      "title": "Bulimia and parotid swelling: A review and case report",
      "abstract": "Bulimia, or “ox hunger,” is characterized by episodes of binge eating, during which there is a large intake of food over a short time span, followed by induced vomiting and occasionally periods of fasting. Classically, the problem starts in a teenage female who perceives herself as being too fat. As a result, the person develops feelings of guilt and low self-esteem.‘,’ An attempt at dieting leads to some weight loss and simultaneous hunger. In the susceptible individual, this hunger results in an eating binge. To counter the effect of the weight gain from the eating binge, self-induced vomiting is initiated. Once the individual realizes that the weight gain caused by the binge can be nullified by vomiting, less restraint is exerted on the binges. A natural progression is for the person to resort to binges not only when hungry, but also when tense or anxious.3 Vomiting is usually carried out in secret, and often with the aid of the emetic ipecac. Laxatives and diuretics frequently become adjunctive agents. Although bulimics may binge and vomit as little as twice a week, the frequency varies and it can become as high as 140 episodes each week.3-6 The average intake of food is 3,400 calories in a 1.2-hour period, with some patients ingesting as much as 50,000 calories in a 24hour period.5 Casper3 characterized the three major manifestations of bulimia nervosa as recurrent episodes of binge eating with an awareness on the patient’s part that the pattern is abnormal, the presence of depressed moods, and the absence of any known physical disorder. In addition, at least three of the following are present: high-calorie intake during the binge, inconspicuous eating during the binge, self-induced vomiting at the end of the binge, repeated attempts to lose weight through dieting and",

      "title": "Eating habits and appetite control: a psychobiological perspective",
      "abstract": "An individual's eating behaviour is shaped by factors ranging from economic conditions and cultural practices to biological influences. The physiological system controlling appetite appears to be adapted to solving the problem of an unevenness of food supply across time, and is fairly permissive in its response to undereating and overeating. Consequently, when food is abundant, the diet is energy dense and energy expenditure is low, there is a strong tendency to become obese (i.e. obesity is better viewed as due to a ‘toxic’ environment than to faulty physiological control of appetite). Under such conditions the most common method of avoiding obesity is through the cognitive control of eating. However, dietary restraint and dieting are demanding tasks, and are associated with psychological costs, including significant impairment of cognitive performance. Restraint is also prone to disinhibition, with the result that it can sometimes undermine eating control, even leading to the development of highly disordered eating patterns. In part, these difficulties are due to the self-perpetuating nature of dietary habits: for example, hunger tends to be diminished during strict unbroken dieting, but increased in individuals having a highly variable eating pattern (such as occurs when eating is frequently disinhibited). These features of appetite control provide both barriers and opportunities for changing behaviour. Accordingly, there is a need for future research to focus on the psycho-social factors and the dieting practices predicting successful eating and weight control, with the objective of identifying the actual cognitive and behavioural strategies used by the many dieters and restrained eaters who are able to achieve weight loss and maintain long-term weight stability.",

      "title": "Connecting biology with psychology to make sense of appetite control",
      "abstract": "Abstract Eating more than is required to maintain bodyweight is weakly resisted physiologically, as appetite does not closely track body energy balance. What does limit energy intake is the capacity of the gut to accommodate and process what is eaten. As the gut empties, we are ready to eat again. We typically refer to this absence of fullness as ‘hunger’, but in this state, even when it is prolonged ( e.g . by missing one or two meals), our mental and physical performance is not compromised because body energy stores are mobilised to sustain energy supply to our brain and muscles. We illustrate this by discussing research on the effects of missing breakfast. Contrary to conventional wisdom, it appears that missing breakfast leads to a reduction in total daily energy intake and does not impair cognitive function (in adequately nourished individuals). The problem with missing a meal or eating smaller meals, however, is that we miss out on (some of) the pleasure of eating (food reward). In current studies, we are investigating how to offset the reduced reward value of smaller food portions, by, for example, altering flavour intensity, food variety and unit size, in order to maintain overall meal satisfaction and thereby reduce or eliminate subsequent compensatory eating.",

      "title": "The Characteristics, Risks, Effects, and Pathophysiology of Eating Disorders -A Review of Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Over the past few centuries, the importance of fitness has gained prominence. Coupled with this is the idea of thinness or the need to be slender and lean as an ideal body type. Thinness and fitness are not the same but are conflated in most messages about being fit. Many individuals, especially adolescents, have been influenced by the ongoing diet culture and social media. They have an ideal body or physique and are increasingly concerned about their weight, shape, size, and body image. As an attempt to lose weight and reach their goals, individuals go to extremes and try to starve themselves and/or excessively exercise, self-induce vomiting, or misuse products like laxatives, diuretics and enemas. Starvation or other psychological discomforts can cause one to binge-eat then purge and feel satisfied for a short period of time, but it eventually leads to selfloathing. This can severely affect the individual both physically and psychologically. As this cycle continues, an eating disorder is developed. Anorexia nervosa and Bulimia nervosa are the most widely recognized, and common eating disorders. Although there is little known about the pathophysiology of eating disorders, the evidence of eating disorders in the context of fitness and thinness, the potential genetic heritability, and developmentally specific age-of-onset shed some light on the aetiology of eating disorders. Research on various reactions of a brain neuropeptide called ⍺-melanocyte-stimulating-hormone (⍺-MSH), the gut microbiota and brain axis and, the monoamines- dopamine and serotonin aid in the understanding of the pathomechanisms behind eating disorders. This review aims to discuss the characteristics, risk factors, effects and the other features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. It also elaborates on the pathophysiology of eating disorders",

Hunger is a physiological or emotional state in which an individual hungers for something, sometimes food, but very often something having no direct relation to nutrition, for example, hunger for a steak or a popsickle by a person in a perfectly normal nutritional state. Hunger is a common complaint or symptom of persons who are overweight or obese and whose intake of food is adequate and more than adequate in all respects. Actually, starvation (undernutrition) is most often accompanied by a lack of hunger. In my experience hunger as a presenting complaint by undernourished or malnourished patients has been infrequent but hunger is a common complaint of obese patients.

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGY OF DIETING",
      "abstract": "Dieting is not an easy task especially for people who love to eat and try out different types of meal everyday. It is very general human behavior that we don't like the idea of restrictions. Now even if maintaining a healthy diet is not particularly liked by everyone. For some people it is something they must adopt in their daily life. Psychology plays a vital role in making it beneficial and easier. If a person thinks that restraining from eating a whole lot of meals everyday and being super conscious and aware of what is going in our stomach is a very different task. It will be no surprise that he or she will find it difficult to achieve a healthy diet. Similarly, if you are extra sensitive and over conscious about your diet it means you are panicking about your weight gain as a result you might end up eating more than usual. Many people have a habit of stress eating. Other times people stop eating at all because their weight psychologically disturbs them to a great extent. Since psychology is so important in weight change journey it should be observed that a person is psychologically focused and attentive while eating their meals. Munching on random snacks while watching a movie or whole talking to someone is a big no. A balance between over conscious and not being conscious at all should be maintained. In a nutshell, psychologically strong people or the people who don't worry a lot about weight changes tend to lose or gain more weight depending on their desires.",

      "title": "Nutrition. You can break the diarrhoea circle.",
      "abstract": "During a diarrheal episode, the body cannot absorb nutrients as well as it can when it is healthy. Nutrient intake may fall as much as 33% during the first days of a diarrheal episode. Loss of appetite or vomiting often occurs, or mothers may follow traditional beliefs or incorrect recommendations and feed the child less. This contributes to malnutrition, which, in turn, facilitates infections (e.g., diarrhea) because the body does not have the nutrients to fight infections. In fact, malnourished children usually have longer and more severe episodes of acute diarrhea (14 days) than well-nourished children. Good nutrition before, during, and after diarrhea can break the cycle of malnutrition and diarrhea. If a child develops dehydration, oral rehydration therapy (ORT) should be administered and feeding (other than breast feeding) should be suspended for a few hours. ORT may include home fluids (e.g., soup). Caretakers should resume feeding within 4-6 hours after ORT begins. The children should receive at least 6 small meals a day during and after diarrhea. Severely malnourished children should continue to receive food, especially potassium-rich foods (e.g., bananas and coconut water) during ORT. Rehydration should last longer (12-24 hours) in severely malnourished children. Growth slows down during diarrhea regardless of food intake. During the recovery period, the very hungry children may consume as much as 2 times the amount normally eaten. Caretakers should provide an extra meal for a recovering child for 2 weeks. Breast feeding should continue at least at the same level during diarrhea. Non-breast-fed infants should continue to receive undiluted animal milk or formula during acute diarrhea. Older infants (=or 4 months) who are already receiving soft or solid foods should continue to receive them during diarrhea. Adding 1-2 teaspoonfuls of vegetable oil (e.g., red palm oil) to staple foods increases the energy content.",

We cannot assume that the patient who doesn't eat simply has no appetite or doesn't like the food. We need to recognize that patients respond to food in light of their own values and cultural patterns. In most hospitals, we could make: better use of social science concepts to understand the significance of eating behaviors.1 For example, the average American pattern of eating is a rather light to medium breakfast on arising, a coffee break at midmorning, a light lunch perhaps, a coffee break, a heavy dinner, and a bedtime snack of anything from popcorn to pizza. Contrast this with the pattern of a Frenchman, who is accustomed to cocoa and perhaps a sweet roll when he arises, followed at 10:00 A.M. by the equivalent of a fair-sized lunch or later by a heavy lunch. On the other hand, a person of Slavic origin may be used to two big meals a day. In the average hospital, however, the custom is to serve a regular breakfast from one to three hours after patients are awakened, a rather heavy meal at noon, and a light supper. Patients may get crackers or cookies and milk at bedtime. This distribution of hospital meals is created principally by staffing patterns. Because of limited budgets, in some hospitals, all food is served within an eight-hour span. Breakfast",

Thus, during the day variations in body weight amounting to several pounds, directly attributable to the ingestion of food and drink and the passage of feces and urine, may not be noted because it is not the custom to record the body weight frequently throughout the day and often the appliance on which the body is weighed is not accurate enough to show changes in weight of less than 1 pound or 0.5 Kg. Such alterations in body weight are easily understood, however,",

      "title": "Resisting the Pathologizing of Autistic Eating",
      "abstract": "Autistic people live in a world that pathologizes their every action, not the least of which are their limited diet preferences and selectivity for certain types of food. The result is the assumption that many, or even most, autistics have an eating disorder or a feeding disorder. I examine this assumption by looking at the literature that describes autistics’ mealtime rituals and preferences for familiar foods. These rituals are often the result of, and a means to reduce, the sensory overloads that mealtimes represent, an overwhelming confusion of tastes, smells, textures, and sounds. Rituals, same foods, and moving around can help autistics cope. These preferences can be as simple as a preferred seat at the table, specific cutlery, foods not touching or on separate plates, or presenting a hot dog in a bun despite the child never eating the bun. Food neophobia, a refusal to try new foods, is also a well-known autistic trait, and often a source of contention between autistics and allistics (non-autistics). I contend that while these behaviours are often understood as rebellion, stubbornness, picky eating, or other forms of misbehaviour, they are not eating disorders. Autistics ought to be allowed to choose how, when, and what they eat. Treatments to alter autistic eating attempt to re-order the autistic in accordance with dominant eating orders. Such corrective and coercive measures are justified by the argument that if allowed to eat as they wish, autistics will be harmed, such as by missing out on the pleasures of social sharing or disrupting the serenity of the family. I argue that autistic eating preferences should not be pathologized, and I call for a radical autistic scholarship, done by autistics, that starts from the perspective that we do not have a disorder.",

The increase in the prevalence of obese and overweight individuals has happened too rapidly for it to be due to an alteration in the genome. The gastrointestinal, sensory (taste and olfaction), and brain feeding mechanisms that developed during the past 2 million years were highly adaptive for ancestral hunter-gatherers living in an environment with limited high-density foods and periods of food deprivation. Today, however, humans in industrialized countries live in what has been called an \"obesogenic environment.\" The nonhomeostatic brain reward circuitry that was acquired during evolution to seek out and eat as many nutritionally high-dense foods as possible is able to overrule the physiological inhibitory mechanisms that were designed to limit meal size and weight gain.",

Pola makan sehat adalah faktor kunci untuk meraih performa terbaik dalam olahraga. Jika nutrisi tidak tersedia dengan baik karena pola makan yang menyimpang maka pertaruhannya adalah performa bahkan kesehatan secara keseluruhan. Bagi atlet, pandangan tentang citra tubuh yang ideal merupakan mitos, dimana setiap orang ukurannya berbeda-beda. Sedangkan bagi pelatih, mengatur pola makan atlet adalah keharusan karena berbanding lurus dengan performa atlet. Penyimpangan pola makan ada dua, yaitu (1) disordered eating ; meliputi pola nutrisi yang buruk, ketidakseimbangan antara jenis-jenis makanan yang dikonsumsi, kekuarangan asupan makan dan menghindari makan. (2) eating disorders ; perubahan perilaku dengan tujuan mengatur pola makan sehingga berat badan berkurang dengan pencitraan diri yang keliru tentang berat badan yang ideal. Bentuk-bentuk penyimpangan pola makan adalah (1) Anorexia Nervosa, yaitu upaya sengaja membuat diri sendiri lapar dan menurunkan berat badan secara drastis, (2) Bulimia Nervosa yaitu pola makan dengan porsi banyak dalam sekali makan kemudian diikuti dengan tidak makan sama sekali sebagai akibat kesadaran untuk tidak mau kegemukan, (3) Binge-Eating Disorder yaitu ditandai dengan bingeing yaitu nafsu makan banyak dalam sekali duduk tetapi diikuti dengan purging yaitu menghindari makan dengan memakai laxative, muntah dan kegiatan yang berlebihan.",

      "abstract": "Illness characterized by severe distress and concern about body weight or shape describe eating disorder. It means inadequate or excessive food intake, which can ultimately damage a well being of the individual. Binge Eating Disorder is the name of an eating disorder, in which a person is unable to prevent himself or herself from eating large amounts of food, often in a mindless state and in a short space of time; and the eating feels out of control. Compulsive eating describes the eating pattern of individuals, who feel that their eating is out of control and they are addicted to food leading to weight gain. People, who describe themselves as compulsive eaters feel that they cannot control their eating, and thus they end up eating more than they need. As a result, compulsive overeaters usually struggle to control their weight. Compulsive overeaters have cravings that they cannot master, and may over eat small or large amounts of food, or just pick and nibble some of the time. The objective of present research is, to study the profile of binge eating disorder people to understand their life style. The sample consisted of 55 eating disorder population in Hyderabad. The data abouttheir demographic profile, life style and eating habits was collected through questionnaire developed by the investigator.",

      "title": "It must be my metabolism: Metabolic control of mind",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event It must be my metabolism: Metabolic control of mind Dana M. Small1* 1 The J.B. Pierce Laboratory/Yale, United States For millennia it was advantageous to overeat whenever food was available in order to create reserves of energy for likely future episodes of famine. Neural circuits thus evolved to promote eating in the absence of hunger when cues signaling food availability were encountered. In today’s food environment, this once adaptive behavior may fuel the obesity epidemic. An oft-used index of one’s propensity to eat in the absence of hunger is “food cue reactivity”. How “reactive” one is to a food cue can be assessed in a variety of ways. Food intake can be measured subsequent to initial exposures to the sight, taste or smell of a palatable food. Not surprisingly, overweight and obese individuals are more likely to eat or to eat more than their lean counterparts when presented with food cues (1). Measuring brain response to food cues can also assess food cue reactivity. Heightened responses in dopamine source and target regions are associated with increased food consumption (2-5), weight gain (6-9), and poor outcomes in weight loss programs (10). Paralleling the behavioral data, overweight and obese individuals also show heightened responses to food cues, as do individuals at risk for overeating (11-14). Despite the reliable relationship between brain response to food cues and obesity the mechanism by which food cues drive brain response is unknown. To identify factors that regulate food cue reactivity in humans we have employed a flavor nutrient conditioning protocol in which associations are formed between a novel flavor and calorie content. In the rodent model, it is well established that pairing a novel flavor with intra-gastric infusion of glucose conditions a strong preference for that flavor when later consumed in the absence of calories (15). This implies that a peripheral signal generated by the glucose infusion is critical for flavor preference formation. Recent work also performed in the rodent model demonstrates that there is a close relationship between the reinforcing potency of sugared solutions and the metabolic effects that follow their consumption (16, also see the abstract of I. de Araujo). We therefore hypothesized that metabolic response provides the critical signal necessary to condition preference. To test this prediction in humans we designed a flavor nutrient conditioning study in which participants first rated their liking for novel flavored beverages and then, over a three week-long conditioning protocol, alternately ingested one of the flavored beverages with 112.5 kcal from maltodextrin, a tasteless and odorless polysaccharide that breaks down into glucose, and another flavored beverage with no calories added. Plasma glucose was measured before and after each of the drinks’ consumption as a proxy measure of metabolic response, assuming that glucose oxidation depends upon the level of circulating glucose. For each participant flavor-calorie pairings were held constant but the identity of the conditioned flavors were counterbalanced across participants. Following the exposure phase, participants’ liking of, and brain responses to, non-caloric versions of the flavors were assessed. We predicted that change in plasma glucose produced by beverage consumption during the exposure sessions would be associated with neural responses in dopamine source and target regions to the calorie predictive flavor. As predicted, response in the ventral striatum and hypothalamus to the calorie-predictive flavor (CS+) vs. non the noncaloric-predictive flavor (CS-) was strongly associated with the changes in plasma glucose levels produced by ingestion of these same beverages when consumed previously either with (CS+) or without (CS-) calories (17). Specifically, the greater the increase in circulating glucose occurring post ingestion of the beverage containing 112.5 kcal from maltodextrin versus the noncaloric drink, the stronger was the brain response to the CS+ compared to the CS- flavor. Importantly, because each participant ingested the same caloric dose during conditioning, changes in plasma glucose depended upon individual differences in glucose absorption/metabolism. Therefore, these findings provide indirect, and yet convincing, support for our hypothesis that glucose metabolism regulates response to calorie-predictive flavors in brain reward circuits. We can therefore conclude that, at least for carbohydrates, responses to calorie predictive food cues reflect the learned association between the cue and its ability to result in a change in blood glucose. This finding has important implications for understanding how the modern food environment promotes weight gain. Carbohydrates now come in forms and doses not experienced during our evolutionary past. Not only are calories increased, but the way in which they are metabolized differs. For example, calories ingested in liquid form are trafficked through the gut faster than solids (e.g. 18). Might this influence metabolic regulation of reward circuits? Certainly it stands to reason that larger loads delivered more quickly to the circulation might increase the metabolic impact and hence more efficiently engage reward circuits to enhance food cue reactivity and promote eating in the absence of hunger. In summary, our result indicates that, as in the rodent model, metabolic response drives the reinforcement potency of carbohydrates and regulates food cue reactivity. We conclude that not only are modern foods more caloric, but in addition their increased metabolic impact drives reward circuits and may therefore promote intake by enhancing food cue reactivity. Our finding further suggests that metabolic regulation of reward circuits may differ in individuals with altered glucose metabolism, such as type II diabetes, offering a potential mechanism by which they become susceptible to weight gain.

Mechanisms include food toxicity, pharmacological reactions, metabolic reactions, dysmotility, dysbiosis, physical effects and non‐specific dietary sensitivity. Food intolerance reactions are variable, typically dose‐dependent, and can occur at any age. Signs may arise at any time, sometimes several hours or days after consumption of the offending food item, and can last for hours or days. Dietary indiscretion and non‐immunological food intolerance are probably more common in dogs than true dietary hypersensitivity. Hopefully, with a greater knowledge of the different pathophysiological mechanisms involved, we will become better at recognising, preventing and managing adverse food reactions.",

Computers, TVs, video games, smartphones, or other screens just before bed can interfere with your sleep cycle. (4) Eating too much late in the evening – Having a light snack before bedtime is OK, but eating too much may cause you to feel physically uncomfortable while lying down. Many people also experience heartburn, a backflow of acid, and food from the stomach into the esophagus after eating, which may keep you awake. (5) Mental health disorders – Anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, may disrupt your sleep. Awakening too early can be a sign of depression. (6) Medications – Many prescription drugs can interfere with sleep, such as certain antidepressants and medications for asthma or blood pressure. Many over-the-counter medications – such as some pain medications, allergy, and cold medications, and weight loss products – contain caffeine and other stimulants that can disrupt sleep. (7) Medical conditions – Examples of conditions linked with insomnia include chronic pain, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), overactive thyroid, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. (8) Sleep-related disorders – Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing periodically throughout the night, interrupting your sleep. Restless legs syndrome causes unpleasant sensations in your legs and an almost irresistible desire to move them, which may prevent you from falling asleep. (9) Caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol – Coffee, tea, cola, and other caffeinated drinks are stimulants. Drinking them in the late afternoon or evening can keep you from falling asleep at night. Nicotine in tobacco products is another stimulant that can interfere with sleep. Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often causes awakening in the middle of the night. Complications of Insomnia May Include: (1) Lower performance on the job or at school. (2) Slowed reaction time while driving and a higher risk of accidents. (3) Mental health disorders, such as depression, an anxiety disorder, or substance abuse. (4) Increased risk and severity of long-term diseases or conditions, such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Prevention: Good sleep habits can help prevent insomnia and promote sound sleep: (1) Keep your bedtime and wake time consistent from day to day, including weekends. (2) Stay active – regular activity helps promote a good night’s sleep. (3) Check your medications to see if they may contribute to insomnia. (4) Avoid or limit naps. (5) Avoid or limit caffeine and alcohol, and do not use nicotine. (6) Avoid large meals and beverages before bedtime. (7) Make your bedroom comfortable for sleep and only use it for sex or sleep. (8) Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading, or listening to soft music. Conclusion: Sleep deprivation is helping no one except the market. Brands are capitalizing on our lack of sleep, on our habits. Who are we giving excuses to, our web series can be paused, late night conversation can",

      "abstract": "Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder that, like anorexia nervosa, is of psychological origin and can have horrible physical consequences. While anorexics simply starve themselves, bulimics “cleanse” themselves of vomiting they have caused themselves or other forms of dealing with extra calories. Bulimics also often use weight loss pills, laxatives and diuretics to lose weight, but also use extensive exercise or fasting. Unlike anorexic people, they are usually of normal build, sometimes even bigger, while in combination with anorexia they are extremely thin. Cleansing can have two purposes: preventing weight gain, and temporarily relieving depression and other negative feelings.",

      "title": "Determinants of Food Choice: Relationships with Obesity and Weight Control",
      "abstract": "Abstract The decision to eat, and to eat particular foods, varies for different individuals and situations. Individual differences in food likes and desires develop throughout life because of differing food experiences and attitudes. There are many internal and external cues, not just stimulation from foods or hunger, which can trigger the immediate desire to eat or orient eating toward certain foods. Food desires and intake are an outcome of interactions between these cues and more stable individual physiological and psychological characteristics. Overweight and obese individuals show a tendency toward greater liking and selection of energy‐dense foods, which may contribute to development and maintenance of these conditions. However, although liking (pleasure from eating) is an important part of food choice, it may make only a modest contribution to overall variation in food choice and eating behaviors. Indeed, difficulties of weight control may reflect problems with cues and motivations to eat, rather than with heightened pleasure derived from eating. Paradoxically, individuals highly concerned with food intake and weight control may be particularly susceptible to thoughts, emotions, and situational cues that can prompt overeating and undermine their attempts to restrain eating. Repeat dieting, high day‐to‐day fluctuations in intakes, and attempts to enforce highly rigid control over eating all seem to be counterproductive to weight control efforts and may disrupt more appropriate food choice behaviors. Longer‐term weight maintenance solutions and programs that offer a degree of structuring of the personal food environment, while retaining flexibility in choices, therefore, may be particularly beneficial in weight management.",

      "abstract": "Orthorexia nervosa is characterized by an obsession with avoiding foods perceived to be unhealthy. It seems to be more common in men than in women and in those with a lower level of education. It may be a food-centered manifestation of obsessive compulsive disorder. Orthorexia is an emotionally disturbed, self-punishing relationship with food that involves a progressively shrinking universe of foods deemed acceptable. The more restrictive the diet, the more likely it is to set off the psychological factors that lead to an eating disorder. Raw foods veganism is on the other extreme, and has a fairly high orthorexic potential. Orthorexia sufferers often display signs and symptoms of anxiety disorders that frequently co-occur with anorexia nervosa or other eating disorders. An orthorexic may avoid numerous foods, including those made with artificial colors, pesticides, fat, sugar, salt, animal or dairy products. A woman with orthorexia may find that her food obsessions begin to hinder everyday activities. Orthroxia can put a strain on relationships with family and friends, as relationships become less important than holding to dietary patterns. Maintaining an obsession with health food may cause a restriction of calories merely because available food isn't considered to be good enough. Orthorexia is a discrete diagnosis like anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Obsession with weight is one of the primary signs of anorexia, bulimia, and other eating disorders, but is not a symptom of orthorexia. orthorexia is a medical disease that can result in irreversible health complications, including death.",

We demonstrated that habituation to a food item can occur even when its consumption is merely imagined. Five experiments showed that people who repeatedly imagined eating a food (such as cheese) many times subsequently consumed less of the imagined food than did people who repeatedly imagined eating that food fewer times, imagined eating a different food (such as candy), or did not imagine eating a food. They did so because they desired to eat it less, not because they considered it less palatable. These results suggest that mental representation alone can engender habituation to a stimulus.",

There are 2 types of Anorexia Nervosa, Restrictive Anorexia Nervosa, people with this type of anorexia greatly limit the amount of food they consume, in fact they often do not eat at all until their bodies become very thin. Anorexia Nervosa Binge-purge, this type of anorexia is almost the same as bulimia. People who suffer from this disorder will eat in large quantities.

      "abstract": "Peoples' attempts to lose weight by low calorie diets often result in weight gain because of over-compensatory overeating during lapses. Animals usually respond to a change in food availability by adjusting their foraging effort and altering how much energy reserves they store. But in many situations the long-term availability of food is uncertain, so animals may attempt to estimate it to decide the appropriate level of fat storage.We report the results of a conceptual model of feeding in which the animal knows whether food is currently abundant or limited, but does not know the proportion of time, there will be an abundance in the long-term and has to learn it.If the food supply is limited much of the time, such as during cycles of dieting attempts, the optimal response is to gain a lot of weight when food is abundant.This implies that recurring attempts to diet, by signalling to the body that the food supply is often insufficient, will lead to a greater fat storage than if food was always abundant. Our results shed light on the widespread phenomenon of weight gain during weight cycling and indicate possible interventions that may reduce the incidence of obesity.",

      "abstract": "Eating Disorders are a heterogeneous group of complex psychiatric disorders that affect physical and psychological functioning, thus compromising life itself.They are often characterized by extreme preoccupation with food, caloric intake and expenditure as well as bodily weight and shape.Additionally, individuals present several forms of recurrent compulsive behavior, such as frequent weighting, body checking, and eating rituals.In many cases food consumption is considered a\" failure\" and its presence in the body \"harmful and even \"toxic\" leading the individual to adopt a wide variety of purging behaviors in order to achieve a state of mental and physical \"cleanliness\" Two cases of compulsive bowel emptying, one suffering from Anorexia Nervosa and one suffering from Bulimia Nervosa, are presented.The compulsive bowel emptying behavior compromised of repeated and/or prolonged voluntary tension of the abdominal and pelvic muscles as well as insertion of the figure in the rectum to \"check\" if the bowel has been completely empty of its content.The purpose of this behavior was to alleviate intense anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts that the individual would get \"fat\" and/or \"dirty/intoxicated\" if the bowel was not completely vacated of the stools.In both cases the compulsive behavior facilitated the manifestation of rectum prolapse that reinforced the vicious circle of the obsessive-compulsive symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of a food typically leads to a decrease in its subsequent intake through habituation--a decrease in one's responsiveness to the food and motivation to obtain it. We demonstrated that habituation to a food item can occur even when its consumption is merely imagined. Five experiments showed that people who repeatedly imagined eating a food (such as cheese) many times subsequently consumed less of the imagined food than did people who repeatedly imagined eating that food fewer times, imagined eating a different food (such as candy), or did not imagine eating a food. They did so because they desired to eat it less, not because they considered it less palatable. These results suggest that mental representation alone can engender habituation to a stimulus.

Simultaneously, we can observe an increase in the availability of dietary services, reduction diets or various types of low-calorie food. What are the reasons for that? So far obesity and its consequences have been described in terms of somatic diseases. However, the psychological issue was ignored. Currently, we can observe a significant increase in the researcher’s interest in the psychological sphere of obese people. Excessive weight cannot be seen only as a consequence of the increased calorie intake. It is also the result of trained mechanisms of coping with stress, anxiety disorders, or as a result of low self-esteem and effectiveness. Probably people function in such a way because the word has changed its function. It does not just provide food and energy. It has become a way of expressing feelings, spending time and coping with emotions. Eating meals fits in many aspects of human functioning, including a family aspect, a business aspect or a social one. High availability of food and the omnipresence of restaurants contribute to the fact that people easier grab meals, regardless of whether they need them or not. In some cases food is a way to get rid of boredom or the way of spending time. Certain features of temperament and personality are characteristic for obese people. In addition, recently more and more psychiatric disorders associated with obesity have been distinguished. Available diagnostic methods and knowledge on the mechanisms of these anomalies allow to their differentiation. We can distinguish the following disorders: binge eating disorder, night eating syndrome, stress eating, sleep eating disorders and others.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Anti‐dieting sentiment has grown in recent years. Critics of restrained eating suggest that it evokes counter‐regulatory responses that render it ineffective or even iatrogenic. However, restrained eaters are not in negative energy balance and overweight individuals show reduced eating problems when losing weight by dieting. A distinction is often drawn between physiological and psychological hunger, and neuroscience research has shown that there is a neurophysiological reality underlying this distinction. The brain has a homeostatic system (activated by energy deficits) and a hedonic system (activated by the presence of palatable food). The omnipresence of highly palatable food in the environment may chronically activate the hedonic appetite system, producing a need to actively restrain eating not just to lose weight but to avoid gaining it. Just as restricting energy intake below homeostatic needs produces physiological deprivation, restricting intake of palatable foods may produce “perceived deprivation” despite a state of energy balance. In summary, the motivation to eat more than one needs appears to be every bit as real, and perhaps every bit as powerful, as the motivation to eat when energy deprived.",

It considers four predictions stemming from the hypothesis that hunger is a response to food shortage: people eating non-food substances have little other food to eat; people would feel less hungry after eating pica substances; pica substances would not be desired when “typical” food was available; and almost any non-food item would be eaten by the consumer. It concludes that there is little to substantiate this hypothesis. Although consumers may feel more full after engaging in pica (consistent with the second prediction), they frequently have other food to eat (contradictory to the first prediction); pica cravings occur when typical food is available (contradictory to the third prediction); and pica substances are extremely carefully selected (contradictory to the last prediction). While hunger has motivated a small fraction of non-food consumption around the world, it is safe to say that it does not explain the bulk of pica.",

Will he experience psychological changes in self-image, which afford him the opportunity to work through his feelings, and thereby support the weight-reduction program? Is successful coping with weight loss similar to the coping with other losses, such as loss of a leg? Silverstone categorizes obese persons into three psychological groups: maturity onset obesity, reactive obesity, and early onset neurotic obesity (). Silverstone defines maturity onset as obesity that begins in adult years -about age 30-from decreasing, activity associated with aging without a compensatory decrease in caloric intake. Silverstone estimates that two thirds of the obese are in this category and two thirds of his study sample of 187 obese people apparently belonged in this group.

      "abstract": "Picky eaters are people who avoid many new and familiar foods because they dislike the taste, smell, texture, or appearance of many foods. When it is severe, picky eating can lead to weight loss or difficulty maintaining a healthy weight, nutritional deficiencies, dependence on supplements to get adequate nutrition or calories, or shame, anxiety, or difficulty engaging in daily life. When severe picky eating leads to these consequences, it can be diagnosed as Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). People who restrict the amount of food they consume (or engage in exercise, purging, or fasting behaviors to get rid of calories after eating) because they are afraid of gaining weight or being fat are diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia when their eating leads to weight loss, nutritional problems, or interferes with life. ARFID is a new diagnosis, and in this paper, we show that 1) adults with ARFID symptoms are just as distressed, and just as likely to have symptoms of depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder, as those with anorexia or bulimia, but that 2) adults with ARFID show very different types of eating behavior from adults with symptoms of anorexia or bulimia.",

      "title": "Sickness absence as an alcohol‐related problem",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use is related to sickness absence in two somewhat different ways. First, chronic heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of a large number of somatic or psychiatric illnesses, and through these illnesses continued heavy drinking may lead to sickness absence. Secondly, episodic heavy drinking and intoxication may lead to accidents, or to plain hangover, or to continuing drinking bouts which may be the grounds for sickness absence [1]. Alcoholic beverages can be used in many different ways. They can, for instance, be used as intoxicants, as beverages with meals, as thirst quenchers, as a means to celebrate several kinds of festive occasions or as a social lubricant in different situations. Different alcoholic beverages suit these different uses. Depending on the most important functions accorded to alcohol, drinking habits will vary across cultures. All alcoholic drinks, and especially wine, are used in many countries as a beverage with meals. When wine is used commonly with meals, per capita alcohol consumption is quite high. However, drinking with meals means that alcohol use is spread over many or all days of the week and the amount of alcohol consumed at one sitting usually stays reasonably low. Therefore, in wine-preferring countries such as those in the Mediterranean region, alcohol-related sickness absence should reflect mainly chronic heavy drinking. All alcoholic beverages can also be used purposively as intoxicants. In this case alcohol consumption is usually taking place in leisure time, weekends and evenings. In countries where these beverages have been used mainly as intoxicants, as in the Nordic countries, per capita alcohol consumption has traditionally been quite low. In those countries alcohol-related sickness absences are based mainly on episodic heavy drinking. During recent decades total alcohol consumption has been on the increase in the Nordic countries. In Iceland, Norway and Sweden, alcohol consumption is still lower than in the Mediterranean countries, but in Denmark and Finland total alcohol consumption (unrecorded alcohol included) is, at the moment, on the same level as in France, and higher than in Italy. This convergent trend in consumption levels is also the result of the decrease in wine consumption in the Mediterranean countries. Around the Mediterranean wine is still today used mainly as a beverage with meals, but the decrease in wine consumption has meant that other uses of alcohol have gained in relative importance, and especially among young drinkers who have begun to use alcohol to become drunk. In the Mediterranean countries a decrease in wine consumption has usually meant that wine has been substituted with water as a beverage with meals. Many people living in the Mediterranean area feel that this kind of development is a substitution of one beverage (alcohol) by another drink with meals (not including alcohol). In statistics this shows as a decrease in per capita alcohol consumption. In the Nordic countries water is also increasing its share as a beverage with meals. This, however, is not reflected in alcohol consumption statistics, as the substitution in this instance is taking place mainly from milk to water. One way to describe major trends in alcohol consumption during the last decades in western Europe could be to say that water has taken over as the traditional drink with meals. Consequently, alcoholic beverages have, during the last decades, lost their role as beverages with meals and become increasingly the beverage consumed during leisure, in many cases leading to intoxication. Consequently, compared to earlier decades alcohol-related sickness absences should nowadays be related more to heavy episodic drinking than to heavy chronic drinking. When some physical or psychiatric illness related to heavy drinking is the cause for sickness absence, in many cases it is possible to link the rates of absenteeism to alcohol consumption. Many alcohol-related somatic or psychiatric illnesses such as alcoholism, alcohol-related intoxication or alcohol-related liver diseases are already, by definition, linked to drinking in the codes of the International Classification of Diseases. When episodic heavy drinking is the cause for sickness absence it is much more difficult to relate the problem to alcohol consumption. In most cases, intoxication or any other cause leading to accident is not mentioned in the medical certificate. Even in cases where it could be mentioned, it is in the interests of the client that the accident is not combined officially with alcohol use because this could lead, for instance, to loss of insurance benefits. Furthermore, hangover or a continuing drinking bout is not a legitimate cause for being absent from work. As Thor Norström [1] has shown in his analysis of the Swedish experience, total alcohol consumption level is associated with sickness absence among men. His conclusion is that sickness absence can be added to the list of harm indicators related to alcohol consumption. Alcohol-related sickness absences and wider aspects of alcohol-related productivity losses, tie alcohol consumption regularly to economic efficiency. It may, however, be somewhat difficult to measure and document the real extent of alcohol-related sickness absenteeism in anysociety, especially as alcohol-related sickness absences are nowadays related increasingly to episodic heavy drinking rather than to prolonged heavy drinking.",

Although a large majority of individuals do have their bowels open from between three times daily to every third day, there are, amongst these, many who are dissatisfied with their lot. What is more, many perfectly ‘normal’ people have their bowels open less frequently than every third day. As it is, nearly all of us experience daily, though subtle, fluctuations of varying degrees in our bowel habit. None of us produce an identical stool two days in a row! There is also a marked difference between men and women: on average, men have their bowels open more often, produce softer faeces, and much more gas than do women, even when eating a similar diet. A large majority of (heterosexual) couples will have made this observation already!",

      "abstract": "In the United States the preferred method of obtaining dietary intake data is the 24-hour dietary recall, yet the measure of most interest is usual or long-term average daily intake, which is impossible to measure. Thus, usual dietary intake is assessed with considerable measurement error. Also, diet represents numerous foods, nutrients and other components, each of which have distinctive attributes. Sometimes, it is useful to examine intake of these components separately, but increasingly nutritionists are interested in exploring them collectively to capture overall dietary patterns. Consumption of these components varies widely: some are consumed daily by almost everyone on every day, while others are episodically consumed so that 24-hour recall data are zero-inflated. In addition, they are often correlated with each other. Finally, it is often preferable to analyze the amount of a dietary component relative to the amount of energy (calories) in a diet because dietary recommendations often vary with energy level. The quest to understand overall dietary patterns of usual intake has to this point reached a standstill. There are no statistical methods or models available to model such complex multivariate data with its measurement error and zero inflation. This paper proposes the first such model, and it proposes the first workable solution to fit such a model. After describing the model, we use survey-weighted MCMC computations to fit the model, with uncertainty estimation coming from balanced repeated replication.",

La relación entre las emociones y la conducta alimentaria es bidireccional y es dependiente del contexto, de la variabilidad de la emoción en cuanto a su valencia, excitación e intensidad, así como de la variabilidad fisiológica del sujeto. Dentro del contexto de la obesidad, se ha descrito el concepto del \"comedor emocional\" como aquel individuo que utiliza los alimentos como un mecanismo disfuncional para afrontar sus emociones negativas (ira, apatía, frustraciones, entre otras). Estas emociones negativas estarían más presentes en situaciones de alto estrés percibido, lo que conllevaría al aumento de la ingesta de alimentos llamados \"reconfortantes\", como lo son aquellos altos en azúcares y grasas. La presencia del comer emocional sería más prevalente en mujeres que en hombres; en personas obesas que en aquellas con estado nutricional normal y en contextos de restricción alimentaria. Las últimas investigaciones señalan que la forma en cómo regulamos nuestras emociones permitirían controlar la cantidad o calidad de los alimentos que se ingieren, siendo una estrategia efectiva para el control alimentario.",

      "title": "The Diet Dynamics in Holy Month of Ramadan",
      "abstract": "Ramadan, one of Islam's five pillars, is a period of frugality from dawn to sunset that lasts a lunar month (29-30 days). In Ramadan, millions of Muslims deepened their relationship with God by fasting, praying and spiritual devotion. Fasting every day before dawn and after sunset, families break their fast together shortly before sunset. Not only is this sacred practice deeply religious, it also provides health benefits that researchers are studying to see how the rhythms of fasting affect our wellbeing. Therefore, it is very helpful in understanding the routine of fasting and nourishment during Ramadan. Fasting during the whole day means going without food and water for long hours. If sufficient nutrition is not maintained throughout this time, it might result in weakness, dehydration, and a decline in energy levels. The body’s normal functioning is greatly affected due to absence of frequent meals. Hence it is essential for individuals to have nutritious foods during non-fasting hours. Many people overeat at iftar and intake high fat and sugar rich foods which causes weight gain and fatigue. It is essential to consume well-balanced diet at Suhoor that will maintain energy levels throughout the day. Mostly, it is advised to have foods high in complex carbs, proteins such as whole grains, eggs, rice that will keep one satisfied for longer and retain muscle strength. Dehydration can be prevented by the intake of plenty of fluids and eating fruits with high water content such as watermelon etc. Moreover, A balanced iftar is also recommended to avoid health haphazard. Dates and water have been traditionally used at time of iftar which have both religious and scientific benefits. Individuals should take fiber rich and healthy foods. People should avoid using fried items which will cause digestive discomfort and uneasiness later on. People should maintain proper hydration at night since fasting limits fluid intake during the day. During this Holy month, the biggest challenge encountered by people is their tendency to overeat at iftar. The extended hours of fasting can lead to increase the appetite for oily and sugary foods which causes indigestion and bloating. Mindful diet plan and portion control can help in maintaining general health and avoiding unwanted weight gain. Besides spiritual benefits, fasting in Ramadan also have vast physical benefits. It helps in digestion, detoxification and improves health management. According to different studies, fasting boosts insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility, which lowers the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Ramadan diet dynamics focus on mindful eating, water, and balanced nourishment.",

      "abstract": "A 25 year old woman attends her general practitioner with a six month history of constipation. Despite having increased her daily intake of fibre and water, she is still only passing two stools a week. Her general practitioner excludes red flag features (box) and finds no abnormality on examination, apart from a loaded rectum. He suggests she try using laxatives to increase her stool frequency, but she is reluctant as she has heard they are not very effective and can have adverse effects.\n\n#### Red flag features in chronic constipation12\n\nLaxatives are foods or drugs that, when ingested, act directly on the gut (or gut contents) to increase stool frequency or ease stool passage. They differ from motility agents such as prucalopride, which exert a promotility effect after systemic absorption. Laxatives are used to treat chronic constipation, usually defined as the presence of difficult or infrequent passage of stool, often accompanied by straining or a sensation of incomplete evacuation, with symptoms present for more than three months.\n\nChronic constipation is common in the general population. A recent meta-analysis of population based observational studies reported a pooled prevalence of 14% worldwide, with a significantly higher prevalence in women and people of lower socioeconomic status.3 However, symptoms often fluctuate, and recent community data suggest that persistent symptoms over 10 to 20 years affect only 3% of the population.4 Population based studies also show that constipation affects quality of life, is associated with several comorbidities (including haemorrhoids and anal fissure),5 and may be associated with a modest reduction in survival.6\n\nLaxatives may act by several mechanisms, including bulking the stool volume, softening the stool consistency, increasing the stool volume …",

Initial onset of stress causes a temporary loss of appetite but chronic stress leads to the development of addiction and/or cravings for 'comfort foods' that are calorific values. Chronic stress, uncontrolled or unmonitored food consumption, and obesity are intricately connected, even involving certain neurological adaptations. We propose a system which helps in identifying stress eating compared to normal eating. It allows the users to make a choice between two proposed methods for monitoring food intake: wearable and non-wearable. These methods take the log of food consumed by the user, calculate the calorie counts and notify the user about the eating behavior with an accuracy of 97%.",

It can be medically imposed before blood draws or surgery, or it can be self-imposed in the case of serious dieting, religious fasts, and chaotic work schedules. While assumed that fasting biases brain reward systems towards high-calorie foods, animal studies have only examined calorie levels and not food types. When a food-deprived person finally eats, what macronutrients or general types of foods do they eat first and most? The answer has implications for the precautions that patients, fasters, medical interns, and dieters should take when first serving and eating food after a short period of food deprivation. Objective: How does short-term fasting or food deprivation bias what foods (starches, vegetables, and protein) a person eats and how much they eat of them?",

It is not known whether protein needs are increased in ultraendurance athletes as a result of extended exercise training. Additionally, micronutrient needs may be altered for these athletes while dietary intake is generally over the RDA because of high caloric intake. Prior to competition, ultraendurance athletes should consider glycogen supercompensation and a prerace meal eaten 4 hrs before as a means of improving performance. Carbohydrate feedings during prolonged exercise can significantly affect performance.

DSM-IV-TR에 따르면 물질 의존 성향(substance dependence)이란 임상적으로 심각한 손상이나 고통을 초래하는 비 적응적 형태의 물질 사용을 말한다. 욕구를 채우고자 물질 (혹은 특정행동)을 남용하고, 남용물질의 양이 늘어나는 내 성이 나타나며, 시간이 지날수록 더 많은 양을 요구하게 됨에 따라 남용물질의 양을 줄이려고 해도 제대로 되지 않는다. 과식 및 폭식행동에서도 물질 의존에서 보이는 이러한 통제 상실이나 내성 혹은 금단 증상 등이 관찰되곤 한다. 섭식장 애나 비만 환자들에서 보이는 모든 비정상적 섭식행동이 전 적으로 중독행동과 동일한 것이라고 할 수는 없지만, 상당 수의 환자들에서 조절하기 어려운 폭식 문제나 음식섭취와 관련한 중독적 특징을 쉽게 관찰할 수 있으며, 특히 대식증 (binge eating disorder)이나 폭식을 동반한 비만 환자들에서 쉽게 관찰할 수 있다. 실제로 진단 기준 상으로도 대식증 진단에 해당하는 여성들을 대상으로 DSM-IV-TR의 물질 의존 진단에서 물질(substance)을 폭식(binge eating)으로 대 체한 수정된 진단 기준을 적용 시켜본 연구결과, 전체 참가자 의 92.4%가 중독 진단 기준을 충족시켰다고 보고되었다. 이처럼 음식 및 섭식행동에 중독적 개념을 적용하는 것은 2000년대 이래 활발히 시도되고 있으며, 비정상적 섭식 REVIEW ARTICLE",

      "abstract": "A food with long-term acceptability can be eaten one or more times a day without the consumer becoming \"tired\" of eating it. Few foods are eaten as often as once a day, but those that are can give us some clues about the attributes associated with long-term acceptability. Studies by the armed forces in the late 1950s showed that most foods decreased in liking when repeatedly consumed and that the rate of decline depended on the specific food. Current techniques for measuring the liking of foods (typically using a hedonic category scale) do not necessarily indicate long-term acceptability. Our data on repeated consumption of two versions of tea suggests that taste test measurements can be quite misleading. A relatively newer measurement, sensory-specific satiety, may provide a rapid method for measuring long-term acceptability.",

Dieters reported more obsessive‐compulsive characteristics (both food‐ and non‐food‐related), more indecisiveness, and tended to have a lower desire for control. Under‐weight dieters were more extreme in these traits than over‐weight dieters. Guilt was not related to perceptions of overweight, rather guilt (both food‐ and non‐food) was significantly higher in those who diet more frequently. Perhaps if food cannot be used as an anxiolytic, any anxiety may be reduced by repetitive behaviour or reinterpreted as guilt.",

      "abstract": "Setiap ibu hamil memiliki kebutuhan nutrisi yang berbeda. Kebutuhan setiap nutrisi di masa kehamilan berbeda dengan kebutuhan nutrisi saat sedang tidak hamil. Pada saat awal kehamilan trimester pertama sering terjadi mual dan muntah biasanya pada saat pagi hari. Hal tersebut terjadi karna adanya perubahan hormone pada ibu hamil. Meningkatnya hormone ibu dapat menimbulkan terjadinya sakit kepala, terdapat air liar yang berlebihan, dan dapat menyebabkan payudara membesar dan sangat mudah lelah. Adapun perubahan psikologisnya yaitu merasa kurang sehat dan dapat membenci kehamilannya, selalu mencari tahu da meyakinkan bahwa dirinya sedang hamil. Ibu hamil juga membutuhkan penerimaan kehamilannya oleh keluarga dan tidak stabilnya emosi dan juga membutuhkan dukungan dari pihak keluarga dalam mengambil suatu keputusan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan nutrisi selama kehamilan.Suatu kebudayaan di suatu masyarakat juga memiliki kekuatan yang sangat cukup besar untuk mempengaruhi seseorang dalam memilih makanan atau pangan yang akan dikonsumsi. Banyak sebagian masyarakat yang masih mempercayai budaya/adat memakai alasan kondisi atau umur seseorang untuk melarang makanan-makanan tertentu. Contohnya, permasalahan gizi pada ibu hamil di Indonesia tidak terlepas dari faktor budayanya. Masih banyaknya kepercayaan-kepercayaan dan pantangan terhadap beberapa makanan, misalnya seperti pada ibu hamil, memakan ikan akan menyebabkan air ASI nya menjadi bau amis dan memakan buah seperti nanas, ketimun, pisang yang dapat menurunkan libido wanita.Pentingnya bagi ibu hamil memiliki kemampuan yang lebih dapat mempengaruhi dalam mengambil suatu keputusan atau tindakan untuk mencapai gizi dan nutrisi yang baik untuk kandungannya atau bayinya. Disaat seorang ibu hamil sedang mengalami masa ngidam, perut terasa mual dan tidak mau diisi dengan apapun, saat mengalami kondisi tersebut jika seorang ibu hamil mempunyai pengetahuan yang baik, maka dia akan berupaya sekeras mungkin untuk melakukan sesuatu tindakan untuk memenui kebutuhan gizinya dan bayinya.",

They may not elicit the cephalic phase response because part or all of the gastrointestinal tract is bypassed, nutrients are typically given in liquid form by a continuous infusion over many hours and often overnight while patients sleep. Work conducted in animals, healthy subjects and patients suggests that nutrients delivered as ETF or PN are less effective in relieving appetite sensations than food intake. Distressing appetite sensations may even occur despite the provision by artificial nutrition of sufficient nutrients to meet requirements. The energy provided by ETF and PN is largely additional to oral food intake in humans eating ad libitum, although the extent to which this occurs may decrease with time. There is a need to establish ways (e.g. nutritional, pharmacological, psychological) to suppress appetite sensations and food intake when eating is contraindicated, and to enhance them when weaning from artificial nutrition is desirable.",

Do we need to give it more consideration than our grandmothers and great grandmothers did? May I answer the above questions by telling of a study with a group of nurses on this subject? Much is said and written about the importance of vegetables and fruits in the normal diet. With few exceptions, the statements in regard to quantity are very general. Usually it is: Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits. Consequently some of the questions that come to the serious minded are: What is plenty? Am I above or below the average? How much do I need? That fruits and vegetables are valued for mineral salts, vitamins and their alkalinity, as well as bulk, is not questioned. That there is a vague concept of the amount required is very noticeable. So often, Just a little spinach, or Not any turnips, today is a common statement overheard at many dinner tables. If constipation is a common ailment, can our normal diets counteract this tendency? It was not necessary to give much consideration to this phase of our diet in the past for much coarse food was used. The various refining processes that are utilized nowadays have not only deprived our foods of some of the valuable constituents, but have made it necessary for us to give consideration to the residue or bulk content of our diet as well. Being conscious of the tendency towards deficiency of diets in this respect, a study was made of the normal diets of a group of nurses at the Milwaukee County Hospital. The object was a twofold one: (1) to give the nurses something tangible that might be of value to them; and (2) make it possible for them to help others with whom they come in contact.",

Yet data from family and twin studies suggest that genes may play a slightly smaller role in risk for purging disorder compared to other eating disorders. Instead, biological responses to food intake may explain the unique configuration of purging after consuming normal amounts of food in purging disorder. Compared to those with bulimia, individuals with purging disorder have greater release of hormones that trigger the brain to stop eating. Compared to those with bulimia and those without an eating disorder, individuals with purging disorder release excessive amounts of a hormone that triggers feelings of nausea and stomachache.",

Sabe-se que os distúrbios do comportamento alimentar possuem uma etiologia multifatorial e há evidências de que o ambiente de trabalho pode ser um fator desencadeante de doenças, dependendo das condições que as atividades laborais são executadas. Nesse sentido, observou-se que as circunstâncias na quais o trabalho é realizado pareciam apresentar relação com a prevalência do transtorno da compulsão alimentar, sendo observada uma maior prevalência dessa enfermidade em trabalhadores com estresses psicossociais, obesidade e insatisfação ou disfunção da imagem corporal.

      "title": "Food and drug addictions: Similarities and differences",
      "abstract": "This review examines the merits of 'food addiction' as an explanation of excessive eating (i.e., eating in excess of what is required to maintain a healthy body weight). It describes various apparent similarities in appetites for foods and drugs. For example, conditioned environmental cues can arouse food and drug-seeking behaviour, 'craving' is an experience reported to precede eating and drug taking, 'bingeing' is associated with both eating and drug use, and conditioned and unconditioned tolerance occurs to food and drug ingestion. This is to be expected, as addictive drugs tap into the same processes and systems that evolved to motivate and control adaptive behaviours, including eating. The evidence, however, shows that drugs of abuse have more potent effects than foods, particularly in respect of their neuroadaptive effects that make them 'wanted.' While binge eating has been conceptualised as form of addictive behaviour, it is not a major cause of excessive eating, because binge eating has a far lower prevalence than obesity. Rather, it is proposed that obesity results from recurrent overconsumption of energy dense foods. Such foods are, relatedly, both attractive and (calorie for calorie) weakly satiating. Limiting their availability could partially decrease excessive eating and consequently decrease obesity. Arguably, persuading policy makers that these foods are addictive could support such action. However, blaming excessive eating on food addiction could be counterproductive, because it risks trivialising serious addictions, and because the attribution of excessive eating to food addiction implies an inability to control one's eating. Therefore, attributing everyday excessive eating to food addiction may neither explain nor significantly help reduce this problem.",

However, it is not uncommon in private practice and among the well-to-do. Its occurrence is much more frequent in the artificially fed infant, although it may be encountered occasionally in the breast fed. One member of this class of infants will take its food well, does not vomit and there is no indication of digestive disturbance. The food may be of sufficient caloric value. Another member of this class of cases, will tolerate only a certain amount of food. In feeding these infants, one has to be extremely careful not to overtax this food",

      "title": "Preparation and Evaluation of Herbal Effervescent Granules for Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa often simply called anorexia is an eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted perception of weight. People with anorexia place a high value on controlling their weight and shape, using extreme efforts that tend to significantly interfere with their lives. To prevent weight gain or to continue losing weight, people with anorexia usually severely restrict the amount of food they eat. They may control calorie intake by vomiting after eating or by misusing laxatives, diet aids, diuretics or enemas. They may also try to lose weight by exercising excessively. No matter how much weight is lost, the person continues to fear weight gain. Anorexia isn't really about food. It's an extremely unhealthy and sometimes life-threatening way to try to cope with emotional problems. When you have anorexia, you often equate thinness with self-worth. Anorexia, like other eating disorders, can take over your life and can be very difficult to overcome. But with treatment, you can gain a better sense of who you are, return to healthier eating habits and reverse some of anorexia's serious complications. The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. Bioactive phytochemicals in food supplements are a trending approach to facilitate dieting and to improve patients’ adherence to reducing food and caloric intake. The aim of this systematic review was to assess efficacy and safety of the most commonly used bioactive phytochemicals with appetite/hunger-suppressing and/or satiety/fullness-increasing properties. To be eligible, studies needed to have included at least 10 patients per group aged 18 years or older with no serious health problems except for overweight or obesity. Of those studies, 32 met the inclusion criteria, in which 27 different plants were tested alone or as a combination, regarding their efficacy in suppressing appetite/hunger and/or increasing satiety/fullness.",

Esse comportamento leva a um grande desconforto emocional, sentimentos de culpa e vergonha, afetando a saúde física e mental do indivíduo. Estima-se que a compulsão alimentar afete cerca de 2% da população mundial, sendo mais comum em mulheres e em pessoas em situação de estresse ou ansiedade. Diante desse cenário, é fundamental o papel do nutricionista no enfrentamento da compulsão alimentar. O profissional da nutrição tem um conhecimento aprofundado sobre os aspectos nutricionais e fisiológicos da alimentação, o que lhe confere a aptidão para realizar uma abordagem científica no tratamento desse distúrbio. Diferentemente de outras abordagens terapêuticas, o nutricionista possui a expertise em adequar a alimentação do indivíduo afetado pela compulsão alimentar, levando em consideração tanto os fatores emocionais, como os aspectos nutricionais e fisiológicos. Dessa forma, o profissional atua como um facilitador no processo de mudança de hábitos alimentares, auxiliando na promoção de uma relação mais equilibrada e saudável com a comida. No entanto, apesar da importância da atuação do nutricionista no enfrentamento da compulsão alimentar, ainda há uma escassez de estudos científicos que abordem essa temática de forma específica. É necessário, portanto, aprofundar o conhecimento sobre as estratégias utilizadas pelo nutricionista nesse contexto, assim como seus resultados no tratamento da compulsão alimentar. Diante disso, o presente artigo tem como objetivo analisar a atuação do nutricionista no enfrentamento da compulsão alimentar, levando em consideração uma abordagem científica.

      "title": "Effects of exercise on appetite control: implications for energy balance",
      "abstract": "At a time of increased obesity, decreased physical activity, and high food consumption, the relationship between physical activity and appetite control needs to be examined. Many people believe that the energy expended as a result of physical activity generates a drive to eat. However, a counterintuitive conclusion arises since there is no compelling evidence that increased physical activity increases energy intake. A suppression of hunger occurs following intense exercise; however, this effect is brief and has no influence on energy intake. Indeed, there does not appear to be any within-day effect of exercise on energy intake. Day-to-day effects of exercise on energy intake could occur, but only a few provocative data exist showing a delayed effect of exercise on energy intake 2 d later. Therefore, there appears to be only a weak short-term coupling between energy expenditure and energy intake. What about the effects of increased physical activity on food selection? The natural hypothesis would be that the energy reserves used during exercise would estimate a drive for a particular nutrient. There is no clear consistent evidence to indicate that in the short-term, exercise induces changes in food or nutrient preferences. In the long-term there is some evidence that physical activity is associated with an increase in carbohydrate intake, but it is uncertain whether these changes are biologically driven for a result of changes of a psychological nature. Contrary to a popularly held view, food selection and nutrient intake constitute patterns of behavior held in place by environmental contingencies and short-acting post-ingestive physiological responses; these patterns of behavior are relatively immune to modulation by the metabolic effects of exercise.",

U daljnjem nastavku vidjet cemo koliko su ispitanici, konzumacijom alkohola i hrane unijeli kalorija u kratkom periodu tijekom blagdana, te koliko je to viska kalorija u odnosu na njihov bazalni metabolizam i potreban dnevni unos kalorija.",

      "title": "Lessons from the Bottomless Bowl",
      "abstract": "In their clever experiment, Wansink et al. (1) provide a dramatic illustration of the importance of visual cues in the control of food intake. As they put it, aphoristically, “people use their eyes to count calories and not their stomachs.” Thanks to the Rube Goldbergesque imperceptibly self-refilling bowl, the experimental participants—through the clear evidence of their own senses—were misled into believing that they had eaten less than they really had. As a result, they consumed a full 73% more soup than did participants who ate from a normal soup bowl, without realizing it and without feeling any fuller. The ancient notion of the “wisdom of the body,” in which calories are regulated automatically through hormonal/neuronal mechanisms and negative-feedback loops, simply cannot accommodate the fact that trick soup bowls can so easily fool the eater. Wansink et al. (1) argue that, rather than keeping track of how much we eat—monitoring mouthfuls or spoonfuls or even calories, we turn this difficult and annoying task over to proxies. For instance, we, or at least 61% of us, according to the supplementary data of Wansink et al., are habitual plate-cleaners; in effect, we accept the portion on our plate as an appropriate amount to eat, and, therefore, we eat the full portion, monitoring our intake only to the extent of stopping when the plate is empty. Because our portions have grown larger (2), we eat more, without particularly realizing it, thereby doing our part to promote the current obesity epidemic. The bottomless bowl study raises some perplexing questions. Importantly, what exactly was the visual cue that the experimental participants used to terminate eating? Not the empty bowl; none of them got that far; even the normal bowl was replenished by the experimenter when only 25% of the soup remained. The eaters ended up, on average, eating (or leaving) one-half, which Wansink et al. suggest may have been their target when eating from a large (18-oz) bowl. However, clearly several people in the normal bowl condition ate at least 75% of the soup—triggering a refill—so the one-half mark was not their original target. When do people target the entire portion and when do they target only one-half? Will they change their minds partway through the meal if they realize that consuming a full portion is not possible? Finally, it may be argued that, in this study, there was inadequate time for satiety cues to accumulate and feedback to stop intake. If the meal had been interrupted and later resumed, perhaps participants would have received more reliable information from their brain–gut axis about how sated they really were. Possibly—but in the real world, we eat our meals without the sort of interlude that might encourage useful internal feedback. Accordingly, the size of the original portion dictates our intake, and when that portion is excessive, our intake will be excessive too. If only our bowls and plates were programmed to imperceptibly empty themselves!",

      "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this review is to describe adolescent nutritional requirements from a scientific, nutritional, and psychosocial point of view, emphasizing the main risks of malnutrition at this age. Currently, too many teenagers are alone at home and prepare their own meals. The influence of friends replaces parental rules. The habits of adolescents are characterized by a tendency to skip meals, especially breakfast, and, less frequently, the midday meal; to purchase carry-out meals away from home; to consume snacks, especially sweets; to eat at fast food restaurants, almost always with high-calorie content; and to eat fried foods, soft drinks, and sweets. Toxic habits, such as smoking, alcohol, and drugs, interfere with a healthy diet, as well. Physical activity usually decreases during adolescence, particularly in girls. The lack of physical activity is due to a precarious knowledge of the benefits associated with practicing physical activity, low motivation, time constraints, and, in many cases, the lack of adequate facilities. Adolescents interested in a body image in accordance with modern ideals follow restrictive and unbalanced diets without any nutritional basis, which they themselves planned. These behaviors increase the risk of nutritional alterations, such as noncompliance with nutritional requirements, meal pattern irregularities, nutritional problems due to low nutrient intake, and self-esteem issues and frustration. In general, in this age group, there is an increase in protein consumption and salt content, often with a supply of unbalanced nutrients, high-fat diets (35–50% of total calories), and low polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratio. In addition, adolescents consume a low level of complex carbohydrates, fiber, fruits, and vegetables.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder that compromises the physical and psychological health of the individual, and can affect people of any age, about 300 million people and when this disorder remains for a long time, it can lead to suicide. The increase in the prevalence of depression is related to the adoption of a modern lifestyle, represented by a sedentary lifestyle, dietary changes and sleep deprivation, a stressful environment, fast pace and low quality of the diet consumed. Body image can be defined as a wide range of psychological experiences. It encompasses not only the concept of physical appearance, but attitudes towards the body, encompassing thoughts, behaviors, convictions, emotions and actions and over the years, society has promoted an aesthetic standard that privileges thin or muscular and defined bodies associated with beauty and success, and this is promoted mainly through the media. In some mood changes, food consumption may increase, with greater interest in consuming high-calorie foods, such as ultra-processed foods. These foods increase the production of serotonin in the body, providing a feeling of immediate pleasure and, consequently, it becomes a vicious cycle. Therefore, the promotion of healthy eating, with foods that are a source of antioxidant nutrients, is important in the prevention and treatment of depression, in addition to humanized care, with a multidisciplinary team.",

      "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY * Long busy-season hours give CPA's so little time for exercise or regular meals that stress can build. This can weaken a person's immune system and make him or her more prone to illness. The overload also can diminish employee performance and lead to low morale, absenteeism and high turnover among staff members. * CPAs CAN TAKE SIMPLE STEPS--both at home and at work--to develop healthful habits that mitigate stress, sustain energy and make staying fit throughout busy season an attainable goal. * TO SUPPORT STAMINA AND CONCENTRATION, a CPA with a heavy workload needs to eat when his or her body signals hunger and keep healthful, high-protein snacks in the office. * A CPA WHO CAN'T GET TO A GYM or hasn't used one can relieve stress by doing small amounts of exercise such as 10 minutes at home in the morning and another 10 minutes after work. Simple, accessible activities such as a brisk walk, a bike ride or boxing/dance moves to upbeat music will work. * IN THE OFFICE, CPAs CAN USE SHORT BREAKS for stretches, push-ups, sit-ups, toe touches and other exercises that don't require equipment. They also can take the stairs instead of the elevator or walk to lunch or to a client meeting. * A PROFESSIONAL TRAINER CAN PUT TOGETHER an exercise plan to help CPAs get the most out of their time and keep workouts safe and balanced. Once learned, routines can be done at work or at home. Long hours, especially from January to April, take their toll on CPAs. Busy season leaves so little time for exercise or regular, balanced meals that what we eat when we get a break may make us more lethargic than energetic. On top of that, the nonstop deadline pressure triggers stress, affecting everyone in the firm--from partners to staff--mentally, emotionally and physically. Such stress can lead to biochemical imbalances that weaken our immune systems, make us more prone to illness and confer a hidden--and high--cost of working in our profession. In the office environment, it contributes to diminished employee performance, low morale, conflicts, absenteeism and high turnover. Staying fit throughout busy season is attainable for everyone, however. Here are some helpful strategies I learned during my six years in the trenches at KPMG LLP. FUEL FOR THOUGHT Some things CPAs can do to mitigate stress are easier than you might think. For example, eating the right foods (particularly those high in protein) strengthens your immune system, lowers blood pressure and stabilizes your energy levels. To develop good nutritional habits that support stamina and concentration, try to * Eat when you're hungry. This may seem obvious, but it isn't common practice. Many busy people go to work in the morning without breakfast or work through lunch because they believe they don't have time for a meal. Eating when you're hungry--not starved--helps to lessen stress and control weight gain. * Keep it simple. Breakfast and lunch don't have to be elaborate to maintain energy. The proteins and carbohydrates in protein bars, fruit, cheese, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs or peanut butter on toast are sufficient. Foods that are complete proteins, such as nuts, meat or eggs, have all the amino acids your body needs to construct new proteins. Studies say they tend to stave off hunger longer. * Don't wait too long between meals. This leads to unpleasant hunger, characterized by headaches, fatigue, lack of concentration and irritability. If you wait until you feel starved, you'll overeat at the next meal. Eat at regular intervals. Set an alarm or use a kitchen timer to signal when it's time for a food break if you're likely to become immersed in your work. * Stop eating before you feel stuffed. Learn to recognize when you're no longer truly hungry. The stomach is about the size of a large baked potato, so a body has met its needs long before a stretched feeling in the stomach signals stop. …",

      "title": "Social psychological factors in tackling obesity",
      "abstract": "In the fight to reduce rising levels of obesity, a persistent obstacle is the psychological conflict between things people want to eat – for instance, fatty or sweet foods – and good health. People have very mixed feelings and beliefs about healthy lifestyle options. They experience positive sensations from eating foods that provide excessive calorie and salt content, yet finding the time to exercise (which in itself they may find unpleasant) is difficult. People know that rich foods are bad for them but, on the other hand, they also know that moderate exercise is good for them (1). No one escapes the psychological conflict, or ‘ambivalence’ that ensues. Yet, public information campaigns insist on simply reminding people to avoid certain foods and to exercise, rather than helping to resolve this deep-seated ambivalence. Ambivalence is an important issue because prior experimental evidence from the field of social psychology reveals it to be an important obstacle to healthy behaviour. Health-related ambivalence makes it psychologically difficult to resist the temptations of unhealthy choices. Several studies illustrate the effort required to overcome unhealthy temptations (2). In one study, young teenagers were given the opportunity to eat a large quantity of crisps, which they consumed with glee. The experimenter then presented them with a jug of Quench, a ‘new’ bright-red drink, along with a written description of its positive and negative attributes. The thirsty participants were told that they could have some of the drink, but it would be better to wait until later because supplies were short. The participants then sat alone with the drink for 10 min. During this time, the experimenter unobtrusively videotaped them and gave them an additional questionnaire to assess the ways in which they had coped with their temptation to drink the beverage. Analyses revealed that the participants tried a range of strategies to avoid drinking the beverage. Some participants moved the tasty-looking juice away from them. Others tried to focus attention on other materials that were available in the laboratory (e.g. magazines) or tried to highlight the negative (not positive) aspects of the drink in the questionnaire that the experimenter had given to them. In addition, participants even created negative attributes of the drink (e.g. that it was ‘too sweet’) that were never even mentioned in the initial, brief description. These behaviours betray a high amount of psychological effort aimed at combating temptation. More important, this effort occurred more strongly when the experimenter emphasized that the participants were free to choose whether or not to consume the beverage. Freedom of choice makes it more difficult to resist temptation. Other research and theory indicate that stress (3,4) and habit formation also impede the ability to resist temptation (5). Yet, choice, stress and habit are all inescapable or difficult to reduce. So how can we help people cope with this ambivalence? Unfortunately, there is good reason to doubt the efficacy of interventions that simply provide new persuasive information. The problem is that people who are high in ambivalence towards an issue carefully scrutinise any information that can help resolve their conflict (6,7). As a result, ambivalent individuals are more likely to pick out flaws in the messages when the messages are overly simplistic (e.g. ‘just say no’) and form more negative attitudes and behaviours towards the healthy options after detecting the flaws. Indeed, a series of studies sponsored by the Economic and Social Research Council have demonstrated this type of backfire when anti-racism messages are presented to people who are highly ambivalent towards ethnic-minority groups (8). A more basic problem with a persuasive information approach is that it may fail to positively affect non-conscious evaluations of health-related behaviours. Indeed, the research on anti-racism messages revealed backfire effects of persuasive messages on implicit measures of attitude, which assess evaluations that people are unable or unwilling to retrieve from memory (9–11). Implicit measures do not ask people to directly report their attitudes but, instead, assess their attitudes without their immediate awareness or control (e.g. using subliminal presentation of stimuli). Importantly, responses on implicit measures are often discordant with self-reported (explicit) attitudes. For example, a person may explicitly report that she dislikes chocolate cake because of its perceived health impact, yet she exhibits a strong desire to eat the cake on an implicit measure (compare this with the work of Roefs et al. (12)). This difference is important because it is the scores on the implicit measures that tend to best predict actual spontaneous behaviour (13,14). Thus, it is vital that interventions manage to influence the associations tapped by the implicit measures and not just the attitudes obtained by self-report measures. It is likely that this non-conscious attitude change requires repeated and creative interventions to change attitudes – even a single powerful message might not be enough to elicit long-term non-conscious change (15). Potential clues to addressing this problem are revealed by important evidence that ambivalence has unique neurological properties. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging brain imaging techniques, Cunningham et al. found that regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), specifically the ventrolateral PFC, are more active when people make evaluations of objects that elicit ambivalence, over and above the activity associated with emotional valence and intensity, in regions such as the amygdala (16). This pattern indicates that ambivalence has unique neuropsychological substrates, which may help us understand the effects of ambivalence on behaviour. In fact, such evidence may help to solve an interesting behavioural puzzle about ambivalence. Specifically, ambivalence tends to elicit polarized responses to the objects of the ambivalence (i.e. extremely positive or extremely negative) (1), despite eliciting enhanced scrutiny of relevant persuasive messages as described above (7). In other words, ambivalent people tend to respond in extreme ways that are consistent with salient situational factors, despite resisting direct social influence. One potential resolution is that the polarization and resistance effects occur over different timescales. The studies showing response polarization have used very obvious and immediate cues (e.g. mood; good behaviour) that may be salient within a ‘teachable moment’, when a person is still processing their conflicting evaluations. In contrast, the persuasive messages require longer periods of attention and deliberation, and they may fail, partly because they are not comprehended early enough during the person’s thoughts about an object, and before the person has begun to resolve their ambivalence in a particular direction. Neurological scanning can be used to better track the time course of ambivalence (e.g. using event-related potential or magnetoencephalography) and to test whether situational cues have a different impact during the activation of brain regions that are associated with ambivalence than after this activation has subsided. Such evidence may reveal ways in which interventions can be shaped to use, rather than challenge, ambivalence. For example, it may be possible to develop signage or messages that give instant pictorial cues to healthy behaviour immediately after eliciting feelings of ambivalence about a behaviour. These approaches may be more successful than those that use drawn-out print messages for ambivalent topics. Ambivalence and difficulties in trying to resolve it are important in the health context. It is important to develop interventions that are capable of affecting the non–conscious associations that plausibly direct many unhealthy behaviours, and the tools are present to test this possibility. There are also powerful tools (e.g. brain imaging techniques) for looking more directly at the neurological structure and consequences of health-related ambivalence. The use of such tools can coincide with attempts to explore the ways in which social psychological approaches to healthy behaviour change can be adapted to suit public health interventions. We believe that this agenda should be an important aim for future research. No conflict of interest was declared.",

Na samym początku z diety eliminuje sie potrawy powszechnie uznawane za niezdrowe (smazone mieso, tluste sosy, slodycze), a wzbogaca sie ją świezymi jarzynami, owocami, nieslodzonymi sokami, gotowanymi rybami. Nastepny krok to kupowanie naturalnej zywności i czytani e etykiet. Jezeli poprzestaje sie na tym etapie, nie mozemy mowic o rozwoju choroby. Problem zaczyna sie wtedy, gdy kontrolowanie tego, co ląduje na talerzu przybiera coraz ostrzejszy charakter, a eliminacja z jadlospisu niektorych produktow powoduje znaczne niedobory skladnikow mineralnych i witamin. Efektem są bole i zawroty glowy, nudności, ciągle zmeczenie, anemia, osteoporoza. Zaburzona zostaje praca jelit i wzrasta podatnośc na infekcje. Dokladna liczba ortorektykow nie jest znana. Spowodowane jest to tym, ze chorzy na ortoreksje rzadko zglaszają sie na leczenie lub leczą sie w kierunku innych chorob.",

      "title": "39 Binge Drinking: Not an Innocent Problem",
      "abstract": "More and more paediatricians are confronted with teen drinking and the problems that result from it. A new trend is the so called “binge-drinking”. This means consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol in a very short period of time with the goal of getting drunk as fast as possible. Within 1 hour after ingestion, alcohol is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. Toxic effects of alcohol can occur from a plasma concentration of 0.5–1‰ (= 500–1000 mg/l) or an intake of 600 mg/kg alcohol. This is equal to ingestion of 120 ml liquor (alcohol concentration 30%) in an adolescent of 40kg. The effects are caused by a suppression of the central nervous system and they occur faster in younger people than in adults due to less extracellular volume. Also individual factors like gender, use of other medications or drugs and drinking habits play a role. All this factors can result in a broad spectrum of symptoms (relaxation, altered perception of the environment, prolonged reaction time, amnesia, nausea, vomiting and in more severe cases respiratory depression, coma and death). When a child with possible alcohol intoxication is admitted to the emergency department, general “APLS” guidelines (Advanced Pediatric Life Support) should be followed. After the “acute” event of the alcohol intoxication, multidisciplinary follow-up of the patient is very important. In Belgium, no objective data exist on the problem of binge drinking whilst among paediatricians there is great concern about it. Therefore, we will conduct a national survey on this topic.",

      "abstract": "Twenty regular smokers were assessed over 24-h of normal cigarette smoking, and an equivalent period of abstinence. In both conditions, a non-deprived baseline was followed by performance tests 2, 6 and 24 h later, while subjective feelings were assessed every 2 h. Compared to normal smoking, abstinence led to reduced heart rate, worse task performance, feelings of depression, stress, irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, and urges to smoke. Letter cancellation and number vigilance task performance were significantly poorer after 2 and 6 h of abstinence. Subjective feeling states were significantly worse after 4 h of abstinence, and became increasingly impaired over the rest of the day. However many abstinence symptoms (except heart rate), were reduced in severity at the 24-h session, held on the morning of the following day. This suggests that many of the psychological effects of smoking abstinence, may build-up afresh each day.",

      "abstract": "fasting: fastingFigureI feel like I've joined a cult. There's no savior to follow, and the main thing you need to do is actually not drink the Kool-Aid. There are some rules, but they're mostly from endocrine physiology. I'm talking about intermittent fasting. I feel like a Crossfitting, gluten-free vegan; I can't stop proselytizing about it. I feel the best I've felt in years, I've lost 10 pounds, my focus has improved dramatically, and most importantly, my body is in the best shape it's ever been. And I'm eating whatever I want. First some background. Absolute fasts withhold food and drink; intermittent fasting is bursts of food-only fasting frequently or regularly. For me, this means 16:8 fasting; I eat from noon to 8 p.m. (eight hours) and then consume no calories (but drink sparkling water and green tea) from 8 p.m. to midnight the following day (16 hours). You can get benefits from even shorter (12 hours) or less frequent (a few times a week) or longer fasts (24 hours of fasting, then eating regularly). I never thought I'd be able to fast. I have had the worst heartburn and gastritis since I was 12, and I figured I'd have to eat something or my stomach would tear itself apart. I'm also known for getting hangry when I haven't eaten, but what's the worst that could happen? It was not easy at first. Day four, I was stuck at home on a conference call thinking to myself, “I can't do this. There's food everywhere!” But after that I gained so much confidence that I could fast and nothing bad would happen that I barely even notice it now, 12 weeks in. I started focusing on macronutrients, eating controlled amounts of proteins, carbs, and fats while working out five days a week. I'd put on some muscle but also fat at the same time. The longer you fast, the more ketones you produce, but I eat plenty of carbs when I break my fast, mostly from fruit. But that's one of the reasons I don't mind intermittent fasting; there's no category of food I have to avoid. I learned most of this from a wonderful book, The Obesity Code by Jason Fung, MD, a nephrologist and a medical expert on fasting. My take on his work: Insulin is the root of most obesity and type 2 diabetes. Genetics play some part, but insulin is an anabolic hormone and makes you gain weight. Insulin is triggered by eating calories (in particular, unrefined carbohydrates and proteins and less so by eating fat). We've spent years worrying about what we eat but absolutely no energy thinking about when we eat. If your body is constantly exposed to boluses of insulin (from consuming calories frequently), it's going to downregulate its insulin receptors (hi, homeostasis) and lead to insulin resistance. It'll also change your body weight set point, and make you put on weight that is hard to lose. Your body doesn't know what a calorie is; it's a hoax that there's a “universal nutrition currency.” No one thinks that 200 calories of kale have the same effect on you as 200 calories of doughnut. Your body responds to carbs, proteins, and fats, not calories. What you eat still matters, but it's much more important that you eat whole foods instead of processed junk. Build up to longer fasts. Start with 12 hours by eating from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and slowly push breakfast further and further ahead until you make your fast longer. I boiled all this down to a few simple rules for myself: Don't eat breakfast. This was hard; breakfast food is my favorite, but now I just eat it for dinner when I want. Eat whatever you want, as long as it's not processed garbage. I eat tons of fruit, whole fat plain yogurt without guilt, and add butter to my food. It's satisfying to eat fatty, delicious food. Avoid refined carbs and sugar: I'm not a saint; I still break my fast with a sweet and creamy chai tea, but otherwise try to avoid foods with extra sugar. Eat meals; don't snack all day. I end up eating three meals in my eight hours—a big lunch, a smaller treat halfway through (a cup of yogurt, some hummus, or some fruit), and then a big dinner. I get so much fuller on so much less food (because it's full of healthy fat!) Stop drinking sugary caffeinated beverages. Sipping on a latte was spiking my insulin levels with every sip. I'm not a strict intermittent faster but a social one. I'll have a beer with dinner. I'll cut my fasting hours if I'm having dinner with a friend. I'm not going to be that guy who refuses to eat after 8 p.m. when everyone is eating at 8:15. I've convinced some colleagues to give this a try, and I challenge you as well.

      "abstract": "Risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD) is more common in late adolescence and early adulthood (approximately between the ages of 16 and 30) than in any other period in life. This is also the age when young people in Switzerland and many other European countries are legally allowed to buy and drink alcohol, but they usually do not yet have adult responsibilities. This paper reviews evidence from the international literature and provides examples of studies conducted in Switzerland demonstrating that (a) RSOD is by far most prevalent on Saturday evenings followed by Friday evenings, usually because young people go out and do not have any work or study responsibilities the next day; (b) RSOD results from drinking in private before going out (\"predrinking\") and accelerating the pace of drinking (i.e. increasing the number of drinks consumed per hour); (c) RSOD is often not accidental but purposeful,. to seek excitement, to have fun and to feel the effects of alcohol; (d) RSOD occurs predominantly outside the home, mostly in bars, pubs, discos or at special events and festivals; (e) RSOD often results in intended and unintended injuries and other acute consequences, which are leading risk factors for mortality and morbidity in this age group. Effective prevention strategies should include attempts to reduce opportunities to engage in heavy drinking as well as strategies to reduce its harmful consequences.",

      "title": "Intermittent Fasting — What Is It and Does It Work?",
      "abstract": "WHAT IS INTERMITTENT FASTING?FigureIntermittent fasting is defined as eating during a certain time period, or, fasting for an entire day. For example, intermittent fasting can be defined as eating foods within an 8-hour period, but fasting for the remaining 16-hour period. This is often referred to as “time-restricted feeding” and/or “16/8 intermittent fasting,” referring to hours one fasts (16 hours) and the hours during which one consumes foods (8 hours). Alternate day fasting also is considered intermittent fasting and is defined as not consuming food for an entire day. With alternate day fasting, for example, a person may eat for 3 days, then fast for 1 day, then consume foods for another 2 days, then fast for another day. The “5:2” diet is one where an individual would eat normally for 5 days of the week, but restrict energy intake for the remaining 2 days of the week. The proposed advantage of intermittent fasting is that individuals do not have to count calories; rather, they are limited to the time in which they can consume foods. The proposed advantage of intermittent fasting is that individuals do not have to count calories; rather, they are limited to the time in which they can consume foods. It is recommended that individuals consume healthy food choices during their periods of food consumption. In addition, fasting may result in dehydration, and thus, it is usually recommended that individuals consume water, unsweetened coffee, and/or tea, during the fasting periods (1). DOES INTERMITTENT FASTING RESULT IN WEIGHT LOSS AND/OR HEALTH BENEFITS? Although much of the research reported on intermittent fasting has been conducted in animals, more and more human studies are being conducted and published, with some positive results. Gabel et al. (2) examined time restructured feeding that did not include counting kilocalories (kcal), hypothesizing that it would result in weight loss in individuals who were obese. They asked their participants to use the 16/8 intermittent fasting pattern for the study. There were 23 individuals who participated in the intermittent fasting group and 23 individuals in the control group. Over the course of the 12-week study period, those in the 16/8 intermittent fasting group were asked to consume foods, ad libitum, between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. They were allowed to consume water during the 16-hour fasting period. The researchers reported a 2.6% weight loss and a reduction of about 340 kcal per day in the time-restricted fasting group compared with the control group after the 12-week intervention. These results were significant (P < 0.05). They also reported a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure in the intermittent fasting group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The researchers did not report significant differences between groups in body composition (fat mass, lean body mass, deep [visceral] body fat), diastolic blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity markers. They also did not report significant differences between groups in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, or homocysteine concentrations. Gabel et al. (2) concluded that an 8-hour time-restricted fast could be helpful for weight loss and in decreasing systolic blood pressure.FigureFigureAlthough Gabel et al. (2) reported positive weight loss results, their study was conducted over a 12-week period. Would longer term intermittent fasting be possible and result in similar findings? Sundfør et al. (3) evaluated whether intermittent fasting (using the 5:2 method) or continuous energy restriction resulted in weight loss or maintenance and improved cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with abdominal obesity and one or more of the other risk factors for metabolic syndrome. They had 112 individuals, 21 to 70 years of age, participate in their study (50% women and 50% men). Individuals were randomized to either an intermittent fasting group or a continuous energy restriction group. The intervention was 6 months in duration and included 10 nutrition counseling sessions with dietitians. This was followed by a 6-month maintenance period, which did not include any nutrition counseling sessions. Those who were in the 5:2 intermittent fasting group were asked to consume between 400 (women) to 600 (men) kcal on 2 nonconsecutive days of the week. The researchers reported that both groups decreased kilocalorie intake by approximately 26% to 28%. There were no significant differences in weight loss between the two groups (8.0 vs. 9.0 kg in the intermittent fasting vs. continuous energy restriction group, respectively). Improvements in blood pressure, waist circumference, and triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol concentrations were reported in both groups, with no differences between groups. The regain in body weight was small in both groups, with no significant differences between groups. However, those who were in the intermittent fasting group reported being hungry more of the time than those in the continuous energy restriction group (P = 0.002). This longer term study demonstrated no differences in weight loss or other markers after 1 year, between intermittent fasting and continuous fasting. The greater feelings of hunger in the intermittent fasting group may deter individuals from participating in this type of eating over a longer period. Although intermittent fasting results in weight loss, and some improvements in cardiometabolic health, will it still improve cardiometabolic health without weight loss? Sutton et al. (4) conducted a controlled feeding trial to examine if intermittent fasting would have cardiometabolic benefits without weight loss in men who had prediabetes. They used “early time-restricted feeding,” which has a 6-hour feeding period and dinner must be consumed before 3 p.m., which the researchers stated would be “in alignment with circadian rhythms in metabolism” (4). They compared this to a control schedule, which had a 12-hour eating period. This was a cross-over study, whereby all participants were on each eating schedule for a 5-week period. Sutton et al. (4) reported that the early time-restricted feeding improved insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, oxidative stress, beta cell responsiveness, and appetite. These results occurred without weight loss among the participants. Although the results were positive, this was a short-term study, and the early time-restricted feeding may prove to be difficult to maintain over time, in particular, with respect to consuming an early dinner. DOES INTERMITTENT FASTING IMPAIR ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE? Intermittent fasting may be something athletes choose to do, or it may be a result of a religious practice, such as Ramadan. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast daily from sunrise to sunset. Does the practice of fasting during Ramadan affect athletic performance? Zarrouk et al. (5) assessed this on muscle fatigue and neuromuscular performance in eight karate athletes, approximately 17 years of age. They evaluated the athletes 1 week before Ramadan (control session) and then again during the first and fourth weeks of Ramadan. At each session, they evaluated dietary intake, anthropometry, maximal voluntary isometric contractions, and submaximal contractions (75% of maximal isometric contractions). They also used electromyography to analyze neuromuscular changes. Zarrouk et al. (5) reported that total kilocalorie intake and water intake were significantly greater during Ramadan than at baseline. Despite the increased energy intake, there were no changes in body mass during Ramadan. Neuromuscular activity also was maintained among the athletes during Ramadan. They concluded that Ramadan did not affect athletic performance in the eight karate athletes. In a meta-analysis, Aird et al. (6) assessed the effects of fasting on exercise performance, specifically, the effects of fasting compared with pre-exercise feeding on aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance. A search was performed using the MEDLINE and PubMed search engines. Of the studies analyzed, the researchers reported that pre-exercise food consumption positively affected prolonged aerobic exercise (P = 0.012). However, pre-exercise feeding did not positively affect shorter duration aerobic exercise performance. They concluded that more research is needed to evaluate how pre-exercise feeding (or fasting) may influence exercise performance and physiological adaptations.2 SUMMARY Intermittent fasting has become increasingly popular within the past 5 years. Based on the research, it seems to be beneficial, not only to weight loss, but with respect to cardiometabolic risk. Although it may lead to positive results, the effects on exercise training and performance have not been well-studied. More research with respect to the different types of fasting on exercise performance is warranted. Intermittent fasting has become increasingly popular within the past 5 years. Based on the research, it seems to be beneficial, not only to weight loss, but with respect to cardiometabolic risk.

As predicted, dieters induced to see themselves as \"good\" ate less after the preload than did dieters whose self-perception was not manipulated, but dieters who saw themselves as \"bad\" also reduced their intake. Over the next week, restrained subjects in general lost more weight, with those who had been led to focus on their dieting ability in the face of a challenge, being mainly responsible for this effect.",

Les industries agro-alimentaires proposent des solutions palliatives qui consistent a reduire la teneur calorique des aliments, soit en diminuant leur taux de matieres grasses, soit en substituant des edulcorants intenses aux glucides simples. Deux etudes comportementales montrent que la compensation calorique est imparfaite lors de la premiere presentation d'un aliment allege enn matieres grasses. Apres apprentissage cette compensation devient parfaite chez l'adolescent et demeure imparfaite chez l'adulte.

      "abstract": "Progress report Normal and abnormal food intakeThe control of food intake is of central importance in the maintenance of physiological energy balance.Nevertheless, knowledge of appetite control in man is fragmentary.Food intake is altered according to prevailing energy requirements; when these are increased by, for example, lactation', growth2, exercise3 or a cold environment4'5 intake is increased.Appetite control occurs on a basis of alternating hunger and satiety, the degree of hunger and the amount of food needed to produce satiety being altered by demands for energy at any given moment.This pattern provides a background but it can be modified or over- ridden by higher influences such as custom, pleasure and the psychological state of the individual.Until recently the major control imposed on food intake was the avail- ability of food as the abundance of food in the western hemisphere is a relatively new situation.In such circumstances fine control mechanisms to diminish slight, but chronic, overeating are not often called upon although short-term mechanisms to prevent gross overeating are still necessary.This may be important when considering why what seems, at first sight, to be a basic physiological mechanism should break down so frequently in the face of unlimited availability of food.The result of this breakdown is obesity. Physiological Mechanisms Controlling Food Intake APPETITE CONTROL CENTRES HypothalamusIn many species the hypothalamus is an important site at which energy requirements are translated into feeding behaviour.Bilateral lesions in the ventromedial nuclei result in hyperphagia and obesity6'7 whereas lesions in the lateral nuclei result in diminished appetite6.The ventromedial nucleus acts as a satiety centre which controls a chronically active feeding centre in the lateral nucleus. Other brain centresAppetite is also influenced by areas of the brain outside the hypothalamus8'9' 10,11 and the role of the extrahypothalamic sites has been comprehensively reviewed by Grossman12.The limbic system provides an important pathway by which higher influences such as emotion, pain and custom can affect autonomic and hypothalamic function including appetite control13. CONTROL MECHANISMSAppetite control can be differentiated into short-and long-term mechanisms.The short-term mechanisms regulate the size and frequency of meals and must act rapidly since satiety occurs even before absorption of a meal is 744on August 14, 2023 by guest.",

      "title": "Rational Use of Protein Supplements in the Elderly—Relevance of Gastrointestinal Mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Protein supplements are increasingly used by older people to maintain nutrition and prevent or treat loss of muscle function. Daily protein requirements in older people are in the range of 1.2 gm/kg/day or higher. Many older adults do not consume this much protein and are likely to benefit from higher consumption. Protein supplements are probably best taken twice daily, if possible soon after exercise, in doses that achieve protein intakes of 30 gm or more per episode. It is probably not important to give these supplements between meals, as we have shown no suppressive effects of 30 gm whey drinks, and little if any suppression of 70 gm given to older subjects at varying time intervals from meals. Many gastrointestinal mechanisms controlling food intake change with age, but their contributions to changes in responses to protein are not yet well understood. There may be benefits in giving the supplement with rather than between meals, to achieve protein intakes above the effective anabolic threshold with lower supplement doses, and have favourable effects on food-induced blood glucose increases in older people with, or at risk of developing, type 2 diabetes mellitus; combined protein and glucose drinks lower blood glucose compared with glucose alone in older people.",

La selectividad alimentaria se caracteriza por la ingesta de una variedad limitada de alimentos y el rechazo a la mayoria de los nuevos nutrientes.

A pesar de que casi todos los ninos con problemas de alimentacion tienen alguna condicion biologica, la mayoria de los programas de intervencion se centran en los componentes conductuales. Los terminos «rechazo a alimentarse» y «selectividad alimentaria» parecen implicar que se trata de comportamientos voluntarios cuando, en realidad, es muy probable que se deban a problemas medicos o sensoriomotores no identificados que transforman el proceso de alimentarse en algo dificil o doloroso. El presente trabajo tiene como objetivo ofrecer una revision de los factores que deben tenerse en cuenta en la evaluacion y el tratamiento del nino que rechaza alimentarse o que se muestra excesivamente selectivo en la aceptacion de alimentos.

When problems of food refusal and selectivity persist, children are at risk for nutritional deficiencies. Although most children with eating disorders have a biological condition, most intervention programs focus on behavioral components. The terms food refusal and food selectivity seem to imply that these are voluntary behaviors when in fact they are very likely due to unidentified medical or sensorimotor issues which transform the process of feeding into something difficult or painful. This paper aims to provide a review of the factors to consider in the evaluation and treatment of the child who refuses to eat or is overly selective in accepting food.",

By saving the necessity to plan for herself, the difficulties of the budget are somewhat lightened.

These diets offer quick and painless weight loss while allowing consumption of favourite or tasty foods, but place severe restrictions on certain other foods or food categories. • Fad diets often work in the short term because they are low-kilojoule diets in disguise; that is, energy intake as a result of the diet is lower than the person's requirements. • Successful long term weight loss depends on the consumption over a long period of time of less energy than is expended.

Mentální anorexie a bulimie představují ve svých projevech mezní polohy jídelního chování od život ohrožujícího příjmu potravy až po přejídání, následované pročišťováním nebo hladověním. V důsledku nevhodných jídelních návyků a užívání ohrožujících způsobů kontroly tělesné hmotnosti a tělesné nespokojenosti generalizované i na jiné oblasti osobního života trpí i obézní lidé stejnými psychickými a somatickými problémy jako lidé s bulimií a anorexií. Avšak klinický obraz a sociální problematika těchto dvou kategorií poruch příjmu potravy je však značně odlišná. Také konstitučně, anamnesticky, ale i v osobnostní struktuře se jedná o rozdílné obrazy a vlastní zdravotní důsledky jsou také úplně jiné. Příčinu rostoucího počtu poruch příjmu potravy vidí většina autorů v rychle se měnící kultuře, která nekriticky oslavuje štíhlost a jednostrannou sebekontrolu. Módní průmysl, filmy, časopisy a televize rozšiřují názor, že vyhublá štíhlost je nejdůležitějším aspektem fyzické přitažlivosti. Kořeny každého strachu, a tedy i strachu z tloušťky, jsou v každodenním životě a ve světě, který nás obklopuje. Existuje tzv. multifaktoriální koncept, který se v posledních letech stává obecně přijímaným standardem pro popis, interpretaci i terapii poruch příjmu potravy. Problematika regulace tělesné hmotnosti, obezity a poruch příjmu potravy má mnoho vzájemně se prolínajících a podmiňujících rovin. Do multifaktoriálního konceptu se zařazují sociokulturní a rodinné vlivy, chronické obtíže, nepříznivé životní události a v neposlední řadě i biologické faktory.",

Evidence indicates there is more imitation by adult offspring of abstemious parents (both abstainer and low volume) than of high volume parents. Adult offspring drink significantly less, on the average, than their high volume parents, a phenomenon here termed‘fall‐off effect’ for both men and women with respect to either their fathers or mothers. This fall‐off among social drinkers appears when the mother approaches or the father consumes at or more than a typical daily drinking level (≥1 drink per day). More sensible drinking occurs among adult offspring when (I) the parent has no drinking problem‐signs than when the parent has drinking problems (this pattern appears at all levels of offspring consumption), and (2) when parents drink at high volume and have no problems for those offspring who do not imitate parent volume. Drinking “sensibly’ appears to be associated directly with the level of parent alcohol use and offsprings’ own drinking levels (considered as imitation or non‐imitation of parents), and indirectly with offspring recall of problematic intake by parents. Drinking sensibly is a medical, education and public health issue.",

      "title": "Endocrinology and the nudge hypothesis",
      "abstract": "In this era of double-blind randomized controlled trials, we are asking you to do something unusual – To imagine. Imagine that you have guests for dinner. As they arrive, you lay out some starters for them to eat. Nothing very healthy. Some spicy fries and the like. However, it turns out that these starters are very delicious. Too delicious, in fact. Now that your guests have started to consume them, they can't seem to stop. You bring the second, third, and then the fourth servings. They all get eaten up in quick time. You now begin to worry. For one, you feel that the spicy fries are unhealthy when consumed in excess, and that continuously eating them might give your guests a health problem, say, an attack of gastritis. Second, you feel that if they continue to eat the fries, they may not leave enough space in their stomachs for the main course of the evening. You, therefore, act. You quietly remove all the starters and take them back to the kitchen. Very simply put, you have taken away a choice from your guests. For their own benefit, of course. They now are saved from the health troubles of a binge on starters, and in addition, they manage to enjoy the main course after that. You have given them a nudge in the right direction by limiting their choices. People have a tendency to go for the easy, default option, and if that is healthy or good for them, why not give them a nudge? Just a few weeks ago, Richard Thaler, the creator of the \"nudge hypothesis,\" was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics.[1] His work on behavioral economics has been applied in a wide variety of fields, even endocrinology. The aforementioned anecdote is adapted from a real-life experience narrated by Thaler.[2] Take for instance, fortification of salt with iodine. The use of iodized salt is universal today, with about 88% of urban Indians consuming it.[3] An important public health step, which has prevented endemic cretinism and goiter, this simple step of salt iodization is an example of a nudge in the right direction. By making iodized salt universally available in the country, public health policy experts have made sure that our choices are limited to the use of healthy salt. There are arguments against iodine supplementation, sometimes, based on biological hypotheses. For instance, one could argue that iodization of salt has been followed by an increase in autoimmune thyroid disease.[4] However, the evidence for this being a causative link remains tenuous. Moreover, the prevention of iodine-deficiency disorders, with its far-reaching effects on maternal health and neonatal neurocognition, may outweigh any such presumptuous risks.[5] Indeed, some other authors would argue that the development of civilizations has followed the iodized salt route![6] In addition to this biological argument, another argument against the nudge hypothesis is that it may limit our personal choices and impinge on freedom. However, this too is debatable. At any level of choice, for instance, does an individual's freedom overcome public good? For instance, does an individual's freedom not to take iodized salt be more important than preventing possible mental retardation in society due to iodine deficiency? Clearly, these are complex questions. Some answers are more clear: an example is the nudge to ban smoking in public places such as airports. Here, the benefits are clearer because the prevention of secondhand smoke exposure in a crowded airport is more important than any individual's right to smoke anywhere that he/she pleases. However, one of the most complex examples of the \"nudge\" in endocrinology has been the suggestion of a \"sugar tax\" or a \"fat tax.\" This has already been applied in some states of India and is hotly debated.[7] There is no doubt about the link between sugar-sweetened beverages and the occurrence of obesity and type 2 diabetes worldwide.[8] What is in question, however, is the effectiveness of taxation of calorie-dense food on overall energy intake and obesity/type 2 diabetes prevalence rates. A \"sugar tax\" or a \"fat tax\" has several pros and cons. We do not claim to be experts on economics and can view this problem mostly from a clinical doctors' perspective. The cons of such a tax abound. To start with, people may not appreciate the authorities telling them what not to eat. Second, there is no established evidence that such taxation leads to reduced calorie consumption in India. This notion that taxation of calorie-dense food can limit energy intake is probably an assumption. Consider this situation, sugar and fat are taxed, but the populations, instead of cutting down sugar and fat, continue to buy the same quantities of these macronutrients at these higher prices. It is, remember, a matter of taste, pun intended. To make ends meet, however, what if this continued sugar/fat intake comes at the cost of reducing intake of healthy, fiber-rich foods? Unlikely though this sounds, it could happen! However, in Mexico, taxation has reduced the purchase of nonessential (read: sugar and junk food) household items.[9] Another problem is that high-calorie taxation has been interpreted to mean an unhealthy Western diet. Beyond some restrictive definitions of junk food to mean pizzas and burgers, it is also instructive to consider that some Indian foods (such as, for instance, rasgullas and samosas) are equally energy dense! Finally, will this tax lead to decreased occurrence of definitive outcomes such as type 2 diabetes or obesity? Modeling studies suggest so, but actual outcome studies are lacking in India.[10] Such taxation could have benefits too. The consumption of unhealthy foods might decrease, nudging persons toward more healthy choices as they are now relatively incentivized. Fast-food restaurants may now include healthier choices. The government can earn more money from the tax, which could be allotted to health-care sector reform. However, viewing a problem from a purely Indian perspective, a sugar tax or a fat tax for all may not be the right nudge. India is a country with extreme wealth as well as poverty.[11] High rates of obesity/diabetes coexist with high rates of malnutrition as well. By imposing a nationwide sugar/fat tax, relatively wealthy populations may reduce calorie intake. However, such a taxation may make food dearer for the poor and needy. Hence, any effort at calorie taxation should be need based and targeted to populations which need the nudge. If this taxation is applicable to the poor as well, the nudge may be a push or even a shove into more hunger. This problem is being made more complex by the problem that type 2 diabetes and obesity are diseases of the relatively affluent, but they are increasing in the poor as well, with their energy intakes rapidly improving. Indeed, as India becomes wealthier, there is a danger that our problems may mimic the developed world. In the developed world, obesity and type 2 diabetes increasingly affect the poor and marginalized sectors, whereas the rich have greater access to fitness regimens and healthier, fiber-rich diets.[12] Given that our country is moving toward economic prosperity, public health policy must reflect this dynamic, changing need and be agile to catch up to the changing requirements of India. Finally, obesity is not solely a disease of diet alone and physical activity and other biological factors (such as, for instance, endocrine disruptors) too play a role – it is important that all these must be addressed.[1314] So, what's the final word? We suggest that having a sugar/fat tax for all may not be implementable. High-calorie foods being taxed for the wealthy people (including middle class) alone may be interpretable as discriminatory. In addition, it is possible that energy-dense calorie consumption may reduce only in lower income and urban households, leaving remainder populations still \"susceptible\" to junk food purchase; this was recently reported from Mexico. At present, urgent measures must focus on removing the scourge of undernutrition- and malnutrition-related deaths.[15] This clinical outcome cannot be completely delinked from economic progress. Only when India is well and truly behind the specter of malnutrition, should sugar/fat taxation be considered. Meanwhile, regulators could focus on a subsidy for healthy, nutritious, and even organic food, making it available at low cost. Simultaneously, there should be increasing awareness of a healthy lifestyle and simultaneously focus on research into the biology and prevention of obesity/type 2 diabetes. The appearance of food, the environment of eating, and the marketing of food in the media are all factors to be considered as improvable, as are proper planning of pavements and parks designed to improve physical activity. Hence, a spectrum of multifactorial intervention, of which a financial approach may be just a minor player, is the need of the hour.[16] In every challenge lies an opportunity. This is true here too. At the risk of sounding naively optimistic, we venture to suggest that the important community of endocrinologists in the country can be torchbearers in this change in the area of type 2 diabetes and obesity. By increasing awareness among public, through advocacy among policy experts and by educating general physicians and by collaborating with nutritionists, it is possible for us to make a change. Obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are among the most pressing public health problems of the day and are likely to increase with increasing economic prosperity. At the dawn of another new year, let us resolve to study, research, understand, and work on solutions to these problems that are unique to India's needs. In a spirit of collaboration, let us endocrinologists work with public health policy experts to bring forth a measurable change, or rather, a nudge toward better health of all Indians.",

Salah satu perubahan yang terjadi adalah perubahan komposisi tubuh, terutama akumulasi lemak tubuh pada remaja puteri. Dengan adanya akumulasi lemak tubuh tersebut, ada anggapan bahwa mereka tidak memiliki tubuh semenarik yang diinginkan. Hal ini akan mendorong remaja puteri mencari jalan keluar agar memiliki tampilan fisik yang ideal, salah satunya adalah dengan melakukan perubahan kebiasaan makan yang umumnya menyimpang. Kebiasaan makan yang tidak benar itu dapat mengakibatkan terjadinya gangguan makan atau eating disorder yang dapat berdampak buruk bagi remaja. Eating disorders (ED) merupakan gangguan mental yang meskipun berhubungan dengan pola makan dan berat badan, gangguan tersebut bukanlah mengenai makanan, tetapi mengenai perasaan dan ekspresi diri. Pada umumnya, penderita ED adalah mereka yang memiliki kepercayaan diri rendah. Terdapat dua macam ED, yaitu anorexia nervosa dan bulimia nervosa. Kedua gangguan tersebut mempunyai tujuan yang sama, yaitu menguruskan badan. ABSTRACTAdolescence is a time of dramatic change in a person. One of the changes that occur are changes in body composition, especially the accumulation of body fat in girls. Given the accumulation of body fat, there is the assumption that they do not have a body as attractive as desired. This will encourage the girls find a way out in order to have the ideal physical appearance, one is to change eating habits are generally distorted. Improper eating habits can result in eating disorders or disordered eating can be bad for teens. Eating disorders (ED) is a mental disorder even though associated with diet and weight, the disorder is not about food, but about feelings and self-expression. In general, patients with ED are those who have low confidence. There are two kinds of ED, namely anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Both of these disorders have the same goal, which is to lose weight.",

One is that they are all overweight because they are so inert and watch television or videos the whole time; the other that they are all on the verge of anorexia. Because this is a time of rapid growth, the calorie needs of those in their teens are indeed greater than at other times of life. Teenagers do eat more food. Most have an appetite that is somewhere between healthy and ravenous. Further, as we shall see, many teenagers, especially girls, are distressed about their appearance and are trying to do something about it. They are either embarking on a diet, actually dieting, or have just given up on a diet. But in fact about four in every five of them are a perfectly healthy weight, neither overnor underweight and, contrary to media reports, most are in no danger either of anorexia or obesity.",

Impoverished patients nearly all complain that they cannot afford to eat a reducing diet. They find it almost impossible to restrict cheap and accessible foods like bread and beans to the small portions which will allow them to lose weight. The foods with less caloric value, like vegetables, fruits, and meats, they find too expensive, although these might give the desired satisfaction of appetite, if eaten. Obviously, all obesity is due directly to eating more food than the body needs for maintenance and operation. The excess is stored as fat, very little being wasted in stools (1). Why is it that some persons find it difficult not to eat more than they need? more than they need? Why do some get fat on an amount of food which would cause others to lose weight? The second question is the easier, and may be answered simply by saying that the natural energy requirements of those who eat small amounts are less because of less, or more efficient, activity, and a more phlegmatic temperament.",

      "abstract": "Since obesity has been a crucial issue regarding children’s health in Korea, numerous studies have been conducted. However, it is difficult to locate studies that can help researchers and/or medical professionals who want to study behavioral differences between obese and normal weight (non-obese) children. The collected literature about obese childrens behaviors were accumulated by performing ‘key word’ searches from several web engines: ‘obesity’ ‘children obesity’ ‘behavior’ ‘habit’ ‘eating behavior or habit’ ‘exercise’ ‘physical activity’ and ‘daily behavior’. The information was extracted and the behaviors were reviewed utilizing 30 papers that revealed any differences from normal weight children with at least p .05 level of significance. According to those studies, the obese children tended to skip meals more often as a method of losing weight. They also have an increased appetite, eat larger portions and rarely leave food on their plates. The obese children prefer to eat high fat, high calorie foods and eat faster than their normal weight counterparts. Also, the children usually eat alone and eat at irregular meal times. Beside the behaviors related to the standard three meals a day, obese children have high preferences for snacking. The children reported that with pocket money they usually eat certain types of snacks without parent approval. The children stated that they exercise more on a regular basis. However, when asked about their participation they were not likely to engage actively. Meanwhile, they tend to spend free time doing sedentary activities such as watching TV or playing on the computer. Since these studies used self -reported questionnaires with a small sample, size there may be difficulty in forming a basis about obese children’s behaviors. Nevertheless, these findings are in accordance with other studies conducted in local as well as western countries. In conclusion, obese children have different daily behaviors or routines from normal weight children. It is recommended that altering these behavioral patterns to match those of normal weight children should be encouraged. (Korean J Community Nutrition 13(3) : 386~395, 2008)",

      "title": "The Negative Impact of Food Neophobia on the People of Chandigarh Tri-City, India",
      "abstract": "Food neophobia (FN) is the person’s fear to try eating new or unfamiliar foods. Food neophobia is directly attached with low quality of diet in adults; thus, the understanding of the relationship between FN and food consumption in more depth appears to be a key issue [1]. There are various factors that influence this eating behaviour of a person such as fear, taste, unwillingness, bad experience and lack of knowledge etc. The level of food neophobia generally decreases with late childhood to adult and increases with adult to old age.\r\nThrough the demographical influences or the inherited properties of the individual food neophobia can be displaced.  At some point of time in our life we all have said no to some particular food item because of our liking or disliking. Sometimes we do not eat some food due to the fear of trying a new food. A bad experience with a particular food may become the reason with some people not trying new food; similarly, lack of knowledge about different foods has been a factor that many people avoid trying a new food. There may be many other reasons for people to avoid or not trying new food. These eating behaviours of people leave them from getting proper nutrition that they need. Because they have restricted them to limited types of food, they may not be eating enough vitamins or nutrients. It’s been observed that neophobia can not only lead to malnutrition, but it also refrain the individual from social abilities. Food neophobia also restricts the individual from taking the healthier alternative of the food and also restricts in trying the new or traditional food items [2] [3].\r\nThe aim of the study was to access the relationship between food neophobia with demographic factors, and education in adults living in urban versus rural areas. This research has been conducted in the Tri-city, Punjab India. Primary data was collected from urban, suburban and rural areas through Google forms, print questionnaires and personal interviews. The questionnaire used in the study indicates the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS), the gender based choices, questions regarding food choice based on demographic factors like gender, age and income, questions on eating behavior and the different eating habits in relation to urban and rural. Data were collected via questionnaire. Total 600 people of age groups (30-45 years & 46 – 60 years) among diversified population of tri-city, Chandigarh, Panchkula & Mohali were given the questionnaires to fill-up.  441 useful responses were received which includes 246 responses from females and 195 responses from males.\r\nThe questionnaire was designed in such manner that it captures data regarding age and gender under demography, and education among people residing in rural as well as urban areas of the tri-city.\r\nThis research will give a insight about the malnutrition due to food neophobia specially in females, we found that geographical location plays an important role and the type of food preferred by urban and rural and the outcomes due to eating habits. This study will give an insight about the eating habits in relation to income and expenditure. We found that food neophobia strongly influence the variables selected for the study. Overall, the results suggest that food neophobia is an important barrier to dietary change and addressing diet-related health problems.  Actions focusing on alternate food choices may help to reduce the neophobia in adults thus increase the chances of maintaining the nutritious diet. Certain theoretical and practical implications in relation to food consumption and food neophobia are offered. Further research is recommended to confirm the observed relationships under different socio-cultural conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The prevalence of eating alone and individuals’ thoughts, feelings, and behavior when doing so is discussed. Such data as are available indicate that adults do a fair amount of it, while young people eat alone much less frequently. Commensal eating is deeply embedded in cultural consciousness and eating alone is an anomalous behavior. For most people a solitary meal is a highly undesirable situation and often is not considered to be a meal at all. Although individuals typically eat less when they eat alone than they do when they eat with others, for some people, eating alone provides an opportunity to escape public scrutiny and to eat as much as desired. Finally, eating alone is associated with negative nutritional outcomes in both the young and the old.",

      "title": "Alcohol and Breastfeeding, a review of the issues",
      "abstract": "Moderate alcohol use by breastfeeding women appears to be relatively common. Alcohol concentrates in breast milk at levels slightly higher than in maternal blood, peaking at 30-60 minutes after consumption. Most studies find no link with the duration of breastfeeding unless drinking is fairly heavy (&gt;2 standard drinks/day). However, seven studies have found that moderate maternal alcohol consumption was associated with a shorter duration of exclusive breastfeeding; one found no difference and one found an increase. Alcohol affects oxytocin release, leading to reductions in breast milk consumption in the following hours. Infant alcohol exposure may increase fussiness and reduce sleep, both temporary if the mother does not continue to drink. These effects on the infant and on the breastfeeding process could be interpreted by mothers as signs of infant dissatisfaction with their breast milk, “insufficient milk,” or other commonly expressed causes for suboptimal breastfeeding patterns. Chronic alcohol consumption, even if moderate, may have a number of more serious effects, including on infant development. In the early weeks or months of life, infant toleration of alcohol is lower than it is at later stages of infancy, and the early breastfeeding process is more susceptible to disruption. Therefore, it may be wise to advise mothers to continue their abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy into the first few months of breastfeeding. Little research has been done on how often women time their drinking so as to avoid infant exposure to alcohol. Health workers and others sometimes propagate myths that alcohol, especially alcoholic beer, is beneficial to breastfeeding. Research is needed in different cultures into whether various forms of cautionary messages are likely to discourage moderate drinkers from initiating breastfeeding or to shorten its duration, and which type of messages if any actually lead to a reduction in drinking during breastfeeding.",

      "abstract": "Figure: viscous lidocaine, medication, gastrointestinalFigureOne of my pharmacology professors in medical school often quipped, “Physicians would think twice about giving certain dubious medications if they sampled them themselves.” There is no better example of this than viscous lidocaine. It might be one of the most foul-tasting medications ever invented. Ask the nurses. Many have sampled of this sour sludge that tastes like expired lemonade with the consistency of runny syrup. Patients agree that it tastes awful. Indeed, patient satisfaction after receiving a GI cocktail is lower when lidocaine is given. (Acad Emerg Med. 2020;27[9]:905; https://bit.ly/3nq0teM.) It's not just the taste. Lidocaine does not add to the success of the GI cocktail, and you should not be giving it routinely. Dyspepsia is a common symptom encountered in the ED. Classically, it's a mix of epigastric pain, nausea, and bloating. Dyspeptic symptoms are also frequently described as abdominal discomfort relieved by food or antacids, worse at night or during recumbency, or associated with a previous diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal reflux. Emergency physicians routinely give GI cocktails to patients to relieve symptoms. What's fascinating is the variety of contents in these cocktails. Many clinicians have their own preferred mixes to give to patients. Some contain antihistamines; others contain simethicone. Liquid combinations of antacids containing calcium carbonate and magnesium-hydroxide (Mylanta) or aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone (Maalox) are commonly given. The Donnatal elixir contains phenobarbital, hyoscyamine, atropine, and scopolamine. (UpToDate. Nov. 29, 2001; https://bit.ly/3GAfaEC.) It sounds like an M&M case waiting to happen. Nail in the Coffin Viscous lidocaine has been the most studied alongside Mylanta and Maalox. One of the reasons it became popular was an initial randomized controlled trial from 1990 with 34 adult patients that used a visual analog pain scale to compare pain responses after giving 30 mL of antacid (Mylanta) with or without 15 mL viscous lidocaine. They found that lidocaine decreased pain scores compared with antacid alone, but the study did not address any limitations. (UpToDate. Nov. 29, 2001; https://bit.ly/3GAfaEC.) Those positive results have not been replicated since this initial study, however. Two more randomized controlled trials have been performed (one with 82 patients, another with 113), and neither found that adding viscous lidocaine favorably reduced pain scores v. antacid alone. (J Emerg Med. 2004;27[1]:7; J Emerg Med. 2003;25[3]:239.) The nail in the coffin came in 2020 when another randomized controlled trial found no difference in pain scores. Patients also did not like the taste of lidocaine even 60 minutes post-administration. (Acad Emerg Med. 2020;27[9]:905; https://bit.ly/3nq0teM.) The literature, albeit modest evidence from small studies, demonstrates that lidocaine does not reduce patients' symptoms. And most patients (and staff) believe it tastes awful.

Eating lots uncontrollably, which is called binge eating, may cause feelings of shame afterwards. Binge eating involves both eating a lot within a short time and not being able to stop eating although you want to. Binge eating may result in eating disorders, which often develop in adolescence. Are some symptoms of binge eating more common than others? Why do some teenagers develop them while others do not? We discovered that 12.6% of teenagers experienced binge eating symptoms, with loss-of-control eating being the most common symptom. We found that teenagers who reported binge eating symptoms were also more likely to have more emotional and behavioral problems, be more dissatisfied with their bodies, eat more in response to negative emotions, eat less because of their weight, and have a higher body weight.",

Regular use of intense sweeteners might therefore lead to a paradoxical weight gain. These alarmist reports have not been confirmed by recent experimental data. There is no evidence that the addition of an intense sweetener to a plain stimulus promotes appetite or results in increased food consumption during some later meal. While replacing sugars with intense sweeteners (with attendant decrease in energy) has been said to result in energy compensation, published studies have variously reported perfect compensation, partial compensation, or no compensation at all, depending on the conditions used. Longer-term studies are needed to assess chronic effects of intense sweeteners on dietary compliance and the control of body weight.",

Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than 24 hours. Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache, drowsiness, concentration problems, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea), absence of hunger, light sensitivity, depression, sweating, nausea, hyperexcitability, irritability, and anxiety. Hangovers are rough. And the more you drink the night before, the more severe your hangover symptoms might feel the morning after. Most of the time you just need to drink water, eat some food, and walk it off. But if you’ve had too much to drink, you may be harming your body and need to see your doctor for treatment. Let’s look at how to tell the difference between a mild, temporary hangover that you can treat at home and one that may need some extra medical attention. Each of these 10 common symptoms stems from a physiological response to the presence of alcohol in your digestive and urinary systems, especially your stomach, kidneys, and bloodstream.",

      "abstract": "Rates of childhood obesity have increased greatly in the past 3 decades. [1] Although the causes of this trend are multifaceted, there is growing evidence that food commercials are a major contributor. [2] Food consumption can be activated by salient environmental cues in an automatic and difficult to control way. [3] Content analyses reveal that the majority of food products promoted are energy-dense and high in fat, sugar, and/ or salt, which is in sharp contrast to (inter)national dietary guidelines. [2]Cue reactivity theory states that food cues induce craving for food and actual eating behavior owing to the presence of sensory inputs associated with past consumption. [4,5] The sight, smell, or thought of tasty food induces appetite, and insuffcient inhibitory control causes failure in inhibition, leading to increased food intake. [6,7] Impaired behavioral inhibition (ie, impulsivity) might make it more diffi cult for children to resist the temptation of energy-dense food. [8,9] Impulsivity is generally defi ned as the tendency to control, think, and plan insuffi ciently. [10] Two aspects ofimpulsivity can be distinguished: insuffi cient inhibitory behavioral control and reward sensitivity or the inability to delay reward. [11] Being able to control impulsive behaviors can be an important explanation for the individual susceptibility to food advertisements, but this has not been examined before.",

Weaning from the breast is the process of retiring the breast, which can be abrupt or gradual. In the former, it may be called complete weaning because the breast has been completely retired. Weaning foods are considered those that are used during the transitional period which is started with complementing breast-feeding, or formula with semi-solids or solids, and which finishes when the child receives a completely tablefood diet. The most important reason for the introduction of beikost in the infant diet is nutritional. The infant fed by the breast, or with infant formula, reaches a point at which his energy requirements are not being met. An interesting question is that of knowing the reasons why mothers start weaning, sometimes very early.",

      "title": "Toward a Psychosociology of Contemporary Food Consumption",
      "abstract": "The inhabitants of the United States consume almost twice as much sugar as the \nFrench. 1 Such a fact is usually a concern of economics and politics. But this is by no \nmeans all. One needs only to take the step from sugar as merchandise, an abstract item \nin accounts, to sugar as food, a concrete item that is “eaten” rather than “consumed,” \nto get an inkling of the (probably unexplored) depth of the phenomenon. For the \nAmericans must do something with all that sugar. And as a matter of fact, anyone who \nhas spent time in the United States knows that sugar permeates a considerable part of \nAmerican cooking; that it saturates ordinarily sweet foods, such as pastries; makes for \na great variety of sweets served, such as ice creams, jellies, syrups; and is used in many \ndishes that French people do not sweeten, such as meats, ﬁ sh, salads, and relishes. This \nis something that would be of interest to scholars in ﬁ elds other than economics, to \nthe psychosociologist, for example, who will have something to say about the presumably invariable relation between standard of living and sugar consumption. (But is \nthis relation really invariable today? And if so, why?) 2 It could be of interest to the \nhistorian also, who might ﬁ nd it worthwhile to study the ways in which the use of \nsugar evolved as part of American culture (the inﬂ uence of Dutch and German immigrants who were used to “sweet-salty” cooking?). Nor is this all. Sugar is not just a \nfoodstuff, even when it is used in conjunction with other foods; it is, if you will, an \n“attitude,” bound to certain usages, certain “protocols,” that have to do with more \nthan food. Serving a sweet relish or drinking a Coca-Cola with a meal are things that \nare conﬁ ned to eating habits proper; but to go regularly to a dairy bar, where the \nabsence of alcohol coincides with a great abundance of sweet beverages, means more \nthan to consume sugar; through the sugar, it also means to experience the day, periods \nof rest, traveling, and leisure in a speciﬁ c fashion that is certain to have its impact on \nthe American. For who would claim that in France wine is only wine? Sugar or wine, \nthese two superabundant substances are also institutions. And these institutions necessarily imply a set of images, dreams, tastes, choices, and values. I remember an \nAmerican hit song: Sugar Time . Sugar is a time, a category of the world. 3I have started out with the example of the American use of sugar because it permits \nus to get outside of what we, as Frenchmen, consider “obvious.” For we do not \nsee our own food or, worse, we assume that it is insigniﬁ cant. Even-or perhaps*Originally published 1961especially-to the scholar, the subject of food connotes triviality or guilt. 4 This may \nexplain in part why the psychosociology of French eating habits is still approached \nonly indirectly and in passing when more weighty subjects, such as life-styles, budgets, and advertising, are under discussion. But at least the sociologists, the historians \nof the present-since we are talking only about contemporary eating habits hereand the economists are already aware that there is such a thing.",

      "abstract": "Drinking alcohol-containing beverages is a common habit in Western countries. In most Western societies, at least 90% of people consume alcohol at some time during their lives, and 30% or more of drinkers develop alcohol-related life problems.1 Severe alcohol-related life impairment, alcohol dependence, is observed at some time during their lives in ∼10% of men and 3–5% of women, with an additional 5–10% of each sex developing persistent but less intense problems that are diagnosed as abuse.1\n\nIndividuals with alcohol abuse are not dependent on alcohol, but have repeated legal, interpersonal, social, or occupational impairments related to alcohol consumption.1,,2 They frequently use alcohol in physically hazardous situations. If individuals with alcohol abuse continue to drink, they may go on to develop alcohol dependence. Alcohol dependence is characterized by tolerance (a need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve desired effect and/or markedly diminished effect with the continued use of the same amount of alcohol), and a withdrawal syndrome when alcohol is discontinued or intake is decreased. Alcohol-dependent individuals often spend a great deal of time using alcohol, and return to use despite evidence of physical and psychological problems. Alcohol abuse and dependence are commonly called alcoholism.\n\nDepression and alcoholism are associated with considerable morbidity, disability, and mortality, and co-occur more commonly than expected by chance.3–,8 The extent of comorbidity between depression and alcoholism was demonstrated by the results of several large epidemiological studies.3–,7 The National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a nationally representative survey in the US, found that compared with non-depressed respondents in the NCS, the lifetime odds of alcohol dependence were significantly elevated for both men (2.95) and women (4.05) with major depression.7 Conversely, NCS data demonstrated a two-fold increase …",

      "abstract": "The holiday season, the time from Thanksgiving to New Year’s Day, is a period filled with many joyous occasions, including family, friends and food. However, one must also consider the negatives that come along with these moments. Family feuds, financial difficulties and personal issues tend to heighten during the holiday season. For the average person, this provides an abnormal amount of stress. However, for someone suffering from an eating disorder, the holiday season is more difficult than one can imagine. With about thirty million people battling an eating disorder in their lifetime, it is important to remember the ongoing fight these people deal with, especially during Thanksgiving and Christmas. While the holidays prove to be difficult for many people, it can be concluded that the holiday season tends to have a more considerable effect on those suffering from eating disorders, due to the significant emphasis on food and elevated levels of stress.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Do subtle cues for imposed healthy eating make consumers hungry? Imposed healthy eating signals that the health goal was sufficiently met, and thus it increases the strength of the conflicting motive to fulfill one’s appetite. Accordingly, consumers asked to sample an item framed as healthy later reported being hungrier and consumed more food than those who sampled the same item framed as tasty or those who did not eat at all. These effects of healthy eating depend on the consumer’s perception that healthy eating is mandatory; therefore, only imposed healthy eating made consumers hungrier, whereas freely choosing to eat healthy did not increase hunger.",

Divers facteurs non alimentaires présents dans l’environnement sont aussi des modulateurs de la prise alimentaire. En particulier, différentes sources de distraction (télévision, entre autres) sont susceptibles de faire augmenter la consommation, toutes choses étant égales par ailleurs. Certaines personnes qui limitent leur consommation pour contrôler leur poids pourraient être plus vulnérables que d’autres aux stimulations émanant de l’environnement. La prise alimentaire est donc sous l’inﬂuence d’une multitude de facteurs dont il faut prendre conscience lorsque l’on veut maîtriser sa consommation.",

How can a physician help such a patient overcome his psychological need for smoking? My observations show that, when a heavy smoker is not smoking, he often unconsciously hypoventilates to a marked degree (Syndrome of Spontaneous Hypoventilation, Mississippi Valley M.

Bei den Behandlungsmöglichkeiten werden vor allem Strategien der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie beschrieben, für die die meisten Wirksamkeitsbelege vorliegen. In der Behandlung lernen die Betroffenen, einen strukturierten Ernährungsplan umzusetzen, eventuell vorhandene Unzufriedenheiten mit ihrer Figur und ihrem Gewicht zu überwinden sowie Stress- und Konfliktsituationen erfolgreich zu meistern, ohne sich durch Essanfälle abzulenken oder durch Essanfälle innere Anspannung abzubauen.

Appointments, previsit lab draws, and preventative health tasks (quarterly diabetes visits, yearly ophthamological referral) were often forgotten. Medication Reminders. Patients desire reminders for medication refills, and for taking medicines at certain times of the day. Medication Dosage Changes. Patients benefit from follow up on medicine changes, as they may become noncompliant and not tell the team. Medication Dosing Clarification. Patients sometimes misdose due to communication errors (e.g. once a interpreted as 11 tablets a day) or space medication doses improperly. Blood Glucose Testing Reinforcement. Patients forget agreements with their provider to check their blood sugar at certain times of the day. Meal Time Reinforcement. Some patients have difficulty remembering meal and snack times. Exercise Reinforcement. Patients desire reminders up to twice a day to make time for the activities they enjoy (walks, Tai Chi, etc). Dietary Reinforcement. Some patients desire reinforcement to eat less, to decrease soft drink and/or juice consumption, to eat healthier, or to drink more water. General Information. Patients desire timely access to health care information, including lab results, medication recalls, preventative health information (influenza vaccination reminders), and availability of new medications/devices for diabetes management. Discussion Patients in the pilot study enjoyed receiving messages. We learned that: Messages should be coalesced if tenmorally close. Patients preferred a single message for all tasks to be performed within a 30 minute block. Communications should be customized. Patients do not need reminders for what they already do. Monitoring patient responses is important. The system should be able to identify critical responses, so that actions can be taken quickly. Constant reminders train patients. Patients start predicting when the pages will come, and they remember what they need to do. Wireless technology is not ubiquitous. This intervention can only be used where wireless service is provided reliably. Reliability is important.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT It was suggested that the ingestion of extra calories towards the end of or shortly after a meal might be especially fattening. That hypothesis was based on the intuition that mixing of the sugared drink and accompaniments while the stomach was emptying rapidly would delay the release of hunger less than the same intake in the hour before the next meal. This paper presents an examination of that mechanism by calculating the time course of gastric emptying with extra intake at different times after the meal. The output from these simulations confirmed that early further energy would delay the end of emptying less than later. However, within the parameters tested, the effect is not large. Fattening effects of calories after meals could arise by a variety of mechanisms that remain to be tested without disrupting daily life. “Highlights” Extra intake may be more fattening shortly after meals than later. That proposal was supported by theoretical calculations of gastric emptying. Hence the timing of energy intake well before a meal seems critical to its effect on weight. The eater’s own concepts of meal, snacks and drinks are key to research on weight control.",

Children/adolescents with autistic spectrum disorders may have a very limited food repertoire, only eating a very few selected foods. Some children with Asperger's report little appetite and no hunger and consequently may eat little. The chapter discusses the causes of poor feeding in the older child. Children with food neophobia eat only a very limited diet, often only dry foods and very little fruits or vegetables. Encouraging playing with food, other messy play and regular times outside of meal to try new foods may be of benefit.",

The first route to overeating involves infractions of restrictive intake norms: people who attempt to restrict their intake by implementing dietary rules often run afoul of disinhibitory circumstances that undermine the self-control upon which successful dieting depends. The second route to overeating involves adherence to restrictive intake norms in situations where it is unclear how much eating is permitted. People search the environment for indicants of what constitutes permissible intake and end up relying on such arbitrary criteria as portion size and the intake of other people. Using such criteria derived from the eating situation often leads to overeating even while individuals believe that they are successfully restricting their intake.",

Within one week most babies can take four ounces at each feeding; provided, that the interval between feedings is three hours or longer.

      "title": "Control of Food Intake in the Obese",
      "abstract": "Abstract Food intake (eating) is a form of behavior that is subject to conscious control. In practice, many obese and weight‐gaining individuals claim that their eating is out of (their) control. Mechanistic models describe the interplay of biological and environmental forces that control food intake. However, because human food intake is characterized by individuals intervening to adjust their own patterns of behavior, food intake should reflect interactions among biology, environment, and attempted self‐imposed control of behavior. In general, humans display a system of weight regulation that is asymmetrical—a reduction in body weight is strongly defended but weight gain is not. The body seems to tolerate a positive energy balance. There is no mechanism that can detect a positive energy balance per se or that can implement a sufficiently strong correction to behavior to maintain body weight in an environment that promotes consumption. The evolutionary process has favored biological traits associated with preferences for high energy density (sweet and/or fatty) energy‐yielding foods. The control of food intake in obese or weight‐gaining individuals may display various risk factors that favor an increase in energy. These include the preference for high energy‐dense over low energy‐dense foods, weak postprandial inhibitory signaling, strong hunger traits associated with low leptin levels after weight loss, and the consumption of fatty foods. In addition, many individuals (up to 47% of some samples) display binge eating patterns, whereas ∼16% show either night eating or nocturnal eating. Because energy expenditure is only loosely coupled to energy intake, sedentariness does not down‐regulate food intake.",

      "title": "The role of energy density",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dietary energy density (ED) appears to have a major influence on the regulation of food intake and body weight. If people consume a fixed weight of food each day, then high‐ED diets should be associated with high energy intakes and with overweight. In contrast, low‐ED diets should result in lower daily energy intakes and therefore weight loss. For this approach to work, low‐ED foods must be as palatable as high‐ED foods and, calorie for calorie, have a greater satiating power. Each of those assumptions is debatable. Dietary ED depends chiefly on the water content of foods. As a rule, high‐ED foods are more palatable but less satiating, whereas low‐ED foods are more satiating but less palatable. Consumer preferences for high‐ED foods can be explained in terms of good taste, low cost, and convenience. Low‐ED foods, such as fresh produce, provide less energy per unit cost than do high‐ED foods, which often contain added sugars and fats. Poverty and obesity may well be linked through the habitual consumption of a low‐cost, high‐ED diet.",

Garrow has made an analogy with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in quantum mechanics. If you try to estimate the position of a particle precisely, it is not possible to measure its velocity with the same degree of accuracy, and vice versa; if you precisely measure its velocity you can be less certain about its exact position. The same is true of food intake; you cannot measure habitual behaviour accurately. You either have to measure habitual behaviour with a high degree of inaccuracy or make accurate measurements of food intake which may interfere with habitual behaviour. Any system which purports to be non‐invasive and does not disturb the subjects' lifestyle will be prone to errors of memory, recording or judgement of portion size and content.",

      "title": "Managing Your Weight through General Semantics",
      "abstract": "In an affluent society, eating has little to do with survival. We eat to symbolize. Well, perhaps we eat for diverse reasons. However, like fish in water, we humans live so immersed in symbolism we can hardly tell where symbolism stops and something else begins. In seeking a weight-management strategy, I began asking: How does food-related symbolism influence our eating habits? This story begins on March 21, 1993, when I weighed myself and wrote down the reading. hideous number disgorged by my squeaking spring scale only confirmed what my clothes had long told me. I had accumulated far too much of myself. Five feet six in height, I weighed 187 pounds. I'd dabbled in diets for years without long-term success and I'd begun to think I could never keep my weight down. In recent years, weight-related physical problems had made themselves felt with a vengeance, yet keeping my weight down had so far proved impossible. What could I do? word diet implies short-term effort. To achieve lasting weight loss, I needed a long-term behavioral change, a switch to eating habits that I could live with. I generally rebel against ritualized exercise, taboos on foods I love, or feeling guilty about eating, so I needed a strategy that would help me to control my weight without feeling guilty, punished, or deprived. I believe that general semantics can help us select and achieve ordinary goals that lead to happier, healthier lives. Could I use general semantics formulations and techniques to effect long-term weight management? Could I thereby avoid weight-related health problems, and improve my day-to-day functioning so that I stopped feeling so bad? I discovered that I could. Using general-semantics principles to produce behavioral change, in 21 months I lost 21 pounds, and I have kept the weight off. As you will see in my record of weight change in the table on page 72, I didn't lose weight steadily. In fact, one measurement showed an increase in weight. (Note that I did not record my weight every month, and I do not show every measurement here.) In the long term, however, I modified some of my dysfunctional assumptions and thereby changed the eating behaviors that arose from those assumptions. Weighing less, I had a significant reduction in chronic back pain (caused by disk deterioration), my energy levels became more stable, I felt lighter, more limber, more in control, more optimistic. I owe a debt to those who've formulated and disseminated general semantics because general semantics helped me do what I had previously deemed impossible. Defining the Problem In general semantics, we try to develop awareness of differences between higher abstractions and specific descriptions. Would a description of the problem help me solve it? If little else, would a list of negative details reinforce my mo- tivation for positive change? In terms of motivation, I needed all the help I could get. Weight-related Problems * Exacerbation of back pain. * Stiffness, joint and muscle ache. Difficulty bending to pick up something from the floor, etc. * Low self-esteem. * Guilt. * Worry about health. * Feeling of out of control. * Depressed over having no willpower. * Fatigue. Loss of energy. The blahs. * Clothes don't fit. * Ugly appearance due to bulges of fat and potbelly. Whatever Happens, Eat Reflecting on my eating habits, I concluded that I had a single unconditional response to almost any situation. My logic went something like this: If I feel: worried...} happy...} sad... humiliated...} excited...} depressed...} nervous...} ...then eat weak...} scared...} pleased...} guilty...} joyful...} etc...} My one premise acknowledged no alternatives; it said whatever happens, eat. In so behaving, I'd ignored a unique characteristic that makes us human. Unlike animals controlled by hardwired instincts, we humans have the power to choose our acts according to circumstances. …",

      "abstract": "Ne samo sto jedemo, nego koliko i kad, utjece na posljedice prehrane na zdravlje. Stoga postoji jasan konsenzus da suvremene prehrambene navike, posebice u kombinaciji sa sedentarnim nacinom života, podrazumijevaju povecan unos kalorija i to u svako doba dana, pa i noci, uzrokujuci debljinu i bolesti metabolizma. Brojna istraživanja su pokazala da ogranicen unos kalorija pridonosi zdravlju i stiti od raznih bolesti. Sukladno tome, u posljednjih par godina, povremeni post je dobio puno pažnje zbog svoje ucinkovitosti pri mrsavljenju, a i opcenito doprinosa zdravlju. Post nije novi koncept prehrane, ljudi ga koriste tisucama godina. Povremeni post (eng. intermittent fasting) je samo „rebrendiranje― necega sto ljudi vec odavno rade. Nase tijelo uđe u stanje posta svaki put kad spavamo, neki ljudi poste a da to ni ne znaju. Izbacivanje dorucka je oblik posta i nase tijelo je apsolutno sposobno to izdržati. Post nije izgladnjivanje, vec kad postimo nase tijelo koristi spremljene nutrijente i energetske oblike da bi omogucilo tijelu da nastavi normalno funkcionirati. Kad se izgladnjujemo, ponestaje nam tih izvora energije i dolazi do propadanja vitalnih organa. Kada govorimo o postu, najcesce govorimo o postu u kojem je konzumiranje vode dozvoljeno, a nije dozvoljeno konzumiranje hrane ni pica koja imaju kalorije i zaslađivace. Izraz povremeni post se odnosi na vremenski ograniceno vrijeme jedenja, sto znaci da svaki dan jedemo obroke u određenim vremenskim intervalima. Vecina ljudi se bez ikakvog napora drži otprilike 14/10 (sto znaci da ce kroz 14 sati u danu jesti, dok ce postiti 10 sati u danu, najcesce dok spavaju). Period jedenja može biti prilagođen potrebama pojedinca. Povremeni post nam pomaže u gubljenju kilograma time sto dovodi do povecanja hormona rasta i smanjenja razine inzulina u tijelu. Nadalje, zbog preskakanja obroka, vrlo je vjerojatno da cemo kroz tjedan unijeti manju kolicinu kalorija. U ovom radu bit ce opisano sto je tocno povremeni post, smjernice i funkcija posta te koje sve vrste posta postoje. Također, bit ce detaljnije objasnjeno kako post utjece na gubljenje kilograma, koje su koristi posta za zdravlje te prednosti i nedostaci.",

Consumers initiate eating behavior in response to a number of factors including time of day, food availability, and hunger. The present research examines whether feeling hungry might reflect a time at which it is relatively healthy for individuals to initiate eating. Specifically, the present research examines whether differences in hunger predict differences in an important health measure, namely, postmeal blood glucose. The results show that post-meal blood glucose is highest when people are not at all hungry and relatively lower when people are moderately hungry or very hungry. When people are very hungry, postmeal glucose is not lower and possibly slightly higher than when people are moderately hungry. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, from a health standpoint, it is beneficial to eat when moderately hungry.",

En general, al pensar en este colectivo, se centra la atencion en la ingesta energetica y en la necesidad de conseguir que sea inferior al gasto para lograr una reduccion de peso. Sin embargo, los individuos con exceso de peso tienen deficiencias mas frecuentes que los de peso normal por el seguimiento de dietas hipocaloricas poco controladas, y porque sus habitos alimentarios suelen ser menos correctos (con menor consumo de verduras, frutas, cereales, legumbres y lacteos), que los de individuos con peso normal. Pero ademas el exceso de peso se asocia con mayores necesidades de diversos nutrientes, como consecuencia las deficiencias de vitaminas (antioxidantes, acido folico, vitamina D) y minerales (hierro, calcio, zinc) en estos sujetos son mas frecuentes, que en individuos de peso normal, y contribuyen a perjudicar la salud e incluso a dificultar el conseguir un buen control de peso corporal. Se pone de relieve la especial necesidad de vigilar/corregir carencias nutricionales en personas con sobrepeso/obesidad.",

      "title": "Development of food acceptance patterns in the first years of life",
      "abstract": "As young omnivores, children make the transition from the exclusive milk diet of infancy to consuming a variety of foods. They must learn to accept a set of the foods available in their environmental niche, and they 'come equipped' with a set of predispositions that facilitate the development of food acceptance patterns, constrained by predisposition and limited by what is offered to them. While children are predisposed to like sweet or salty foods and to avoid sour or bitter foods, their preferences for the majority of foods are shaped by repeated experience. The predispositions that shape food acceptance patterns also include neophobia and the predisposition to learn to prefer and accept new foods when they are offered repeatedly. In addition, the predisposition for associative conditioning affects children's developing food acceptance patterns, resulting in preferences for foods offered in positive contexts, while foods presented in negative contexts will become more disliked via the learning of associations with the social and environmental contexts. Children also learn to prefer energy-dense foods when consumption of those foods is followed by positive post-ingestive consequences, such as those produced when high-energy-density foods are eaten when hungry. Although children are predisposed to be responsive to the energy content of foods in controlling their intake, they are also responsive to parents' control attempts. We have seen that these parental control attempts can refocus the child away from responsiveness to internal cues of hunger and satiety and towards external factors such as the presence of palatable foods. This analysis suggests that taking a closer look at what children are learning about food and eating may provide clues regarding the formation of children's food acceptance patterns, and that this approach also suggests potential causative factors implicated in the aetiology of obesity and the emergence of weight concerns. Current data, although limited, suggest that child-feeding practices play a causal role in the development of individual difference in the controls of food intake, and perhaps in the aetiology of problems of energy balance, especially childhood obesity. These relationships should be pursued in future research.",

In other words, given a free choice we are generally discriminative and select those foods and drinks which give us most pleasure. However, we must also recognise that the majority of us try to live our lives with the least effort and as discrimination involves effort it is not surprising that a large majority of consumers approach the selection and appreciation of food at best subconsciously or even, with the ever increasing pressures of today, unconsciously.",

      "title": "Natural Addiction",
      "abstract": "The distinction between natural addiction and drug addiction is interesting from many points of view, including scientific and medical perspectives. \"Natural addictions\" are those based on activation of a physiobehavioral system, such as the one that controls metabolism, foraging, and eating to achieve energy balance. \"Drug addictions\" activate many systems based on their pharmacology. This review discusses the following questions: (1) When does food produce a natural addiction? Sugar causes signs of addiction if the scheduling conditions are appropriate to cause binge eating. (2) Why does addictive-like behavior result? Bingeing on a 10% sucrose solution repeatedly releases dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, and it delays the release of acetylcholine, thereby postponing satiety. Opioid involvement is shown by withdrawal caused by naloxone or food deprivation. Bingeing, withdrawal, and abstinence-induced motivation are described as the basis for a vicious cycle leading to excessive eating. (3) Which foods can lead to natural addiction? A variety of sugars, saccharin, and sham feeding are compared with bingeing on high-fat diets, which seem to lack sugar's opioid-withdrawal characteristic. (4) How does natural food addiction relate to obesity? Low basal dopamine may be a common factor, leading to \"eating for dopamine.\" (5) In a neural model, the accumbens is depicted as having separate GABA output pathways for approach and avoidance, both controlled by dopamine and acetylcholine. These outputs, in turn, control lateral hypothalamic glutamate release, which starts a meal, and GABA release, which stops it.",

This activity is quite evident at my university at around 4:00 P.M., the time that many people experience an afternoon slump in energy but when their demanding schedules are still stressful. The local snack area is filled with students eating muffins, cookies, ice cream, or any other foods they feel will give them a lift. I suspect that if we could observe these same people for the rest of the day, this snacking pattern would hold at other low-energy times as well. A few hours after dinner, when students begin to get tired but still have to study, we would see trips to the refrigerator or wherever else snacks are kept. Diets are very difficult to maintain on these occasions, as the motive to avoid tense-tiredness is powerful.",

The news triggered an overwhelming fear of ingesting harmful food associated with persistent and intrusive thoughts about contamination in this patient. As a result, she adopted extreme food avoidance behaviours and restricted her oral intake for 2 weeks, causing significant weight loss and anxiety. Following a visit to her psychiatrist and a prescription for a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, her eating behaviours improved, and she could take her food without overwhelming fear. This case shows how OCD may mimic eating disorders and highlights how food-related obsessions can have a severe impact on health.",

      "abstract": "Sensory-specific satiety for foods is operationally a relative change in liking of a food immediately after eating it compared to the change in liking of uneaten foods. Typical sensory-specific satiety protocols are designed to disentangle many feelings of hunger and fullness from the changes in liking. Higher-protein foods produce more sensory-specific satiety than lower-protein foods. Sensory-specific satiety crosses over to uneaten foods having sensory qualities similar to the eaten food. Thus consuming a sweet food will often diminish liking for other sweet foods; consuming salty foods can diminish liking for other salty foods. One of the fundamental ways people acquire liking is from Pavlovian conditioning to the postingestional effects of consuming foods. Karalus' five-factor satiety instrument is useful for discriminating differences in hunger and fullness produced by small changes in the formulations of specific food products.",

But the manipulation of an already adequate diet does not enhance performance. The composition of a meal preceding single-effort events like the high jump has little effect on performance, but performance in tests involving prolonged muscular work is enhanced if carbohydrate stores are replete at the beginning of the test. Obesity is a mechanical handicap in most, though not in all, forms of athletics. The average corporeal density of athletes is higher than that assumed for the general population; therefore the usual height-weight tables give the misleading impression that an athlete of given height is too heavy and presumably obese. Placing him on a reducing diet would be a mistake. Ordinarily he will spontaneously ingest food in amounts sufficient to maintain his weight. Performance is generally influenced by motivation, skill, and other neuromuscular and psychological factors. The training table provides the athlete with the foods on which he has learned he can rely; it also provides some of the sense of security generally obtainable by the practice of rituals. The best diet for him is a balanced one consisting of a variety of the foods he enjoys, in amounts that maintain his weight at an optimum level.",

      "title": "The effects of fasting on metabolism and performance",
      "abstract": "An overnight fast of 8–10 h is normal for most people. Fasting is characterised by a coordinated set of metabolic changes designed to spare carbohydrate and increase reliance on fat as a substrate for energy supply. As well as sparing the limited endogenous carbohydrate, and increased rate of gluconeogenesis from amino acids, glycerol and ketone bodies help maintain the supply of carbohydrate. Many individuals undergo periodic fasts for health, religious or cultural reasons. Ramadan fasting, involving 1 month of abstention from food and fluid intake during daylight hours, is practised by a large part of the world population. This period involves a shift in the pattern of intake from daytime to the hours of darkness. There seems to be little effect on overall daily dietary intake and only small metabolic effects, but there may be implications for both physical and cognitive function. The limited evidence suggests that effects of Ramadan-style fasting on exercise performance are generally small. This needs to be balanced, however, against the observation that small differences in performance are critical in determining the outcomes of sporting events. Studies involving challenging sporting events (prolonged sustained or intermittent high-intensity events, hot and humid environments) are needed. Increases in subjective sensations of fatigue may be the result of loss of sleep or disruption of normal sleep patterns. Modifications to the competition timetable may minimise or even eliminate any effect on performance in sport, but there may be negative effects on performance in some events.",

This study aims to determine whether adolescents high in trait social anxiety report more cigarette use and greater urge to smoke before, during, and after friend interactions than do teens low in trait social anxiety. Four hundred two students who reported smoking more than once during high school were assessed approximately every 30 min during up to 84-day monitoring sessions. Controlling for momentary anxiety, high socially anxious teens were equally or less likely to smoke, but more likely to report urge to smoke, surrounding friend interactions than low socially anxious teens. Although high socially anxious adolescents do not smoke more than low socially anxious peers, they may believe that they should need a cigarette in anxiety-provoking situations. Such urges may later develop into smoking behaviors.",

Participants used palm-top computers to record their first lapse, and their reaction to it, within minutes of the event, and were followed for 3 months to assess subsequent smoking. Indicators of the Abstinence Violation Effect--self-efficacy, attributions, and affective reactions to the lapse--generally failed to predict progression to relapse, but participants who felt like giving up after the first lapse progressed more rapidly to a second lapse. Participants who attempted restorative coping were less likely to progress to another lapse on the same day. Those whose lapses were triggered by stress progressed more quickly, whereas those triggered by eating and drinking or accompanied by alcohol consumption progressed more slowly. More nicotine-dependent participants progressed more rapidly toward relapse, but neither the amount smoked in the first lapse nor its subjective reinforcement predicted progression.",

      "abstract": "Food influences to a great extent our disposition whereas our mood dictates our cravings and the type of nutrients we choose. Emotions affect eating while the nutritional properties of food impact on brain functions related to mood and emotion. The dietary choices are a complete and complex circuit. Provided we influence one option, the other will follow suit, as increasing evidence has shown that the food choices have a positive impact on several mental disorders. In this research paper we have tried to show that nutritional deficiencies have been proved to negatively impact on the mental sanity and that, consequently, specific nutrients can contribute to the alleviation of mood and mental disorders. Specific nutrients can affect cognitive processes and emotions, whereas the lack of vitamins, fatty acids, minerals and some macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) may contribute to aggravating a poor psychological state. Among the most common nutritional deficiencies seen in mental disorder patients are those of omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that are precursors to neurotransmitters: tyrosine to dopamine, tryptophan to serotonin. Serotonin and tryptophan are known to promote well-being and their production is triggered by carbohydrate rich foods. Carbohydrates have been found to affect mood and behaviour. Inadequate dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may increase predisposition to several psychiatric disorders, particularly depression. Anxiety, depression, and autism spectrum disorders have been linked to functional Gastro-Intestinal tract (GI) disruptions, whereas GI disease are often determinant for psychological comorbidities. Altered gut microbiota composition, in particular a less diversified one, has been associated with stress as well. Showing more attention to the daily food and bringing the right nutrients in the proper amounts may enhance our mood.",

      "abstract": "High protein products in the form of snacks have built a market presence in the last few decades, where individuals seeking weight loss/management, bodybuilders and athletes requiring high protein are probably major consumers. Some individuals regularly consume diets containing in excess of 0.8 g protein/kg/day. However, increasing protein intake beyond this amount may raise the potential risk of harm to the body, particularly to the kidneys. People are often unaware that not all proteins are equal in terms of amino acid score and hence may not be the best match for their body’s needs. Equally, they may not realise that some added protein may be of animal origin. This in view of the apparent plant-base appearance of these types of products. It is not clear from the literature how potentially detrimental high protein diets are especially in the context of weight-management/sport/endurance/body building where in general the diets do not appear to create acute physiological/psychological issues. For the groups of vulnerable people who need to manage their protein/amino acid consumption carefully due to disease states, in the most part they would be aware of the need to control protein intake within their diet. For them, high protein foods would almost certainly be excluded. This review pulls together the health issues associated with eating high protein snacks and is intended to inform health professionals and consumers alike.",

It is often included in general samples of children treated as food refusers. In a large British retrospective population study, 4% of 5-year-olds were described as being 'faddy' by their parents. There was an equal prevalence in boys and girls. Around 30% of the faddy eaters had feeding problems as a baby. Parents frequently report early onset under the age of 2 years in pre-school children. Severe selective eating exists in the adult population but it is not clear whether this originated in early childhood or infancy.",

      "title": "How to Help Yourself without Taking Medicine",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although there is no cure for fibromyalgia, patients can initiate numerous changes and make adjustments that improve their sense of wellbeing. Simply stated, there are things patients can do without spending money or seeing a healthcare provider. Demonstrating a certain amount of control over the syndrome also improves self-esteem and instills a sense of self-worth. Even though certain general dietary principles allow fibromyalgia patients to feel better, there is no “fibromyalgia diet.” No specific food regimens or supplements have ever been shown in any published, controlled study to be helpful for fibromyalgia despite the observation that “arthritis diet” books are a multimillion-dollar-a-year industry. How can we explain this discrepancy? First, people feel better when they eat healthy foods. Most arthritis diet books urge patients to eat three well-balanced meals a day and caution against overeating. Many recommend having the main meal at midday; heavy, late-evening dinners don’t give the body enough time to burn off calories and are associated with bedtime esophageal spasm or heartburn. Similarly, consuming alcohol, nicotine, or caffeine (in the form of coffee, tea, or even chocolate) at a late dinner can make it harder to get a good night’s sleep. Alcohol, in particular, should not be used as a painkiller. In turn, poor sleep can increase musculoskeletal pain. An acceptable healthy balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats can also increase energy and fight fatigue.",

For healthy older adults, the number of meals may not matter as much as the total food eaten in a day. It is the nutritional quality of your meals and snacks and the total calories eaten that are most important. Aiming to meet the recommended servings of food groups, i.e. fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy will help promote good health and prevent illness.",

It is said that they are not really about weight and eating at all. When speaking of the relationship between the weight and eating symptoms and the other issues, it is arguable that is preferable to use a less usual horizontal metaphor in which the former is said to be tangled up with the latter. The actual mechanisms involved in weight and eating control are likely to be complex and they are not well understood. However, that does not stop many people from giving a remarkably simple account of how weight and eating control works. The usual outcome of attempts to slim is failure. Sustained weight loss is not usually achieved. The typical story goes something like this. Most people give up slimming.",

      "title": "Nutrition and Eating Problems—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Children and teens with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have the same nutritional needs as all children and teens. Children with ASD may be picky eaters, so parents might worry they are not getting the nutrients they need. For example, if children do not get enough dairy (milk or cheese) because they do not want it or because of a special diet, they may not get enough calcium and vitamin D. If children do not eat enough foods made from grains, they may not get enough fiber and B vitamins. Some children with ASD are such picky eaters that they are at risk for nutritional disorders. They may also be at risk for low iron.Eating problems are common in children. In children with ASD, the problems may be more serious and last longer because of problems with taste, texture, or smell. They may be the result of learned behaviors. Up to 3 of 4 children with ASD may have problems with eating behaviors, food choice, and/or delayed feeding skills. These problems includeAcid reflux may lead to the child not wanting to eat. Distractions around a child may cause troubles with eating. For example, the school cafeteria is loud, bright, distracting, and disorganized, with multiple smells, which can be overwhelming to the child. Medication side effects, such as higher or reduced appetite, may also cause issues. Children with ASD may have a hard time knowing when they are full, when they are hungry, and how long they have been sitting at the table. The child might think he is “all done” after a bite or two of food or continue eating long after he is full. If your child has felt sick after eating a certain food, he may not want to eat that food again. This may happen even if the food was not what made your child sick. Your child might also eat only a few foods or not want to eat what has been a favorite food in the past. This may be related to anxiety, obsessions, not being flexible, or sensory problems.If your child has difficulties with eating, think about all medical, sensory, environmental, and other behavioral causes so you can work on these problems with your child’s pediatrician and therapists. Different members of the team may have creative solutions.A great way to work on eating and nutrition issues is to set up a regular structure for mealtimes. Offer your child meals and snacks at about the same times each day. Keep mealtime calm and remove distractions. Sit down with your child and eat the same foods. Your child should feed herself if she can. Do not ask your child to come to the dinner table until you are done preparing the food and are ready to sit down and eat.At each meal, be sure to serve at least one food that your child has eaten and liked in the past.Remember that a food often has to be offered multiple times before a child will eat it. Offer the new food on many days in a row with food your child likes to eat. This way, your child has something she is likely to eat. As much as you can, try to feed your children as many of the same foods as the rest of the family. Ask your child to eat, but do not beg or threaten. Once your child leaves the table, the meal is finished. To encourage eating at scheduled meals and snacks, do not give your child food or drink other than water until the next meal or snack. Use a visual schedule so that your child knows the time and place of each meal. She will learn to eat what the rest of the family eats and follow everyone else’s mealtime behaviors. So, the rest of the family will need to show good mealtime behaviors, eat fruits and vegetables, and avoid snacking. Your child will learn the eating habits of other family members.You can help your child learn about mealtime routines by telling and retelling a social story, which is a story in pictures or words about what you hope mealtimes will look like. Telling social stories about what should happen at mealtimes can help your child know what to expect at home, at school, and in the community. To deal with special feeding problems such as mouth packing, rechewing of food, and very limited diets, you will likely need help from experts. Talking with a registered dietitian may help too.Talk to your child’s therapists about how they can help him learn feeding skills and improve variety in his diet.Your child’s pediatrician will review your child’s diet at health checkups. Let her know if your child has a very limited diet or if you have placed your child on a special diet. The doctor will ask you some questions and do a physical examination to see if medical problems are causing eating problems. Tell your doctor if you notice burping, gagging, difficulty sleeping at night, or any other concerning symptoms. Also, tell your child’s doctor if you are giving any vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter medications.Keep in mind that what you think children need to eat may actually be too much. Your child’s pediatrician will be able to tell you the portion sizes that are best for your child’s age and weight. Also, remember that a balanced diet takes into account what she eats over the whole week, not in one meal. Eating problems do not go away overnight. You will need to keep teaching your child the rules for eating.

      "title": "Some Fad Diets' Promises sound Too good to Be True",
      "abstract": "Many overweight Americans, as well as some who just want to lose 5 pounds, keep searching for an easy, guaranteed weightreducing diet. Promoters of such diets are delighted to aid in this consumer quest, so the number of fad diets continues to increase along with the promoters' profits. Fad diets tend to be nutritionally unbalanced, to focus attention on only one type of food or nutrient, to appeal to the consumer with faulty logic, to neglect the issue of weight maintenance, or to make excessive claims for weight loss. The body stores excess energy, measured in kilocalories, as fat. One pound of fat represents 3,600 kilocalories of energy. To lose one pound of fat, you must expend 3,600 kilocalories more than the number in the food you eat. It is not unusual to see claims by a fad diet that you can lose 10 pounds in one week. Take a closer look at this excessive claim: Ten pounds of fat means 36,000 kilocalories. To lose that by dieting in one week, you would have to eat at least 5,000 kilocalories per day less than you normally would. However, the average U.S. adult eats only about 2,500 per day. How can you eat negative 2,500 kilocalories? Well, you could increase your exercise, but running 5 hours a day is beyond most of us. That's how much exercise it takes to use up 5,000 kilocalories. On most fad diets, a large part of the weight lost is just water, not By Dr. Patsy M. Brannon Nutrition and Food Science",

      "abstract": "<em>The hypothesis that some children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may show sensitivity or allergic reactions to various food items has led to the development of the oligoantigenic diet. The rationale of the diet is to eliminate certain foods from the diet in order to exclude potential allergens contained either naturally in food or in artificial ingredients with allergenic properties. The oligoantigenic diet attempts to identify individual foods to which a person might be sensitive. First, ADHD symptoms are monitored while multiple foods are excluded from the diet. Subsequently, if symptoms remit, foods are re-introduced, while observing the individual for the return of symptoms. An advantage of the oligoantigenic diet is that it can be tailored to the individual. A growing body of evidence suggests that behavioral symptoms of subgroups of children with ADHD may benefit from the elimination of certain foods. The effect sizes of an oligoantigenic diet regarding improvement of ADHD symptoms have been found to be medium to large. Available evidence suggests that the investigation of the role of food hypersensitivities in ADHD is a promising avenue worthy of further exploration. Further large-scale, randomized controlled studies including assessment of long-term outcome are therefore warranted.</em>",

      "abstract": "A RELUCTANCE TO CONTACT. Haphephobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by an intense fear of being touched without consent. Among the symptoms of this condition are immediate anxiety after being touched or when contemplating being touched, avoidance of situations where the person may be touched, and panic attacks. The most common strategy for dealing with this aversion to being touched entails a variety of types of behavioral therapy, as well as coping mechanisms, such as relaxation techniques. PASSING THROUGH. Excessive flatulence is generally an indication that a person either has a digestive system disorder or is experiencing a sensitivity to a particular food. As a rule, flatulence occurs for a number of reasons. One possibility involves the fact that individuals tend to swallow a bit of air as they eat or drink. Then as the air makes its way to the intestines, it is released as a burp or leaves the body as gas. Gas also is a by-product of natural activity in the digestive system. The bacteria that live in the gut create different gases as they break down food, which are subsequently expelled as flatulence. HAIR TODAY, GONE TOMORROW. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that typically results in an unpredictable hair loss. This condition leads to the loss of hair in patches, approximately the size of a quarter. The attendant loss can range from a few patches to a more extreme level of total baldness. Although no cure currently exists for the disorder, some forms of treatment can help individuals regrow their hair more quickly, such as corticosteroids—anti-inflammatory drugs. PUMPING UP. Edema is the buildup of fluids in the ankles, feet, and legs, which leads to swelling. This condition is a common problem, especially among older adults. There are a number of factors that can cause edema, including problems with the body’s lymphatic system, long-term protein deficiency, weakness in the veins, kidney complications, cirrhosis of the liver, and congestive heart failure. Among the treatment options for this condition are wearing compression socks, elevating the legs whenever possible, losing weight, soaking the feet and ankles in Epsom salts, and taking magnesium supplements. ONLY THE NOSE KNOWS. Nonallergic rhinitis entails chronic sneezing or a congested, drippy nose with no apparent cause. The exact triggers that cause the blood vessels in the nose to expand, filling the nasal lining with blood and fluid, are unknown. However, there are several possible catalysts, including environmental irritants; reaction to particular medications, infections, food, and beverages; and sleep-related issues. Avoiding the potential irritants, using antihistamine or steroid nasal sprays, and taking antihistamine tablets are among the common treatments for the condition. EARSPLITTING. Hyperacusis is a condition that occurs when a person’s hearing becomes oversensitive to certain sounds, making them seem louder than they really are. The disorder, which is caused by changes in how the brain processes sound, is usually centered on certain sound frequencies. Among the factors that can lead to these changes are damage to the cochlea (from exposure to loud noise), a head injury, Lyme disease, Bell’s palsy, PTSD, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common treatment for the condition is to wear a special hearing aid. TO PEE OR NOT TO PEE? Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control, a relatively common and often embarrassing problem. The severity of the condition ranges from a person leaking urine when they cough or sneeze to experiencing an urge to urinate, which is so strong that the individual does not get to the toilet in time. Urinary incontinence is not a disease but rather a symptom of a wide range of both short-term (e.g., urinary tract infection, constipation, and medicine) and long-term (e.g., diabetes, multiple sclerosis, enlarged prostate for men, and childbirth for women) health issues. Among the treatments that can help a person take control over their bladder are making lifestyle changes, taking medication, and undergoing surgery. IMPULSIVITY PERSONIFIED. Excoriation disorder is a repetitive, compulsive picking and scratching at the skin, to the point where serious tissue damage occurs. The condition is usually chronic, with periods of remission alternating with periods of greater symptom intensity. Although no specific cause has been identified for the disorder, evidence exists suggesting a genetic predisposition to the condition. Both medication and cognitive behavioral therapy have been found to possibly reduce the symptoms of the disorder. THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental illness characterized by a person being persistently preoccupied with at least one perceived flaw in their appearance. Individuals with this condition may frequently examine their appearance in the mirror, constantly compare how they look to others, and regularly try to avoid social situations or having their photo taken. As a rule, treatment includes undergoing counseling and taking antidepressant medicine. SWEETS BE DAMNED. A sugar intolerance is a condition in which an individual has difficulty in either digesting or processing sugar. This nutritional state, which is relatively common, causes a range of digestive issues that tend to vary from person to person. The basic way to treat sugar intolerance is to identify the triggers that are causing the condition and to eliminate those foods from the diet.",

      "title": "Hepatotoxicity of fast food?",
      "abstract": "In the dictionary, fast food is defined as any food which may be cooked easily, and is sold by restaurants to be eaten quickly or taken away. Changes in the dietary pattern of the last decades have made fast food a relevant component of Western diets, but a diet largely based on fast food has detrimental effects on health, which have been a matter of discussion for 20 years.1 Two potential mechanisms have been suggested: (1) fast feeding does not suppress appetite, leading to increased calorie consumption; and (2) fast food is usually richer in fats and saturated fats (and thus richer in calories), as well as in other components which may cause harm to several organs, namely widespread cardiovascular disease. Both mechanisms are likely to promote obesity, but is there evidence for a direct hepatotoxicity?\n\nThe issue came to public attention in the movie Super Size Me . After consuming three meals a day in a fast-food restaurant for 1 month, Morgan Spurlock increased by nearly 10 kg, and liver enzymes peaked at 290 U/l [alanine aminotransferase (ALT)] from baseline values of 20 U/l, accompanied by increased total cholesterol, uric acid and the onset of clinical features of the metabolic syndrome. There is no doubt that elevated aminotransferase levels are a marker of hepatic dysfunction, but are they related to any specific dietary component of fast food-based diet, or simply to weight gain and obesity-associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)? \n\nIn the general population, the majority of obese individuals do not have high liver enzymes. Also, in the presence of morbid obesity, more than half of individuals have liver enzymes within normal limits,2 although a significant correlation exists between the prevalence of abnormal liver enzymes and the degree of obesity. Accordingly, excess calorie intake cannot be the …",

Many diabetic foods have a higher fat content than their non-diabetic equivalents. This is contrary to the requirements of the 1984 Food Labelling Regulations. 3. Many diabetic products have a relatively high content of protein. 4. In percentage terms, the greatest difference between diabetic and non-diabetic foods remains that of carbohydrate content, particularly carbohydrate other than fructose or sorbitol. On a per portion basis (for instance, per teaspoon of jam) the difference is relatively small and likely to be of minimal practical significance. 5. Diabetic foods cost between 1.5 and 4 times as much as their non-diabetic equivalents. 6. Some ordinary reduced-sugar/low calorie products are preferable to diabetic products in terms of fat and energy content and cost. 7. The promotion and widespread availability of diabetic foods tend to delude patients into believing that these products are advantageous, or even necessary. Their existence also undermines current dietary teaching by implying that people with diabetes cannot eat normal foods. 8. Diabetic foods offer no significant physiological or psychological benefits to diabetic patients and can even be counterproductive to good diabetic control.

      "abstract": "Increasing numbers of consumers with food allergies encounter challenges when eating food from restaurants, cafeterias and fast food outlets, and also when choosing food sold without factory packaging. Trends have changed in recent decades. We prepare less food at home from ingredients, so that younger generations have fewer preparation skills and limited food knowledge. At the same time, we travel more widely, and enjoy experiencing dishes which originate around the world served by our local food businesses.\r\n\r\nThose diners who need to avoid particular foods to protect their health face a range of practical difficulties, starting with the need to find out exactly what dishes contain as ingredients, and then whether the food business has managed to prepare a particular item or dish without contamination from the allergen to be avoided, sometimes in trace quantities. Evidence from fatal reactions to foods and also reported by patient group members indicates that the most important factor in effective avoidance is access to the CORRECT information about what food contains. Most fatal reactions involve consumption of food containing the culprit allergen. In some cases, the allergic person was not actively avoiding the particular allergen, perhaps through lack of accurate diagnosis or avoidance advice, but even those with accurate diagnoses and well-honed avoidance skills have been caught out.\r\n\r\nTypical barriers include: not retaining the correct information, poor information-sharing between preparation and service staff, inconsistent recipes, menu words from other languages / cultures which are not understood by staff / customers, cross-contamination in preparation or service, including shared utensils on self-service buffets, customers being nervous about asking for information in front of their friends or colleagues, and not wanting to make a fuss.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will present case files, practical risk assessment and some examples of effective solutions to protect food allergic consumers eating catered food.",

      "title": "Debunking the Myth",
      "abstract": "“Wow — almost 2 h!” This was the response from my first-grade daughter as she finished adding up the number of minutes she had jogged to “burn off” the calories in a popular child meal combo from a large fast food chain. She was putting the final touches on her science project, which involved eating the meal, looking up the nutrition facts online, and completing multiple bouts of running (across several days) while wearing an activity tracking device. In line with my daughter’s reaction, I suspect that the average American has a highly skewed notion about the amount of activity required to negate all the calories he or she consumes. And the gross overestimation of the capacity of exercise to burn the extra calories we collectively consume is likely one of the culprits of the obesity epidemic we face today. The consequences of allowing the myth to be perpetuated have at least two major consequences for youth with obesity: 1) we set up a false expectation for these children and their families, who after exercising and failing to lose weight, may experience disappointment and decide to abandon exercise altogether; and 2) we create a potentially subversive and counterproductive scenario in which nonadherence to appropriate dietary modification might be rationalized by an individual who assumes that any extra calories consumed can be canceled out easily and quickly by exercising just a little more. Therefore, the benefits and limitations of exercise need to be accurately portrayed and placed into an appropriate context whenever physical activity counseling is offered to individuals with obesity. Exercise can aid in weight loss, just not nearly as much as most people think. In the current issue of the Journal, “Exercise for Obese Youth: Refocusing Attention from Weight Loss to Health Gains,” Shaibi et al. (3) expertly detail how exercise produces multiple beneficial health outcomes that are, unfortunately, too often deemphasized in favor of weight-based end points in many clinical trials. Indeed, exercise training can improve insulin resistance, beta-cell function, glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and vascular function, to name only a handful of benefits (3). One additional aspect of exercise and physical activity not fully appreciated is the role they play in weight loss maintenance. As described by investigators of the National Weight Control Registry study, physical activity appears to be indispensable in relation to preventing weight regain among adults (1,2). However, less is known about the role of physical activity on weight loss maintenance in children. Perhaps similar studies can be undertaken in children to improve our understanding regarding physical activity and weight loss maintenance and underscore their importance in the treatment schema. At some point, hopefully not far on the horizon, effective and sustainable nonsurgical treatments will be available for children and adolescents afflicted with obesity. And when that day arrives, exercise will continue to be an important part of the equation, particularly as the focus begins to shift toward maintaining a healthy body weight and addressing risk factors for other chronic diseases. In the interim, we as a research and health care community should continue to tout all of the health benefits of exercise, yet challenge the commonly held assumption about its role in weight loss (i.e., a little activity can go a long way toward burning off those extra calories). In so doing, we might cause some parents to think twice about pulling up to the fast food window so frequently and free up some time for their first grader who may be interested in doing things other than jogging for 2 h · d-1.

      "abstract": "Ramadan (in Islam), the ninth month of the Muslim year. During this period, from the sunrise to the sunset, a total abstinence is practiced, no food, drink, nor any other nutritional substance can be introduced into the body through any method, but after sunset. Practicing daytime ramadan (fats) sport burns primarily the sugars and fatty acids that circulate in the blood and then asks the body to focus on glycogen stores, fats and proteins. The energy deficit leads the body into a suffering situation. In such a situation, it is difficult to get performance without the necessary amount of energy. Exercising intense effort calls for other sources of energy, such as fats and proteins. The use of muscle proteins for energy purposes leads to changes in contractile fibers and weakens the muscle tissue. This risk is even greater if the hydration is not correct, a situation often associated with the absence of food intake. Associated dehydration increases the risk of tendon and muscle lesions (tendinopathy, elongation, breakdown). During the Ramadan month, physical and sports performance is significantly reduced. Coaches have to take this into account. Programming competitions during this period is not very compatible with a high performance sports diet and with the idea of performance.",

      "title": "Shame is Not an Effective Diet Plan",
      "abstract": "Shame is Not an Effective Diet Plan Judith Bruk The stigma of being obese is so strong that it is assumed that anyone with the condition is (or should be) deeply ashamed. After all, it’s really easy to lose weight, right? Just cut out dessert and walk around the block three times a week. If you can’t even do that, then you are definitely a moral failure, have succumbed to Gluttony and Sloth, and deserve to be shunned by society. The problem is that shame is not a very effective diet plan; quite the opposite. It’s no surprise that recent research shows that shame leads to depression that leads to isolation, which, in the morbidly obese, leads to a suicide rate twelve times that of healthy–weight people. Unfortunately, it is indeed true that many obese people feel a great deal of shame, even if we occasionally put on a façade of bravado or seeming shamelessness, e.g., the “large and in charge” sitcom staple trope. The bottom line is that our shame about our weight does keep us from engaging with other people, limits our willingness to participate in physical activities, and generally makes us reluctant to simply exist out in public. None of these are behaviors conducive to positive lifestyle changes. For years I engineered my life so I would only go out of my house when absolutely necessary: grocery shopping and the occasional meeting at work were pretty much it (I usually work from home). I went for years without going to a movie, shopping for clothes in a store, eating in a restaurant, gardening, or any of the other activities I once enjoyed. I was ashamed to be seen. And since I had tried and tried and tried and tried to lose weight for three decades and only ended up more overweight as the years went by, I finally, truly gave up. I convinced myself my psychological makeup was so flawed (or was missing whatever ingredient it was that made someone succeed at sustained weight loss) that I just hoped my inevitable heart attack would be instantaneously fatal. This thinking is irrational, or at least unhealthy. (I am an otherwise fairly smart person with an advanced degree and am professionally employed.) Yet, it is basically the path that both societal attitudes and medical treatment lead us down at this point in time. Here are a few examples that illustrate how the path to irrationality evolved for me. About twelve years ago, I decided to see a psychotherapist to get to the bottom of my subconscious psychological issue that was keeping me overweight. This therapist suggested I see a nutritionist who gave me a list of detailed thyroid tests to take to my doctor so she could order the labs and we could get a full profile of how my thyroid was functioning. Upon presenting the list to my doctor’s PA (my doctor was not available that day), she rolled her eyes, gave a very deep sigh and said to me, “Every fat woman wants to believe it’s because of her thyroid and it never, ever is.” I was so embarrassed for having even brought the subject up that in an effort to save face, I reacted to my shame by replying, “Yeah, I just assume my extreme lack of energy and excess weight is simply because I eat too much.” She said, “Right, so let’s not even bother running these tests.” It was at least ten years later that I finally had the thyroid panel run and found out it was very low functioning. After about a year of seeing that shrink, she declared me “cured” and sent me on my way, though I had not lost any weight. It was about this time I first began thinking that throwing in the towel [End Page 91] was a good option. That didn’t mean that I went out and ate pizza and ice cream every day. Not at all. In fact, given the fact that I had been vegetarian and general health–food freak beginning in my mid–twenties, I rarely had anything in the house that contained sugar...",

      "title": "Healthy Nutrition and Dietary Considerations for the Workplace",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAdvice related to diets and nutrition seems to be confusing to many people. One day, the latest scientific news may tell us one thing only to be contradicted the following day by the results of yet another study. To avoid such confusion, it is a good idea to consider more stable perspectives that come from trusted sources of nutrition information. One such source is the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (1) that come from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services. This source offers advice that considers that nutrition and physical activity needs are not the same for everyone and that our food and beverage choices, along with our physical activity, should be priorities because they directly relate to how we feel and function (see “Resources” section for additional information). As a cross-cutting message that applies to the entire workforce, worksite health promotion messaging related to eating a healthy diet may be as simple as: “focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, include protein, and avoid saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars.” Of course, healthy nutrition is a bit more complex than this because it also relates to the unique considerations that apply to individuals. Such considerations include physical activity patterns, body mass index or body composition, medical care issues related to chronic conditions, and a person’s caloric requirements for a healthy weight. In the workplace, what can an employer do to support its workforce given the challenges related to healthy eating and following a diet that is nutritious and maintains energy requirement throughout the day? Clearly, energy requirements for an office worker may be drastically different than those of a construction worker. Yet, despite the difference in caloric needs, both diets should be healthful. It is the purpose of this brief commentary to provide suggestions and considerations for healthful nutrition at the workplace. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HEALTHY EATING PATTERNS FOR ADULTS The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide the main source of science-based information for proper nutrition. Considering the context of the workplace, recommendations for workers to follow don’t always need to be about weight loss. In fact, a general focus on increasing certain types of foods and limiting others is an appropriate message to send. For example, the following foods are not consumed often enough, and a relative increase in their consumption is good advice: A variety of vegetables from all the subgroups—dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy, and other Fruits, especially whole fruits Grains, at least half of which are whole grains Fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or fortified soy beverages A variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts, seeds, and soy products Oils A healthy eating pattern also limits: Saturated fats and trans fats, added sugars, and sodium General Information One effective health education tool is the ChooseMyPlate resource from the USDA available at ChooseMyPlate.gov (see Figure). This educational resource illustrates the five food groups that are the building blocks for a healthy diet, including fruits, grains, vegetables, protein, and dairy.FigureNote: Available at: https://www.choosemyplate.gov/ Specific Foods—Fish Another evidence-based resource is ChooseYourFish.org, a web site designed to provide information about the benefits of eating fish. This web site, which was developed by HealthPartners Institute in partnership with the Minnesota Department of Health, provides specific guidance for pregnant women about what types of fish to consider and what types of benefits this provides for both the mother and the baby (see the “Resources” section for additional information). Specific Foods—Fruits and Vegetables The Produce for Better Health Foundation (2) provides a rich Web site including a section focused on fruits and vegetables (see the “Resources” section for additional information). Their Top 10 Reasons to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables include: Color and texture Convenience Fiber Low in calories May reduce disease risk Vitamins and minerals Variety Quick, natural snack Fun to eat …and they are delicious! This type of advice almost is designed for a worksite health promotion fruits and vegetables campaign! An example of the types of topics a healthy eating program could focus on is provided in the sidebar. Healthy eating and active living, alone or in combination, can elevate mood, manage and sustain high energy throughout the day, provide opportunities for coworkers to enjoy time with each other, reduce stress, build self-esteem, and reduce risk of heart disease and cancer. Sidebar: Healthy Eating Suggestions to Include in a Workplace Program Suggest for people to eat at least one dark-green and one orange vegetable each day. Pick real vegetables and fruit instead of juice. Choose lots of whole grain options each day. Drink fat-free/skim or low-fat milk. Include protein options besides meat, e.g., beans, lentils, or tofu. Eat at least two servings of fish each week. Select lean meat and alternatives prepared with little or no added fat or salt. Be physically active every day. Satisfy your thirst with water. Provide ideas for healthy snack options that include lots of variety so people can experiment and try new foods, such as: ○ Raw vegetables like baby carrots or celery ○ Fresh fruit such as apples ○ Dried fruit / canned fruit ○ Nuts ○ Peanut butter ○ Low salt pretzels ○ Whole grain crackers ○ Low-fat yoghurt ○ Canned fish ○ Granola bars ○ Rice cakes ○ Whole-grain cereal ○ Cottage cheese ○ Low-fat cheese ○ Bagel bits ○ Bran muffins ○ Milk ○ Juice box FACTORS FOR PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT As a worksite health promotion professional, when you are working on designing and implementing a healthy eating initiative, not only would you look for bona fide resources for employees, you also should consider factors that are related to the design of a successful program. The following factors are important to keep in mind: Consider the adult population in general and workers specifically as the main audience. Redesign eating opportunities to make the healthy choice the easy choice. Use simple messages to address important dietary risk factors or issues. Make sure the advice provided is possible for workers to act on, consistent over time, and informed by credible sources. Whenever possible, rely on health professionals (e.g., dietitians or nutritionists) to provide specific guidance for dietary information related to diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Ensure that guidance and information provided is actionable by aligning it with the programs, services, and foods available at the workplace. Align messages and programming aspects with the culture of the company. Connect the program with community-based resources. INTERVENTION PROGRAMS AND POLICIES Various types of approaches may be considered in creating interventions or programs for the workplace. We present four ideas here that include suggestions about what individuals can do, as well as what the company can do, to change the environmental conditions. Nutrition Information One area of focus should be the provision of accurate information and building awareness of what it means to eat healthy. This is important in itself but unlikely to be sufficient for people to change their eating behavior. Often, access to web-based resources is central to this option, and messages presented using texting or email are an important aspect of this intervention tactic. Behavior Change Programs Another individual-level programming option is to provide behavior change programs that will allow people to learn new ways to improve their dietary habits. Such programs include nutrition education and programming aspects such as health assessments or screening, self-instruction, and group education/classes. Furthermore, they tend to be organized around topics such as weight management or reduction of cardiovascular disease or other chronic conditions. Environmental Supports Obviously, healthful dietary choices also are influenced by the environment in which workers find themselves. For example, if the corporate cafeteria doesn’t provide healthy food options and doesn’t make the healthy choice the easy choice, it is unlikely that workers will consume them often enough. So, for example, a company can decide to make available point-of-service nutrition information/labeling that informs workers about their food options. Another option is to make available healthy options in the cafeteria and vending machines. Nutrition-Related Policies Often, large companies outsource their food services and many, including small- and medium-sized companies, make vending options available at the workplace that follow healthy catering policies. Examples of these types of policies and guidelines include the healthy vending toolkit created by the King County Public Health Department (see “Resources” section). HOW TO MEASURE IMPACT It is important to include an approach to the evaluation of the healthy eating program because this will allow for justification of continued allocation of resources as well as a chance to feed results back to the participants. For this purpose, indicators of changes participants have made because of the program would be ideal. Furthermore, being able to see a shift in the entire population also would be impactful. Available data may come from existing questions embedded in a health assessment but also may be complemented by short surveys as part of the healthy eating program itself. Don’t forget that if people purchase their foods at the corporate cafeteria, it may be possible to work with the food vendor to capture receipts and find out the type of purchases that were made during specific timeframes, thereby enabling the capture of a newly established pattern of food choices brought about by the intervention program. An example of such a project was the price change initiated by HealthPartners for its employees at the corporate cafeteria during the month of March 2012 (3). The price of salad bar purchases was reduced by 50% during the month, and monthly sales data were analyzed for February through June. This information was complemented by a survey to employees. Salad bar sales more than tripled during the price reduction period and returned to baseline afterward. Employees reported that the high price of purchasing a salad relative to other choices available to them was a significant barrier to choosing to eat a salad. As a result, it may be concluded that policies that make salads competitive in price to other choices in cafeterias may significantly increase healthful food consumption. CONCLUSIONS Eating healthy and well is important not only for health but also for maintaining the energy needed to perform at work. It is in the interest of companies to ensure that healthy food options are available to employees. It may be difficult to keep track of everything related to eating well, but keeping things simple for people and relying on trusted, evidence-informed sources is a good strategy when it comes to designing and implementing a worksite health promotion program focused on healthy eating.

      "abstract": "Looking for opportunities to squeeze more physical activity into your busy lifestyle? The second edition of The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that regular physical activity is one of the most important things that we can do to improve our health, prevent chronic disease, improve brain health, improve sleep quality, and reduce the risk of anxiety and depression. Let’s look at the guidelines and some practical ways you can apply them to your life. ✓ Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Any physical activity can aid in offsetting the risks of chronic disease. Replacing sitting with anything active is likely to produce some health benefits. - Intentionally store regularly used household items out of the way. Snacks, for example, can be stored downstairs, paper towels are a walk to the garage. - Not having ice cream in the house means that if you want it, you have to make a trip to go out and enjoy that single serving. - Try an activity tracker. Most smart phones offer some form of tracking (steps or movement). Being conscious of how much you move or do not move is the first step in achieving progress. - Walk or use mass transit instead of driving. You will be surprised how much activity you gain and how much money you will save. - Head to a mall or grab a cart and go food shopping instead of ordering online. ✓ Any activity counts. Physical activity means just that — move your body. - Focus on what you do. Often we focus on what we do not do and that leads to negative thought cycles. Start with a plan of how you will add movement into each day. - Replace sitting with standing when possible. - If you cannot stand, move while you sit. You can march while seated, for example. - Make a virtual activity call with a friend. Decide on a time to chat while you both walk. - Listen to audio books or podcasts while you walk, ride a stationary bike, or do chores. - Choose the stairs. Make this a pact with loved ones or colleagues. ✓ Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefit. Surprise yourself with what you can accomplish in 30 seconds. - Try a standing desk. - Take your colleague for a walk to brainstorm instead of sitting in a conference room. - Be a movement champion — make standing and moving during meetings a workplace mission. Adding in simple, short duration movements to your day will count toward your activity goal, for example, push-ups against a wall or kitchen counter, squatting to a chair and standing up, and knee lifts between phone calls. ✓ For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week. Intensity is relative to each individual. Generally, if you can carry on a conversation during activity, it is considered moderate; if you need to catch your breath between sentences, it is more vigorous; if you can only gasp a few breathy words, it is very intense. - The easiest way to conquer this recommendation is to choose activities you enjoy and make them a part of your weekly schedule. - Social support is a key ingredient to movement success. Engage a friend or loved one in your activities. Make activity dates. Many activity trackers offer challenges you can do with friends. - Try a new activity — golf, swimming, dancing, yoga, bird watching, or aquatic exercise. - Make it a family activity. A brisk walk before or after dinner or a game of hide and seek with little ones can add up to a fun habit. - Binge-watching TV? Put a stationary bike, personal rebounder (mini-trampoline), rower, treadmill, or other equipment in front of your screen. You also can march in place while watching your favorite shows. ✓ Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week. - A scheduled 45-minute walk each day plus extra opportunities to move and you can meet this easily. - Realize those times when you are doing more activity and try and replicate it. ✓ Adults also should do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups on two or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits. Adding in strength activities adds so much value to how you feel and how well you function each day. Lifting your kids, pets, groceries, or aiding loved ones is a major part of life, and having the ability to continue to perform those functions builds confidence and independence and will count toward your weekly movement goals. - Use your big box shopping time to practice some heavy lifting. For example, a carton of 24 (16.9 oz) water bottles weighs about 28 lbs. Carry those around the store or around your house and you will quickly realize how important strength is. - Having a strength program prescribed by an ACSM certified personal trainer is ideal. Meet with the trainer regularly for motivation and form checks or intermittently for program updates. - Join a community center or gym and learn a quick circuit of exercises you can do in 30 minutes. - Try resistance bands at home to add weight/load to exercises. - The basics are still great. Push-ups, squats, lunges, planks, and triceps dips are great examples of body weight exercises that build strength. - If you ever tried to pull a stubborn weed or move a shrub, you understand that heavy gardening builds strength. Every moving minute counts toward making deposits in your activity account. Get moving for life.Sidebar: Stay Active on Vacation On a cruise? Never take the elevator. Visiting a new city? Take a walking tour. Communing with the outdoors? Try trail walking. Sports buff? Try a golf vacation, ski vacation, or learning to surf or paddle board. Zoos, water parks, and similar attractions require lots of movement — and make a lot of great memories.",

As nutritionist Adelle Davis famously put it back in the 1960s: “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper”. Breakfast is most commonly skipped meal more than lunch and dinner specifically in the young adult in the university study period and those who wake up late. Lack of time is the main reason behind skipping meals, in general, lack of appetite, inability to cook, fasting/religion, and not being hungry. Many people are used to be in a hurry for job, business, children’s’ school in the morning where a filled stomach may prevent them to walk a long way. It is obvious that the irregular omission of breakfast may be effective in energy intake reduction over the next 24 hours and in this day, exercise performance may be compromised. There is no evidence that breakfast skipping reduces overeating or prevent weight gain. Some people argue that breakfast and good health is a marketing strategy by breakfast companies.",

      "abstract": "When we learn from a patient, clinician, or medical record that a drug has been discontinued, it is logical to ask why. The drug may no longer be needed; it may not have produced the desired effect; it may have produced an adverse reaction; a better drug may be available to replace the original drug. The patient may have discontinued the drug because he or she could not see why it was necessary; or the patient may have discontinued the drug because of unpleasant side effects. A drug may not work because its absorption is reduced by physical or chemical interaction with another drug or a food component. It may also not work because the patient's metabolism is speeded up or in hibited to an extent such that the desired duration of drug action is not obtained. Such an effect may be related to a change in diet. Side effects may be related to consumption of specific foods or bev erages or to an overall change in nutritional status. Drug-food and drug-alcohol incompatibility reactions are frequent but are avoidable if a patient is warned of their possible occurrence. Drugs may also produce nutritional deficiencies, especially in a patient whose diet is marginal in those nutrients depleted by the particular drug. Careful prescribing practices together with appropriate nutrient supplements will serve to reduce the risk of these incompatibilities.",

      "title": "Unriddling the Neural Circuitry of Impulse Control",
      "abstract": "Animals, including humans, display a range of impulsive behaviours. For example, sometimes we are unable to withhold ourselves from carrying out certain actions, even though we are aware that such actions will incur negative consequences. This type of impulsive behaviour is attributed to the alcoholic whom is perfectly aware that drinking is leading him down a path of self-destruction, but he is nevertheless incapable to withhold himself from engaging in such a behaviour. This type of behaviour is called “impulsive action” as it pertains to an individual’s inability to control their own imminent actions. Another type of impulsive behaviour is named “impulsive choice”. This type of behaviour pertains to an individual’s predisposition to overvalue and choose immediate but smaller rewards, over larger but delayed rewards. An example of this is the marshmallow test; wherein a child is presented with a marshmallow and told that if he does not eat it, he will later obtain more marshmallows. Impulsive children would rather eat one marshmallow now, than wait to obtain a larger reward later. It is important to understand that displaying impulsive behaviour is natural and it is only when it is overly expressed that it becomes detrimental to the individual. ADHD, drug addiction, bipolar disorder, problem gambling and eating disorders are disorders wherein impulsive behaviour is no longer being properly controlled. Both types of impulsive behaviour are thought to be mediated by different neuronal circuits within the brain. Although we have some understanding of the circuitry already, the aim of this thesis was to further tease out these circuits. This was done by using precise methodologies which enabled us to target specific areas and connections within the brain with time locked precision. The experiments were performed in rats trained in tasks wherein they would have to wait for a cue before making a response or choose between a small immediate reward or larger but delayed reward. By using lasers (amongst other techniques) to stimulate neurons within the brain we were able to pinpoint the role of distinct circuits in not only impulsive behaviour but also attentional behaviour.",

      "title": "Brain Serotonin, Carbohydrate‐Craving, Obesity and Depression",
      "abstract": "Serotonin-releasing brain neurons are unique in that the amount of neurotransmitter they release is normally controlled by food intake: Carbohydrate consumption--acting via insulin secretion and the \"plasma tryptophan ratio\"--increases serotonin release; protein intake lacks this effect. This ability of neurons to couple neuronal signaling properties to food consumption is a link in the feedback mechanism that normally keeps carbohydrate and protein intakes more or less constant. However, serotonin release is also involved in such functions as sleep onset, pain sensitivity, blood pressure regulation, and control of the mood. Hence many patients learn to overeat carbohydrates (particularly snack foods, like potato chips or pastries, which are rich in carbohydrates and fats) to make themselves feel better. This tendency to use certain foods as though they were drugs is a frequent cause of weight gain, and can also be seen in patients who become fat when exposed to stress, or in women with premenstrual syndrome, or in patients with \"winter depression,\" or in people who are attempting to give up smoking. (Nicotine, like dietary carbohydrates, increases brain serotonin secretion; nicotine withdrawal has the opposite effect.) It also occurs in patients with normal-weight bulimia. Dexfenfluramine constitutes a highly effective treatment for such patients. In addition to producing its general satiety-promoting effect, it specifically reduces their overconsumption of carbohydrate-rich (or carbohydrate-and fat-rich) foods.",

Similarly anyone on a weight reduction programme will avoid snacks, reducing the frequency of eating occasions to two to three times a day. However there is evidence to suggest that snacking is not the evil once thought and individuals that snack throughout the day have positive advantages over individuals who conform to a rigid pattern of three meals a day. Increasingly western populations appear to be moving away from the “gorging” to the “nibbling” pattern of eating, probably as a direct result of the increased availability of fast foods and snacks.

Para poder vivir debemos alimentarnos, pero un exceso de alimentacion tambien puede ser perjudicial, por lo que constantemente nos movemos en un ciclo continuo de hambre/saciedad que nos va a indicar cuando, cuanto, como y que comer. Hoy en dia, en la sociedad existe un claro ejemplo del fallo de la regulacion de este proceso, como se refleja en el elevado numero de sujetos con sobrepeso y obesidad. Esto nos lleva a la siguiente pregunta: ?es que mas de la mitad de la poblacion come mas de lo que debe? La respuesta parece obvia, y es que si lo hace. Pero evidentemente, las razones de por que esta sucediendo esta alarmante situacion no son tan claras, y la causa se adjudica a razones multifactoriales. Por ello, en el presente libro vamos a intentar profundizar sobre los aspectos que se conocen acerca de la regulacion del apetito en el ser humano. Posteriormente, nos centraremos en aspectos mas metodologicos, para finalizar con los metodos farmacologicos que actualmente pueden ayudar a aquellas personas con problemas de sobrepeso u obesidad a controlar el apetito, y por tanto mejorar su salud.",

      "abstract": "Type I wheat ingestion allergy is a special type of food allergy because the patient usually is not aware of his allergy. The unawareness comes from two reasons; one is that the clinical symptom appears not immediately after ingestion of wheat products but occurs sometime (30-60 min) later, and the other is that it may not appear if the patient does not exercise at this particular time. Therefore, the reaction does not always follow wheat ingestion. The study of enzymatically digested gluten antigens in the patients disclosed that the allergenicity to wheat was reinforced by peptic digestion but abolished by further tryptic digestion, indicating that allergen activity was most potent in the stomach. Anaphylaxis may occur in some patients after wheat ingestion and exercise. Therefore, in exercise-induced anaphylaxis without apparent allergy, one should consider wheat allergy.",

Pagophagia (compulsive ice chewing) is a particular form of pica that is characterized by ingestion of ice, freezer frost, or iced drinks. It is usually associated with iron deficiency anemia or mental abnormalities like intellectual disabilities, autism, etc. Very few case reports have reported association of eating ice cubes with compulsive behavior or depressive disorders. In this case report, we present the association of pagophagia with sadness in a patient with recurrent depressive disorder. A 44-year-old female suffering from depressive disorder since the age of 33 years presented with symptoms of an intense desire to eat ice cubes that she was unable to resist and would feel better only after consumption of ice cubes or iced drinks. Initially she would consume about 250-500 g of ice cubes per day, but gradually the quantity of consumption of ice increased to about 10-12 kg of ice cubes per day. These symptoms were related to low mood and stress. The preoccupation with consumption of ice was associated with significant psychosocial dysfunction and interpersona problems with the spouse. She was managed with venlafaxine 187.5 mg/day and cognitive behavior psychotherapy (identifying her cognitive errors, generating alternative thoughts, problem solving, activity scheduling and mastery, and pleasure technique) with which her depressive symptoms improved and her pagophagia reduced significantly but did not subside completely. She learned to use alternative coping mechanisms to deal with her psychosocial stressors.",

      "abstract": "The relevance of the problem lies in the fact that today's wartime causes distress in the majority of the population, which affects all systems and structures of the body and leads to psychosomatic disorders. The body's reaction to prolonged round-the-clock stress is accompanied by the depletion of relevant vitamins and microelements involved in stress adaptation mechanisms, and the accompanying polynutrient deficiency deepens the consequences of distress. The purpose of the work: based on the principles of nutrition of people with increased psycho-emotional stress, to determine the necessary food products and the most important nutrients for alimentary prevention of chronic stress and stress adaptation during martial law. The results. The conducted analysis shows that even in the difficult conditions of wartime, it is possible to reduce anxiety and reduce stress by correcting the diet. To support the body, it will be enough to consume even the simplest, budget products. You should consume protein foods (both animal and vegetable protein) and avoid foods with a high content saturated (solid) fats and sugar, because they only give a small influx of energy, and in the future lead to negative consequences. Conclusions. A diet with a high content of fiber and fresh vegetables is necessary, providing an anti-stress reserve and a resource of vitamins A, C, group B and necessary trace elements. In addition, various cereals, bread, starchy vegetables contain slow carbohydrates, which will help maintain a feeling of satiety. Correcting and minimally diversifying food will help strengthen sleep, calm the nervous system and reduce stress.",

      "abstract": "Since obesity has been a crucial issue regarding children`s health in Korea, numerous studies have been conducted. However, it is difficult to locate studies that can help researchers and/or medical professionals who want to study behavioral differences between obese and normal weight (non-obese) children. The collected literature about obese childrens behaviors were accumulated by performing ``key word`` searches from several web engines: ``obesity`` ‘children obesity`` ``behavior`` ``habit`` ``eating behavior or habit` ``exercise`` ``physical activity`` and ``daily behavior``. The information was extracted and the behaviors were reviewed utilizing 30 papers that revealed any differences from normal weight children with at least p .05 level of significance. According to those studies, the obese children tended to skip meals more often as a method of losing weight. They also have an increased appetite, eat larger portions and rarely leave food on their plates. The obese children prefer to eat high fat, high calorie foods and eat faster than their normal weight counterparts. Also, the children usually eat alone and eat at irregular meal times. Beside the behaviors related to the standard three meals a day, obese children have high preferences for snacking. The children reported that with pocket money they usually eat certain types of snacks without parent approval. The children stated that they exercise more on a regular basis. However, when asked about their participation they were not likely to engage actively. Meanwhile, they tend to spend free time doing sedentary activities such as watching TV or playing on the computer. Since these studies used self -reported questionnaires with a small sample, size there may be difficulty in forming a basis about obese children`s behaviors. Nevertheless, these findings are in accordance with other studies conducted in local as well as western countries. In conclusion, obese children have different daily behaviors or routines from normal weight children. It is recommended that altering these behavioral patterns to match those of normal weight children should be encouraged.",

      "abstract": "Verleidingen op de korte termijn winnen het nu en dan van keuze opties die verstandiger zouden zijn op de lange termijn. Mensen eten bijvoorbeeld lekkere, maar ongezonde producten terwijl zij het doel hebben om gezond te eten. Falen van zelfcontrole wordt vaak verklaard vanuit de theorie dat mensen slechts een beperkte capaciteit of motivatie hebben om zelfcontrole uit te voeren. Dit fenomeen wordt ego-depletie genoemd. Na het uitvoeren van zelfcontrole in een eerste taak, bijvoorbeeld het onderdrukken van emoties, zijn mensen minder geneigd om zelfcontrole uit te voeren in een tweede taak, zoals het weerstaan van een verleidelijk tussendoortje. In het eerste deel van dit proefschrift worden individuele factoren belicht die van invloed zijn op het ego-depletie effect. Er wordt aangetoond dat niet iedereen even gevoelig is voor ego-depletie, maar dat de ene persoon meer capaciteit of motivatie heeft om herhaaldelijk zelfcontrole uit te voeren dan de ander. In het tweede deel van dit proefschrift worden de gevolgen van ego-depletie onderzocht. In eerder onderzoek lag de focus meestal op de negatieve gevolgen van ego-depletie: onder omstandigheden van ego-depletie maken mensen meer ongezonde voedingskeuzes. In dit proefschrift wordt echter aangetoond dat de consequenties van ego-depletie voor voedingskeuzes afhangen van de omgeving. Wanneer sociale cues in de omgeving naar gezonde voedingsproducten wijzen, hebben omstandigheden van ego-depletie gezonde voedingskeuzes tot gevolg. De effecten van ego-depletie voor voedingskeuzes kunnen dus ook positief zijn. Door middel van sociale cues kunnen mensen onder omstandigheden van lage zelfcontrole worden aangezet tot een impulsieve keuze voor gezondheid.",

      "abstract": "It is commonly stated that 'snack' foods provide 'empty calories' and, therefore elevate energy intake whilst providing insignificant quantities of other nutrients. The data presented in the present review suggest that foods which contribute to the pattern of 'snacking' contribute significantly to the nutrient quality of the diet. Those who 'snack' frequently tend to eat more food in general. Part of the difficulty in identifying the nutritional implications of 'snacking' is related to the definitions of 'meals' and 'snacks' and subsequent categorization of individual patterns. The physiological definitions typically relating to energy content or the time of eating do not necessarily coincide with colloquial, cultural or individual perceptions of what constitutes a 'meal' or 'snack'. Clearly, a more consistent approach would facilitate interpretation of the literature and enable more effective health education messages about 'snacking' to be delivered.",

      "abstract": "A compulsão alimentar (CA) é caracterizada pela ingesta exagerada de comida em um curto período de tempo e de forma descontrolada, porém sem a adoção de medidas compensatórias para impedir o ganho ponderal. Os indivíduos com histórico de transtorno alimentar, por sua vez, tendem a uma personalidade mais ansiosa. É sabido, entretanto, que a ansiedade é um estado emocional fisiológico desde que as preocupações não ocupem a maior parte do dia do indivíduo, como nos transtornos ansiosos generalizados (TAG). Com o objetivo de combater esses pensamentos ansiosos obsessivos, a pessoa opta por algumas medidas de escape, sendo que na maior parte dos casos a descarga psicológica é descarregada na ingesta patológica de alimentos. Dessa forma, observa-se como consequência comum de ambas as desordens o risco elevado da obesidade, que tem impacto negativo na saúde e na qualidade de vida. Frente a isso, o presente estudo objetiva avaliar a comorbidade entre ambos os transtornos psíquicos, tendo como público alvo acadêmicos de medicina da Universidade de Ribeirão Preto (UNAERP), para que com os resultados possamos despertar o interesse nessas áreas de estudo e assim gerar uma promoção e prevenção de saúde, evitando, por exemplo, a obesidade que é altamente prevalente em ambas as patologias e além disso, um fator de risco para doenças crônicas, principalmente as cardiovasculares, que além de afetar a qualidade de vida do doente é uma ameaça socioeconômica.",

      "abstract": "ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die moderne Zivilisation und das überreichliche Nahrungs- und Lebensmittelangebot in unserer Zeit haben das ursprüngliche, auf das Überleben ausgerichtete Essverhalten stark verändert. Dem wird weder in der universitären ärztlichen Ausbildung noch bei politischen Entscheidungen zielführend und wirkungsvoll Rechnung getragen. Im komplexen Geschehen rund um das Essverhalten spielt das Gehirnbelohnungssystem die zentrale Rolle. Die Essensaufnahme wird von einem Glücksgefühl begleitet. Der Gewöhnungseffekt richtet sich allerdings nach „Immer Mehr“ aus und unterscheidet nicht mehr zwischen gesund und ungesund. Mit der Selbstkontrolle kann das Gehirnbelohnungssystem „aufgeschoben“ werden. Da die weit verbreiteten Genussmittel, Alkohol, Nikotin, Drogen, aber auch Medikamente, das „(Schein-)Glückhormon“ Dopamin im Darm und Gehirn exprimieren und kurzfristige Glückgefühle erzeugen, wird die Selbstkontrolle über eine verminderte Ansprechbarkeit des Gehirnbelohnungssystems gestört, mit der Folge eines Konsums kalorien- und fettreicher Nahrung. Die meist schwierige Auflösung des resultierenden Konflikts zwischen Begehrlichkeit und Gesundheit macht aber nachhaltig glücklicher. Eine kohlenhydratlastige und eiweißarme Nahrungszufuhr erzeugt über den Mangel an essenziellen Aminosäuren – wichtige Elemente der Serotonin- und Dopaminproduktion – ein wiederholt gesteigertes Hungergefühl, das besser über eiweißreiche, fett- und kohlenhydratarme vegetabile Nahrungsmittel (Gemüsesorten, Hülsenfrüchte) gestillt werden sollte. Um die Stressresilienz zu verbessern, aktiviert unter Belastungsbedingungen Zucker das Gehirnbelohnungssystem sehr rasch und erzeugt ein Glückgefühl mit Gewöhnungseffekt. Die komplexen Zusammenhänge werden ausgewählt dargestellt, aus denen sich die „Sucht“ nach Zucker, Hyperalimentation und Verknüpfungen mit der Entwicklung depressiver Zustände ergeben. Als Fazit wird, auch bei noch vorhandenen Wissenslücken, die Überzeugung vertreten, dass nur unter der synoptischen Berücksichtigung der systemischen Faktoren auf das Esshalten eine Primär- und Sekundärprävention, insbesondere bei Kindern und Jugendlichen, erfolgreich sein kann.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Instant food is a food that is practical and easy to obtain, one example of instant food is instant noodles. The critical point in instant noodles lies in all the ingredients it uses, such as; wheat flour, cooking oil, and seasonings that are not necessarily healthy and halal. Pregnant women who often consume instant foods are at risk of hypertension, where the consumption of carbohydrate sources is quite high such as fried foods, biscuits, chips almost every day and consumption of meatballs and fried noodles on average â‰¥ 3 times a week while daily food portions have also increased. Many studies have shown an association between instant food consumption and high sodium intake in pregnant women, while pregnant women who consume high sodium (â‰¥2300 mg / day) influence the risk factors for hypertension in pregnant women with a 7.2 times greater risk of hypertension. Considering the dangerous risk of instant food, it is better for pregnant women to consume food from natural sources so that the degree of health of the mother and fetus can be improved. One way to increase consumption of natural foods is by way of socializing the importance of natural consumption for pregnant women. The socialization method used is using the lecture method. The result of this activity is a change in knowledge from before and after the socialization which means that this activity is quite effective in encouraging changes in the eating behavior of pregnant women. Â  Keywords: Natural foods, socialization of nutrition for pregnant women, nutrition for pregnant women Â  Â  Abstrak Makanan instan adalah makanan yang praktis dan mudah didapat, salah satu contoh makanan instan adalah mie instan.Titik kritis pada mie instan terletak pada semua bahan yang digunakannya, seperti; tepung terigu, minyak goreng, dan bumbu-bumbu yang belum tentu sehat dan halal. Ibu hamil yang sering mengonsumsi makanan instan beresiko mengalami hipertensi,dimana konsumsi sumber karbohidrat yang cukup tinggi seperti gorengan, biskuit, keripik hampir setiap hari dan konsumsi bakso dan mie goreng rata-rata â‰¥ 3 kali seminggu sementara porsi makanan sehari-hari juga sudah meningkat. Banyak penelitian yang menunjukan hubungan antara konsumsi makanan instan dengan tingginya asupan natrium pada ibu hamil, sedangkan ibu hamil yang mengonsumsi natrium tinggi (â‰¥2300 mg/hari) mempengaruhi faktor risiko kejadian hipertensi pada ibu hamil dengan risiko 7,2 kali lebih besar terjadinya hipertensi. Mengingat resiko yang berbahaya dari makanan instan ada baiknya ibu hamil mengkonsumsi makanan dari sumber alami sehingga derajat kesehatan ibu dan janin dapat ditingkatkan. Salah satu cara peningkatan konsumsi makanan alami yaitu dengan cara sosialisasi pentingnya konsumsi alami bagi ibu hamil. Metode sosialisasi yang digunakan yaitu menggunakan metode ceramah.Hasil dari kegiatan ini yaitu terjadi perubahan pengetahuan dari sebelum dan setelah sosialisasi yang berarti bahwa kegiatan ini cukup efektif mendorong perubahan perilaku makan ibu hamil.

The periodically recurring fad diets based on occult or religious beliefs run the gamut from the bizarre and dangerous (brown rice and water) to the nutritionally acceptable. For example, the vegetarian menus, often difficult to select with the necessary precision for protein adequacy, may be nutritionally sound when properly designed. These unusual diets, which must be evaluated individually, do not compose the more general concern about adolescent eating. The heavy patronage of fast-food chains looms much larger. How do such foods compare in nutritional adequacy to the usual \"balanced\" home diet? Before one can answer such a question, one must have a means for analyzing a diet, and one must have standards of nutritional adequacy.

We need to administer food and fluids as early as possible both before both before and after surgery and to avoid or reduce hospital infections. Resumption of bowel movements is very rapid, and the patients are fed and experience no thirst and thus have better compliance during their hospital stay. Moreover, the social cost is reduced. A short review of the rules of various Associations of Anaesthetists both in Europe and the US shows that today the starvation time is reduced, and re-feeding after surgery is implemented early. For clear fluids a 2-h period before surgery without ingestion of clear fluids is enough, whilst in most countries a 6-h period of starvation for solid foods is the rule, but if proper distinctions are made between the various nutrients given to the patients, this time could be reduced to 2-3 hours.",

      "title": "Increasing Energy Flux to Maintain Diet-Induced Weight Loss",
      "abstract": "Long-term maintenance of weight loss requires sustained energy balance at the reduced body weight. This could be attained by coupling low total daily energy intake (TDEI) with low total daily energy expenditure (TDEE; low energy flux), or by pairing high TDEI with high TDEE (high energy flux). Within an environment characterized by high energy dense food and a lack of need for movement, it may be particularly difficult for weight-reduced individuals to maintain energy balance in a low flux state. Most of these individuals will increase body mass due to an inability to sustain the necessary level of food restriction. This increase in TDEI may lead to the re-establishment of high energy flux at or near the original body weight. We propose that following weight loss, increasing physical activity can effectively re-establish a state of high energy flux without significant weight regain. Although the effect of extremely high levels of physical activity on TDEE may be constrained by compensatory reductions in non-activity energy expenditure, moderate increases following weight loss may elevate energy flux and encourage physiological adaptations favorable to weight loss maintenance, including better appetite regulation. It may be time to recognize that few individuals are able to re-establish energy balance at a lower body weight without permanent increases in physical activity. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for more research to better understand the role of energy flux in long-term weight maintenance.",

      "abstract": "Small children frequently swallow foreign bodies during their games. Eating too fast without masticating sufficiently or the bad habit of drinking abundantly during meals increase the danger of swallowing foreign bodies. In some professions (tailor or carpenter) people have the habit of keeping in their mouth certain objects which can easily be swallowed. The risk of swallowing foreign bodies is increased in all situations which entail a diminished ability to distinguish a foreign body once it is in the mouth: after a cerebrovascular accident, wearing a dental prothesis with a palate etc. This accident occurs also in senile and psychotic persons.",

There are significant differences between persons who diet in a healthy way and those who diet at an extreme level. Those who diet at an extreme level have significantly more problems in the period before they start to diet and have unrealistically high expectations about losing weight. They see their slimming behaviour as a solution for their psychological problems. Dieting and weight loss give them self-esteem, control and positive feelings about themselves. This positive evaluation motivates them to continue their slimming behaviour even after considerable weight loss. Only when they are confronted with all kinds of negative physical, psychological and social problems they do realize that their extreme dieting does not bring what they hoped for.",

      "title": "Potentially psychoactive constituents of cocoa-containing products",
      "abstract": "In a recent review we argued for a primarily attitudinal rather than physiological explanation of (self-reported) food craving and food “addiction” (1). We proposed that attitudes towards frequently craved foods such as chocolate can be highly ambivalent. Chocolate is “nice but naughty”: it is highly liked, but nutritionally suspect. In other words, chocolate is perceived as an indulgence, a treat not a staple food, and therefore a food that should be eaten with restraint. Paradoxically, though, attempts to resist the desire to eat chocolate can increase the salience of and thoughts about chocolate (cf 2), intensifying this desire sufficiently for it to be labelled a craving. This, perhaps together with the need to provide a reason for why resisting eating chocolate is difficult and sometimes fails, can in turn lead the individual to an explanation in terms of addiction (e.g., “chocoholism”). According to this view, chocolate is the most frequently craved food because it is the food that people most often try to resist eating. In contrast to craving, moreishness (“causing a desire for more”) occurs during rather than preceding an eating episode. Nevertheless, restraint is again an essential feature, because moreishness is experienced when the eater attempts to limit consumption before appetite for the food has been satiated (1, 3).",

Most of these suffer hayfever, which is a form of allergic rhinitis, or asthma. Many allergens (i.e. antigens that cause allergies in hypersensitive people) have been isolated and described in detail. These allergens are generally antigens derived from plant or fungal proteins. However, allergy to cats is the most common allergic condition world-wide, followed by allergy to house mite dust. All babies are capable of being allergic to foods and inhaled allergens, since their immune system is just developing the ability to react in an adult manner. Generally they only receive breast milk or formula feed for several months so the reactions are not common but, if foods are not introduced slowly enough, babies up to about nine months to one year of age can show allergic responses. Then the body learns to tolerate, or not react to, the potentially allergenic substances and the baby can eat a mixed diet without reactions. About 2–5% of adults remain allergic to foods such as cow's milk, peanuts or seafoods, and about 5–10% of children may suffer asthma, with the numbers rising each year. One-third of these may grow out of asthma, but another 10% of adults are newly added to the list of sufferers. The cost of asthma to the American economy in 1990 alone was around $3.6 billion.",

Food consumption, thoughts, and desire were assessed before and after the food was forbidden.Consistent with an ironic process account, participants' thoughts about the food increased, regardless of whether they were required to or chose to avoid it.

Welche Auswirkungen hat das Fasten auf unser Befinden? Geht es nur um Nahrungsmittel oder auch um Alkohol und Nikotin? Oder in diesen modernen Zeiten gar auch um die Abstinenz von Internet und Computer? Warum wirken fastende Menschen oft besonders glucklich? Warum dauert die Fastenzeit 40 Tage? – Fragen uber Fragen, die sich wahrscheinlich nicht nur die Leser von Europas auflagenstarkster Boulevard-Zeitung, sondern auch die Leser von Europas auflagenstarkster neuropsychiatrischer Zeitschrift gerade in diesen Tagen stellen. Wer fastet, der erlebt zunachst einmal, dass er seine Nahrungsaufnahme unter Kontrolle haben kann. Gelingt ihm das fur ein paar Tage und tut er es im Bemuhen, ein paar Pfunde zu verlieren, dann stellt sich irgendwann auf der Waage ein Erfolgserlebnis ein: Ich habe mich im Griff, kann mein Verhalten wirklich selber steuern, bin nicht Spielball sondern Spieler, Herr uber meine Geschicke. Dieses Gefuhl der erlebten Selbstkontrolle ist nicht zu unterschatzen! Oft genug haben wir es im Alltag nicht, wenn wir uns von anderen Menschen und den vielen vermeintlichen „Sachzwangen“ eingeengt fuhlen. Und das Gefuhl der fehlenden Kontrolle, des Umhergeschubstwerdens, der Ohnmacht, ist Anlass von Stress, der uns dann Korper und Seele ruiniert. Dagegen hilft nur mehr Selbstkontrolle, und genau die kann man beim Fasten direkt erleben.

This is supported by an expanding body of evidence from animal studies, human neuroscience, and brain imaging. Obese and overweight individuals also display patterns of eating behavior that resemble the ways in which addicted individuals consume drugs. Scientific and clinical questions remain: Is addiction a valid explanation of excess weight? Is food addiction a behavioural (i.e., eating) or substance (i.e., sugar) addiction, or a complex interaction of both? Should obesity be treated as a food addiction? Should we distinguish food addiction from other forms of disordered eating like Binge Eating Disorder? It is also unclear what impact food addiction explanations might have on the way in which we think about or treat people who are overweight: What impact will a food addiction diagnosis have on individuals' internalised weight-bias, stigma, and self-efficacy? Should some foods be regulated like other addictive commodities (i.e., alcohol and tobacco), whose advertising and sale is restricted, or like certain foods, which are taxed? This Special Issue addresses questions raised by the concept of food addiction.",

Only chocolate deprivation was expected to elicit cravings, as chocolate is not easily substituted, whereas vanilla is.The main effect of chocolate deprivation on consumption was qualified by an interaction with restraint. Chocolate-deprived restrained eaters consumed more chocolate food than did any other group. Restrained eaters experienced more food cravings than did unrestrained eaters and were more likely to eat the craved food. Moreover, restrained eaters deprived of chocolate spent the least time doing an anagram task before a \"taste-rating task\" in which they expected that chocolate foods might be available.Converging measures of craving indicate that deprivation causes craving and overeating, but primarily in restrained eaters.",

      "abstract": "wellness, mental health, EP life: This figure is best explained with a food analogy. A continuum of benefit to detriment is in the present and the future. Quadrant 1 is the ideal. It would be like eating something that tastes great and is nutritious. Quadrant 2 is like eating health food that tastes like cardboard but enjoying the nutrition it provides later on. Quadrant 3 is eating delicious but unhealthy junk foods that taste great in the moment but leave you feeling bad later. Quadrant 4 is the worst, where you eat something that tastes terrible, and it leaves you feeling awful later.FigureFigureFigureIf you are like us, you've lived your life focused on the future. You look forward to the prize, the achievement, even the thank yous. (Wait, what are those?) You count down the days until the end of a string of shifts. You picture yourself on vacation and how great it's going to be. You're elated when these things happen! The reward centers in your brain light up. There's no dopamine quite like walking-out-of-the-hospital-for-vacation dopamine, right? But it only lasts for a short time, leaving us deflated. How many of us thought, “If I can just get into a med school, I'll be happy,” and “Once I finish med school, I will be happy,” only to replace it with, “When I am an attending, I'll be so happy.” “When I get married....” “When I have kids....” “When I pay off my student loans....” Guess what's next? “When I retire, I'll be so happy.” What's going on? Why is there always one more hurdle to having lasting happiness? Temporary Happiness Arrival fallacy is a term coined by Tal Ben-Shahar, PhD, a Harvard-trained positive psychologist. He described it as the “illusion that once we make it, once we attain our goal or reach our destination, we will reach lasting happiness.” He came up with the idea based on his experience as an elite squash player. When he won the Israeli national championship, he thought the happiness would be enduring. All his hard work would be worth it. He was happy after winning, but only briefly, and then all the pressure and stress quickly returned. He explained why there are so many rich, “successful,” unhappy Hollywood stars. Many start out dissatisfied with life, but think, “It's OK because once I arrive, it will fix everything.” It doesn't. Fame and success give fleeting glee, but when the unhappiness returns, it is joined with hopelessness because fame didn't fix anything emotionally. The achievement or destination doesn't equal long-term happiness. Temporary happiness, yes, but not lasting. This is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of us who have strived and worked so hard to get where we are. Haven't we been told our whole lives we just have to work hard to have a happy life? Isn't this the American dream? Isn't that why we want our kids to be on the honor roll and get into a good college, so they can have happiness? We of all people should know that's not how it works. We've all worked our butts off, so we should be the happiest people on the planet, right? But a quick look around suggests the theory doesn't hold up. Moments of Growth Doctors frequently overwork at the expense of activities that replenish them: relationships, sleep, creative hobbies, exercise, etc. The singular focus of work can leave us unbalanced without intentional efforts in these areas. Even worse, sometimes our “happiness” from attaining a goal isn't happiness at all. It's relief from the relentless pressure and heavy burden that we've been carrying. Relief is a positive emotion, but it is temporary. It's transiently experienced with the release of a bad feeling. Are we supposed to stop striving for goals? No. As humans, we need meaning and purpose. There is another term Dr. Ben-Shahar coined for those who live only for momentary pleasure—floating moment fallacy. It's the false belief that happiness can be sustained by ongoing instant gratification detached from a future purpose. It isn't the pursuit of goals that is the problem. In fact, we need purpose and meaningful aspirations. It's only a trap when goal attainment is the prerequisite for reward. What do we do? Dr. Ben-Shahar said, “Attaining lasting happiness requires that we enjoy the journey on our way toward a destination we deem valuable. Happiness is not about making it to the peak of the mountain nor is it about climbing aimlessly around the mountain; happiness is the experience of climbing toward the peak.” The most important thing is to find happiness along the way to a worthy goal. Don't wait. Only a brief portion of your life is spent at the summit. Try to enjoy the moments of growth of becoming a more successful version of yourself, whatever success means to you. Don't let relationships suffer at the expense of the journey. According to Dr. Ben-Shahar, “The number one predictor of happiness is the quality time we spend with people we care about and who care about us. In other words, relationships.” Dr. Ben-Shahar recommends creating multiple simultaneous goals in and out of your work life. The goals can be something like spending more quality time with loved ones or pursuing a creative hobby. High achievers tend to get dopamine hits from checking off things on their list, so put quality time with a loved one on the list. Put celebrating progress on your list. Whatever you do, try to erase “I'll be happier when [x] happens” from your thoughts. The right time to be happier is now. Share this article on Twitter and Facebook.

      "title": "Using Your Hands to Express Your Milk",
      "abstract": "It can be useful to hand express in the first 3 days because the amount of milk you remove during this time affects what you make later on: hand expressing now can boost your long term supply. Especially in the early days, hand expression often works better than pump suction. Once your supply goes up, you can often get more milk if you use a pump and your hands at the same time. Once your milk comes in, or if you are apart from your baby for some time, your breasts might get hard (“engorged”). Hand expression helps you to soften the breast and get the flow of milk going. This also makes it easier for the baby to latch on. In an emergency, you will be able to remove milk without a pump. If your milk supply drops, you can hand express a little bit (like a teaspoon) from each breast a dozen times a day and this should help your supply go up again.",

      "title": "Food addiction in Latin America",
      "abstract": "Food addiction is a disorder characterized by an uncontrollable desire to eat foods high in fats and sugars. These foods activate the brain reward system in a similar way to drugs generating the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and oxytocin which trigger a need to repeat the behavior. In developed countries in Europe, Asia, and North America, there are reports of food addiction in children, adolescents, university students, sexual minorities, women and the adult population that suffer from obesity or overweight. In Latin America, studies conducted in Chile report that 10% of university students suffer food addiction, while in Brazil 4% of adults have the same disorder. There are few studies on the prevalence of food addiction. Likewise, validations of diagnostic instruments and studies on the effectiveness of psychotherapy are required to modify behaviors in this disorder.La adicción alimentaria es un trastorno que se caracteriza por un deseo incontrolable de ingerir alimentos con alto contenido de grasas y azúcares. Esta dependencia se debe en parte, a que dichos alimentos activan el sistema de recompensa cerebral de manera similar a las drogas. Ello genera la liberación de neurotransmisores como la dopamina y oxitocina, lo cual desencadena una necesidad de repetir la conducta. En países desarrollados (en Europa, Asia y Norteamérica), existen reportes de adicción alimentaria en niños, adolescentes, estudiantes universitarios, grupos de minorías sexuales, mujeres y población adulta que padecen obesidad y/o sobrepeso. En Latinoamérica, estudios realizados en Chile reportan que 10% de estudiantes universitarios sufren adicción alimentaria, mientras que en Brasil 4% de adultos tienen el mismo trastorno. Los estudios sobre prevalencias de adicción alimentaria son escasos. Asimismo, se requieren validaciones de instrumentos de diagnóstico y estudios sobre la efectividad de la psicoterapia para modificar conductas en este trastorno.",

Human adults across cultures show disgust towards sources of potential contamination or pathogens, and elect to avoid their ingestion or even to look at them. Stomach rhythms appear to play an important role: disgust reduces normogastric power, and the pharmacological normalisation of gastric state reduces disgust avoidance. Human children are remarkably slow to develop disgust as measured by self-report and facial expressions. Here, we investigate whether disgust-induced avoidance (measured using eye tracking) and changes in gastric rhythm (measured using electrogastrography) exist in children aged 5 to 13 years (",

For this condition, however, the word introduced by Sollier 2 , namely, sitieirgy, meaning refusing food, seems to be more appropriate. For, in the insane, the patients do not want to eat, not because they are afraid of the food, but for different reasons; either they are in a state of depression, unwilling to do anything, even eating, or they have suicidal ideas, or they have illusions that the food may be poisoned,",

It takes time to eat each piece of pizza and both players eat pizza at the same rate. One is allowed to take a next piece only after the person has finished eating the piece on hand. Also, after the first piece is taken, one can only take a piece which is adjacent to already-taken piece. This paper shows that, in this real time setting, the starting player can always eat at least two-fifth of the total size of the pizza. However, this may not be the best possible amount the starting player can eat. It is a modified problem from an original one where two players takes piece alternatively instead.",

They had less constipation but there was no difference in the use of laxatives or the prevalence of the irritable bowel syndrome. Although most runners tried to empty their bowels before running, the urgent need to have a bowel movement was still the most common reason for a runner to stop during a run. Heartburn, vomiting and bloating were more common when not training while retching, stitches and fecal incontinence were more common when running. Few runners ate before running and upper gastrointestinal symptoms while running were rare.Lower gastrointestinal symptoms may be caused by running or the running lifestyle. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms are not due to running alone.",

      "title": "The stress-eating paradox: Multiple daily measurements in adult males and females",
      "abstract": "Abstract The stress-eating relationship was examined in a prospective study of 158 subjects who completed daily records of stress and eating for 84 days, yielding 16.188 person days of observation. Using both within-subjects and between-subjects analyses, individuals were much more likely to eat less than usual than to eat more than usual in response to stressful daily problems. The likelihood of eating more did not change as severity of stress increased, but the likelihood of eating less increased substantially. There were also clear gender differences. Males had a slight tendency to eat less than to eat more across all levels of stress, except at the highest level, where eating less occurred much more frequently. In females, the tendency to eat less as opposed to eating more emerged at middle levels of stress; at the highest level of stress, females were more than three times more likely to eat less than to eat more. Individual subjects were highly consistent over levels of stress in the direction of eating; 82% of the subjects were consistent in eating more or less over the majority of their stressful periods. These results show a clear effect of stress on eating, with eating less being the predominant response.",

      "abstract": "Breakfast, the first meal of the day, is considered the most important meal throughout the day. As nutritionist Adelle Davis famously put it back in the 1960s: “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper”. Breakfast is most commonly skipped meal more than lunch and dinner specifically in the young adult in the university study period and those who wake up late. Lack of time is the main reason behind skipping meals, in general, lack of appetite, inability to cook, fasting/religion, and not being hungry. Many people are used to be in a hurry for job, business, children’s’ school in the morning where a filled stomach may prevent them to walk a long way. It is obvious that the irregular omission of breakfast may be effective in energy intake reduction over the next 24 hours and in this day, exercise performance may be compromised. There is no evidence that breakfast skipping reduces overeating or prevent weight gain. Some people argue that breakfast and good health is a marketing strategy by breakfast companies.",

      "title": "Disordered Eating and the Brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract Food addiction remains a popular yet controversial construct, which proposes that overeating and obesity arise from the consumption of “addictive” foods. This model rests on the assumption that foods, or their constituent macronutrients, elicit pharmacological effects on the brain analogous to those produced by addictive drugs. However, there has been no critical examination of whether the key pharmacological characteristics of addictive substances truly extend to food. In this chapter, we consider if two proposed addictive components of food, sugar and dietary fat, recapitulate the pharmacological properties of drugs, such as their impact on mesolimbic dopamine release. We find no convincing evidence to support the classification of sugar or dietary fats as addictive substances, particularly as addictive-like consumption in animals arises from orosensory effects alone. We caution against the implementation of food addiction as an explanation for disordered eating.",

Para la persona que hace ejercicio moderado de forma habitual, el entrenamiento, una dieta adecuada y una buena hidratacion durante todo el dia, y de forma especifica mientras dura la actividad fisica, son las maneras mas eficaces y correctas de aumentar el rendimiento. Los deportistas de elite y/o de alta competicion tienen un nivel de actividad mayor y mas intensa, su organismo esta sometido a un sobreesfuerzo, y sus metas son distintas, por lo que pueden presentar unas necesidades diferentes que han de ser individualizadas en cada momento, buscando tanto mantener y/o mejorar el estado de salud (alimentacion deportiva basica), como aumentar el rendimiento fisico (alimentacion deportiva intensiva), favorecer una buena recuperacion tras el ejercicio (alimentacion deportiva regeneradora) y prevenir ciertas patologias especificas37. En febrero de 2001, la Direccion General de Salud y Proteccion del Consumidor de la Comision Europea, a traves del Comite Cientifico de Alimentacion Humana (CCAH), redacto un informe sobre la composicion de los alimentos y las bebidas destinadas a cubrir el gasto energetico en un gran esfuerzo muscular, especialmente en los deportistas. En este documento se indica que los alimentos y liquidos especialmente adaptados ayudan a solucionar problemas especificos para que se pueda alcanzar un balance nutricional optimo. Estos efectos beneficiosos no estan limitados solo a deportistas que realizan un ejercicio muscular regular e intenso, sino tambien a aquellas personas que por sus trabajos hacen esfuerzos importantes o en condiciones adversas. El 15 de junio de 2016, la Comision Europea presento al Parlamento Europeo y al Consejo un informe sobre alimentos destinados a los deportistas. En este informe se concluye que no hay necesidad de disposiciones especificas en los alimentos para deportistas. A partir del 20 de julio de 2016 estos productos deben cumplir las normas horizontales pertinentes de la legislacion alimentaria de la UE.",

      "abstract": "Self-control is typically viewed as a battle between willpower and desire. The authors focus on the desire side of the equation and extol the positive effect of faster satiation that makes unhealthy behaviors less tempting. They demonstrate that consumers higher in trait self-control demonstrate such “healthy” satiation as they satiate faster on unhealthy foods than on healthy foods. In contrast, those with lower self-control fail to consistently show this differential pattern in their satiation rates. This difference for high self-control people can result from faster satiation for unhealthy foods, slower satiation for healthy foods, or both in combination. Moderating and mediating evidence establish that changes in attention to the amount consumed helped account for these effects on the rate of satiation. The resulting differences in satiation influence the ultimate intake of unhealthy foods, underscoring the importance of the contribution made by differential satiation rates to overconsumption and obesity.",

When summer comes around, I can't resist a barbecue and a nice glass of red wine. When I put on weight across the summer, I tell myself I will take it off come September, when I get back to serious business again. The thing is, there is never a time in the future when I can take weight off by simply watching what I eat over a short period of time, so I just have to watch myself all the time. How can I not eat too much, when there is so much good and tasty food around, and when I love my food, as I always have? This chapter considers the misunderstanding that everyone can regulate their appetite and eat only what their share is, for a stable body weight and stable energy balance. It just doesn't work like that. Some people can very easily overeat without noticeable effect, while many of us cannot and dare not, without putting on weight.",

      "abstract": "What is this ‘physical activity’ thing people keep talking about? Simply put, physical activity is movement of the body (this may be your upper or lower body or both) which expends energy. It is important to remember that physical activity does not just mean exercise! Physical activity is an ‘umbrella term’ which encompasses a range of domains, such as being active in your leisure-time (like taking the dog for a walk or going to a dance class), walking and cycling for transport (this may be going to the local shops or it may be in an effort to beat the peak hour traffic), being active at work (like lifting boxes or laying bricks) and even undertaking active chores at home such as gardening and vacuuming. In Australia, it is recommended that adults accumulate 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity (equivalent to that of a brisk walk) on most, if not all days of the week. If preferred, this activity may be broken up into three 10-minute bouts, which is good news for busy people! This ‘dose’ of physical activity is the minimum amount required for health benefits and has been shown to prevent a number of chronic illnesses that will be discussed in further detail later in this chapter. So why has the government spent up big on mass media campaigns such as ‘Life. Be in it’ (thinking back to the 90s — who remembers the couch potato cartoon character Norm who was the face of that campaign?), and more recently the ‘Swap it, don’t stop it’",

Behaviours around food consumption can range from 'normal' to disordered, where some people may develop eating patterns that suggest a preoccupation with food or weight. This preoccupation can lead to inappropriate compensatory behaviours, such as purging or excessive exercise, or dysphoric mood following food consumption. This article discusses the continuum between 'normal' eating behaviours and eating disorders, with a focus on binge eating behaviour and binge eating disorder. The author also describes the use of a screening tool for identifying binge eating behaviour and suggests ways in which nurses might support patients in addressing disordered eating behaviours.",

Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders affect a cat's stomach and intestines, resulting in pain and other problems. Efficient digestion is\r\nessential for your cat to be able to build and repair tissues and obtain energy. Digestive disorders in cats are quite common and most clear up within a few days. But some cats need long-term management because they have regular or permanent digestive problems. GI disorders can lead, to dehydration, acid-base and electrolyte imbalances and malnutrition so it is important to recognize the signs Cats with intestinal disease have a wide range of clinical signs. Weight loss, despite a normal or increased appetite is very common. Cats that are chronically ill usually have a loss of fat over the spine (so that the spine is palpable). Other cats have routinely vomit food, fluid and or hairball. Contrary to what many pet lovers believe, hairballs are not normal in cats, and they are not due to a grease eficiency. The clinical signs of cats with intestinal disease are often similar to those of other diseases (chronic kidney disease, urinary tract obstruction in male\r\ncats, chronic progressive kidney disease, diabetes and hyperthyroidism). Gastro intestinal problem in cat is a significant health problem for which there is no universally accepted pharmacological treatment. The combination of Viusid pet is supplementary Food.

      "title": "Warum geht es immer wieder um Essstörungen?",
      "abstract": "sich die Hinweise darauf, dass die Adipositas (Ubergewicht mit einem BMI > 25 kg/m) nicht nur bei den Einwohnern der USA, sondern auch in Europa rasant zunimmt. Ein Uberfluss von Waren in Lebensmittelgeschaften und Supermarkten ist seit sicherlich 50 Jahren in Europa Standard. Das Angebot reicht von Bioprodukten (fur ernahrungsbewusst gesund lebende Konsumenten?) uber kalorienreduzierte Nahrungsmittelsegmente (fur gewichtsbewusste Kunden?) bis hin zu hochkalorischen Produkten (fur korperliche Schwerarbeiter?). Eine Auswahl von 50–60 verschiedenen Salaten in Delikatessenabteilungen, uberbordende Fleischtheken bei Metzgern oder 40 verschiedene Brotsorten in Backwarengeschaften sind keine Ausnahme. Die offensichtliche Diskrepanz zwischen Angebotsvielfalt und tatsachlich benotigten Nahrungsmitteln ist eklatant und kann nicht nur zur Reizuberflutung, sondern auch zu Fehlentscheidungen der Konsumenten fuhren. Lebensmitteleinkaufe mit einem Hungergefuhl fuhren bei den meisten Menschen, also auch solchen mit einem gesunden Essverhalten, aufgrund des grosen Nahrungsmittelangebots haufig zu groseren Einkaufen und moglicherweise auch zu einem groseren Verzehr als geplant. Anders als bei Suchtmittelmissbrauch oder -abhangigkeit konnen Menschen mit schwerem Ubergewicht (Adipositas per magna) keine Nahrungsmittelabstinenz ausuben, um ihr Problemverhalten zu beeinflussen. Vielmehr geht es um ein kontrolliertes Essverhalten. Hier ware eine Beschrankung des Nahrungsmittelsangebots (also nicht alles kaufen konnen) hilfreich, jedoch vollig unrealistisch, da sich die allermeisten Menschen in ihrer personlichen Wahlfreiheit eingeschrankt fuhlen wurden und so einem Vorgehen kommerzielle Interessen entgegenstehen wurden. Wir haben es also mit einem Problem zu tun, das dem Uberfluss an einem lebensnotwendigen Gut, der Nahrung, entspringt. Sowohl aus psychopathologischen als auch aus gesundheitspsychologischen Grunden stellt sich sehr schnell die Frage, weshalb es Menschen gibt, die trotz dieses «ungunstigen» Umweltfaktors ein gesundes Essverhalten zeigen, das mit einem der Norm entsprechenden Es ist schon interessant, dass im vergangenen Jahr 80% der mehrheitlich weiblichen Studierenden am Psychologischen Institut der Universitat Zurich bei freier Themenwahl fur ihr Abschlussreferat in Klinischer Psychologie den Vortrag zu Essstorungen gehalten haben. Was sind die Grunde? Wurden die Vorlesungen so einseitig abgehalten? Gibt es einen Forschungsschwerpunkt zu diesen Storungsbildern? Beides ist nicht zutreffend. Konnte es sein, dass Korpergewicht und Aussehen eine auserst hohe Relevanz fur Frauen im Alter zwischen 25 und 30 Jahren haben und deshalb das Interesse fur ein stark dekompensiertes Essverhalten besonders gros ist? Diese Hypothese ist recht wahrscheinlich. Nach wie vor ist es so, dass kleine Grosen bei Damenbekleidung erstrebenswert sind und die Frage nach groseren Grosen in den meisten Bekleidungsgeschaften zum Selbstsicherheitstest wird. Das besondere mediale Interesse an der Einfuhrung eines Mindestgewichts fur Mannequins an Modenschauen (zuletzt in Spanien im Herbst 2010) nahrte die Hoffnung, dass es eine Kehrtwende im Attraktivitatsurteil bezuglich eines gesunden Gewichts, d.h. eines Body Mass Index (BMI) zwischen 20 und 25 kg/m bei Frauen im Alter bis Ende 40, geben wurde. Weit gefehlt: Der «Cut-off» fur das Gewicht der Mannequins lag bei 17,5 BMI-Punkten, also entsprechend der Kriterien des Diagnostischen und Statistischen Manuals psychischer Storungen (DSM) genau an der Grenze zur Anorexia nervosa. Das bedeutet, dass nur jene Models nicht mehr auf den Laufsteg gebeten wurden, deren Gewicht an der Grenze zur Anorexie lag. Die ungunstige Nachahmungswirkung eines geringen Korpergewichts bleibt somit anscheinend erhalten. Die britische Presse wurde kritisiert, dass Titelfotos von untergewichtigen Frauen das Imitationsverhalten bezuglich einer Gewichtsreduktion bei Leserinnen fordern wurde. Dies wurde von den entsprechenden Magazinen dahingehend kommentiert, dass ein Titelbild einer extrem schlanken, aufwandig gestylten Frau die Verkaufszahlen am Kiosk nachweislich steigern wurde und deshalb auf diesen okonomischen Vorteil nicht verzichtet werden konne.

      "abstract": "Picky eating is an eating disorder that is often found in toddlers. Picky eating, which is also known as fussy eating, is characterized by a child's unwillingness to try new foods as well as a very strong food preference. This of course will have a bad effect on the child because the nutritional composition of the food is not balanced. Some studies said that children with picky eating eat less protein, vegetables and fruits. However, they eat lots of sweet and fatty foods. The causes of picky eating are late introduction of food when weaning, parents who put too much pressure on their children to eat something, and the protective factor of parents who just want to give the same food over and over again. In addition, several studies have stated that the duration of breastfeeding is also one of the causes of picky eating habits. This is because breastfed babies are introduced to the various flavors of breast milk, making the transition from breast milk to complementary foods easier for children.However, because there is no consistent evidence, the conclusion is there is no relationship between the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and picky eating in toddlers.",

      "title": "Infants and children consuming atypical diets: Vegetarianism and macrobiotics",
      "abstract": "Alternative diets have been recognized for centuries. In his 1813 pamphlet, A Vindication of Natural Diet, the poet Shelley wrote, “There is no disease, bodily or mental, which adoption of vegetable diet and pure water has not infallibly mitigated, wherever the experiment has been fairly tried” (1).\r\n\r\nIn the rapidly expanding multicultural population of North America, vegetarianism is a popular dietary practice. It may be based on religious or cultural beliefs, or on economic, health or ethical concerns. A 2002 survey (2) found that approximately 4% of Canadian adults consumed a vegetarian diet that excluded meat, poultry and fish. Furthermore, 20% to 25% of adults in the United States reported eating four or more meatless meals weekly, or that they ‘usually or sometimes maintain a vegetarian diet’, suggesting an increasing interest in vegetarianism (2). Because parents are the principal providers of what their infants eat, vegetarian parents often wean their children onto the family’s vegetarian diet. It is important to note that atypical diets are more likely to cause problems of malnutrition in children than in adults due to their greater nutrient requirements relative to body weight. Thus, without the appropriate care for these children, health issues may arise that could concern health care professionals.\r\n\r\nVegetarianism is a very broad category consisting of diets with varying degree of animal product consumption. This distinction is important because the more strictly vegetarianism is followed, the more difficult it becomes to guarantee an adequate diet for growing infants and children. For example, lacto-ovo-vegetarians include eggs, milk and dairy products along with a plant food selection; however, they refrain from animal flesh. On the other hand, a lacto-vegetarian diet consists of plant foods such as grains, legumes, nuts, fruits and vegetables, complemented with milk and milk products, with avoidance of eggs and animal flesh. Pure or total vegetarians (or ‘vegans’) reject all foods of animal origin, including milk and eggs. Finally, another atypical diet that is far more restrictive than pure vegetarianism is the macrobiotic diet. The original macrobiotic dietary regimen comprised of 10 diets, ranging from the lowest level, which includes 10% cereal, 30% vegetables, 10% soups, 30% animal products, 15% salads and fruits, and 5% desserts, to the highest level, which is composed of 100% cereals (3). The revised macrobiotic diet may contain whole-grain cereals (mainly unpolished rice), vegetables and pulses, with small additions of seaweeds, fermented foods, nuts, seeds and seasonal fruit (4).",

It has been suggested that the prevalences of food and food‐related cues contribute to overeating and that dieters are particularly sensitive to food stimuli. In the present study, the influence of dieting was examined in a representative sample of college students who were exposed to a list of written food cues or who served as controls. The list of food cues increased motivation to eat in nondieting subjects, but did not appear to influence the appetites of dieters. It may be that dieters are more resistant to the effects of more subtle food cues, even when many cues are presented sequentially.",

      "title": "Therapeutic implications of drug 'holidays'",
      "abstract": "While a patient may appear to be fully compliant with respect to quantity of medication ingested, the timing of doses can vary considerably. This may introduce protracted intervals between doses, particularly if dosing frequency is greater than once daily. This commonly presents in the form of drug holidays, where dosing is omitted for 1 or more days, followed by a resumption of full-strength dosing, possibly resulting in excessive drug effects when dosing suddenly resumes, rebound effects when dosing is suddenly stopped and a period without effective drug action. Poor compliance has not only been associated with poorer treatment outcome, but also with financial consequences. It has been suggested that hospitalization due to non-compliance accounts for 11.7% of all healthcare expenditure in the U.S.A. Differences between drugs, in terms of both their concentration-time profiles and their duration of action, will lead to some agents being more effective than others in the face of interruptions in dosage. A drug with an intrinsically long duration of action, such as the calcium antagonist amlodipine, will provide better therapeutic coverage than those with a shorter duration of action and therefore minimize effects generated by an intermittent pattern of dosing.",

      "title": "Portion Distortion",
      "abstract": "Many patients are told to lose weight and watch the fat in their diet to help with heart health and reduce risk factors, but few are successful in this endeavor. Why? For one thing, many have no idea where to begin when attempting weight loss. They don't know a healthy fat from a trans fat and they have heard so much conflicting nutrition information they have lost faith in nutrition science. However, with some guidance, they can learn some key strategies to help them get started on their risk reduction journey and clarify many of the misconceptions. One of the key strategies in weight control is to become aware of portion sizes. Our patients are accustomed to larger portions and “super-sizing” in restaurants and at home. For example, a recommended serving of pasta or starch (rice, hot cereal) is 1/2 cup or 1 ounce, yet it is not uncommon to be served 3 1/2 cups of pasta at a restaurant. According to the United States Department of Agriculture's MyPyramid, the average person should be consuming about 6 ounces daily from the starch group. So when we go to our favorite Italian restaurant, we are getting more than our daily allotment of starch in just one dish, and that isn't even counting the bread that comes with the entree! Patients are further distressed when they learn that a serving of juice is only 4 ounces (most of us don't even have 4 ounce glasses at home), a serving of meat should be about 3 ounces (not 8–12 ounces as normally served at a restaurant), and one cup (8 ounces) of milk is what they should be having instead of the venti (20 ounce) mocha at Starbucks. Some simple strategies to get portions under control can be implemented to aid patients in their weight goals. First, measuring portions at home will help patients see exactly what they are eating. Many patients have been shocked to find that their “1 cup” of cereal is actually 2 cups. By measuring portions, they can see where adjustments can be made and this will also help them to eyeball portions when they are eating out or at a friend's house. They needn't measure foods all the time, just a few days of detective work will let them know what their bowls, cups, plates, and serving utensils hold. Another key opportunity to reduce portions is to use smaller plates, cups, and bowls. Small portions on an 8 inch plate give the illusion that we will be satisfied with the meal. Small portions on the more common 12 inch plate lead one to feel deprived. In addition, the larger the plate, the more likely our patients are to fill it. While they are filling their plate, a good suggestion is to fill half of it with vegetables. There has been ample research on the benefits of low energy density foods in aiding with reducing overall calorie intake and increasing satiation. For those who like to “super-size,” vegetables will fit the bill. Some research has suggested that people also tend to eat more from larger packages, which are all too common these days with the increase in warehouse-type stores. To help offset this tendency, patients are encouraged to divide the foods in the larger package into multiple individual sized portions and keep those on hand. No more mindless eating out of the bag or box. In case your patients cannot remember what a serving size is supposed to be, or they don't always carry their food scale or measuring cups everywhere they go, they just need to reference their hand or common items to be reminded. A 3 ounce serving of meat is considered to be the size of a deck of cards, or the palm of one's hand. Three ounces of fish may look like a checkbook. The size of a woman's fist is about one cup of grain or cut up fruit or vegetables. Half of a baseball is about 1/2 cup of cooked grain, rice, or pasta. An ounce of cheese is about the size of a thumb, 4 dice put together, or a one inch square. One teaspoon of margarine or spread is about the size of one die. If portions are a problem because of frequent restaurant eating, patients have several options. They can consider splitting dishes with companions, thereby saving money and calories. They could also take half (or more) of their meal home. In that case, it is best to ask for the doggie bag when the meal arrives, so that the extra half can be packed away and not tempting when the meal is over. Ordering senior or child-sized portions at restaurants, if available, will reduce intake as well as just ordering from the appetizer menu. When patients increase their awareness of portion sizes, it gives them the ability to make adjustments in their intake to help with weight loss. The tips included in this article can lead to adequate calorie savings to promote a healthful weight loss of one to two pounds a week. However, with the advent of television programs such as The Biggest Loser, this may not be as rapid a weight loss as patients are seeing on television. This is an excellent opportunity to share realistic weight loss expectations with patients. There are many factors contributing to weight gain, and adjusting portions is a proven way of creating a calorie deficit. A referral to a registered dietitian can give patients additional help in reaching their health goals.

The drive for feeding is particularly strong in humans whose large brains require large energy support. This starts immediately after birth; the newborn child being able to taste sucrose and suck the sweet and fat from its mother's milk. At present, mothers are generally advised to breastfeed children as often as they like, which may be up to 15 times a day. At the same time, childhood obesity is rapidly developing. One reason for the rapidly increasing prevalence of childhood obesity may be overfeeding with snack food. Conclusion: We hypothesize that non‐rule breastfeeding favours the development of snacking throughout the day during childhood, a habit which in turn favours the development of obesity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract If you ate the above meal you might well suffer some discomfort after- wards, because you would almost certainly have consumed more than 3 grams of monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is commonly used as a flavour enhancer, particularly in oriental cooking. For some people this would be enough to trigger an intolerance reaction of dry mouth, hot cheeks, itchy neck, and a headache-in other words the infamous Chinese Restaurant Syndrome (CRS). But if you are particularly sensitive to MSG you don’t need to eat in such a place to suffer from CRS, as the case study in the box shows.",

      "title": "Food Interactions With Once-A-Day Theophylline Preparations: A Review",
      "abstract": "AbstractAt present, theophylline is used predominantly as sustained-release dosage forms. Since the mid-seventies many such products have been introduced and have found huge application for use with a dosage interval of 12 hr (‘twice-a-day’ preparations). Since 1983 theophylline has also been available as preparations that can be given with an interval of 24 hr (‘once-a-day’ preparations). The release of theophylline from sustained-release dosage forms can be influenced (either increased or decreased) by concomitant intake of food. Obviously, ultra-slow-releasing products are most vulnerable to food effects. With some preparations the composition of the meal, especially its fat content, determines the degree of the food effect. The effect of meal timing and content on once-a-day theophylline preparations must be known since rather large doses are ingested all at a single time. If food can alter the release of theophylline in an unexpected manner from ultra-slow preparations, drug effectiveness may be impaired if release is inhibited or toxicity might result if sudden release of drug occurs. Herein, information about food interaction with once-a-day theophylline preparations is reviewed as this topic is important both for clinicians as well as those concerned with chronopharmacologic investigations of such medications.Key Words: Once-a-day theophyllinemeal effectsmeal fat contentDilatrane A.P.®Theo-24®Theo-Dur®Uniphyl®Uniphyllin®",

Il digiuno intermittente ( Intermittent Fasting ) e il Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF) negli animali (anche noto come Time-Restricted Eating , TRE nell’uomo) hanno raggiunto una crescente popolarità parallelamente al consistente aumento delle evidenze scientifiche nell’ambito della cronobiologia, con la recente attribuzione del premio Nobel per la Medicina nel 2017 a Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash e Michael W. Young quale riconoscimento per il contributo alle scoperte dei meccanismi molecolari che sottendono il ritmo circadiano. Il sistema circadiano regola il metabolismo in un ciclo di circa ventiquattro ore, determinando una ritmicità circadiana endogena nel dispendio energetico, nell’appetito, nella sensibilità insulinica e in altri processi metabolici. Molti di tali processi, tra cui la sensibilità insulinica e la termogenesi indotta dalla dieta, presentano un picco nella prima parte della giornata. Numerose evidenze sia nell’animale sia nell’uomo sottolineano che alimentarsi in momenti della giornata che siano asincroni rispetto ai ritmi delle suddette funzioni metaboliche promuova l’eccesso ponderale e le alterazioni metaboliche ad esso associate.",

Rats allowed to drink in the box during conditioning form a larger CR than rats merely injected with hypertonic or isotonic procain who are prevented from drinking in the box: response blocking during extinction eliminated if no experience of drinking water in the box occurs either during baseline or during conditioning. Blocking the drinking response, like blocking shock avoidance, markedly reduces its high resistance to extinction. This suggests that rats overdrink to avoid anticipated illness, and fail to extinguish partially because they are never exposed to the fact that no illness will occur even if no drinking occurs.",

      "abstract": "Adult humans often undertake acute fasts for cosmetic, religious or medical reasons. For example, an estimated 14% of US adults have reported using fasting as a means to control body weight and this approach has long been advocated as an intermittent treatment for gross refractory obesity. There are unique historical data sets on extreme forms of food restriction that give insight into the consequences of starvation or semi-starvation in previously healthy, but usually non-obese subjects. These include documented medical reports on victims of hunger strike, famine and prisoners of war. Such data provide a detailed account on how the body adapts to prolonged starvation. It has previously been shown that fasting for the biblical period of 40 days and 40 nights is well within the overall physiological capabilities of a healthy adult. However, the specific effects on the human body and mind are less clearly documented, either in the short term (hours) or in the longer term (days). This review asks the following three questions, pertinent to any weight-loss therapy, (i) how effective is the regime in achieving weight loss, (ii) what impact does it have on psychology? and finally, (iii) does it work long-term?",

      "abstract": "La préférence bien documentée pour la minceur du corps féminin, qui prévaut dans la culture occidentale depuis quelques dizaines d’années, conduit à une incitation toujours plus forte à faire des régimes pour perdre du poids afin de correspondre à l’idéal minceur. Malheureusement, notre recherche des 30 dernières années a démontré de façon répétée que les personnes qui sont perpétuellement au régime (c’est-à-dire en restriction cognitive) ont davantage tendance à vivre des épisodes de désinhibition (c’est-à-dire de perte de contrôle) et à trop manger qu’à réussir à s’inhiber ou à manger moins. Nous avons assisté simultanément à une augmentation du phénomène des régimes et de la disponibilité et à la palatabilité des aliments. Les incitations à consommer sont maintenant omniprésentes dans la société, formant un « environnement toxique » en ce qui concerne les aliments et l’acte alimentaire. J’aborderai les effets de ces incitations omniprésentes à manger sur le comportement alimentaire, notamment sur celui des mangeurs en restriction cognitive et/ou au régime de façon chronique. Il semblerait tout particulièrement que la vue, l’odeur, le goût et la simple présence de grandes quantités ou de grandes portions de nourriture conduisent à une augmentation de la prise alimentaire, surtout chez les personnes les plus soucieuses de contrôler leurs apports, c’est-à-dire les mangeurs en restriction cognitive et/ou au régime de façon chronique. Les observations indiquent ainsi que la présence de stimuli alimentaires agréables interrompt les tentatives de régime et de restriction. Je présenterai des études montrant que l’absence d’incitations à manger peut en effet inhiber les prises alimentaires et donc aider à diminuer les apports. Les périodes de pénurie de nourriture et d’absence de stimuli alimentaires pourraient donc faciliter le fait de manger moins et limiter ainsi les apports énergétiques. Malheureusement, cependant, avec les stimuli alimentaires omniprésents de la culture occidentale, notre société favorise plus facilement l’augmentation de la consommation alimentaire que sa diminution. Il ne semble pas réaliste de vouloir essayer d’empêcher nos patients en surpoids d’être exposés à des incitations à manger. Nous devrons plutôt chercher des stratégies qui les aideront à ne pas se laisser emporter par celles-ci.",

Disinhibition can also result from emotional distress, with ego-threats more likely than physical fear to disinhibit eating. Low self-esteem dieters are more likely to become disinhibited than are high self-esteem dieters in response to both preloading and distress manipulations. Recent theoretical perspectives on disinhibition are examined and the possible role of self-awareness is highlighted.",

Social and physical factors as well as decreased energy expenditure may be part of the explanation for the decreased food intake; however, it is possible that changes in hunger mechanisms are also involved, but more studies similar to those conducted on thirst are needed. The consumption of a varied diet depends in part on sensory‐specific satiety, that is, the decrease in the pleasantness of a food as it is consumed. We have shown that sensory‐specific satiety changes with age such that it was absent in individuals over the age of 65 and this could be part of the explanation of why the elderly consume more monotonous diets. Additional basic studies on how aging affects the controls of food intake will suggest ways to improve the nutritional status of the elderly.

      "title": "THE PSYCHODYNAMICS OF THE \"DRY DRUNK\"",
      "abstract": "Our study of the responses of the 52 respondents to the questionnaire on the dry drunk leads us to the following conclusions: 1. The dry drunk is experienced by the majority of alcoholics who have maintained sobriety over a long period. 2. The occupation of an alcoholic has no statistical significance in maintaining sobriety. 3. A number of alcoholics will drink from 10 to 20 years before they begin to maintain sobriety. 4. Dry drunks generally occur within the first year of sobriety ( occasionally during the early months). 5. This symptom occurs irregularly and with diminishing intensity as the period of sobriety lengthens. 6. The dry drunk is characterized by a feeling of deep depression and frustration and by indecision regarding taking a drink. 7. \"Inner life\" is largely responsible for precipitating a dry drunk. 8. The dry drunk often is preceded by the same feelings. 9. The principal feelings after a dry drunk are relief and thankfulness at not drinking during this period of craving. 10. Drugs are not used to combat the moods and feelings of a dry drunk nor to produce similar feelings. 11. Alcoholics are irritable, restless, and impatient during a dry drunk. 12. After a dry drunk one's thoughts, feelings, and behavior return to normal. 13. A. A. members are the persons most helpful during a dry drunk while spouses, other members of the family, and former drinking companions are the least helpful. 14. Dry drunks may be prevented by contacts with A. A. and efforts to keep the mind off the drinking problem. 15. Dry drunks are generally related to one's mood swings 16. The financial status generally improves when sobriety is maintained over an extended period. 17. The dry drunks described by our respondents have a number of the same characteristics as the \" late withdrawal symptoms\" described by Wellman. We feel that this study has been useful in clarifying our thinking on the dry drunk, in indicating sources of help for persons who are experiencing or may suffer dry drunks, and in pointing out areas for further study. We are impressed with the thoughtful, painstaking way in which the questionnaires were answered and with the willingness of the respondents to elaborate in detail on their experiences.",

      "abstract": "Features of ingestion of a large amount of soil or non-nutritive substance are found more frequently in children who spend a great deal of time outdoors as a feature of hand-to-mouth activities, although such behaviour is quite rare in adulthood. Geophagia is an intentional, chronic, and often non-addictive consumption of soil. It has a number of features similar to those of addictive disorders; thus, this case series emphasizes this view, challenging the classification of pica as an eating disorder.

      "abstract": "Substance use refers to the intake of drugs, like alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, inhalants, tobacco, and other harmful substances that lead to the deterioration of oneself, society, or both. It comprises both physical dependence and psychological dependence. Physical dependence caused by excessive intake of a drug refers to a change in the physiological state in which withdrawal symptoms develop when drugs are discontinued whereas psychological dependence refers to the state of need to continue using the drug even without physical dependence. Substance use also known as drug abuse or drug addiction is usage of drugs up to a certain level that disrupts the individual return to its normal state or condition prior to the intake. It could range from mild, moderate or severe depending on the drug intake. Addiction can supposedly be a form of drug abuse in terms of severity. Addiction refers to the need to be associated with something (here a substance) ignoring the adverse effects it can cause. It can also refer to a strong inclination towards repeated use of a substance. The higher the addiction, the higher the risk of developing a substance use disorder (SUD).",

      "abstract": "This article explores recent research in psychology, physiology, endocrinology, and animal behavior that bears on the relationship between compulsive athleticism and the eating disorders. There are several differences and a number of likenesses between these groups. Both groups are composed of persistent, perfectionistic, high-achieving persons. Compulsive (“addicted”) athletes appear healthier than eating-disordered patients on psychological tests, even though the athletes may do or say things that appear irrational. The relationship between compulsive athleticism and the eating disorders can best be described in terms of a risk-factor model. Perfectionistic persons can be easily caught up in a diet or exercise program and can become even more committed through social reinforcement and the formation of a reciprocal feedback loop. When perfectionistic persons engage in extreme exertion while following a restricted, “healthy” diet, this can increase obsessional behavior by affecting mood and cognition. Eating-disordered patients experience similar changes in personality and behavior secondary to stress and dietary restriction.",

When large doses are used, insulin shock is prone to occur during fasting, especially at night.<sup>1</sup>In severe diabetes heavy glycosuria occurs after meals.<sup>2</sup>Supplementary injection of ordinary insulin helps to correct such faults, but even so control in many cases remains imperfect and the penalty of multiple injections is imposed.<sup>3</sup> Mild diabetes is easily controlled with protamine zinc insulin injected once daily.<sup>4</sup>This does not imply that it is an ideal insulin, because almost any type of depot insulin will do just as well in small doses for mild diabetes.",

Menstruasyon ağrıları ve hormonal değişiklikler bu etkiyi ortaya çıkarır. Östrojen, progesteron, luteinizan ve folikül hormonları arasındaki etkileşimler bu döngünün düzenlenmesinde önemli bir rol oynar. Östrojen hormonunun etkisi özellikle belirgindir ve farklı siklus evrelerinde değişen seviyelerde salgılanır. Bu hormon, beyin kimyasında ve sinir sisteminde değişikliklere yol açarak duygusal durum ve davranışlarda dalgalanmalara neden olabilir. Özellikle premenstrüel sendrom yaşayan kadınlar, menstrüasyon öncesi dönemde depresif ruh hali, irritabilite, anksiyete ve yiyecek istekleri gibi semptomlar yaşayabilirler. Beslenme tercihleri, hormonal değişiklikler ve duygusal durumlarla ilişkilidir. Araştırmalar, menstrüasyon öncesi dönemde kadınların özellikle tatlı, yağlı veya karbonhidrat içeren yiyeceklere yönelik isteklerinin arttığını göstermektedir. Bu isteklerin, serotonin hormonu seviyeleriyle ilişkili olabileceği düşünülmektedir. Ayrıca, menstrüasyon döneminde demir kaybı yaşanması nedeniyle demir açısından zengin besinlere olan ihtiyaç artabilir. Kadınlar genellikle menstrüasyon döneminde daha fazla kırmızı et, yeşil yapraklı sebzeler ve demir takviyeleri gibi demir içeren gıdalar tüketmeye yönelebilirler. Ancak, bu konuda daha fazla araştırma yapılması gerekmektedir. Menstrual siklusun beslenme tercihleri üzerindeki etkilerini tam olarak anlamak için daha kapsamlı çalışmalara ihtiyaç vardır.",

A ingestão de alimentos calóricos de maneira obsessiva, por indivíduos ansiosos, pode levar ao surgimento de doenças metabólicas crônica, como a obesidade. Isso acontece devido a um desequilíbrio hormonal e psíquico, na qual o indivíduo para tentar fugir de sensações desagradáveis passa a ingerir uma grande quantidade de comida. Assim, devido ao aumento de casos de ansiedade na sociedade contemporânea, é preciso ficar atento em relação aos hábitos de vida, principalmente em relação a alimentação e estilo de vida diários.

Trividha Upasthambha (the body's sub-pillars) and Ahara (food) are two of the key pillars for a healthy lifestyle, according to Ayurveda. Ayurveda places a strong emphasis on eating a balanced diet that promotes health and nourishment. Viruddha Ahara (incompatible diet) is the term for a diet that throws off the equilibrium between the body's components. Combining two foods or following a certain diet can be hazardous; this is known as an incompatible diet. Gara Visha (artificial poison) is comparable to even an unsuitable diet. Viruddha (incompatible diet) refers to foods that, when ingested, aggravate the Doshas but do not eliminate them from the body, resulting un anomalies in Dhatu. If consumed concurrently and consistently, the incompatible diet might be compared to poison and manufactured poisoning. The western way of life exposes people to poisons on a large scale. In the context of Viruddha Aaharajanit Vyadhis (incompatible food-induced diseases) and their prevention in Brihattrayi, the current article reviews Viruddha Ahara (incompatible diet).",

      "title": "Omega‐3 Fatty Acids During Pregnancy",
      "abstract": "During pregnancy, your baby gets most of his or her food from the foods you eat and vitamins you take.Omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3s) are an important family of building blocks needed during pregnancy and breastfeeding.The two most important omega-3s are DHA and EPA.Our bodies cannot make these fatty acids, so we have to get them from food.What Are the Benefits of Omega-3s?Omega-3s are important to health.They can lower blood pressure and reduce heart diseases and other health problems.Omega-3s improve your baby's eye and brain growth and early development.Taking in enough omega-3s can lower your baby's chances of getting asthma and other allergic conditions.They also may lower your risk of giving birth too early, and of having depression after you have your baby (postpartum depression).Where Are Omega-3s Found?Only a few foods contain omega-3s.They are mostly found in fatty fish like salmon, sardines, and trout.Some eggs are high in DHA because of the diet fed to the hens.They are sold as high-DHA eggs, and have about 150 mg of DHA per egg.Omega-3s are also now added to certain foods (fortified) like some brands of milk, juice, and yogurt. Should I Worry About Eating Certain Fish?Because of mercury contamination of our oceans, rivers, and lakes, almost all fish contain some mercury.Some fish contain too much mercury.Some fish may also have polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin from industrial pollution.High amounts of mercury and PCBs in your body can cause problems with your baby's brain growth, so fish with high levels of these toxins should not be eaten during pregnancy.Check local advisories on the safety of fish from local waters.Fish advisories are available from your local health department and online from state agencies.The health benefits of eating low-mercury fish during pregnancy outweigh the risks, so DO eat safe fish during pregnancy and while you are breastfeeding your baby.How Can I Make Sure I Eat Fish Safely?Choose fish that are low in mercury.Remove skin and fat before cooking.Baking, broiling, steaming, or grilling fish lets the fat drain away and reduces PCBs in fish.Do not eat raw fish or shellfish.How Much Omega-3s Do I Need?Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding should get about 200 to 300 mg of omega-3s per day. How Do I Get Enough Omega-3s?Because omega-3s stay in the body for a few days, eating two servings of fatty fish per week can give you the 200 to 300 mg per day that you need.One serving is a 6-ounce portion of cooked fish.If you do not eat fish, or do not want to eat it every week, you can get fish oil as a pill or liquid you can swallow.Purified fish oil in pills or liquid form have all PCBs and dioxin removed.Read the label carefully to make sure there are at least 200 mg of omega-3s.Fish oil pills generally do not have side effects, although some women say they have a fishy aftertaste with burping.Cutting down fried and processed foods in your diet will help your body's ability to use the omega-3s you are taking in.Fish liver oils like cod liver oil should be avoided in pregnancy because they can cause dangerous levels of vitamin A in your body.",

While patients with eating disorders focus on food quantity, orthorexic individuals focus on pure and quality of food. Orthorexia nervosa is not weight loss fast but enormous phobia about eating only ‘clean and pure’ foods. Orthorexia nervosa should be classified as a new eating disorder or at least a new neuropsychiatric disorder. Further studies about nutrional, cognitive, and eating habits of ON have to be done in order to determine clearly the hypercorrect position of orthorexia nervosa.",

Aus diesem Grund sollte Gewichtsstigma nie als Instrument zur Bekampfung von Adipositas verwendet werden. \r\nDie Annahme, Ubergewicht sowie Gewichtszunahme resultieren aus Mangel an Selbstbeherrschung und Selbstverantwortung, fuhrt zu impliziten und expliziten Formen des Gewichtsstigma. Infolgedessen werden ubergewichtige Personen oft als faul, zugellos und willensschwach (explizites Stigma) dargestellt. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist, ausgehend von impliziten Gewichtsstigmen unter Nutzung qualitativer Forschungsmethoden herauszufinden, inwiefern Ernahrungsexperten in deutschsprachigen Fachbuchern gewichtsstigmatisierende Aussagen verwenden. Dafur wurde eine Kombination aus der Inhaltsanalyse nach Philipp Mayring (2002) und des thematischen Kodierens nach Uwe Flick (2005) verwendet. Zur Unterstutzung der Auswertung wurde teilweise das Textanalyseprogramm Atlas.ti. herangezogen.\r\nGesundheitsexperten bedienen sich haufig beider Stigmaformen (implizit und explizit). Im Gesundheitswesen ausern sich diese Vorurteile durch eine schlechtere medizinische Versorgung. Implizite Einstellungen sanken von 2001 bis 2013, wahrend explizite Einstellungen in diesem Zeitraum verstarkt vorkamen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen die Wichtigkeit einer sorgfaltig durchdachten Wortwahl. Ernahrungsexperten gehen teilweise mit gutem Beispiel voran, indem sie sich in Fachbuchern einer neutralen Sprache bedienen.\r\nObwohl diese Beobachtung von groser Bedeutung ist, sind bis heute keine qualitativen Forschungsergebnisse veroffentlicht worden, wie implizite Gewichtsstigmatisierungen von Gesundheitsexperten transportiert werden.",

      "abstract": "While they do not necessarily present the same health risk, such other problems as compulsive shopping and eating have similarly serious implications for both physical and emotional health. All of these behaviors share a common theme reflecting difficulty with impulse control. In some cases, identifying patients with impulse control problems is straightforward; the pack of cigarettes or nicotine stains are easily visible, or the patient's weight can be measured in the office. Other problems, such as alcohol abuse or compulsive shopping, are less observable. To further compound the difficulty with identification is the fact that physicians may not ask routinely about the existence of such problems. Whether a practitioner inquires about the existence of these or other impulse control problems may be related to the difficulty one faces when the problem is finally identified. Addictive behaviors and impulse control disorders are notoriously difficult to treat. High relapse rates and the frustration of both patient and health care provider when efforts to change fail are a testimonial to the tenacity of these behaviors. Recent research highlighting how to meet patients at their level of readiness to change a risk-related behavior offers a perspective on what clinicians can do to assist their patients in approaching and ultimately changing these behaviors. The stages of change model will be described as a method for conceptualizing how behavior change can be facilitated in patients with these various problems. In addition, issues relevant to making a referral will be discussed.",

Après des coliques plus graves, ayant généré un iléus important, la consommation spontanée ne débute généralement que le 2è jour.

      "abstract": "Salt is found in nearly every kitchen across the world; however, it is not typically thought of to be a means for suicide. Depending on the age and size of the person, anywhere from 2 to 4 tablespoons of salt consumed rapidly can be lethal. To put that in perspective, the average person in the United States consumes approximately 0.5 tablespoons of salt over the course of the day, which is still above what is recommended. Most cases discussing salt overdose or salt poisoning happen accidentally, however there are case studies and reviews discussing intentional salt overdoses that mostly occur either as exorcism rituals in adults or parents poisoning their young children in cases of factitious disorder imposed on another (formally Munchausen's by proxy). Adolescents using salt as a suicide method, especially in the United States, is either very rare or not well documented due to the lack of available case reports. Here we present a case of an adolescent female who consumed approximately 4 dessertspoons of kosher salt (equivalent to 2-3 tablespoons) to kill herself after reportedly seeing the idea on social media. Although this patient had a favorable outcome with no signs of neurological damage, our goal is to bring awareness to the dangers of salt overdose and warn about a potential rise in cases due to circulating videos on popular apps social media apps.",

The phrase is, in our view, often taken to mean that you simply cannot do enough exercise to successfully lose or manage weight over time. Nonetheless, all weight loss paradigms run through energy balance,1 and the concept that you cannot outrun a bad diet is, in our view, inaccurate. Importantly, the simplicity of the phrase does not consider the multitude of other positive effects that physical activity/exercise (ie, running) have on health beyond weight loss. Evidence shows that you can out-exercise/out-work poor nutritional choices, but most people do not since they do not/will not/or cannot, practically, expend sufficient energy to do so. It is incontrovertible that exercise can and does result in weight loss.2 Nonetheless, behavioural and/or metabolic compensatory mechanisms often lessen the predicted weight loss with exercise induced as opposed to diet-induced energy deficits.2 Viewed through the lens of a weight loss approach to …",

      "title": "Nutritional Support for Exercise-Induced Injuries",
      "abstract": "Nutrition is one method to counter the negative impact of an exercise-induced injury. Deficiencies of energy, protein and other nutrients should be avoided. Claims for the effectiveness of many other nutrients following injuries are rampant, but the evidence is equivocal. The results of an exercise-induced injury may vary widely depending on the nature of the injury and severity. Injuries typically result in cessation, or at least a reduction, in participation in sport and decreased physical activity. Limb immobility may be necessary with some injuries, contributing to reduced activity and training. Following an injury, an inflammatory response is initiated and while excess inflammation may be harmful, given the importance of the inflammatory process for wound healing, attempting to drastically reduce inflammation may not be ideal for optimal recovery. Injuries severe enough for immobilization of a limb result in loss of muscle mass and reduced muscle strength and function. Loss of muscle results from reductions in basal muscle protein synthesis and the resistance of muscle to anabolic stimulation. Energy balance is critical. Higher protein intakes (2–2.5 g/kg/day) seem to be warranted during immobilization. At the very least, care should be taken not to reduce the absolute amount of protein intake when energy intake is reduced. There is promising, albeit preliminary, evidence for the use of omega-3 fatty acids and creatine to counter muscle loss and enhance hypertrophy, respectively. The overriding nutritional recommendation for injured exercisers should be to consume a well-balanced diet based on whole, minimally processed foods or ingredients made from whole foods. The diet composition should be carefully assessed and changes considered as the injury heals and activity patterns change.",

It is about overeating, of course. How can we stop the obese from becoming more obese? Pretty simple. Stop feeding them. Think about the other common self-destructive human behaviors. On a commercial airplane, in a saloon, or at a professional sports event, if the customer is deemed to be drunk, the keepers of the booze key will lock the cabinet. If a person drives a car at a dangerous speed, the driver is subject to substantial penalties. For young persons known to be at high risk for early chemical addictions, society tries to prevent exposure to the addicting drugs. Overeating with underexercising is now killing more Americans than anything else except tobacco addiction. Yet, an obese person enters an eating joint, or a supermarket, and buys and eats any and everything he or she wants, and nobody seems to care. Does that make any sense to you? Meanwhile, Big Science strives to understand why people get fat; Big Genetics searches for the obesity gene so that stem cells could correct the flaw; Big Surgery lines up the morbidly obese to shunt their stomachs; Big Pharma seeks the next weight-loss pill that will help more people than it kills; Big Nutrition hawks the newest sure-thing, weight-loss diet; Big Fast Food pushes healthy lines right next to their billion dollar unhealthy food lines; Big Soda and Big School Boards share the profit from drowning kids with calories from vending machines; and Big Exercise pushes group rates for aerobics class. Money made by so many special interests. All this while the simple answer is to stop eating; stop feeding the obese until they are no longer obese. Of course, that may be hard to do, and who makes any money that way? Fat chance for this crazy idea to go anywhere. That's my opinion. I'm Dr. George Lundberg, Editor of MedGenMed.

The practice of sedentary activities has been shown to have a negative influence on various indicators of health. Furthermore, the increase in energy intake observed while practicing sedentary activities is not related to increases in appetite or hunger sensations. As opposed to other sedentary activities, sleep may help facilitate the control of appetite and promote the maintenance of a healthy body weight. A U-shaped relationship has been noted between sleep duration and adiposity indicators, suggesting that both short- and long-duration sleepers are more likely to gain weight over time. Recent evidence shows that short-duration sleepers having a high disinhibition eating behavior trait are more at risk of gaining weight over time compared to short-duration sleepers having a low disinhibition eating behavior trait. In summary, it is important to make the distinction between ‘sleep’ and ‘sedentary activities’ when assessing their effects on health-related indicators. While most sedentary activities promote a positive energy balance, which may ultimately lead to weight gain over time, adequate sleep is rather associated with body weight stability and overall health.",

      "abstract": "In a world where they are inundated with potential temptations, how are successful dieters able to resist the urge to give in to unhealthy foods? Four studies suggest distance is one tool that may enable people to forego temptation. People with strong goals to eat healthy preferred to be farther away from unhealthy foods (Study 1a), which was associated with feeling less tempted by and less likely to give in to them (Study 1b). In addition, successful self-regulators with goals to restrict unhealthy eating perceptually represented the distance to unhealthy foods as greater than the distance to healthy foods (Study 2). Moreover, in a week-long food diary study, distancing from temptations helped people make healthier food choices (Study 3). The studies suggest that successful self-regulators’ motivations to avoid unhealthy foods are reflected in the way they structure and perceive the world. Distancing may allow people space to make healthier choices.",

Psychotherapeutic treatment and medication produce good responses to bulimic symptoms, whereas evidence of the efficacy of anorectic therapies remains less certain.",

A este consumo de agua se le llamo polidipsia psicogena y aun cuando ha permanecido como un fenomeno inexplicable, se ha empleado como un modelo para estudiar el alcoholismo en humanos. A diferencia de estudios previos en los que se registro el consumo de agua exclusivamente durante las sesiones, en el presente estudio se registro continuamente el consumo de agua en ratas y diariamente se programaron cuatro sesiones de polidipsia de una hora en las que se entregaron diferentes cantidades de comida. En fases consecutivas no se privo de comida a las ratas o permanecieron al 70% de su peso ad libitum. Bajo la condicion sin privacion de comida el consumo de agua ocurrio durante todo el dia independientemente de las sesiones. Cuando se privo de comida a las ratas el consumo de agua aumento durante las sesiones y complementariamente disminuyo fuera de estas. Asimismo, a mayor cantidad de comida entregada mayor fue el consumo de agua. Se concluyo que la privacion de comida y la entrega de comida a intervalos no generan un consumo excesivo de agua, sino que controlan que",

      "title": "Le grignotage : sa definition physiologique. mise en evidence de ses consequences metaboliques et comportementales a court terme chez l'homme",
      "abstract": "La sequence alimentaire, qui represente le nombre, l'importance et la repartition des prises alimentaires au cours du nycthemere, s'est recemment modifiee dans nos societes developpees, avec une augmentation du nombre de prises. Si cette modification conduisait a un bilan energetique positif, elle pourrait contribuer a la forte augmentation de la prevalence de l'obesite. Cet effet adipogene pourrait etre lie a la nature de ces prises. Certaines prises sont provoquees par un signal metabolique a l'origine de la sensation de faim, d'autres sont provoquees par le stress, l'occasion et non par la sensation de faim. Nous appellerons les premieres repas et les secondes grignotage. Nous avons fait l'hypothese que l'utilisation de l'apport energetique d'un repas ou d'un grignotage pouvait etre differente. Nous avons donc etudie les consequences metaboliques et comportementales d'un grignotage consomme entre le dejeuner et le diner a l'aide d'un protocole dont les principaux points sont : - sujets prives de reperes horaires (recreation d'une sequence alimentaire spontanee) - evaluation reguliere de l'etat de faim - diner spontanement demande - mesures en continu des parametres sanguins (glucose, insuline, acides gras) (experience 1 et 3) - mesures de l'oxydation des substrats (experience 3). Nos resultats (experience 1) montrent que quelle que soit sa place dans l'intervalle interprandial (iip), un grignotage de composition equilibree (1 mj) ne retarde pas l'heure de la demande du diner et ne reduit pas la prise energetique a ce repas. Nous avons ensuite etudie si ces consequences comportementales sont differentes en fonction de la composition du grignotage. En effet (experience 2), l'iip est differemment augmente par un grignotage hyperlipidique (hf), hyperglucidique (hg), hyperproteique (hp), consomme 2h avant l'heure prevue du diner (25, 34 et 60 min respectivement). En revanche, quelle que soit sa composition, le grignotage ne change pas la dimension du diner. Ces resultats peuvent etre interpretes en terme d'utilisation des substrats en fonction de la secretion d'insuline induite par les differents grignotages. Nous avons alors montre (experience 3) que l'insulino-secretion induite par un grignotage hg stimule fortement l'oxydation du glucose aux detriments des lipides. En revanche, un grignotage hp, tout en apportant des acides amines glucoformateurs, est moins insulinosecreteur et ne reduit pas l'oxydation lipidique. Ce travail fournit donc des elements d'explications metaboliques au faible pouvoir satietogene et au role adipogene du grignotage, c'est a dire des calories consommees en etat de satiete. Cet effet deletere est toutefois attenue lorsque le grignotage est hyperproteique.",

Threshold changes become particularly important for individuals at high risk of nutritional insufficiencies. Genetic differences, medication, diet and zinc levels all alter sensory perception. Odour perception is both ortho and retronasal and both can alter. We know that over 250 drugs caused taste complaints and that zinc is not only essential for gustin but is also important with selenium in thyroid hormone metabolism. The development of novel foods using natural tastants as well as nutrient fortification and alternative modes of delivery are being developed in order to counteract the effects of conditions such as dementia and Parkinson’s disease. As well enjoyment, alteration in taste thresholds has an important safety aspect. Lower thresholds for salt recognition may result in individuals adding copious amounts of salt with resultant cardiovascular and metabolic consequences. Tastants such as naturally occurring Umami may increase oral intake as well as add to the pleasure of food.",

Because the dieting manipulated in these experiments may be unrepresentative of real-world weight-loss dieting, 122 intermittent dieters were randomized to either diet as they usually do for weight loss or eat as they do when not dieting for four weeks to provide a more ecologically valid experimental test of these effects. Results indicated that individuals in the diet as usual condition slowed the weight gain trajectory shown by non-dieting participants, but did not result in significant weight loss. These findings imply that most dieters may simply be curbing a general tendency to overeat when attempting to diet, and that dieters may be eating less than they desire rather than reducing their intake sufficiently to",

      "abstract": "El sobrepeso y la obesidad son las enfermedades nutricionales más comunes en perros y gatos. La gran diferencia entre el sobrepeso en mascotas y humanos es que los animales no tienen la facultad de controlar su peso. Dependen única y exclusivamente de lo que les sirva su dueño. A partir del año edad es fundamental proporcionarles la dieta recomendada para su edad, especie y raza. De lo contrario, les llevaremos al sobrepeso, y de ahí a la obesidad. La obesidad se define como un exceso de grasa corporal suficiente como para producir enfermedad. Cuando el animal consume más calorías que las que gasta, la grasa se acumula en el cuerpo. En perros, el sobrepeso comienza cuando el animal sobrepasa entre un 15 y un 30% el peso establecido como normal para la raza. A partir de un 30%, estaríamos hablando de obesidad. En el caso de los gatos se considera que presentan sobrepeso cuando superan en más del 10% su “peso ideal”, y son obesos cuando lo supera en un 20%. La salud y la longevidad se ven afectados por los depósitos excesivos de grasa en el cuerpo. Las enfermedades asociadas con la obesidad y el sobrepeso, incluyen desordenes ortopédicos traumáticos o degenerativos, enfermedad cardiovascular que se manifiesta con insuficiencia cardiaca congestiva, intolerancia al ejercicio y al calor, predisposición a la diabetes mellitus, hipertensión, hiperlipidemias, carcinoma de células transicionales en vejiga y compromiso de la función inmune. Por otra parte, la obesidad y el sobrepeso aumentan el riesgo de sufrir tumores mamarios, y esto relacionado no solo con la obesidad sino con el consumo de comida casera y de carnes roja. Con esta revisión bibliográfica de literatura se busca reunir y resumir información científica, actualizada y específica acerca de las patologías que se asocian a la obesidad y el sobrepeso en perros y gatos, con la finalidad de comprender la fisiología de la patología y como el profesional Médico Veterinario puede intervenir oportunamente para controlar estos trastornos asociados a la nutrición de las mascotas.",

Although a deficiency of dietary fiber uncommonly causes constipation, some individuals do respond to an increase in fiber to 20 to 30 g daily. Fiber has been shown to increase stool weight and decrease transit time through the gastrointestinal tract. Soluble fibers such as psyllium may be better tolerated than insoluble fibers, but this is highly variable. Patients should be told that immediate results are not to be expected, and the dose should be increased slowly over 1 to 2 weeks. Fiber should be used cautiously in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as these patients may experience increased symptoms, including bloating and cramping. Fiber should be avoided in patients with megacolon, megarectum, colonic inertia, and defecation disorders.",

      "abstract": "Author(s): Cummings, Jenna Rosemarie | Advisor(s): Tomiyama, Ayako J. | Abstract: People engage in multiple behaviors that affect their health. There is little research on how these behaviors intersect within a person’s life. In this dissertation, I hypothesized that behaviors that activate the neural reward system can “compete.” In Study 1, I experimentally tested if eating sweet high-fat foods acutely reduced alcohol cravings for heavy drinking adults. I found that eating sweet high-fat foods acutely reduced alcohol cravings no more than watching a neutral video. In Study 2, I observed multiple reward-related behaviors (e.g., self-affirmation, social interactions, exercise) and health-compromising behaviors (e.g., unhealthy eating, alcohol use) within the everyday lives of young adults via a 4-day ambulatory electronic diary. I found that when young adults engaged in multiple reward-related behaviors they were more likely to eat unhealthy foods in the next hour. However, when young adults engaged in reward-related behaviors that provided a sense of accomplishment they were less likely to drink alcohol in the next hour. These studies fill scientific gaps in understanding intersections between reward-related behaviors and provide insight for health behavior change. Namely, that “replacing” health-compromising behavior with other reward-related behaviors may not consistently work.",

      "title": "Reductions in Dietary Energy Density as a Weight Management Strategy",
      "abstract": "Reducing caloric intake is the cornerstone of dietary therapy for long-term healthy weight management. Strategies individuals have typically used include limiting portion sizes, food groups, or certain macronutrients. Although such restrictive approaches can lead to weight loss in the short term, they can result in feelings of hunger or dissatisfaction, which can limit their acceptability, sustainability, and long-term effectiveness. An alternative positive strategy to manage energy intake is for individuals to eat more foods that are low in calories for a given measure of food—that is, they are low in energy density (kcal/g). Data have shown that people eat a fairly consistent amount of food on a day-to-day basis; therefore, the energy density of the foods an individual consumes influences energy intake. Encouraging patients to eat more foods low in energy density and to substitute these foods for those higher in energy density allows them to decrease their energy intake while eating sati sfying portions, thereby controlling hunger and lowering energy intake. This type of diet fi ts with the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans in that it incorporates high quantities of fruits, vegetables, and fiber, which are often suboptimal in typical low-calorie diets, and it provides ample intakes of numerous micronutrients. Moreover, studies have found that individuals who consume lower-energy-dense diets consume more food by weight and have lower body weights compared with individuals who consume higher-energy-dense diets. This chapter reviews the evidence supporting the use of diets rich in low-energy-dense foods for weight management and provides practical approaches to lowering the energy density of the diet.",

The American food supply can support optimal dietary health and the array of healthy food choices available can accommodate almost all dietary preferences, needs, and resource constraints (time, energy, skill). The key to a dietary pattern that nurtures good health is learning to choose nutritious foods that also accommodate personal preferences like convenience and taste appeal.",

      "title": "The Intermittent Fasting Revolution",
      "abstract": "How intermittent fasting can enhance resilience, improve mental and physical performance, and protect against aging and disease. Most of us eat three meals a day with a smattering of snacks because we think that's the normal, healthy way to eat. This book shows why that's not the case. The human body and brain evolved to function well in environments where food could be obtained only intermittently. When we look at the eating patterns of our distant ancestors, we can see that an intermittent fasting eating pattern is normal—and eating three meals a day is not. In The Intermittent Fasting Revolution, prominent neuroscientist Mark Mattson shows that intermittent fasting is not only normal but also good for us; it can enhance our ability to cope with stress by making cells more resilient. It also improves mental and physical performance and protects against aging and disease. Intermittent fasting is not the latest fad diet; it doesn't dictate food choice or quantity. It doesn't make money for the pharmaceutical, processed food, or health care industries. Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that includes frequent periods of time with little or negligible amounts of food. It is often accompanied by weight loss, but, Mattson says, studies show that its remarkable beneficial effects cannot be accounted for by weight loss alone. Mattson—whose pioneering research uncovered the ways that the brain responds to fasting and exercise—explains how thriving while fasting became an evolutionary adaptation. He describes the specific ways that intermittent fasting slows aging; reduces the risk of diseases, including obesity, Alzheimer's, and diabetes; and improves both brain and body performance. He also offers practical advice on adopting an intermittent fasting eating pattern as well as information for parents and physicians.",

An aspirin‐induced gastrointestinal bleed caused him to begin a bland oligoantigenic diet. He became headache‐free shortly thereafter. Single food challenges, done carefully and deliberately, revealed sensitivities to banana, citrus, and cheese, all foods containing potent vasoactive amines. The year prior to his serendipitous discovery, the subject had headache on 326 days and took 1316 aspirin tablets. The year following it, in which he eliminated offending foods, he had headache on 8 days and took 16 tablets. Seven years of headache data are presented. Delayed reactions to foods, and multiple food sensitivities, may pose diagnostic problems. Headaches can occur up to 72 hours following ingestion of provoking foods. Oligoantigenic diets and single food challenges utilizing enough time so as to recognize delayed reactions are useful in detecting food sensitivities.",

      "abstract": "Special requirements, such as super-maximally filled glycogen stores, short regeneration times, correct meal timing or appropriate weight specifications for ski jumping are particularly useful for endurance athletes such as cross-country skiers. A deficiency could have a fatal effect on performance and possibly a negative influence on health.&#x0D; While cross-country skiing is clearly one of endurance sports, ski jumping and alpine skiing are considered to be fast-strength sports or technical (acrobatic) sports.&#x0D; The proven advantages of carbohydrate loading (supercompensation), a nutritional technique for classic endurance loads, also apply to cross-country skiing.&#x0D; A drop in performance, concentration and coordination disorders as well as overheating threaten if fluid loss exceeds 2% of the total body water. Vitamin additives or sweeteners in sports drinks are inefficient. Since the higher need is actually compensated by the increased food intake with a balanced mixed diet, there is, in principle, no over-proportional need for individual vitamins in athletes.&#x0D; As the maximum oxygen uptake is already 15% lower from 3000 m altitude, a drop in performance is clearly noticeable there.&#x0D; When skiing (snowshoeing, ski touring, etc.), it should be noted that an ascent of 100 meters in altitude alone requires an additional 100–150 kcal. At moderate activity, the additional energy requirement at high altitudes compared to the sea level is estimated to be 250–290 kcal per day for men and 180–200 kcal per day for women.&#x0D; Top athletes in cross-country skiing can liberate 170–210 kJ/min (40– 50 kcal/min) in a dominant anaerobic manner within 2–3 minutes. The respective energy consumption is modified by numerous personal as well as external factors (for cross-country skiing, for example, the outside temperature, the friction resistance of the snow, the technique, the height profile of the route and the headwind).&#x0D; In cross-country skiers, the average values of body fat range between 4.8 and 12.7% in males and from 10.6 to 22.7% in females, while the average values of lean body mass (LBM) vary between 58.2 and 68.8 kg in males and from 45.6 to 48.6 kg in females. In alpine skiers, the mean values of body fat are between 9.7 and 15.8% in males and from 16.2 to 26.7% in females, and the LBM values in males range between 59.9 and 74.7 kg, in females from 42.1 to 52.8 kg. The span of body fat in male ski jumpers ranges from 8.6 to 16% with an LBM of 59.7 kg. Since 2012, a BMI of at least 21 kg/m² including suit and shoes has been a condition for ski jumpers to be able to use full-length skis (145% of body height). Otherwise, shorter skis have to be used, which reduces the wing area and is intended to reduce the jump distance as a penalty. The average values of body fat in male athletes of Nordic Combined range between 8.9 and 11.2%, and the corresponding LBM values are between 62.0 and 64.1 kg. When comparing these parameters of body composition, it must always be remembered that different methods of determining the body fat percentage have been used in corresponding studies and that possible differences do not represent a development of the skiing somatotypes over time but could also have methodological reasons.",

      "abstract": "Duodenal action of rapidly digested carbohydrate can induce an intense satiation shortly after the meal, which conditions down the volume of food eaten in the later part of the meal. In contrast, after a meal rich in spreading fat, separation of fat above the aqueous contents of the stomach is liable to delay the fat’s emptying and hence its contact with satiety receptors in the small intestine; eaters are therefore unlikely to learn to eat less of a menu rich in separated fat. Yet the delayed emptying may prolong the period of digestion and absorption of separated fat beyond that for the same amount of fat emulsified or bound in the aqueous phase. Hence, separating fat might help to delay better the rise of appetite for the next meal several hours later. These ideas explain some of the diversity of claims about satiation from fats in foods. Observes how individuals learn from the post‐ingestional effects on appetite of variants of the foods they choose routinely.",

Among populations involved in drug abuse and predatory crime, a temporal sequence from drug abuse to predatory criminality is not typical; on the contrary, predatory criminality more commonly occurs before drug abuse. Drug-abusing offenders who display increasingly deviant behavior over time may eventually cross over a threshold to heroin addiction or frequent polydrug abuse. The intensity of their criminal behavior typically escalates substantially. If these high-rate offenders subsequently decrease the amount of drugs they use, they typically also lessen their rate of criminal activity. Among offenders who use multiple types of drugs, individual predatory crime commission frequencies are typically two or three times higher among offenders when they use multiple types of drugs than they are for the same offenders when they are in drug treatment or abstain from drug abuse.",

      "abstract": "Андрей Урбан ... \nВесна скоро. Взгляд в зеркало становится все более придирчивым. Мысль о том, что хорошо бы подправить фигуру, приходит все чаще. Мысль правильная. Только приступать к ее осуществлению в жизнь надо осторожно и с умом. ... \nПеред походом в спортзал следует глотать не искусственный белковый порошок, а отдать предпочтение натуральным продуктам, например, креветкам, которые состоят из чистого белка. Если же вы хотите похудеть, то лучше заправиться чашечкой бульона, порцией квашеной капусты или салата. Такие советы дают эксперты Немецкого общества по проблемам питания. Они не устают повторять, что оптимальным для приобретения хорошей фигуры является сочетание тщательно выверенной диеты и приемлемых спортивных упражнений. ... \nСтрадающие избыточным весом могут попытаться уменьшить рацион: обычную тарелку заменить большим блюдцем, а порцию поделить на две части. Важно не спешить, не глотать большие куски пищи, а растянуть трапезу на двадцать минут - именно в течение этого времени уходит чувство голода. Причем первая порция поглощается в основное - за первые десять минут, а вторая - в добавочные десять. Вторая тарелка воспринимается уже в качестве добавки, от которой впоследствии можно будет и отказаться. Важно часто перекусывать - фруктами или маленькими бутербродиками из ржаного хлеба грубого помола. ... \nНи в коем случае нельзя покупаться на рекламу и употреблять химические добавки для наращивания мышечной массы, предупреждает кельнский медик Герхард Уленбрук. Быстро вздувшиеся от химии мускулы так же быстро исчезнут или, к вашему же ужасу, обвиснут. Красивая мускулатура, приобретенная за счет кропотливого труда и нормального питания - супов на мясном бульоне, бифштексов и шницелей без жира в сочетании с салатами и обильным питьем - останется такой навсегда. ... \nСвои достижения можно записывать в спортивный дневник - эта книга послужит мощным стимулом для работы над собой, - советует специалист. Те, кто решится бегать по парку, должны начать с пяти минут три раза в неделю, увеличивая время тренировок на пять минут каждую неделю. Зимой можно сочетать утренние или вечерние пробежки с походами в лес на лыжах. Важно контролировать свой пульс и следить, чтобы он не перескакивал порог 130, а при интенсивной тренировке не выходил за рамки 150 ударов в минуту. ... \nКардионагрузки необходимо разбавлять силовыми упражнениями. Для этого вовсе не обязательно платить безумные деньги и каждый день ходить в фитнес- центр. Достаточно делать зарядку, доведя ее до 30 минут. Снаряды из престижного спортзала в домашних условиях мужчинам прекрасно заменят обычные трех- или пятикилограммовые гантели. ... \nПродуманное питание и разумная нагрузка на сердце и мышцы, считают немецкие медики, позволит вам через два-три месяца увидеть первые результаты атлетического самовоспитания. ... \nТак что к лету можно успеть. Если начать уже завтра. ... \nАндрей Урбан, БЕРЛИН",

      "abstract": "Food-drug interactions occur as a result of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics mechanisms. Pharmacokinetic mechanisms include what the body does to a drug while Pharmacodynamics mechanisms involve what drugs do to the body. Many types of food have been shown to influence metabolism and the absorption of drugs. Large numbers of drugs are produced and introduced yearly. The interaction between Food and drug may cause negative effects in the nutritional status of the patient as well as safety and efficacy of drug therapy. Due to the possibility of unexpected or poor outcomes, generally, food-drug interactions, in this case, should be avoided. As the good clinical practice, drugs taken by mouth must be absorbed either through the lining of the stomach or the small intestine. Reduction in the absorbance of a drug might be influenced by the presence of food in the digestive tract. The avoidance of such interactions could be possible if the drug is taken 1 hour before or 2 h after eating the food. The effects of several types of food such as milk or milk products, grapefruit and grapefruit juice, bananas, oranges, legumes, fermented meats and pickled fish and some nutrient elements such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and vitamin K are highlighted in this paper including their clinical implications.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Club drugs are typically taken by groups of people during raves. Raves are parties where the opportunity to dance to very loud, rhythmic music while under the influence of one or more drugs is the primary attraction. Needless to say, most users of club drugs under these conditions are young and single. Club drugs are usually taken periodically; several of them may be taken three to four times over the course of an 8-hour rave, and then they may not be taken again until the next opportunity to attend such a party. This is quite different from the pattern of opioid, nicotine, or alcohol abuse, where drug-seeking and drug-taking occur several times per day for months or years, or from the pattern of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse, where the drug may be taken as frequently as possible for several days of profound intoxication. In most cases, even periodic club drug use does not continue for more than a few years. For all but a few individuals, there is little indication that it is difficult to stop using these drugs. Some of the drugs, MDMA in particular, lose their ability to change the perceptions of some users in interesting ways, and these people effortlessly stop taking them. For these reasons, club drugs meet the criteria for abuse, but usually do not meet the criteria for addiction as these terms were defined in Chapter 1. Physiological dependence on some club drugs is possible, as noted below, but is rarely observed in people who take them only twice each week.",

      "abstract": "Obesity has become a serious epidemic and one of the leading global health problems. However, much of the current debate has been fractious, and etiologies of obesity have been attributed to eating behavior (i.e. fast food consumption), personality, depression, addiction or genetics. One of the interesting new hypotheses for explaining the development of obesity involves a food addiction model, which suggests that food is not eaten as much for survival as pleasure and that hedonic overeating is relevant to both substance-related disorders and eating disorders. Accumulating evidence has shown that there are a number of shared neural and hormonal pathways as well as distinct differences in these pathways that may help researchers discover why certain individuals continue to overeat despite health and other consequences, and becomes more and more obese. Functional neuroimaging studies have further revealed that pleasant smelling, looking, and tasting food has reinforcing characteristics similar to drugs of abuse. Many of the brain changes reported for hedonic eating and obesity are also seen in various types of addictions. Most importantly, overeating and obesity may have an acquired drive similar to drug addiction with respect to motivation and incentive craving. In both cases, the desire and continued satisfaction occur after early and repeated exposure to stimuli. The acquired drive for eating food and relative weakness of the satiety signal would cause an imbalance between the drive and hunger/reward centers in the brain and their regulation. In the current paper, we first provide a summary of literature on food addition from eight different perspectives, and then we proposed a research paradigm that may allow screening of new pharmacological treatment on the basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many mechanisms are known to contribute to the regulation of food intake. This notwithstanding, variations in food intake from day to day and deviations from daily energy balance are substantial and very readily tolerated. Yet, despite this very loose short‐term adjustment of food intake to energy expenditure, most adults maintain stable body compositions during long periods of their lives. This is particularly puzzling when it occurs in the face of an ubiquitous supply of appealing foods and under circumstances that, in many ways, promote food consumption. Thus, the question arises as to why people in affluent societies eat substantially less on most days, than the amounts that they can so readily consume on high‐intake days? In addition to conscious decisions, physiological phenomena restraining food consumption must be presumed to play an important role in limiting weight. But what are the phenomena that cause spontaneous reduction in food intake after a few days of overeating? Our ignorance about the nature and impact of these effects stands in the way of a better understanding of body weight regulation and of the factors responsible for the induction and maintenance of obesity.",

      "title": "A survey on the habit of dieting and food constrained by superstition",
      "abstract": "1. Generally speaking, our people have been carrying out the government policy of using grains other than rice comparatively well. But it is desirable that the government heirs the whole nation as well as the farmers to understand better the scientific meaning of using foods made from the flour of various grains. This will greatly improve the nation's eating habits, for it will make people discard the habit of eating only boiled-rice, which will not only improve our national health but will also increase the national income. 2. For the purpose of improving health and developing intellectual faculties of our mind, we had better, if possible, get much protein from plants(especially beans) which we can obtain more readily than from animals. However if we must use animal protein, we should dependonly on livestock. Pregnant women and new-born children must not be in ill health because of malnutrition caused by following groundless superstitions about foods: for example, some religions forbid the use very healthful foods or some traditional conventions do the blend of certain foods together with other victuals. 3. It is good that we conquer the difficulty of living in the season of spring poverty by having other substitute for regular victuals. But it requires us to pay a careful attention to the food and to do research on many foods problems such as food pollution. Farmers should cooperate with each other and help those who have very little arable land, or even those who have no place for cultivating, to grow miscellaneous cereals on the land which other farmers don't use that year. 4. On the whole, farmers have a good appetite for any, food, whatever it is. Neverthless, because they aren't econmically well-off, they generally eat hot meals only for breakfast and supper in the busy faming season. They eat a tepid lunch which, they think saves time and cooking fuel. In conclution, I feel sorry that many village farmers still steeped in conventional thought and superstition are inclined to have an unbalanced diet of boiled-rice and that they continue not to use the floor from other grains all the year round. when these unscientific dieting customs mentioned above are discarded, we will be able to enjoy good health, better knowledge or intellegence, and higher income. Then we will ba able to make our present lives more self-reliant and self-supporting.",

      "title": "Urinary symptoms in diabetes",
      "abstract": "Physicians have been studying urine for thousands of years. We still look at it but thankfully no longer have to taste it! Urinary symptoms may include changes in urine colour, clarity or frothiness; in volume (polyuria, anuria); frequency of urination; ease or otherwise of passing urine (for example retention); control of urination (for example incontinence); and sensations such as dysuria or awareness (or lack of it) of the need to urinate. All these aspects are relevant in diabetes. ‘My symptom started about 5 weeks ago… Constant thirst and needing to go to bathroom every hour. I am 60 and thought this was just another of the wonderful joys of aging. But as time went on I realized that my urine was smelling very sweet.’1 ‘I have high blood glucose… I'm urinating loads especially at night. I have terrible urge incontinence, I leak quite a bit… I'm only 40 so quite embarrassing.’2 Dry mouth, sweet or funny taste, thirst, need to urinate, not feeling right, and weakness are regarded as osmotic hyperglycaemic symptoms.3 Polyuria is the passage of large volumes of urine, usually at frequent intervals. It has been suggested that both the high volumes of urine and the high urine glucose content may cause long-term damage.4 Hyperglycaemia may not be the only reason for polyuria in people with diabetes. People with Wolfram's syndrome can have both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus,5 as can others without this syndrome.6 Hypercalcaemia and diabetes may co- exist. ‘The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in primary hyperparathyroidism is approximately 8% and that of primary hyperparathyroidism in diabetic patients is approximately 1%. Both values are about three-fold higher than the respective expected prevalences in general populations.’7 SGLT2 inhibitors induce glycosuria and hence both polyuria and increased urinary frequency. Other drugs, such as diuretics, also increase urine output. ‘So, I'm on my 4th urine infection in 4 months… I also think that this one *might* have spread to my kidneys, based on the fact that I have pain there, nausea, and my temperature is up and down.’8 Bacteriuria is more common among women with diabetes than in those without diabetes, so researchers incubated uroepithelial cells from each group with Escherichia coli. They found that ‘Type 1-fimbriated E. coli adhere more to diabetic than to control uroepithelial cells.’9 Cloudy urine, with or without symptoms, should be investigated, as should malodorous urine. Urinary infection can be present without these signs. Among people with diabetes, urinary infections may be due to, or be associated with, multi-resistant or unusual organisms including fungi. ‘Last week whilst at my diabetic clinic appointment I gave a urine sample and had my period at the time. Blood was present in my sample and doctor… asked if it was monthly period. Yesterday I get letter from clinic saying they have traced protein in my urine and want me back for second test… petrified that maybe I have start of kidney disease and am going to die before I get to 43!!!’10 Please don't send urine samples from menstruating patients for microalbumin or other protein analysis. Refer anyone aged ≥45 years with ‘unexplained visible haematuria without urinary tract infection or visible haematuria that persists or recurs after successful treatment of urinary tract infection… using a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for bladder cancer.’11 People with diabetes may be slightly more at risk of bladder cancer than those without diabetes – a meta- analysis found an overall relative risk of 1.24, 95% CI 1.08–1.42 compared with people without diabetes.12 Various studies have suggested that pioglitazone use is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.13, 14 Other studies did not confirm a link.15 The UK's MHRA advises avoiding pioglitazone in patients with past or present bladder cancer, and in people at higher risk of this.16 The American FDA concludes: pioglitazone ‘may be linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer’. ‘Patients should contact their health care professionals if they experience any of the following signs or symptoms after starting pioglitazone, as these may be due to bladder cancer: blood or a red color in the urine; new or worsening urge to urinate; pain when urinating.’17 Kidney disease is very common among people with diabetes. The National Diabetes Audit found that 64.8% of people with type 1 diabetes and 79.1% of those with type 2 diabetes had some evidence of chronic kidney disease.18 Protein in the urine reduces the surface tension and, if present in large amounts, for example in nephrotic syndrome, can cause frothy or foamy urine.19 Diabetic cystopathy is a common complication of diabetes that gets little publicity. Symptoms are variable and many patients are asymptomatic or assume symptoms are just ‘because of the sugar’. Symptoms include hesitancy, poor stream, dribbling, nocturia, a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, reduced awareness of the need to urinate, leaking with increased abdominal pressure such as coughing, or more general urinary incontinence, infrequent urination, and urinary retention. Exclude other causes such as urinary tract infection or prostatic disease.20 A Japanese study found that 40% of people with diabetes without urinary symptoms had voiding problems on questioning. Cystometrograms showed high bladder volume at first desire to void and maximal capacity, with reduced detrusor contractility; and higher residual volume in people with diabetes compared with non-diabetic controls.21 In Taiwan, 22.5% of patients reported an overactive bladder on asking, among whom 48.0% had incontinence.22 Women with type 2 diabetes without other causes of urinary symptoms were more likely to have nocturia, and had weaker urinary streams, and voided smaller volumes than those without diabetes. Among women with diabetes, 13.9% had significant residual volume post voiding compared with 1.8% of controls. Reduced bladder emptying efficiency was associated with the presence of neuropathy.23 Although ‘diabetic cystopathy’ is usually understood to mean neuropathic bladder disease, the cause is likely to be multifactorial including nerve damage within the bladder and its exit, microvascular disease, and the effects of high glucose and microorganisms. Treatment depends on the problem, but reducing hyperglycaemia will reduce polyuria and reduce progression of neuropathy. Voiding every 2 hours can prevent excessive bladder volumes. Some patients with neurogenic bladder may need to learn how to exert lower abdominal pressure to help emptying. Others may need to self-catheterise or have an indwelling urethral catheter. Nowadays, most catheterised patients can use catheter valves, avoiding embarrassing, weighty leg bags, although most such patients use a night bag. NICE guidance on the management of urinary incontinence and other symptoms states that such patients should have specialist assessment.24-26 Urinary symptoms are common among people with diabetes who may not mention them unless asked. Don't assume that they are all due to hyperglycaemic polyuria. Many will not be. Any urinary symptoms are, at best, a nuisance or, at worst, a torment. Seek them. Treat them. Don't assume that all polyuria is due to glycosuria, especially in people who have near-normal glucose control. Do control hyperglycaemia as glycosuria will exacerbate urinary problems, in addition to the other hazards of hyperglycaemia. Treat urinary tract infections promptly having clarified the causative organism. Beware multi-resistant bacteria and fungi. Don't test urine for protein during menstruation but do take non-menstrual haematuria seriously. Refer via suspected cancer channels anyone aged ≥45 years with ‘unexplained visible haematuria without urinary tract infection or visible haematuria that persists or recurs after successful treatment of urinary tract infection’.11 Remember diabetic cystopathy. ‘Evaluation of bladder function should be performed for individuals with diabetes who have recurrent urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, incontinence, or a palpable bladder. The medical history should include simple questions to unveil symptoms of lower urinary tract symptoms.’27",

      "abstract": "VITAMINS are essential constituents present in minute amounts in natural foods.If these constituents are removed or deficient such foods are unable to support nutrition and symptoms of deficiency or actual disease develop.Although vitamins are unconnected with energy and protein supplies, yet they are necessary for complete normal metabolism.They are, however, not invariably present in the diet under all circumstances.Childhood and periods of growth, heavy work, childbirth, and lactation all demand the supply of more vitamins, and under these conditions signs of deficiency may be present, although the average intake is not altered.The criteria for the fairly accurate diagnosis of vitamin deficiencies are evidence of deficiency, presence of signs and symptoms, and improvement on supplying the deficient vitamin.It is easy to discover signs and symptoms of vitamin deficiencies, but it is not easy to tell that this or that vitamin is actually deficient in the diet of a certain individual, unless one is able to assess the exact daily intake of food, a process which is neither simple nor practical.Another way of approach is the assessment of the vitamin content in the blood or the measurement of the course of dark adaptation which demon- strates a real deficiency of vitamin A (Adler, 1953).Both tests entail more or less tedious laboratory work which is not easy in a provincial hospital.Response to the supply of the deficient vitamin or vitamins, on-the other hand, is a simple reliable test, which I have used in my first series of 670 cases, which I have seen and followed up as in-patients and out-patients in the central hospital at Wad Medani.In my second series, consisting of 595 cases, mostly schoolchildren, seen during a survey in some of the Gezira villages, my diagnosis was based on definite clinical signs alone.Vitamin deficiency is usually multiple and may at times be associated with general sub-nutrition and an unbalanced diet.It is customary to consider each vitamin with its specific manifestations separately, although there is really no sharp demarcation between one vitamin deficiency and the other.Xerophthalmia, for instance, is generally associated with rickets in cold climates.In Barlow's disease there is frequently co-existence of both scurvy and rickets in the same child.Avitaminosis-B is hardly ever seen in an isolated form.The whole symptomatology and clinical picture are so closely associated and interwoven that, at the best, one can say with certainty that the deficiency of one vitamin predominates (Sheldon, 1955;Davidson, 1956).Vitamin A Of all vitamins described so far, vitamin A is the most important as far as",

Food intake and eating behaviour of adolescents is influenced by a variety of factors. Especially important is the high level of dissatisfaction with body shape and weight or increased self-consciousness among girls. This forces them to adopt strict regimes for slimness, in pursuit of the goal i.e., to lose weight by skipping meals or omitting certain foods. Further the concept of self-identity makes them adopt erratic food behaviours. Hence, adolescent female represents a group at risk for nutrient deficiencies both in developing and industrialized countries.",

      "abstract": "The study shows that the problem of eating disorders in the twentieth century is associated with a cultural myth that created the phenomenon of Winnie the Pooh. Winnie’s character always manages to keep balance and control his emotions, manages to always be positive precisely because he eats in stress, and even when he is not hungry. Besides, he can’t stop eating all the good stuff. We suggest calling it «Winnie the Pooh syndrome». Winnie the Pooh syndrome became extremely popular due to the fact that it was offered during the period of cultural and historical trauma of hunger and danger (world war I), so during the second world war it became almost the only recipe that helped a person in a state of stress. This was fixed in the memory of generations, creating a cumulative cultural and historical trauma.The most susceptible to Winnie the Pooh syndrome are people with perfectionism, too low self-esteem, with an inflexible line of behavior, who are not able to come up with more powerful incentives for approval than sweets, as in childhood. Also plays an important role negative social experience, bullying or childhood trauma. But we can resist with Winnie the Pooh syndrome, if we realize that in our life there is something more pleasant than food – so today’s young people count calories, wear a fitness bracelet and try to lead a healthy lifestyle.",

      "abstract": "Le comportement alimentaire de l'homme suit une double periodicite circadienne, d'une part prandiale et d'autre part nycthemerale. Dans l'homeostasie energetique, les lipides consommes lors de la periode de veille constituent avant tout un substrat de reserve. Du fait des mecanismes d'apprentissage, certains facteurs (nutritionnels, oro-sensoriels, hedoniques, digestifs, metaboliques, neuro-hormonaux et culturels) favorisent l'adoption d'un regime spontane a fort contenu lipidique, qui induirait a son tour hyperphagie et obesite. Dans le meme temps, les comportements de restriction sont de plus en plus frequents dans la population, substituant a la prise alimentaire spontanee un controle cognitif des ingesta. Des produits alimentaires alleges en lipides, conservant les proprietes organoleptiques procurees par le gras pour un apport energetique inferieur, ont ete concus. Ils sont supposes contribuer a ameliorer l'observance des regimes hypoenergetiques. Ils permettent aux chercheurs de mieux etudier l'influence des lipides sur le comportement alimentaire en dissociant proprietes sensorielles et metaboliques. Conduits pour la plupart d'entre eux au sein meme du laboratoire, nos travaux font apparaitre que la dilution lipidique d'une precharge a l'insu des sujets, provoque un phenomene de compensation energetique au cours meme du nycthemere, retardee mais complete, que ce soit chez le sujet normoponderal ou obese. Les facteurs cognitifs modulent cette reponse. Le comportement restreint n'est pas associe a une diminution de la sensibilite aux signaux internes de repletion, et n'est pas, a lui seul, un facteur de contre-regulation. Seuls les sujets obeses non restreints et normoponderaux restreints montrent une tendance a une compensation specifique au nutriment lipidique. L'augmentation du contenu en lipides d'une precharge reduit la satiete sensorielle specifique (sss) chez le sujet normoponderal non restreint. Les sujets obeses presentent pour leur part une preference pour la version dont la densite lipidique est la plus forte et une absence de sss pour la version allegee par un substitut lipidique.",

Long hours spent in front of a TV are linked to higher material aspirations and anxiety and therewith lower life satisfaction.",

The American Psychological Association reported 38% of Americans attribute unhealthy or excessive eating to stress in a given month, Quartz reported April 24. That's without the additional anxiety of a global pandemic or the social isolation of nationwide lockdowns. Psychiatrists and nutritionists suggest that variations of the Mediterranean diet are ideal for mental wellness, because they are high in fiber and Omega‐3 fatty acids, which are commonly found in nuts, fish and olive oil. “The idea behind nutritional psychiatry is to feed the [gut] microbiome, eat nutrient‐dense plants and seafood, and avoid processed foods, simple carbs and simple sugars,” said Drew Ramsey, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. “These definitely increase inflammation. And, over time, this type of eating is highly correlated with an increased risk of depression.” He added, “We should all be eating comfort foods to help our emotional and mental well‐being — but while cooking with nutrient‐dense foods like sweet potatoes, the great popcorn, or seafood and bivalves. Those dishes are satisfying and comforting, but they also deliver nutrients that your brain needs.”",

Micronutrient deficiencies can occur when an individual is restricting calorie intake for weight loss or management, not consuming an adequate amount of food to meet energy requirements due to poor appetite or illness, eliminating one or more food groups from the diet on a regular basis, or consuming a diet low in micronutrient-rich foods despite adequate or excessive energy intake. Patient groups at risk include older adults, pregnant patients, patients with alcohol use disorder, patients with vegetarian or vegan diets, and patients with increased requirements secondary to medical conditions or long-term drug use that alters nutrient absorption, metabolism, or excretion. The micronutrients that most commonly require supplementation are vitamin D, iron, vitamin A, zinc, folate, and iodine. Results of large-scale randomized trials have shown no overall benefit of multivitamins for the majority of patients. However, a daily multivitamin may be beneficial, particularly for patients who do not consistently consume a well-balanced diet. Although dietary supplements can be helpful in correcting deficiencies, higher than recommended doses can cause adverse effects. Patients should be advised to take recommended dosages of supplements and consult their physician if they notice any adverse effects. Physicians should advise patients to consult drug labels and/or pharmacists about potential supplement interactions with drugs or other supplements.",

      "abstract": "Past research has shown that strong emotional or motivational states can cause normally restrained eaters to overeat. In this article it is argued that simple cognitive load can also disinhibit eating by restrained eaters. Two studies examined this disinhibition effect. In Study 1, restrained and unrestrained eaters were given the opportunity to consume high-calorie food while performing either a high cognitive-load or low cognitive-load task. Restrained eaters consumed more food when under high cognitive load than when under low cognitive load; unrestrained eaters showed the opposite pattern. Study 2 replicated the disinhibition effect and ruled out stress, diminished awareness of food consumption, and ironic rebound as probable mediators. Results suggest that cognitive load may disinhibit consumption by preventing restrained eaters from monitoring the dietary consequences of their eating behavior. Implications for theories of self-regulation are discussed.",

As nutritionist Adelle Davis famously put it back in the 1960s: \"Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper\". Breakfast is most commonly skipped meal more than lunch and dinner specifically in the young adult in the university study period and those who wake up late. Lack of time is the main reason behind skipping meals, in general, lack of appetite, inability to cook, fasting/religion, and not being hungry. Many people are used to be in a hurry for job, business, children's school in the morning where a filled stomach may prevent them to walk a long way. It is obvious that the irregular omission of breakfast may be effective in energy intake reduction over the next 24 hours and in this day, exercise performance may be compromised. There is no evidence that breakfast skipping reduces overeating or prevent weight gain. Some people argue that breakfast and good health is a marketing strategy by breakfast companies.",

Weight-loss dieting practices can involve reducing calorie intake, limiting portions, or following a particular eating pattern or regimen—for example, cutting carbohydrates and fats while preferring proteins. Yet dieting is much more than an individual activity. It is influenced by and mirrors a society’s power dynamics and social hierarchies that are also determined by weight and body shape. Looking particularly at the history of this phenomenon in modern industrialized societies like the United States, developments in weight-loss dieting are closely intertwined with gender and citizenship. Weight-loss dieting was a male practice in the 19th century and became a decidedly feminized practice in the 20th century. Furthermore, there have been concerns about the negative effects of weight-loss dieting as voiced by anti-diet nutritionists and the academic field of fat studies. Weight management is expressive of public discourses around health, capitalism, and body politics.",

This over-consumption of calories can be consistent (every time an individual eats he consumes too much) or sporadic (the response to environmental cues such as an overabundance of highly desirable food). Such overeating has been assumed to be the result of some mechanism, as yet unidentified, regulating energy balance. Moreover, this assumption was the basis for the belief that weight loss could be accomplished by teaching overeaters about the caloric value of food and how to select foods to meet but not exceed their nutritional needs. The failure of most behavioural weight-loss programmes to achieve this objective indicates that the problem is more complex than the learning to select calorically correct foods and using 'will-power.'",

Infant colic generally is not caused by a food allergy. In infants, urticaria, eczema or gastrointestinal bleeding may be due to foods such as milk and eggs, but clinical tolerance usually develops within a few years. Peanuts, tree nuts, seafood and seeds, as well as milk and eggs, can cause anaphylaxis in highly allergic children, and reexposure to such foods presents the risk of life-threatening reactions. Immediate-reacting allergy skin tests and in vitro IgE antibody tests can be used to screen for food allergy. Only food challenge, however, can confirm a reaction to a particular food. Management of food allergy, once the initial symptoms are confirmed, consists of avoidance of specific foods, sometimes for a lifetime. All children at risk for food anaphylaxis should be identified, and their parents or caretakers should be prepared to administer epinephrine before taking the child to the emergency room.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In Western countries, vegetarian diets are associated with lower intakes of energy, saturated fatty acids and animal protein and higher intakes of fibre and phytochemicals, compared to omnivorous diets. Whether the corresponding health benefits in vegetarians outweigh the risks of nutrient deficiencies has not been fully clarified. It should be noted that vegetarians often have a higher socioeconomic status, follow a more health-conscious lifestyle with higher physical activity, and refrain from smoking more often than non-vegetarians. The nutritional needs of growing children and adolescents can generally be met through a balanced, vegetable-based diet; however, due to their higher nutrient requirements per kilogramme of body weight, vegetarian children have a higher risk for developing nutrient deficiencies than adults. With a vegetarian diet, the mean intakes of some nutrients, such as the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are lower than in omnivores or those eating fish. For other nutrients, such as iron and zinc, the bioavailability from vegetable foodstuffs is reduced when the intake of phytates and fibre is high; thus, the prevalence of iron deficiency can be increased despite high vitamin C intake. In addition, vitamin B12 is only found in animal-source foods. Vitamin B12 should be supplemented in people of all age groups who follow a strict vegan diet without consuming animal products. A vegetarian diet in childhood and adolescence requires good information and supervision by a paediatrician, if necessary, in cooperation with an appropriately trained dietary specialist.",

      "title": "The Effects of Caloric Preload and Dietary Restraint on Smoking and Eating Behavior",
      "abstract": "Rates of smoking are elevated in eating-disordered populations, especially among females (Pomerleau & Snedecor, 2008; Klesges & Klesges, 1988). Restrained eaters ignore physiological cues of satiation and hunger, and instead attempt to employ cognitive control over decisions to eat. Additionally, they are prone to eat in a disinhibited manner after a salient emotional or food cue interrupts their restraint. This eating style is also associated with increased rates of smoking compared with the general population. Although there is a great deal of literature on the relationship between smoking and eating, the role of eating in momentary decisions regarding smoking remains to be explored. The current study tested whether a food prime, which has been found to elicit disinhibited eating in restrained eaters, could also motivate smoking as an alternative to eating. In a randomized two-arm (Prime/No-Prime) between-subjects design, it was hypothesized that smokers, particularly those high in eating restraint, receiving a food prime would be more likely to smoke than eat when given the option, compared to smokers who did not receive the food prime. Although main effects on smoking variables were not found, restraint status did moderate the effect of the food prime upon latency to first puff, number of puffs, and cigarette craving. Moreover, the moderation effect was reversed upon eating variables, suggesting that after a food prime, weight-control smokers appear to choose to smoke to prevent further food intake. This conclusion was bolstered by the finding that the moderation effect on smoking was further moderated by expectancies regarding the effect of smoking upon appetite and weight. In summary, this study identified psychological mechanisms that appear to underlie the population-based covariance between disordered eating and smoking.",

Then environmental influences on our eating are discussed, since eating, the most fundamental behavior for life, is under strong influence of cultures of the present society. In the developed countries, people under stress tend to eat too much since foods are so delicious and sweet that eating is a pleasure; they often suffer from life-style-related diseases. Also in the developed countries, many young people suffer from eating disorders, that is, anorexia and bulimia nervosa. Their behavior (refusing to eat, or eating-vomiting) is on one hand to appeal their anxiety accumulated in their childhood, and to survive extremely stressful days on the other.",

Psychological dependence is the subjective feeling that the user needs the drug to maintain a feeling of well-being; physical dependence is characterized by tolerance (the need for increasingly larger doses in order to achieve the initial effect) and withdrawal symptoms when the user is abstinent. There are a lot of effects of drug addiction to the economy, society, and family. Drug addiction affects individual's physical and mental health. Drug addicts are burden for a family and society.

      "abstract": "Increased fruit and vegetable consumption early in life may lead to life-long intake of fruits and vegetables, which in turn may be beneficial for weight control and other health outcomes in later life. Although health officials worldwide recommend delaying solid foods until 6 months of age, younger infants often receive solid food, which may affect later obesity rates. The timing of introduction to solid foods is important both nutritionally and developmentally and may affect acceptance of foods both in infancy and later in life. Infants can clearly discriminate the flavors of different fruits and vegetables. Repeated flavor experiences promote the willingness to eat a variety of foods: infants will consume more of foods that have a familiar flavor and are more accepting of novel flavors if they have experience with flavor variety. Many flavors that the mother either ingests or inhales are transmitted to her milk and/or amniotic fluid. Mothers can help the transition from a diet exclusively of milk or formula to a mixed diet by providing the infant familiar flavors in both milk or formula and solid foods. Exposure to a variety of flavors during and between meals appears to facilitate acceptance of novel foods. Providing novelty in the context of a familiar food might prove to be an optimal combination to progressively accustom infants to a diversity of novel foods. When repeatedly exposing infants to flavors of some vegetables that have bitter tastes, mothers should focus not on infants’ facial expressions but on their willingness to eat the food and should continue to provide repeated opportunities to taste the food. Introducing children repeatedly to individual as well as a variety of fruits and vegetables, both within and between meals, might help them be more accepting of fruits and vegetables, which is difficult to enhance beyond toddlerhood.",

A partial explanation can be found in an investigation of the relative meaning of the drug for the addict within his social context rather than viewing the drug simply as a pharmacological agent. The idea that addiction is a social phenomenon within the addicts family suggests a relationship between the functioning of the families of addicts and their inability to tolerate abstinence. Because the abuse of heroin or barbiturates by one family member can result in \"rewards\" for all family members, the family, in behaving as if the addict cannot control his drug use, functions in such a way as to reinforce the addiction.",

The main cause of this real or supposed constipation is the lack of dietary fibre in the food.

Treatment may include general measurements, the addition of bulk-laxatives to the diet and the prescription of other laxatives. The use of laxatives other than bulk-laxatives may cause many harmful side-effects in the aged. The daily food must contain sufficient dietary fibre.

      "abstract": "Food pouches offer parents convenience and can calm mealtime stress with a toddler, especially one who's a picky eater. But are there unintended effects of offering these squeezable bags of softened or pureed food too often? A preference for only eating food pouches might signal underlying medical, nutritional, developmental/feeding skill, and psychosocial concerns. If I suspect something beyond developmental picky eating, I refer the child for further subspecialist workup. But if we're looking at selective eating with no underlying feeding disorder, caregivers often worry about their child's insistence on food pouches, questioning whether there may be negative effects.",

      "abstract": "Prior research indicates that when candy dishes were moved 6 feet off the desks of office assistants, their average daily consumption of candy decreased by almost one‐half. They reported that this was because that distance led them to “pause” and reflect as to whether they were really that hungry. Multiple portions (refills) is a reported contributor to overeating at meal time. Using the same reasoning as with the candy dishes, a lunchtime lab experiment with university staff (n=78) was conducted to examine whether serving foods from the stove or kitchen counter instead of the table would reduce the number of times an individual refilled their plate. The results indicated that this “serve it here; eat it there” technique decreased intake by an estimated 23–35% decrease – approximately the equivalent to ½ less of a portion. The impact of this technique was slightly stronger on men than on women (P=.03).",

      "abstract": "Die Vorstellung, „eine Kalorie ist eine Kalorie”, ist nicht mehr aufrecht zu erhalten und macht vor dem Hintergrund aktueller Forschungsergebnisse nach Ansicht der Autoren einen Paradigmenwechsel notwendig. Die Zusammensetzung der Nahrung in Bezug auf die Makronährstoffe beeinflusst eine Vielzahl von Hormon- und Transmittersystemen, die entscheidende Wirkung auf die Regulation des Energiehaushaltes haben. Diese Systeme führen nicht nur zu Veränderungen in der Energiebilanz und damit der Effizienz der Nahrungsauswertung, sondern tragen wesentlich zum Verhalten des Individuums im Zusammenhang mit der Nahrungsaufnahme bei. Die Übergewicht und Adipositas häufig begleitende chronische Hyperinsulinämie, entweder als Folge einer primären Hypersekretion oder als Konsequenz einer etablierten Insulinresistenz, nimmt dabei eine zentrale Stellung ein. Diätkostformen mit niedriger Insulinogenität (niedrige glykämische Last [Low GL], niedriger glykämischer Index [Low GI]) zeigen günstigere Wirkungen im Hinblick auf Hungergefühl, Grundumsatz, Lipidstoffwechsel und Insulinsensitivität als traditionelle Low-Fat-Reduktionskostformen. Hinsichtlich der Gewichtsreduktion zeigen sie bislang bei jenen Personen deutliche Vorteile, bei denen ein Hyperinsulinismus besteht. Die zukünftige Ernährungstherapie bei Übergewicht und Adipositas wird individuell nach dem metabolischen Profil des Betroffenen gestaltet werden müssen. Die Analyse der Insulinproduktion und des Insulinspiegels eines Patienten wird möglicherweise zur entscheidenden Determinante, wenn die Gewichtsreduktion das primäre Therapieziel ist.",

      "title": "Alcohol Use Disorder",
      "abstract": "Millions of individuals use alcohol every day; however, not everyone experiences a problem due to such use. It is therefore helpful to conceptualize alcohol use as ranging on a continuum from nonproblematic social use (e.g., a glass of wine with dinner); to alcohol misuse (e.g., a one-time incident of binge drinking); to excessive use or abuse (e.g., frequent use of alcohol that results in a negative impact on the life of the individual and those around him or her, such as recurrent driving under the influence of alcohol); and finally, to physical dependence or addiction to alcohol (e.g., a chronic disorder that may require medical detoxification and/or formal treatment). While not used professionally, the commonly used term alcoholism has been used synonymously with alcohol addiction and refers to the compulsive use of alcoholic beverages. Both terms imply a progressive deterioration of the individual’s social, physical, and mental status combined with the inability to stop using alcohol even when wishing to do so. Although the professional literature on alcohol use problems is extensive and can be found in almost every country in the world, the inconsistent use of terminology is often confusing. There are tremendous overlaps among literature on topics such as alcohol-related problems, risky drinking, hazardous drinking, alcohol abuse and dependence, substance abuse, and alcohol addiction. The confusion has been compounded by the changes in the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2013), which eliminated the previous diagnostic classifications of “alcohol abuse” and “alcohol dependence” and replace them with the overall category of “Alcohol Use Disorders” (AUD), which itself is part of the broader new DSM-5 category of “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders.” A fuller discussion of the DSM changes can be seen in S. Lala A. Straussner’s 2013 article “The DSM–5 diagnostic criteria: What’s new?” Journal of Social Work Practice in the Addictions. Research studies in the United States indicate a general decrease in the proportions of individuals with “pure” alcohol use diagnosis and an increase among those using multiple substances. Consequently, the topic of alcohol-use disorders needs to be considered within the context of the literature on problematic use of a variety of other chemical substances as well as other addictions, such as gambling and smoking. It also needs to take into account co-occurring mental disorders; age, gender, and sexual identity of users; socioeconomic and psychological issues; family dynamics; and ethnocultural factors. Finally, research and treatment focusing on AUD must be viewed within the context of governmental policies, which vary over time and in different locations.",

      "title": "bruxismo como causa de desgaste dental",
      "abstract": "La masticación es considerada la función principal del sistema estomatognático y de los dientes. Estudios realizados en los años 70 y 80, revelaron que practicamente no hay contacto dentario durante la masticación, excepto durante la fase de máxima intercuspidación. Aunque la masticación se basa en un patrón muscular automatizado, es todavía una actividad consciente. El desgaste dental es mayoritariamente atribuido a la abrasión causada por los componentes más duros de la comida o por contaminación de ésta con materiales abrasivos como sílice o carbonatos. En cambio, el bruxismo del sueño es un movimiento excursivo, inconsciente, de los dientes inferiores, que utiliza toda la longitud de las guías oclusales con mayor fuerza muscular y sin la interposición del bolo alimenticio. Por esa razón, puede resultar en contactos dentales de mayor extensión, con el resultado de pérdida de material. Al considerar los humanos modernos que utilizan una dieta blanda y refinada, que generalmente no contribuye para el desgaste dentario, la posibilidad de que el bruxismo sea el mayor contribuyente para la pérdida de material dentario no puede ser descartada. Así, los patrones de desgaste dentario en sujetos modernos y en poblaciones antiguas deberían ser considerados con base en la experiencia clínica del análisis de las actividades de bruxismo y masticación en sujetos vivos. En este artículo se presenta la experiencia clínica en pacientes con bruxismo y con desgaste dental en sociedades industrializadas contemporáneas como una posible fuente de información que se debe integrar al análisis del desgaste encontrado en hallazgos arqueológicos.",

      "abstract": "In view of increasing knowledge of the function of the normal human pancreas, it is not surprising that there are now an increasing number of technical innovations that attempt to mimic pancreatic endocrine function. The normal pancreas secretes insulin constantly at a rate based on the metabolic needs of the individual. The basal rate of insulin secretion is relatively constant and comprises about one-half the total 24-hour insulin output, or about 0.3 units/kg/24 hours in the normal individual who is within 80–120% ideal body weight. The normal pancreas also senses blood glucose continuously and gives insulin or initiates counterregulatory activity depending on the absolute value of blood glucose and the rate of change of blood glucose. In addition, through neural input, the pancreas can anticipate ingestion of calories with insulin secretion so that the liver is \"primed\" to metabolize caloric intake. Finally, insulin is secreted in response to food based not only on the caloric and carbohydrate intake but also on the blood glucose at the moment of eating. Such a system is known as a \"closed loop system\" since it has the capability to sense glucose and respond appropriately. An open loop system provides only one limb of a closed loop system—either sensing glucose or infusing glucose.",

It is difficult to find scientific valid recent information. Fasting without changing eating habits previous to the fast do not help in weight loss. Fasting is indicated previous to a surgical intervention or any procedure requiring general anesthesia because risk of pulmonary aspiration of the gastric content after the anethesia induction.

      "title": "Nutritional Preparation of Athletes: What Makes Sense?",
      "abstract": "Abstract With the increased public awareness of fitness and participation in athletics, the primary care physician needs a basic understanding of nutrition's role in athletics. Energy metabolism shifts from anaerobic glycogen metabolism to aerobic free fatty acid and then glycogen metabolism as intensity and duration of exercise increases. Body glycogen stores are, therefore, important to maximum performance and can be manipulated to some degree with appropriate diet. Protein, vitamin, and other dietary supplements have not been demonstrated to effect performance. Good day-to-day nutrition has greater impact on athletic performance than the pregame meal, but, four hours precompetition, a moderate meal high in complex carbohydrates should be eaten. High carbohydrate meals should be continued after competition to replace glycogen stores. Fluid intake, particularly water and juices, should be increased for the hours before the competition and, in endurance events, at 20-minute intervals during the competition, since absorption is rate-limited. Postcompetitive fluid replacement should be enough to replenish body weight. “Value of Lymph Node Biopsy in Unexplained Lymphadenopathy in Homosexual Men,” RUSSELL K. BYRNES, et al. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) manifested by severe opportunistic infections, Kaposi's sarcoma, or lymphoma often has a prodrome of lymphadenopathy accompanied by constitutional symptoms. We studied the histopathologic findings of lymph node biopsy specimens and peripheral blood immunologic parameters of 24 clinically indistinguishable homosexual men with chronic generalized lymphadenopathy. Two different morphological patterns were observed: (1) lymph nodes with follicular and paracortical hyperplasia in 21 patients who had had no clinical deterioration and (2) an atypical pattern of lymphoid proliferation in three patients who experienced rapid development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and/or opportunistic infections. Several immunologic laboratory results paralleled these changes. Lymph node morphological findings seem to be a useful predictor of outcome in homosexual men with generalized lymphadenopathy. (Journal of the American Medical Association 1983;250:1313–1317.) “Long-term Diazepam Therapy and Clinical Outcome,” KARL RICKELS, et al. This double-blind study involved the continuous (six to 22 weeks) treatment of 180 chronically anxious outpatients with diazepam, 15 to 40 mg/day. Our findings indicate that a significant number of patients benefit from prolonged diazepam treatment and that tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of diazepam does not develop during a 22-week study period. The duration of continual treatment with sedative-benzodiazepines was clearly the most important determinant of withdrawal reactions. Patients treated continuously for less than eight months with sedative-benzodiazepines had an incidence of withdrawal of 5%, whereas 43% of patients treated for eight months or more demonstrated clear withdrawal reactions. While these withdrawal reactions produced considerable distress, they were neither life threatening nor incapacitating and did not include convulsions or psychotic reactions. In all cases, withdrawal reactions could be readily managed by gradually tapering the dose of the benzodiazepine. (Journal of the American Medical Association 1983;250:767–771.)",

      "abstract": "In addition to being a pharmacological agent, alcohol (ethanol) can also be considered a food; the body can utilize effectively its calorific contribution. The consumption of alcohol has in many respects the same characteristics as the intake of food. In animal experiments, food intake decreases in relation to the calorific value of the alcohol consumed; in human studies, various results have been obtained from no compensation to full compensation for the contribution from alcohol. If a choice is possible, primarily the carbohydrate part of the diet is decreased for compensation to ethanol intake. Food, in turn, can influence alcohol consumption. There is evidence that it is the carbohydrate content of the diet which influences alcohol drinking. The daily intake of alcohol is equally or even better regulated than intake of carbohydrate, protein, or fat. There is a circadian rhythm of alcohol consumption which resembles the rhythm of food intake. However, the mechanism which regulates alcohol intake does not have a very strong influence on the behaviour of most animals or humans, and its control is often overpowered by outside factors. Nevertheless, it is important to identify the precise mechanism because a better understanding should provide valuable information for use in the search for risk markers and pharmacological treatments for alcoholism.",

Using event-related potentials, we showed that individuals who find food-related images more motivationally relevant than erotic ones (“sign-trackers”) are more susceptible to cue-induced eating and, in the presence of a palatable food option, eat twice as much as individuals with the opposite brain reactivity profile (“goal-trackers”).

      "abstract": "Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, may be a disease that affects an individual's brain and behaviour and results in an inability to regulate the utilization of a legal or illegal drug or medication. Substances like alcohol, marijuana and nicotine are also considered drugs. When you're addicted, you'll continue using the drug despite the harm it causes . Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a narcotic in social situations, and, for a few people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, white plague begins with exposure to prescribed medications, or receiving medications from a lover or relative who has been prescribed the medication. The risk of addiction and the way fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, like opioid painkillers, have a better risk and cause addiction more quickly than others. As time passes, you'll need larger doses of the drug to urge high. Soon you'll need the drug just to feel good. As your drug use increases, you'll find that it's increasingly difficult to travel without the drug. Attempts to prevent drug use may cause intense cravings and cause you to feel physically ill (withdrawal symptoms). You may need help from your doctor, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program to beat your white plague and stay drug-free. Drug addiction isn’t about just heroin, cocaine, or other illegal drugs. You can get hooked in to alcohol, nicotine, opioid painkillers, and other legal substances. At first, you'll prefer to take a drug because you wish the way it causes you to feel. You may think you can control how much and how often you use it. But over time, drugs change how your brain works. These physical changes can last a long time. They make you lose self-control and may lead you to damaging behaviours.",

As a result, the disposition to experience these desires is very persistent over the long-term, manifesting itself in particular episodes of wanting to use drugs that recur with great frequency. Both the persistence and the recurrence of these desires, it is argued, contribute to a diminished ability to respond to relevant reasons that speak against drug use.",

      "abstract": "The availability of artificial light and light-emitting devices has changed human life in relation to time, enabling 24-hour health care, trade, and production, as well as the expansion of social life around the clock. In Europe, about 21% of the labor force consists of shift workers. 10% of the employed population work evening shifts or the night shift, and 7% of employees in Europe regularly work the night shift. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 15 million Americans work the night shift. Shift work, especially night-time work, seriously affects dietary habits. It is known that night-time work produces a conflict between the socially determined rhythm of eating and the circadian biological rhythms related to the feeling of hunger, satiety, as well as the metabolism itself. Night meals cause disorders of intestinal motility, affect digestion, absorption, but also the utilization of nutrients and possible medical therapy (if the individual has one). From the point of view of chronobiology, humans belong to diurnal species, which to a certain extent explains why night shift workers have a decreased appetite at night, when the human body is programmed for rest and fasting, as well as for endogenous mobilization of glucose. From the psychosocial aspect, shift workers usually experience a discrepancy between their daily routines (including the meal schedule) and those they have with family and friends, which further leads to even more severe disorders of dietary habits. However, it is difficult to give dietary recommendations regarding nutrition. Firstly, there are no clear views on whether night shift workers should eat during the night hours or not. Secondly, even if night eating is encouraged, definitive evidence is lacking on which types of food should be consumed and which should be avoided. Thirdly, the most nutritious foods may not be available at that time of night. Finally, eating at night certainly has an impact on the metabolism. With all the above in mind, we have tried to provide some useful guidelines regarding these issues.",

Sweetness encompasses the sweet taste associated with the various sugars, intense sweeteners, and heavy metal halides. Satiety according to the common, dictionary use refers to a glutted, unpleasant state following consumption of too much of something. However, satiety may also refer to a positive state which occurs as hunger is relieved. In scientific studies satiety generally refers to the graded termination of eating. As eating proceeds individuals start to feel full and that they have had enough, i.e., they are satiated. The preference or liking for the food being consumed declines, but interest in food can often be revived by offering another food. Thus satiety may refer to both a change in the palatability of foods, i.e. the hedonic response to foods, and to the satisfaction of the physiological need for food. In this review I will first discuss the changing hedonic response to sweetness and will then discuss the ability of different sugars and intense sweeteners to satisfy hunger and reduce food intake.",

      "title": "Physical activity, food intake, and body weight regulation: insights from doubly labeled water studies",
      "abstract": "Body weight and energy balance can be maintained by adapting energy intake to changes in energy expenditure and vice versa, whereas short-term changes in energy expenditure are mainly caused by physical activity. This review investigates whether physical activity is affected by over- and undereating, whether intake is affected by an increase or a decrease in physical activity, and whether being overweight affects physical activity. The available evidence is based largely on studies that quantified physical activity with doubly labeled water. Overeating does not affect physical activity, while undereating decreases habitual or voluntary physical activity. Thus, it is easier to gain weight than to lose weight. An exercise-induced increase in energy requirement is typically compensated by increased energy intake, while a change to a more sedentary routine does not induce an equivalent reduction of intake and generally results in weight gain. Overweight and obese subjects tend to have similar activity energy expenditures to lean people despite being more sedentary. There are two ways in which the general population trend towards increasing body weight can be reversed: reduce intake or increase physical activity. The results of the present literature review indicate that eating less is the most effective method for preventing weight gain, despite the potential for a negative effect on physical activity when a negative energy balance is reached.",

Overnutrition at this age can increase the risk of obesity and other degenerative diseases in adulthood. Stress and eating behavior are two factors that might impact nutritional status in adolescents. Stress can trigger unhealthy eating behaviors, such as increased consumption of fast food, sugary foods and drinks, or even loss of appetite. Stress can also lead to emotional eating behavior, which is the urge to eat as a coping method when facing stress or negative pressure, and has been link to a higher BMI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This study aims to identify the relationship between stress, emotional eating, and the nutritional status of high school students at SMA 2 Cileungsi Bogor Regency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This research is a quantitative study with a cross-sectional approach. Data collection was conducted in September 2023 at SMA 2 Cileungsi Bogor Regency. Data were collected using research instruments, including the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire – Shortened Version (ASQ-S) to determine stress data, the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) to determine emotional eating data, anthropometric measurements to determine the nutritional status of the respondents, and the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) to assess the frequency of respondents' consumption of various foods. This study involved 262 respondents obtained using Cluster Random Sampling technique. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The results showed that most of respondents in this study had normal nutritional status, accounting for 66.0%, while 8.4% were undernourished and 25.6% were overnourished. Respondents categorized as stressed were 51.9%, while the remaining 48.1% were adaptive. It was found that 54.6% of respondents fell in to the category of emotional eating, while 45.4% did not exhibit emotional eating behaviour. Based on bivariate analysis, a significant relationship was found between stress and nutritional status (p-value=0.013). There was no significant relationship between emotional eating and nutritional status (p-value=0.647).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stress has been shown to be significantly associated with nutritional status.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEYWORD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutritional status; stress; emotional eating; adolescents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

A food allergy is an immunological reaction to the exposure to a food antigen. The majority of recognized food allergies are the Immunoglobulin E mediated degranulation of the mast cells in response to a food allergen, primarily glycoprotein. Adverse symptoms to food ingestion may be acute and caused by a single exposure, or they may be dose related. Elimination diets can be useful in helping to determine which foods in the diet are causing an adverse reaction. If the symptoms disappear with the elimination of the food and reappear with its reintroduction, it is presumed that the individual is allergic to this food. An open challenge is a reintroduction in which both the person eating the food and the person observing the symptoms are aware of the food being tested.",

She is identical to you in every way except that she does not have PCOS. What you would find is that, if you both ate exactly the same number of calories as each other every day for a year, if your twin sister’s weight remained the same, yours would increase by 4 lb in that year. Therefore women with PCOS have a very slightly slower metabolism than their non-PCOS counterparts. An accumulation of 4 lb of fat in a year equates to an excess of only 38 calories per day, less than two teaspoons of sugar.",

      "abstract": "This research paper seeks to raise awareness regarding the physical, psychological, social, and life-threatening effects of fasting and binge eating. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics emphasizes eating patterns instead of specific foods as a more effective approach to lessening the risk of eating disorders. Research from Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, the University of Tartu, and Dalhousie University determined that consistent eating patterns can be influenced by the individual's personality traits, self-control, outside influence, environment, and state of mind. Some individuals skip meals and even go without eating for extended periods of time to lose weight, for religious beliefs, or medical necessity. According to Fuhrman, fasting can be quite dangerous; and medical experts agree fasting is not a healthy or effective way to lose weight. Unlike fasting, individuals with binge eating disorder (BED), eat unusually large amounts of food in a short period of time. Results published in Biological Psychiatry, found that 3.5% of women and 2.0% of men had binge eating disorder during their life. All foods can be within healthy eating patterns when they are appropriately portioned, eaten in moderation, and combined with physical activity. Raising awareness about prevention, encouraging early detection and treatment is crucial and possible.",

      "abstract": "It is often stated, \"the faster you lose weight, the faster it is regained \". A review of existing literature does not support such a statement--indeed if anything the reverse is true. The origins of this erroneous view are the misconceptions that weight regain is a simple matter of bad dietary and social habits and that it takes time to change these, that physiological adaptations to rapid weight loss are different to those of gradual weight loss and that weight regain is simply due to a return to old habits. Indeed there are many advantages to rapid weight loss achieved with the use of a modern very low energy diet, including the fact that rapid weight loss is a motivating factor, that the mild ketosis that occurs not only suppresses hunger, but also slows protein loss and that adherence is easier with a structured dietary regime. VLEDs are dietary preparations that provide all nutritional requirements together with between 1845 and 3280 KJ (450 and 800 Kcal) per day. An individual takes this meal replacement three times daily as a substitute for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In addition, a bowl of non-starchy vegetables once daily provides some fibre and helps to satisfy the social aspect of eating. A teaspoon of oil on the vegetables contracts the gall bladder to minimise the risk of gall stone formation. Since weight loss, at whatever rate, results in physiological adaptations leading to weight regain, careful attention must be paid to the period after the VLED regime is completed. Lifestyle modification, diet and exercise are instituted optimally with behaviour modification. If, despite the subject's best efforts, weight regain occurs, an appetite suppressant is advisable to help control the drive to eat.",

      "abstract": "Going hungry for a period of 8-10 hours at night is normal for most people. Hunger is characterized by a coordinated series of metabolic changes; it is a situation that preserves endogenous carbohydrate and increases the use of fat as a source of energy. While the consumption of endogenous carbohydrate becomes restricted, the production of carbohydrate from amino acids, glycerol and ketone bodies through gluconeogenesis increases. Many people periodically fast for religious or cultural reasons. Ramadan is a state of fasting in Islam when it is forbidden to eat and drink during daylight hours for 30 days. A state of intermittent fasting such as Ramadan has a slight effect on the general nutrition and physiological responses of the sedentary population. Food intake occurs at night and close to the morning. The body mass generally remains the same, the total energy intake roughly remains stable, and small changes are observed in the consumption of protein, carbohydrate and fat. Nevertheless, the lack of suitable nutritional support decreases the adaptation to exercising and disrupts the process of preparation for competitions. The process of recovery after heavy exercising depends on the food and liquid intake. This compilation aims to examine the effects of the month of Ramadan on exercising performance in the light of scientific data",

      "abstract": "Recovery after strenuous exercise involves processes that are dependent on fluid and food intake. Current sports nutrition guidelines provide recommendations for the quantity and timing of consumption of nutrients to optimise recovery issues such as refuelling, rehydration and protein synthesis for repair and adaptation. Recovery of immune and antioxidant systems is important but less well documented. In some cases, there is little effective recovery until nutrients are supplied, while in others, the stimulus for recovery is strongest in the period immediately after exercise. Lack of appropriate nutritional support will reduce adaption to exercise and impair preparation for future bouts. Ramadan represents a special case of intermittent fasting undertaken by many athletes during periods of training as well as important competitive events. The avoidance of fluid and food intake from sunrise to sundown involves prolonged periods without intake of nutrients, inflexibility with the timing of eating and drinking over the day and around an exercise session, and changes to usual dietary choices due to the special foods involved with various rituals. These outcomes will all challenge the athlete's ability to recover optimally between exercise sessions undertaken during the fast or from day to day.",

Unlike airline passengers, many patients on dialysis have protein-energy wasting (PEW) syndromes and could potentially benefit from the additional protein and calories (1). As tempting as it may be to compare dialysis units to discount airlines that withhold peanuts or pretzels from their passengers, there are historical reasons why American dialysis units have frequently banned eating on dialysis. When maintenance hemodialysis in hospital-based units began in the 1960s, inefficient dialysis meant treatment times over 24 hours, and therefore, units provided meals (2). By 1976, the standard treatment was 8 hours of dialysis three times a week, and patients ate a meal that they brought if they were not provided with one. As dialysis became more efficient, treatment times were shortened, and with more rapid volume and solute removal, hemodynamic instability became a challenge (3). Importantly, hypotension seemed to be more common among patients who had recently eaten, and additional investigation identified a postprandial fall in systemic vascular resistance as the most likely mechanism (4,5). Although there are no case reports of aspiration from eating on dialysis, newspaper articles do show a few such lawsuits (6). Thus, many American hemodialysis units banned eating on dialysis. In contrast, European and Asian dialysis units did not reduce dialysis times to the same extent as American units, and a much larger percentage of these units continued to provide meals for their patients or allowed patients to bring their own food. Concern that eating may be beneficial for PEW is counterbalanced with concern for hypotension in European guidelines on hemodynamic instability on dialysis (7). Although no systematic study has been performed, relatively few complications were noted in a recent survey of European and Asian units that continue the practice (8). Thus, although there has been diversity in practice worldwide, American units became less likely than units in other countries to allow eating during treatment. Modern proponents of eating on dialysis do not dispute effects of postprandial physiology on BP, but they argue against its clinical significance (9,10). In their eyes, clinically significant negative effects were only seen with large meals, large fluid intake, or meals late in the dialysis session. They note correctly that many studies occurred in an era when some patients were still on acetate dialysate and before biocompatible membranes, volumetric ultrafiltration, low-temperature dialysis, and limits on hourly ultrafiltration were common. For example, they cite a study performed in 2008 over three treatments in 126 patients in whom there were no effects of eating on any measure of BP (11). Furthermore, they argue that there may be significant benefits of eating on dialysis for patients with PEW. First, they note that oral nutrition when used as a control in studies of intradialytic parenteral nutrition was associated with improved albumin and outcomes (12). The loss of amino acids that occurs with dialysis is intensely catabolic for muscle, and radiotracer studies confirmed that the slow delivery of amino acids to the bloodstream in the postprandial state provided excellent delivery of amino acids to muscle (13,14). Patients who ate on dialysis consumed more protein and more calories (15) and reported a higher quality of life (16). In a retrospective, observational study, patients with PEW defined by a serum albumin of <3.5 mg/dl who received oral supplements containing 15 g protein on or before dialysis had a 29% decrease in mortality compared with matched control subjects in a 14-month follow-up (17). However, eating on dialysis did not help patients without PEW in the few available studies (18). Given the growing data on the relative safety and possible benefits of oral nutrition before or during hemodialysis, have there been changes in practices of United States hemodialysis units? In this issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, Benner et al. (19) examine surveys on eating in dialysis units completed by dietitians in units owned by DaVita Healthcare Partners, Inc., a leading United States dialysis provider. The surveys reported on both practices around oral nutrition and attitudes of the dietitian, facility manager, and medical director toward eating on hemodialysis. After an initial survey in 2011 showed a diversity of practices on eating on dialysis, Benner et al. (19) devised an educational intervention sent in 2013 to promote eating before, during, and after dialysis and highlight safety issues. Then, in 2014, they repeated the survey (19); >1000 units responded to each survey, which gave the study adequate power. The results show a great diversity of practices but a strong trend toward allowing eating on dialysis when the two surveys were compared. Only about 29% of the units had an absolute ban on eating during dialysis in 2011, and this number fell to 23% in the second survey; <20% of dialysis units encouraged eating on dialysis in 2011, but this increased to >30% in 2014. The majority of units allowed eating but did not encourage it. Dietitians were much more likely to support eating on dialysis than medical directors or facility administrators, but all groups had a more favorable outlook on eating on dialysis in the 2014 survey compared with in 2011. Hypotension, gastrointestinal symptoms, and clinic hygiene were cited as major reasons to oppose eating, with little change between the two surveys. However, meeting caloric needs, avoiding hypoglycemia, and difficulty enforcing a ban on eating were cited as reasons to allow eating. Interestingly, of the units that banned eating, two thirds reported that patients ate on dialysis, despite the ban. Meeting caloric needs was the only reason for eating that was cited more often in 2014 than in 2011. When asked why they changed practices, very few respondents cited the intervention that Benner et al. (19) sent to promote eating. Of those respondents, one of three restricted eating more because of the intervention. Thus, other factors than the intervention were responsible for the changes in behavior. The message from the work by Benner et al. (19) is clear. Eating on dialysis is increasing in the United States both because of official encouragement in some units and because patients are defying bans on eating in others. The benefit for patients with PEW is increasingly clear, and the risks are small. The challenge for health care providers is to help our patients make good choices of when and what to eat. My experience matches the dietitians in the survey who described eating as a teaching opportunity, because boiled peanuts, pretzels, extra-large colas, and nacho cheese corn chips make great food for discussion about healthy food choices. Most studies showing benefit of feeding on dialysis have used nutritional supplements, but studies in other settings suggest that mixed meals of similar composition could be equally beneficial (20,21). Benner et al. (19) developed sensible suggestions (shown in the supplemental material in ref. 19) as to limiting the size of the meal, lowering fluid consumption, eating 15 g protein, and not creating spills. On the basis of studies of hypotension, I might add encouraging eating before or earlier in dialysis to that list. It is clear that we need more information on how to maximize benefits and reduce risks for the patients. The piece missing from the study by Benner et al. (19) is patient attitudes about eating. If some patients are eating when forbidden to do so, there must be a reason. Whether we pay attention to the scientific evidence that oral supplements given during dialysis improve self–reported quality of life (16) or our human experience that a little food makes sitting in a chair for 3 or 4 hours more tolerable, we can guess that eating on dialysis may meet a nonmedical need. Although relying on science, I think that it is time that we listen to our patients as we revise our policies about eating on dialysis. Disclosures None.",

      "abstract": "Children reportedly consume a variety of adequate vegetables during the introduction of complementary foods, and breastfeeding helps to facilitate child food acceptance. However, dietary intake of vegetables is reported to fall when children begin to eat foods of the family table. In laboratory settings, repeated exposure is effective in promoting children's acceptance and consumption of novel foods. We have recently explored mother and child early experiences (from infancy to toddlerhood) with offering hard-to-like foods. Our findings suggest a \"sweet spot\" for food introduction and acceptance during the early complementary feeding period (6–12 months) with increasing variability in acceptance and negative child behaviors occurring during toddlerhood. When queried, most mothers are familiar with repeated exposure concepts, but their persistence in continuing to offer disliked foods differs. Some report they will \"never give up\" – a stance linked to health beliefs and that children should \"eat what we eat.\" Others seem more influenced by children's resistance and food dislikes, and the amounts their child eat. The majority believe that children's tastes change and that their child will accept rejected foods later. These mothers may reoffer a rejected food after \"a break.\" Opportunities exist to translate repeated exposure paradigms to practical methods mothers can successfully adopt in the home.",

High doses of some single nutrients may improve immunity in relatively short time periods (weeks to months), but persistence of these effects is not currently known. High doses of other micronutrients may adversely affect immunity. Some micronutrients may interfere with the beneficial effects of other micronutrients on immunity; this effect depends on relative doses. Low- to moderate-dose multivitamin/mineral supplements may require considerable time (6 mo to 1 yr or more) before they enhance immune functions and potentially reduce susceptibility to infectious diseases, and the timing of their effects may differ between men and women. High- and even low-dose micronutrient supplements may enhance immunity even in the absence of evidence of underlying deficiencies. Micronutrient supplements are not a substitute for a good diet and regular exercise but, rather, are a complementary measure. Long-term ingestion of single nutrient supplements, especially at high doses, may have beneficial and/or adverse effects on immunity and other outcomes.",

The energy intake of a developing athlete should be determined individually based on gender, anthropometric measurement, character, and number of workouts per day. The frequent presence of drowsiness and fatigue during training may indicate insufficient dietary energy supply. Dehydration exceeding 2% of body weight should be prevented. Isotonic drinks should only be consumed during training longer than 75 minutes. Young swimmers should consume adequate amounts of carbohydrates to restore glycogen reserves before another training unit. Carbohydrates with a high glycemic index of 1-1.2 g/kg b.w./h should be delivered during the post-training period. Immediately following training, a meal containing a complete protein should be consumed to accelerate post-exercise recovery. The total protein supply should be at least 1.2 g/kg b.w./h. The minimum intake of fat in the diet of a young swimmer should be 2 g/kg lean b.w. It is recommended to limit products containing large amounts of saturated fatty acids.",

According to the DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorders, the pattern of ultra-processed food (UPF) overconsumption is best characterized as an addiction. There is significant overlap in how UPF and drugs of abuse impact many brain systems. Over time, neurological changes result in overpowering cravings, insatiable hunger, and a willpower gap. The Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 is a validated and widely used tool for the diagnosis of UPF addiction. Research on treatment is nascent, but two weight loss approaches that directly target addiction, GLP-1 agonists and Bright Line Eating, both decrease hunger and cravings and result in significantly greater sustained weight loss than other methods. Addressing addiction is an avenue to weight loss that warrants further study.",

Creo que tampoco se tiene en cuenta los riesgos de desestructurar a sujetos haciendolos adelgazar, existiendo la posibilidad de que muchos de ellos esten anudados estructuralmente en su condicion de obesos y al conmover ese fantasma puede producirse un desgarramiento de la estructura. Lejos de aparecer la demanda de analisis, estos pacientes quedan sometidos al consumo de una prohibicion que debe estar renovandose semana a semana, desde la voz de una persona que desde la autoridad, desde el saber y desde el lugar de ideal (psicopegagoga o Ravena) renueve constantemente aquello que no se debe hacer, en tanto comer de mas.\r\nPalabras clave\r\nSingularidad Conducta Demanda Goce\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n...THE LAST TIME I´M LOST 100 KG, NOW I´M BACK FOR LERN TO SMILE I believe that the Ravena method, a method of the homogeneous, leaves aside the most essential of the subject: its uniqueness in suffering.

Ayurveda described the Trividha Upasthambha (sub-pillars), including Ayurveda Ahara (food) being one of the most important for a healthy lifestyle. Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of eating a well-balanced diet. Virudha Ahara (Incompatible Diet) is a diet that disrupts the body's elemental balance, digestion, metabolism (Agni), and homeostasis leading to the accumulation of Ama (toxins). Consuming two incompatible food items together or adhering to a specific type of diet can result in toxicity, this is referred to as Virudha Ahara (incompatible diet). Virudha Ahara can be caused by consuming food in the inappropriate dose, time of day or season. The article discusses the modern perspectives on Samskara Virudha, Veerya Virudha and so on. These perspectives contain incompatible dietary items that can be harmful to a person's health. Ayurvedic literature describes food incompatibility as Gara Visha.

Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass gegenuber Essens-Cues generell, verglichen mit neutralen Objekten, eine Annaherungstendenz vorliegt. Die wiederholte Vorstellung von Konsum hatte jedoch keinen Effekt auf die Annaherungstendenz diesem Nahrungsmittel gegenuber. Mogliche Ursachen und alternative Methoden werden diskutiert.",

      "abstract": "Smak og lukt er sanser som reagerer på oppløste kjemiske stoffer fra mat og luft via hjernenervene. Fysiologiske aldringsprosesser innebærer cellulære og intercellulære endringer i de nevroner i sentralnervesystemet som mottar smak- og luktsignalene. Aldring medfører også en viss reduksjon i antall smaksløker i munnhulen og antall luktreseptorer i nesehulen. Kliniske undersøkelser viser at svikt i smak og lukt forekommer i økende grad med stigende alder, særlig hyppig etter 80-årsalderen, og lukt hyppigere enn smak. Aldringsavhengig tap av smak og lukt er vanskelig å skille fra effekter av sykdommer og medikamentbruk, noe som er særlig karakteristisk for eldre på institusjon. Den tydeligste effekten på smakssansen rammer surt, salt og umami. Eldre er ofte ikke selv oppmerksom på dette og risikerer derfor tap av appetitt og feilernæring, særlig i retning av øket bruk av salt. Svikt i luktesansen bidrar til smakstap og kan også medføre personlige og sosiale implikasjoner i form av substandard hygiene og dårlig inneluft. I tillegg er de nevrodegenerative prosessene som fører til svekket luktesans, en av del patologien ved utvikling av demens. Svikt i luktesansen kan derfor være et forvarsel om kognitiv svikt.",

      "abstract": "Our physical and mental well-being are directly linked to what we eat and drink. The nutritional content of what we eat determines the composition of our cell membranes, bone marrow, blood, hormones, tissues, organs, skin, and hair. Lifestyle and nutrition of the humankind has undergone substantial changes during the last century. Additives and processed food have become the basis of our nutrition. Ingredients such as salt, sugar and fat are sometimes added to processed foods to make their flavour more appealing and to extend their shelf life. When the processed food industry discovered that these ingredients could be formulated to produce a state of satiety, pleasure, and sensory hedonia in those who consumed them, it extended their use to the “bliss point”, the point where the levels of saltiness, sweetness, and richness were perceived by the consumer as just right. Such modified foods can dysregulate the brain’s food reward system by increasing dopamine production, thus making the foods addictive. It is not easy to avoid these foods: the only way is to eat mainly fresh or only lightly processed foods (such as canned tomatoes and frozen vegetables). It is helpful to know which foods are healthy and what you can do to ensure you eat the healthiest diet you can. Combining a variety of foods, eating regular meals, including wholegrains, fibres, fruit, vegetables and “healthy fats”, and limiting the amount of sugar, salt and fat you eat are all recommended for good nutrition.

Die meisten späteren Konsumenten illegaler Drogen (84 Prozent) machen erste einschlägige Erfahrungen im Alter von 14 bis 19 Jahren. Das Abhängigkeitspotenzial psychotroper Substanzen ist sehr unterschiedlich. Nicht jede Substanz, die eine psychische Abhängigkeit hervorruft, bewirkt automatisch auch eine physische Abhängigkeit. Umgekehrt allerdings besteht bei physischer Abhängigkeit meistens eine psychische Abhängigkeit. Eine physische Abhängigkeit ist im Wesentlichen durch ein körperliches Entzugssyndrom gekennzeichnet, welches dazu führt, dass ein großes Verlangen besteht, diese Substanz erneut zu konsumieren. Bei einer psychischen Abhängigkeit empfindet die Person die Notwendigkeit, in bestimmten Abständen eine entsprechende Substanz zu konsumieren, um bestimmte angenehme Wirkungen zu erzielen oder unangenehme Empfindungen zu vermeiden, die beim Nachlassen der Substanzwirkung auftreten würden.",

      "abstract": "O jejum é a abstenção de consumir alimentos e bebidas por um determinado tempo. Tanto os sistemas de saúde tradicionais quanto os modernos usam jejuns como forma de ajudar a gerenciar doenças crônicas não infecciosas. Durante o jejum, a atividade aumenta a lipólise do tecido adiposo (queima de gordura na gordura adiposa) enquanto aumenta a oxidação de ácidos graxos nos órgãos periféricos, o que aumenta a queima de gordura e a perda de peso. A principal coisa que esta análise estava investigando é se o treinamento de resistência realizado em jejum induz adaptações específicas no treinamento, em que o aumento da oxidação de gordura melhora os níveis de treinamento de resistência a longo prazo. Alguns dados mostram que o jejum tem uma influência mais ampla no metabolismo corporal tanto em indivíduos não treinados quanto treinados, afetando o metabolismo de proteínas e glicose. Há informações conflitantes sobre como o jejum afeta o metabolismo da glicose em atletas altamente treinados, e o impacto no desempenho também não é claro (alguns dizem que tem um impacto negativo, outros dizem que não há efeito significativo). O jejum diminui o peso corporal de indivíduos treinados e não treinados, juntamente com o teor de gordura. Há pouca evidência de que o treinamento de resistência e o jejum juntos aumentam a oxidação da gordura, pois muitos estudos têm resultados conflitantes. Embora existam diferenças nos detalhes dos experimentos, como a gravidade da restrição calórica, quanto tempo durou o experimento e quem eram os participantes. Em nossa revisão da literatura, sugerimos que os atletas não devem fazer treinamento de alta intensidade em jejum.",

      "abstract": "It must be readily understood that the only possibility of fighting obesity is by bringing about a reversal in the energy balance so that inputs are smaller than outputs. At least theoretically, then, obesity's special quality is that it does not present any therapeutic problem. Restriction in food intake is currently the treatment of choice; to be effective, food intake must be cut so that the energy provided is below the obese person's daily consumption, on average below 1200 calories per day, while at the same time holding a comparatively high intake of indispensable elements (proteins, vitamins, certain minerals and oligo-elements). The physician has a choice of various possibilities represented by fasting, a variety of free or controlled diets, protein diets or diets with low carbohydrate content and with a variable fat content; dissociated, zig-zag, one food diets etc. Substantially all these tend to limit the total quantity of glycides and boost the feeling of satiety by increasing the total volume of good while keeping total calories unvaried. It is clear that each of them has specific indications and clear-cut contraindications. The aim is to produce a calory shortfall, not cause denutrition. The diet must therefore be suited to the individual directed during subsequent stages of weight loss in relation to the patient's specific requirements (number of meals, etc.).",

Las recomendaciones y prohibiciones alimenticias se han asociado no solo con la medicina, la higiene y la salud sino ademas con las nociones opuestas de saciedad, placer y extravagancia. En la Europa medieval, las tres grandes religiones imponian considerables restricciones en el consumo y produccion de alimentos. En este articulo, la autora se enfoca en Cataluna, especificamente en algunos de los textos catalanes que describen y discuten aspectos diversos sobre la comida (incluyendo recetas), comportamiento y modales en la mesa, y los peligros de la indulgencia y el consumo excesivo: Lo Crestia y el Llibre de les dones de Francesc Eiximenis, y la obra anonima Llibre de Sent Sovi . EnglishThe consumption of food and drink in our past and in our present is often bound up with notions of need and desire, obsession and control, subsistence and decadent indulgence. Prescriptions and proscriptions about food have long been associated with medicine, hygiene and health, as well as with opposing notions of satiety, pleasure and extravagance. In medieval Europe, the three great religions each imposed constraints on the consumption —and sometimes production— of certain foodstuffs. In this article, the author focus on Catalonia, more precisely on several of the (few) medieval Catalan texts that describe and discuss food (including recipes), customs and practices at table, and the dangers of overindulgence: Francesc Eiximenis' Lo Crestia and Llibre de les dones, and the anonymous Llibre de Sent Sovi",

      "title": "Calorie Restriction off the Menu for the Time Being?…",
      "abstract": "If you're interested in living a healthy, long life, mere calorie restriction probably won't do much for you. But wait! Before you impulsively dash to the fridge to gobble up a whole pot of artificially sweetened yoghurt − with a freshly cleared conscience, and resolved simply to enjoy your remaining mortal days − it's more complicated than that. Sorry, but this is, after all, biology that we're talking about. Increasing, epidemiological and sociological evidence, and critical examination of calorie restriction experiments, are combining to give a more scientifically-founded explanation for the “obesity epidemic” afflicting wealthy nations. Here's the bottom line: It's likely to be eating habits and the type of diet associated with them, not the calories per se, that threaten to curtail many people's lives short of their potential span. It's the way we eat and what we eat. First to the way: humans face a serious risk to health in having food constantly available, increasingly advertised, and ever less associated with regular eating times. Basically this is a type of industrially encouraged ad libitum feeding regime.1 What's the connexion with calorie-restriction studies? Having covered the risks of simplistically translating results from calorie restriction in animal models into personal eating habits in our previous issue,2 Le Bourg is back with a “Think again” article3 in this issue that basically forces us to examine the negative effects of ad libitum feeding. Herein is the reasoned claim that the seeming life extension effect of calorie restriction in laboratory animal studies is more likely to be due a lowered life expectancy in the ad libitum-fed control groups. Animals in this setting escape the predation, natural accidents, and most of the disease burden that wild animals suffer; however, if Le Bourg is right, the control group can't profit as much from these advantages as the calorie-restricted one, because ad libitum feeding is not healthy for them. These ad libitum fed diets at least contain foodstuffs that are species-appropriate. In the human population, by contrast, that is highly questionable. And so to the what. Industrialized wealthy nations are increasingly eating foodstuffs laced with refined carbohydrates and carbohydrates with high glycemic indexes (put crudely, that rapidly enter into the blood as monosaccharides, and hence have high insulin-releasing potential). George Monbiot's analysis,1 drawing on published peer reviewed literature, claims that today's obesity-prone populations are not eating more calories on average than their counterparts even in the 1970s; rather they are eating them in different forms, predominantly in more carbohydrate-rich foods − a trend that is promoted by the food industry's strategic development and advertising of attractive foods. Put dysregulated eating habits together with unbalanced nutrition, and one has a metabolic energy economy that is forced to run out of synchrony with physiological circadian rhythms, and on a fuel that exhausts the insulin machinery. And mere exercise won't help you much in that situation either.4 It seems, therefore, that putting calorie restriction into practice in human populations has never been further from the realms of realism − and at least as much for practical, as scientific, reasons. If there are any potential benefits in humans, these might only be realized if we manage to get our diet and eating habits back into order. Performing calorie restriction on such a poor, carbohydrate-rich, diet is a bit like saying to an obese person “If you cut down your consumption of fizzy orangeade, you'll live longer”, knowing that the fizzy drink is likely the major source of certain important vitamins in that person's diet… Andrew Moore Editor-in-Chief",

The hot drinks and foods as other examples can help to mitigate the abdominal pains. Indeed, warm drinks boost memory through lowering the pressures in different brain ‘sections (or lobs) in fatigue time. Some plant - based diets assist to the better digestion through faster and more smooth facilitation of food transformation in stomach areas. The plant – based dietary also can decline the heart muscle shocking impulse. However, some people for different reasons (i.e. cultural) do not consume some specific foods and drinks that can be kind of disadvantages for musculature system.

The dietary issue is one of the most serious health issues confronting millions of children of all ages. There are lots of effects of fast food on the health of adolescents. Because of peer pressure, shortage of time, attractive packages and tastes they become closer to take fast food. Fast foods are at large quantity obtain in educational institutions through various stores. Canteens are available in educational institutions to offer soda water, soft drink, cracks and lots of other foods of less nutritious rate(value). There are many ill impacts and effects of fast food and persons are not aware of its dangerous effects. It can cause many harmful disorders. Prolonged use of fast food is the reason for medical issues, chubbiness means obesity, GI Tract problem and increased fat. Excessive intake of fast foods may reduce appetite and eliminate the chance for nutrients in foods. These quick meals are rich in fat, salt, and sugar, and they are the root cause of chronic illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer in later years of life. This review focuses on what is fast food and its effect on adolescents and the evidence of its effects on mortality, morbidity and quality of life.",

Further, such weight changes had a much larger influence on their affect. It was concluded that chronic dieting is likely to produce temporary swings in both weight and mood but no permanent change.

      "abstract": "As the widespread availability of highly calorific food has resulted in a high incidence of obesity, attempts to decrease body weight have concentrated on trying to reduce energy intake. It is suggested that this is not the best approach. Although consuming more calories than expended is part of the initial problem, it does not follow that reducing intake, unless consciously counting calories, is the best solution. Mechanisms smooth out the large day-to-day differences in energy consumption, decreasing the importance of the size of a meal. In the short term a reduction in energy intake is counteracted by mechanisms that reduce metabolic rate and increase calorie intake, ensuring the regaining of lost weight. For example, even a year after dieting, hormonal mechanisms that stimulate appetite are raised. Over a million calories are consumed a year yet weight changes to only a small extent; there must be mechanisms that balance energy intake and expenditure. As obesity reflects only a small malfunctioning of these mechanisms, there is a need to understand the control of energy balance and how to prevent the regaining of weight after it has been lost. By itself, decreasing calorie intake will have a limited short-term influence.",

An extreme version of this hypothesis is advanced in \"pro-anorexia\" communities: identifying with anorexia, in conjunction with disordered eating, can lead to higher self-esteem. The current study empirically tested this hypothesis. Results challenge the pro-anorexia hypothesis. Although those with higher levels of pro-anorexia identification trended towards higher self-esteem with increased disordered eating, this did not overcome the strong negative main effect of pro-anorexia identification. These data suggest a more effective strategy for promoting self-esteem is to encourage rejection of disordered eating and an anorexic identity.",

If, as is frequently practiced by many people, the water is gulped down ice-cold, a glassful or so at a time, then instead of being useful, it may become very injurious indeed. We are often called to treat people with severe cramps suddenly developed during or right after a meal. In many of these cases we often find that the sufferer drank large quantities of too cold water. So though the dilution of an enzyme does not interfere with its activity, cold, as is well known, retards its action.

Yet the body does not necessarily need close supervision, for the mechanisms controlling food intake are incredibly sensitive and precise, as a little calculation shows. Thus, an average woman gains about 11 kg between the ages of 25 and 65. During this period she eats roughly 20 tons of food, and yet her weight increase corresponds to an average daily error of only 350 mg (about 1/100 oz) over the amount needed for energy balance (Hervey, 1969). That represents a very high order of accuracy, particularly when the variables introduced by meal size, meal length, inter-meal interval, the selection of a balanced diet from the nutrients available, the influence of food palatability, dietary preferences and religious taboos are taken into account.",

This review suggests that blood glucose is one important part of the energy source of self-control. Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. Self-control benefits numerous social and interpersonal processes. Glucose might therefore be related to a broad range of social behavior.",

The insulin pump has several advantages over other forms of insulin delivery: it gives precise units of more predictable rapid insulin as little as one tenth of a unit, and can be closely matched to the patient`s needs. The most common response to insulin pump was improved flexibility. Other reported advantages included ease of scheduling and timing of meals, greater freedom, decreased sense of physical restrictions, decreased physical restrictions. although metabolic control matters are important. Today, insulin pumps are technically more advanced, smaller, and more versatile, to closed-loop insulin delivery with development of better performing continuous glucose sensors. The basal rate may be programmed to vary at times of diurnal variation in insulin sensitivity, and adjusted during the day only when meals are delayed or skipped and blood glucose levels rise or fall>30mg/dL (> 1.7 mmol/L) during that time. The pump may be activated before meals to provide increments of insulin as meal boluses whenever that meal or snack is consumed. Prandial insulin usually comprises 50~70% of the total daily dose, and basal insulin does 30-50%. Compared to western research results, the basal insulin requirement was lower, while the amount of insulin needed for meals was higher because Korean consumed relatively more carbohydrate. To choose candidates for successful insulin pump therapy, medical, physical, intellectual and motivational ability will be considered. (Korean Clinical Diabetes J 11:40-45, 2010)",

Fibre, particularly from wheat, has been shown to shorten transit time in many studies. Different types of fibre affect transit in different ways; but, in general, transit varies in relation to changes in faecal weight. The importance of transit has yet to be clarified, but certain metabolic events in the large bowel can be related to it.",

After watching a female confederate eater in an inflatable fat suit serve herself very large amounts of either a healthy (salad) or less healthy (pasta) food, 83 college undergraduates were given the opportunity to serve and eat lunch from the same buffet. When the confederate was wearing the fat suit (versus when she was not), participants ate less healthy food regardless of what and how much the woman served (F (1, 72) = 13.47, p &lt; .001). When she was thin (not wearing the fat suit), participants were more likely to eat healthier food when she did so than when she did not (F (1, 72) = 3.92, p = .05).",

The deficit of energy (or calories) in the diet is made up by drawing on the body's energy reserves: first fat, later muscle. Undernutrition can be mild or severe, beneficial (in someone who was obese) or dangerous. The loss of weight is a manifestation of energy depletion. Essential nutrients, protein, and micronutrients are likely to be depleted at the same time, but some micronutrients have large stores in the body, and requirements of some others are lower when energy intake is reduced. In children, who have higher protein requirements than adults, important depletion of protein is likely to accompany serious undernutrition. The chapter then looks at protein-energy malnutrition and famine.",

Gordon et al<sup>1</sup>have pointed out that obesity of such widespread proportions is a problem of affluent societies, occurring when an abundance of food is available to great masses of people. Presumably, many in this overweight population are what they are because of the mere availability of food. For some, however, the reasons for excessive food intake are less obvious; the severely obese person so exceeds his caloric needs that his fatness threatens his own physical and social wellbeing. Although emotional factors are apparently of importance in such obesity, Stunkard<sup>2</sup>points out that this assumption is based on two very general findings: first, that obese persons admit they eat when they are upset and, secondly, that such persons manifest more neurotic traits than their nonobese counterparts.",

Postpubertal girls and women are chiefly affected. Perhaps it is less common in men because a degree of corpulence is more acceptable for them. There is no doubt that innumerable women control their weight at their desired level through fasting, vomiting, or purging—by means of laxatives, enemas, and diuretics—to compensate for overeating. The overeating may range from true bulimia and serious binge eating to moderate excesses incompatible with the maintenance of the desired trim figure. In Western society, a premium is currently placed on extreme thinness, particularly among women of upper socioeconomic groups. Stylish dresses and the popularity of pants for women emphasize the trend. It is possible that a similar expectation of thinness may eventually affect men, as suggested by",

Nutrition is an emotional as well as a physical need and this has led to the creation of the concept of emotional eating. This form of eating, which emerged out of physical need, gave birth to eating disorders and the related concept of addiction. Eating disorders were not a topic that was emphasized much until the 20th century and were categorized and collected in the publication of DSM-5. Although eating addiction is not included in the DSM as a diagnostic criterion, it is widely used as a concept. Current research supports the concept of eating addiction and research is still ongoing.",

      "title": "Was it something you ate?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Very few people are allergic to food, but most of us suffer adverse effects when we eat certain things. The reason is that our body is intolerant of particular chemicals, and it reacts to them as if we were being poisoned. We then experience a variety of symptoms such a stomach ache, headache, sweating, skin rashes, diarrhoea, palpitations, and vomiting. When several of these affect us at one time they are likely to indicate that we are suffering from food intolerance and this is what the book is all about. If we can identify which components of our diet are likely to cause intolerance, then we can make sure we don’t take in too much at one meal and so provoke the body to react. Human metabolism has developed to cope with small amounts of all kinds of non-nutrients in our food, even some that are highly toxic. What it cannot cope with are large amounts, and for sensitive people even relatively small amounts can trigger the body to over-react. This is why the same meal can affect people in very different ways. There are only a few common chemicals that can provoke an intolerance reaction: alcohol, benzoates, caffeine, dopamine, histamine, monosodium glutamate, nitrate/nitrite, phenylethylamine, salicylates, serotonin, solanine, sorbates, tryptamine/octopamine, and tyramine. The book examines the principal causes of food intolerance, explaining how this differs from food allergy, which few suffer from, and identifies the chemicals that cause it - many of which are natural - and the foods that contain them. It also reveals why food intolerance occurs, what its symptoms are, and why some people are so badly affected by a particular non- nutrient, while others suffer no upset at all. The book also contains chapters on natural toxins, and unnatural food additives and food contaminants. It explains the key nutrients in our diet and highlights the foods richest in the essential ones that we may be lacking. Most of the chapters are devoted to a few key non-nutrients that account for the majority of cases of intolerance. Each section is illustrated with actual case notes from people who have been badly affected by their diet. The book ends on an upbeat note with a final chapter giving dietary advice for maintaining a healthy heart. If you’ve ever wondered why something you eat does not agree with you, then this is the book that will help you discover what this is likely to be, and why your system reacts so badly to it. Written in an easy-to-understand style, Food Intolerance will take you through all aspects of food, especially identifying those non-nutrients that provoke a toxic response and make us ill.",

One condition for which nutritional feeding products are commonly prescribed is disease-related malnutrition. Nutritional support for poorly nourished clients consists of more than simply prescribing a specialized product. Key nutrition messages need to be applied to individual situations to promote optimal nutritional intake. However, in many situations clients are unable to meet their nutritional requirements by food alone and nutritional supplement products are then extremely useful. The nutritional status of all those receiving nutritional support should be monitored regularly; as the client’s nutritional status improves, his/her intake of these products may need to be reduced or stopped. If clients are unable to maintain or improve their nutritional status despite the use of nutritional supplements, additional help from an alternative feeding product may be required.",

      "abstract": "In general, exercise and/or sports are effective for bone health. Bone metabolism is influenced by several environmental factors, especially mechanical loading and nutrition. It is well known that the bone mass in athletes is higher than that of people having a sedentary lifestyle. Mechanical loading leads to an increase in bone mass, whereby it helps in strengthening. However, in some cases athletes might have lower bone mass. Insufficient dietary intake and an imbalanced nutritional status cause an inhibition of bone formation and activation of bone resorption. A higher than necessary Ca intake is important for improving bone metabolism. An adequate protein intake level, not too high or low, might be effective for bone maintenance. In addition, low energy availability could be leading to low bone mass. It might be possible to say that exercise is not effective for improving bone metabolism in an inadequate and/or imbalanced nutritional condition. A moderate level of physical activity, not an excess level, and appropriate nutrient intake are both necessary for bone health.",

      "abstract": "The allergy management of bronchial asthma consists of avoidance of exposure to allergens either inhalant, or ingestant, hyposensitization in cases where complete avoidance is impossible and drug therapy is needed. The diet initiated in allergic children is principally a diagnostic tool. There are two important diet regimens. First, \"The Elimination Diet\", indicated in patients to exclude major allergenic foods such as fruit, milk, egg, fish, and peanut. Secondly, \"The Minimal Diet\" (Modified Rowe's Diet), consisting of several foods \"allowed\" such as water, rice, coconut, beef, soy-cake, soy sauce, spinach, carrot, garlic and onion, salt and sugar, while other foods are prohibited. To obtain clear improvement of symptoms, the diet must be continued for 3 weeks. If improvement occurs, a challenge can be performed. All previously excluded foods can be reinstituted one at a time in a sufficient amount, every day for one week. If no symptoms appear, the food can be considered as non allergenic to the patient. If symptoms reappear, the food should be suspected as causing the allergy. For diagnosis, three challenges are required. Pharmacologic therapy is initiated with ephedrine and chlortrimeton as needed. Aminophylline and beta 2 agonist may be given as a substitute if the former drugs fail to relieve the symptoms. Intravenous aminophylline and corticosteroid are used especially in \"status asthmaticus\".",

Remaja adalah peralihan seseorang dari masa kanak-kanak ke masa dewasa yang mengalami perubahan baik itu perubahan fisik, emosional, sosial, mental yang mengacu ke lebih matang. Peyalahgunaan narkoba saat ini semakin hari semakin meningkat terutama dalam kalangan remaja saat ini. Penyebab utama penyalahgunaan narkotika karena adanya rasa dan dorongan dari diri sendiri maupun dorongan dari luar. Ciri-ciri penyalahguna narkoba dalam perubahan perilaku seperti prestasi di sekolah/tempat kerja turun tiba-tiba secara signifikan, membolos, tidak menyelesaikan tugas, berubahnya pola tidur, sering begadang, sulit untuk bangun pagi hari dan berkurangnya selera makan. Menumbuhkan kesadaran remaja akan besarnya pengaruh negatif yang diberikan oleh narkoba ini dan sekaligus meciptakan kenyamanan dan mengingatkan bahwa ada keluarga yang sangat menyayangi serta selalu menciptakan komunikasi yang baik adalah satu peran keluarga dalam pencegahan penyalahgunaan narkoba ini.",

      "abstract": "Remaja merupakan salah satu kelompok sasaran yang berisiko mengalami gizi lebih. Gizi lebih pada remaja ditandai dengan berat badan yang relatif berlebihan bila dibandingkan dengan usia atau tinggi badan remaja sebaya, sebagai akibat terjadinya penimbunan lemak yang berlebihan dalam jaringan lemak tubuh. Tujuan dalam penelitian ini ialah mengeksplorasi faktor penyebab obesitas pada remaja. Dalam penelitian ini, peneliti menggunakan desain literature review. Metode yang di gunakan pada literature review melalui pendekatan sistematis untuk melakukan analisa data. Kata kunci dalam penelitian ini ialah obesitas remaja dan status nutrisi dan aktifitas fisik dan genetik dan sosial ekonomi. Asupan nutrisi yang baik dapat dilakukan dengan cara makan 3 kali sehari secara rutin dimana sarapan sebelum beraktifitas atau bersekolah, makan siang pada waktu siang hari dan makan malam sebelum pukul 19.00. Aktifitas fisik dapat menurunkan atau menjaga menyetabilkan lemak tak jenuh dalam tubuh untuk dibakar menjadi tenaga dan dikeluarkan melalui keringat. Akan tetapi banyak remaja jarang melakukan aktifitas fisik yang cukup sehingga lemak yang ada dalam tubuh menumpuk dan membuat massa tubuh menjadi lebih besar. Obesitas dapat terjadi karena banyaknya makanan yang di konsumsi tanpa membatasi porsinya sehingga sebagian besar remaja pada kondisi ekonomi sosial di atas kemiskinan lebih banyak mengalami obesitas jika di bandingkan dengan remaja yang memiliki kondisi ekonomi sosial pada garis kemiskinan. Terjadinya obesitas karena faktor genetik ini bisa terjadi karena anak mewarisi genetik dari orang tuanya. Sehingga memungkinkan ketika orang tua ada yang mengalami obesitas maka besar kemungkinan anak mudah mengalami obesitas juga. Terjadinya obesitas pada remaja pada dasarnya memiliki banyak pencetus akan tetapi faktor yang paling dominan ialah asupan nutrisi yang tidak terporsi dengan baik bahkan cenderung berlebihan, aktifitas fisik yang rendah, kondisi ekonomi yang tercukupi sampai tinggi sehingga remaja menjadi lebih mudah untuk makan di luar porsi normalnya dan juga faktor genetik turunan dari orang tua.Kata Kunci: Obesitas remaja, status nutrisi, aktifitas fisik, genetik, sosial ekonomi.",

      "abstract": "This paper uses an evolutionary perspective to explain features of food learning in human children. Data from Western parents indicate that (1) children are least picky about foods when they are between one and two years of age, (2) vegetables are frequently refused by children, and (3) children have a tendency to eat foods one at a time rather than mixed together. Adaptive explanations for these patterns are suggested, together with supporting evidence from studies of the ontogeny of human and non-human primate diet choice. The following arguments are made: (1) age difference in receptiveness to new foods is consistent with the existence of a sensitive period for learning about food; (2) since leaves and other non-fruit plant parts often contain toxic secondary compounds and young animals are less able to detoxify these chemicals than are adults, an initial dislike of vegetables may function to protect young children against the risk of poisoning; (3) a preference for easily identifiable foods eaten separately may be an evolved preference that aids in identification of the food and the consequences of eating it.",

      "abstract": "The modern way of living is characterized by high participation in sedentary activities such as computing, watching television and playing video games. The practice of sedentary activities has been shown to have a negative influence on various indicators of health. Furthermore, the increase in energy intake observed while practicing sedentary activities is not related to increases in appetite or hunger sensations. As opposed to other sedentary activities, sleep may help facilitate the control of appetite and promote the maintenance of a healthy body weight. A U-shaped relationship has been noted between sleep duration and adiposity indicators, suggesting that both short- and long-duration sleepers are more likely to gain weight over time. Recent evidence shows that short-duration sleepers having a high disinhibition eating behavior trait are more at risk of gaining weight over time compared to short-duration sleepers having a low disinhibition eating behavior trait. In summary, it is important to make the distinction between 'sleep' and 'sedentary activities' when assessing their effects on health-related indicators. While most sedentary activities promote a positive energy balance, which may ultimately lead to weight gain over time, adequate sleep is rather associated with body weight stability and overall health.",

      "title": "The Role of Self-Regulation in Childrens Eating Behavior",
      "abstract": "Considering food, many people are particularly interested. Food can satisfy hunger and make some foods highly creative. People have an appetite, and more advertisements about food are attractive. Some people want to eat something delicious to celebrate when they are happy, and some people eat to relieve when they feel sad or depressed. There are many delicious foods for people to choose from, however, these food might not be good for children. This paper presents the concept of self-regulation and how self-regulation plays a role in childrens dietary behaviors. The purpose is to find out what impacts childrens healthy eating habits from an early age. A healthy diet has different effects on children from childhood to later stages. If eating healthily is the basis, it can make child have a good and stable mood as well. In addition, childrens self-regulation in dietary behaviors can be influenced by factors of the environment, e.g., the impact of family or parental lifestyles. When a family is well-educated and parents create a harmonious atmosphere, the childs daily diet and behavior habits are positive, which also lays the foundation for the future. On the contrary, if children live under malnutrition, it will affect their living habits in youth and adulthood. Finally, there are the external factors that come into playing a role. Moreover, another restriction should also be considered. Children should have a balanced diet every day. Snacks can be added between meals, but they will not be used as the main meal. This review can provide some insights for healthy diet related programs at schools and communities.",

      "title": "Fast foods, energy density and obesity: a possible mechanistic link",
      "abstract": "Summary Fast foods are frequently linked to the epidemic of obesity, but there has been very little scientific appraisal of a possible causal role. Here we review a series of studies demonstrating that the energy density of foods is a key determinant of energy intake. These studies show that humans have a weak innate ability to recognise foods with a high energy density and to appropriately down‐regulate the bulk of food eaten in order to maintain energy balance. This induces so called ‘passive over‐consumption’. Composition data from leading fast food company websites are then used to illustrate that most fast foods have an extremely high energy density. At some typical outlets the average energy density of the entire menus is ∼1100 kJ 100 g –1 . This is 65% higher than the average British diet (∼670 kJ 100 g –1 ) and more than twice the energy density of recommended healthy diets (∼525 kJ 100 g –1 ). It is 145% higher than traditional African diets (∼450 kJ 100 g –1 ) that probably represent the levels against which human weight regulatory mechanisms have evolved. We conclude that the high energy densities of many fast foods challenge human appetite control systems with conditions for which they were never designed. Among regular consumers they are likely to result in the accidental consumption of excess energy and hence to promote weight gain and obesity.",

      "title": "Structure et environnement des repas en Languedoc-Roussillon",
      "abstract": "Au moment ou le maintien d'une alimentation reguliere et structuree est promu dans le cadre du Programme national nutrition sante (PNNS), il est utile de faire le point sur la persistance ou non des manieres de table qui caracterisent le Languedoc-Roussillon en comparaison de celles observees en France et comment elles ont evolue depuis 2002. Les habitants du Languedoc-Roussillon conservent en 2008, comme ceux du reste du pays, une journee alimentaire structuree autour des trois repas principaux que sont le petit-dejeuner, le dejeuner et le diner auxquels s'ajoute parfois un en-cas l'apres-midi. Parmi les plus jeunes, c'est cette structure a quatre repas qui est la plus souvent retrouvee. On observe cependant une legere augmentation de la proportion de personnes n'ayant pas pris de diner et une baisse de la pratique des en-cas le matin ou le soir. Le dejeuner et le diner sont majoritairement composes de deux ou trois plats, l'association les plus frequentes etant plat / dessert ou entree / plat / dessert . La pratique du plat unique le soir est retrouvee plus frequemment chez les plus jeunes et est le fait de pres d'un adolescent sur quatre. Le grignotage entre les repas reste faible et est en diminution par rapport a 2002, maintenant la region au meme niveau que le reste du pays. Le petit dejeuner est le repas qui est le plus souvent pris seul, par plus d'un adulte sur deux. Ceci est retrouve plus frequemment dans les foyers aux revenus modestes. Au petit-dejeuner (comme pour le reste des Francais), pres de huit habitants du Languedoc-Roussillon sur dix ont consomme a la fois une boisson et un aliment mais moins d'un sur dix a associe les trois groupes d'aliments recommandes (fruit ou jus de fruit, feculent et produit laitier). Pres des deux tiers des habitants de la region ont pris ce repas en moins d'un quart d'heure, proportion plus importante qu'au niveau national. En moyenne, les durees des principaux repas - 16 minutes pour le petit dejeuner, 41 minutes pour le dejeuner et 42 minutes pour le diner - restent acceptables et sont meme en legere progression par rapport a 2002. Cependant, on notera que 37,9 % des habitants du Languedoc-Roussillon ne consacrent pas plus de 10 minutes au petit dejeuner, 11,9 % pas plus d'un quart d'heure pour le dejeuner et 12,9 % pas plus d'un quart d'heure pour le diner. La duree des repas augmente quand ils sont partages ou bien le week-end. Regarder la television au cours des repas est un phenomene relativement frequent dans la population regionale puisque c'est le cas de pres de la moitie des personnes au diner (pres d'un tiers au dejeuner et un sur six au petit dejeuner). La presence de la television au petit-dejeuner a fortement baisse par rapport a 2002 alors que l'utilisation d'une console video ou d'un ordinateur au petit-dejeuner ou au diner sont en progression. Le domicile est le lieu favori de prise des repas, en Languedoc-Roussillon, comme pour le reste de la France, et ceci reste vrai pour le dejeuner chez les jeunes adultes qui est pris a domicile par plus de la moitie d'entre eux. Le dejeuner sur le lieu de travail ou de scolarisation concerne un habitant de la region sur dix. Le repas au restaurant d'une part, chez des familles ou des amis, d'autre part est plus souvent retrouve au dejeuner qu'au diner. Enfin, on releve qu'une convivialite du repas (c'est-a-dire un repas pris sans regarder la television ou lire) est retrouvee, pour les personnes qui ne mangent pas seules, dans les trois-quarts des cas au petit-dejeuner, dans sept cas sur dix au dejeuner et dans seulement un cas sur deux au diner. Cette convivialite est plus frequente chez les femmes et les personnes ayant des revenus eleves ou un niveau d'etudes eleve. (Resume d'auteur)",

      "abstract": "Today, people's food consumption is due to the pleasure they feel for that food rather than their physiological needs. This situation is explained by the view of hedonism. According to this view, the happiness of a person in life is hidden in the pleasure and pleasure he receives from that life. Hedonic hunger, on the other hand, is when a person does not need energy but wants to consume that food for the pleasure he gets from delicious foods. Hedonic hunger prevents the homeostatic pathway when the energy in the body is higher than normal and increases the desire of the person to eat delicious foods. Food enjoyment may induce 'non-homoeostatic' eating. This could potentially contribute to obesity. Obesity has genetic and environmental interactions. It is also a serious and chronic disease. Today, it has become a growing health problem. Since obesity has become a very important health problem that threatens human health, it is very important to understand hedonic hunger in order to establish a meaningful connection between an individual's unhealthy lifestyle and food consumption.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Aging, a wearing‐out process which affects everything inanimate and animate, is accelerated by abuse or decelerated by care. The psychologic reactions of aging persons vary considerably. The concept of growing older is much more satisfactory and pleasant than the concept of being old, since the former is applicable to everyone regardless of age whereas the latter carries a finite significance as deterioration progresses. Chronologic age is much less important than biologic age. The desideratum is not longevity but rather a long, useful and meaningful life. Although heredity is of importance in longevity, it is a factor over which at present we have no control. However, we can influence the aging process according to whether we care for or abuse the body. The principal factors in accelerated aging, in order of importance, are: 1) tobacco use (particularly cigarette smoking), 2) lack of exercise, and 3) obesity. Conversely, abstinence from tobacco, exercise within tolerance, and avoidance of obesity not only decelerate aging but result in a better quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Prevention of injury involves identifying risk factors that would predispose one to injury and developing strategies to attenuate or eliminate their presence. Because muscle glycogen depletion is associated with fatigue and injury, it should be treated as a possible risk factor. Muscle glycogen stores are derived almost entirely from carbohydrate intake. Because there is a limited capacity to store muscle glycogen, and because muscle glycogen is the predominant fuel in exercise of moderate to severe intensity, the nutritional focus should be on carbohydrate consumption. Easy-to-follow nutritional strategies should be employed that will maximize muscle glycogen stores and delay the onset of fatigue. Individuals involved in activities lasting less than 60 minutes need to consume an adequate amount of carbohydrate daily and a pre-event meal before the start of the activity. However, individuals participating in activities longer than 60 minutes or participating in activities requiring repeated bouts of high intensity exercise need to: 1) consume an adequate amount of carbohydrate daily, 2) practice carbohydrate loading, 3) consume the pre-event meal, and 4) ingest carbohydrates immediately before, during, and after the activity.",

      "title": "Body Weight, Sleep, and Food Choices",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONIt seems that we all are getting busier, with less time to reflect and rest. It almost is thought of as being lazy if someone says that he/she is going to get a little “rest and relaxation” while on vacation, which is why we take vacations in the first place! Yet, the brain is another muscle that also needs rest, just like our skeletal muscles need a rest day from working out. I recently read in The Atlantic magazine that social scientists have stated that we would be most productive if we worked for 52 minutes and took a 17-minute break, walking away from our work to give our brains a rest and get our blood flowing (5). In this Nutritionist’s View column, I am going to write about rest but in the form of getting enough sleep with respect to weight gain. I also include studies on food choices and health because sleep and energy balance are both important for a healthy body weight. Furthermore, with less sleep, we tend to make poorer food choices. SLEEP AND WEIGHT GAIN Sleep and health have been studied for some time. It has been reported that lack of sleep can lead to unfavorable health outcomes, like high blood glucose concentrations and obesity. Japas et al. (1) examined men, ages 40 to 60 years, after they retrospectively reported their body weight when they were ages 20 to 40 years. They then analyzed these participants’ present lifestyle patterns, including their dietary intake, television watching, physical activity, and sleep practices. These researchers found that, of the more than 9,000 men studied, those who reported a higher body mass index (BMI) when they were between ages 20 and 40 years typically consumed a nonvegetarian diet, watched television for long durations at a time, had little physical activity, and shorter sleep durations compared with the men who had a lower BMI. Although a good study, these data are not perfect in several ways. The researchers asked the men to report their body weight when they were between ages 20 and 40 years, which some men may have misreported. In addition, these data show associations and not cause and effect. Finally, Japas et al. (1) did not just assess sleep, but many lifestyle factors, with sleep duration being one of them (a positive aspect of the study). Nonetheless, sleep was identified as a factor possibly contributing to the higher BMI in this very large sample size of men. In a prospective study involving children, Martinez et al. (3) evaluated the effect of sleep on obesity risk in 229 Mexican-American children, aged 8 to 10 years. This was a 2-year study, where the children and their mothers were evaluated for sleep duration at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. They used accelerometry to assess sleep duration. They also classified the children as “long sleepers” or “short sleepers” using the National Sleep Foundation’s definition that the adequate amount of sleep for children, aged 5 to 12 years, is 10 to 11 hours. Martinez et al. (3) reported that 82% of the children were classified as “short sleepers” (less than 10 hours of sleep). The children who had less sleep were more likely to have a higher BMI and waist-to-height ratio as well as more weight gain at 24 months compared with children who had the proper amount of sleep. These findings controlled for weight status, sex, maternal BMI, and maternal occupation. Thus, in this 2-year prospective study in children, less sleep resulted in weight gain when other factors were accounted for statistically. Although these are only two studies on sleep and weight gain, there is a plethora of research showing that the less sleep a person gets, the more likely he/she will gain weight. Furthermore, we certainly will be more productive and better able to concentrate when we get more sleep. FOOD CHOICES Lack of sleep can affect food choices. Kruger et al. (2) studied the effect of sleep duration and food choices in more than 13,000 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. This was a cross-sectional examination of these data, where the researchers used regression models for two main outcome variables: daily fruit and vegetable intake and the previous week’s fast food intake. They used demographic, as well as social and behavioral, variables within their regression models. The authors reported that habitual short sleep duration of less than 7 hours was associated with decreased fruit and vegetable consumption and increased fast food consumption, even after they adjusted for the demographic, social, and behavioral factors. They concluded, “Food choices are significantly associated with sleep duration and may play an important role in the mediation of the association between sleep and health among adolescents” (2).Pope et al. (4) examined food choices during the holiday season and compared them with food choices during other times of the year. Although these researchers did not measure sleep or food choices with little or no sleep, I thought this study was of interest because they compared food choices during the holiday season, which tends to be a hectic time of the year for many households. In this study, they had 207 households partake in a randomized controlled trial at two grocery food chain locations. They recorded item-level transactions during a 7-month time frame (July 2010 through March 2011). They particularly focused on purchases made between Thanksgiving and New Year’s and compared them with New Year’s through March, using the July through Thanksgiving period as the baseline measure. These researchers reported that, from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, food expenditures significantly increased by 15% compared with baseline. Of these increased expenditures, 75% of them were considered less healthy foods. Conversely, the week after the holiday season (e.g., the first week in January), there was a 28% increase in healthy food sales compared with baseline, with a 19% increase in healthy foods compared with the holiday period. Despite this move toward healthier foods, the number of calories purchased each week after the New Year were 9% higher when compared with the holiday period and 20% higher when compared with baseline, representing 450 and 890 more calories per serving per week, respectively. Thus, less sleep and the stress of the holidays may lead to poor food choices and eventually extra caloric intake for a period. SUMMARY Getting the proper amount of sleep is important for our health and, based on the research to date, it seems clear that the proper amount of sleep is associated with maintaining a healthy body weight. Furthermore, lack of sleep can lead to poor food choices and, thus, possibly to weight gain. When we think about health, we need to think about it holistically, with the proper amount of sleep, food, and activity. Hippocrates put it so well when he said, “If we could give every individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise, not too little and not too much, we would have found the safest way to health.”",

      "abstract": "There is no doubt that the type, amount, composition, and timing of food intake can Dramatically affect exercise performance, recovery from exercise, body weight and Composition and health. When exercise or physical work increase to more than 1 hour per day, the importance of adequate energy and nutrient intakes becomes more critical. As the American public becomes more concerned with health and health issues, the interest in nutrition and physical activity has increased. This interest in health has also heightened the sale of supplements, herbal preparations, and weight loss products, all aimed at improving health, preventing or curing disease, improving sport performance, and changing body composition and weight. Sports nutrition’s the practical science of hydrating and fuelling before, during and after exercise. Executed properly, sports nutrition can help promote optimal training and performance. Done incorrectly or ignored, it can derail training and hamper performance. Active individuals need more energy (calories) each day than their sedentary counterparts assuming individuals are the same age, body size and participate in similar non-physically active daily activities. Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance means that active individuals need to replace the water and electrolytes lost in sweat. Nearly 25% of Americans use dietary supplements daily and ~35-40% use themoccasionally. For individuals engaged in physical activity, the estimates are as high as 50-100% (Sobal & Marquart, 1994). We now know that what you eat and drink can significantly impact health andexercise performance. The active individual needs to make sure they consumeenough energy to maintain a healthy body weight for their activity level and sport, while reducing risks of chronic disease. Active individuals need more carbohydrate and protein than sedentary individuals, and should not restrict fat intake too severely. Keeping well-hydrated and replacing fluids lost during exercise is also a key part of feeling good and performing at one’s best. Active individuals dieting for weight loss may need to supplement, but in general supplements should be used with caution and after careful examination of the diet.",

Dieting has been more common in recent years as more people strive to adhere to strict food plans in an effort to achieve their desired body weight and form. Unfortunately, this strategy may have unforeseen repercussions that could have a negative impact on one’s health. Insufficient calorie intake, for instance, might deprive the body of vital nutrients, resulting in malnutrition and a weakened immune system. Similar to too-restricted diets, irregular periods and even infertility can result from a disruption in the hormonal balance. Furthermore, dieting can lead to psychological distress, which in turn promotes disordered eating behaviors such as binge eating, purging, and other eating disorders. These disorders have the potential to have a long-term negative impact on physical and mental health, and in some situations, they may even be fatal. It’s important to exercise caution and knowledge when it comes to various diet regimens that are advertised on social media and online.",

Satiation (the process that leads to the termination of eating, which may be accompanied by a feeling of satisfaction) and satiety (the feeling of fullness that persists after eating, potentially suppressing further energy intake until hunger returns) are important factors in the control of appetite and energy intake, and there is evidence that some aspects of satiation and satiety are altered in older adults. Factors affected include gastric emptying, which could affect satiation, and levels of gut hormones which could affect satiety. Sensory specific satiety also appears to be reduced in older subjects. This might be important in the anorexia of aging and dietary strategies could be used to reduce satiety and encourage an increased energy intake. However, many other factors may affect the anorexia of aging and it is important to understand these in order to help those at risk of malnutrition.",

Por otra parte, en un porcentaje importante de casos, el uso de la DC ha permitido la reduccion o la supresion de la medicacion anticonvulsivante. Conviene recordar que la buena adherencia a la dieta determina en gran parte su efectividad. La restriccion calorica y el control del consumo de liquidos no parecen aportar ventajas en la DC. Igualmente, la fase de ayuno inicial en la DC no es un determinante para la eficacia de la dieta y, en cambio, aumenta la frecuencia de efectos secundarios relacionados con la deshidratacion. Para las variantes de la dieta, aquellas que al inicio son mas restrictivas en el aporte de glucidos, parecen dar lugar a mejorias mas rapidas, sin encontrarse diferencias a largo plazo. El tipo de lipidos aportados en la dieta puede modificar sustancialmente los efectos sobre el perfil lipidico, aunque tambien puede afectar su palatabilidad y aceptacion. Durante la instauracion de la dieta es muy importante una estrecha vigilancia de la glucemia y del estado de hidratacion. Durante el seguimiento debe controlarse la evolucion pondoestatural y vigilar la aparicion de complicaciones. Es importante ademas la suplementacion con vitaminas y minerales para cubrir sus requerimientos. Aunque muy raramente se ha descrito miocardiopatia por deficit de selenio, esta puede ser una complicacion potencialmente fatal, por lo que debe extremarse la vigilancia de estos pacientes.",

      "abstract": "Past research indicates that self-control relies on some sort of limited energy source. This review suggests that blood glucose is one important part of the energy source of self-control. Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. Self-control benefits numerous social and interpersonal processes. Glucose might therefore be related to a broad range of social behavior.",

      "title": "10 Ways to Increase Your Energy Level",
      "abstract": "SHAKE A LEG. Get moving. Research indicates that being more physically active will boost an individual’s energy level, just as engaging in a sedentary lifestyle will often lead to fatigue in a person. In this regard, exercising on a regular basis can be particularly beneficial. Not only can a workout trigger the release of feel-good endorphins but also can lower an individual’s level of elevated stress hormones. IN THE MOOD FOR FOOD. Watch what you eat. Adhering to sound nutritional guidelines is integral to experiencing an enhanced level of get-up-and-go. In fact, poor eating habits can elicit feelings of fatigue. As such, the age-old caveats of “eat a healthy diet” (i.e., one that features an appropriate amount of vegetables, fruit, whole-grain foodstuff, and low-fat dairy products, as opposed to foodstuff with elevated levels of fat, sugar, or salt) and “don’t skip meals” (particularly breakfast) remain as relevant and applicable as ever. REST IN PEACE. Get enough sleep. As a rule, most adults function best on about 7 to 8 hours of sleep. In fact, not getting enough sleep or not experiencing quality sleep (i.e., relaxed restorative, undisturbed) is a common cause of fatigue during the day. It also is important to note that it can take up to 2 hours for an individual’s brain to become fully alert once a person wakes up. FIND INNER PEACE. Learn to relax. Individuals should identify and address issues/problems in their lives that may be causing them to experience prolonged bouts of anxiety. Studies show that constant anxiety can zap the body of energy. One viable strategy in this regard is to learn and practice specific relaxation techniques (e.g., yoga or meditation) to help minimize the release of adrenaline. Another possible step to counter any potential energy drain is to try to carve out some time each day to simply relax (i.e., do nothing). TOO MUCH STIMULATION. Don’t overdose on caffeine. Too much caffeine, particularly in the evening, can lead to insomnia, which in turn can result in fatigue during a person’s waking hours. As a general rule, caffeinated drinks should be limited to no more than five per day. In fact, as a pick-me-up, coffee tends to work in the short run. On the other hand, ingesting an excessive amount of caffeine (i.e., the exact amount is dependent on a number of factors and tends to vary from person to person) can cause a number of problematic side effects, including an upset stomach, irritability, accelerated heartbeat, and muscle tremors. ENOUGH ALREADY. Don’t overeat or undereat. Eating too much can drain an individual’s energy. On the other hand, not eating enough can lower a person’s metabolism level and cause them to feel lethargic. The key for individuals is to consume enough food to meet their daily caloric needs (note: crash dieting is highly discouraged for anyone who wants to fire on all cylinders energy-wise), but not too much. Furthermore, snacking also can be an effective tool in an effort to maintain and/or boost energy. Eating the right snacks at the right time over the course of the day can help prevent significant changes in a person’s energy level. IT’S JUST A JOB. Reduce stress in the workplace. More often than not, problems occur at work that lead to fatigue. The key for individuals is to manage these situations so that these matters don’t have a negative impact on their level of energy. The first step in that regard is to put any problems into perspective. In fact, no one’s life is problem-free. Every problem has a solution. Every situation can be dealt with rationally, even if it eventually means finding a new job. LIGHTEN UP ON LIGHTING UP. Don’t smoke. In addition to being bad for a person’s health, smoking also tends to be counterproductive to any attemptto have more energy. For example, the body makes energy by combining glucose with oxygen. On the other hand, cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide, a substance that reduces the amount of oxygen available in the blood. Not surprisingly, smokers typically have lower energy levels than nonsmokers. LAUGHTER AS MEDICINE. Incorporate fun in your life. Individuals should do whatever they can to make sure that they have enough time for fun. In fact, laughter has been found to be a very effective energy booster. Not only does it lift a person’s mood and immune system, it also can elicit the release of beneficial hormones in the body. A CAUTIONARY NOTE. See a physician if it appears that nothing can be done to boost your energy level. It is important to make sure that your persistent fatigue is not the result of an underlying medical problem.",

      "abstract": "espanolAlgunos lactantes precisan recibir una alimentacion con un mayor contenido energetico y/o proteico, con el fin de cubrir sus necesidades de energia y nutrientes. Clasicamente, este objetivo se conseguia aumentando la concentracion de la formula o mediante el uso de modulos nutricionales. A pesar de ser una practica habitual, existen pocos datos publicados en la bibliografia sobre su empleo. En los ultimos anos se han incorporado como opcion de tratamiento las formulas hipercaloricas para lactantes, que en su presentacion liquida, apta para su empleo, consiguen proporcionar una mayor cantidad de energia y de proteinas, sin desequilibrar el perfil nutricional del producto o con solo un leve aumento de su carga osmolar. En la actualidad, pues, estas formulas constituyen el primer paso para enriquecer la alimentacion del lactante, quedando los modulos nutricionales para las situaciones en las que estas no puedan utilizarse o en los errores innatos del metabolismo. Es dificil manejar las situaciones que requieren un enriquecimiento de la alimentacion de los recien nacidos que reciben lactancia materna. No estan disponibles modulos especificos para suplementar la leche materna y son varias las alternativas que se plantean en este escenario (modulos nutricionales, alternar tomas de leche materna con formulas hipercaloricas, etc.). Tanto las formulas hipercaloricas para lactantes como los modulos estan financiados por el Sistema Nacional de Salud y pueden emplearse fuera del ambito hospitalario. En conclusion, se dispone de un buen numero de productos que pueden emplearse para conseguir mejorar la calidad de la dieta del lactante con necesidades especiales, aunque cada situacion precisa un abordaje individualizado. EnglishSome infant needs to increase the caloric and/or protein content in her feedings, in order to sustain energy and nutrient requirements. Lastly, this goal was achieved by strengthening infant formula o by the use of nutrient modules. Despite of its current use there are scarce references. In the last few years, hypercaloric hyperproteic polymeric formulas for infants have been developed. Presented as ready to use they provide a higher amount of energy and protein without modifying the nutritional profile of infant formulas, and with a minimal increase is osmolality. Currently, they represent the first step to enrich infant feeding. Nutrient modules are therefore used in case of intolerance or in patients with inborn errors of metabolism. A difficult question is how to enrich feedings in a breast-fed infant. There are no available specific supplements for breast milk except those for preterms. In the paper we review several alternatives (use of modules, alternate breast milk and hypercaloric formulas, etc.). Both hypercaloric hyperproteic formulas and modules are reimbursed by the National Health System in Spain, and can be used as outpatients. In conclusion, there are available a good number of products to be used in order to enrich the quality of an infant diet with special needs. Each clinical scenario precise an individualized approach.",

      "title": "Is tryptophan a natural hypnotic",
      "abstract": "A 63-year-old woman was in good physical and mental health but was disturbed by the fact that she had difficulty falling asleep and woke several times each night. She did not want to take a drug because of her concern that she might become addicted. She had heard that tryptophan is a natural dietary hypnotic and wanted to try it.\r\n\r\nTryptophan, at a dose of 1 gram taken 45 minutes before bedtime, will decrease the time taken to fall asleep in those with mild insomnia and in those with a long sleep latency. At this dose, it has no effect on sleep architecture, and no effects on alertness the next day have been detected. In patients with moderate or severe insomnia, tryptophan is not as effective as standard hypnotics. Although the effect of tryptophan on sleep has been studied only over the short term, its effect is not likely to change over time, given that a 1-gram dose taken at bedtime will be completely metabolized before the end of the night.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected with a compound that is a component of the diet, side effects of tryptophan are few and mild, nausea being the most common. No withdrawal effects have been reported when tryptophan use is discontinued. In rare cases, tryptophan can interact with other drugs that potentiate serotonin function, and this can result in the serotonin syndrome. The normal daily dietary intake of tryptophan is about 1 gram, so taking it as a hypnotic will double the daily intake.\r\n\r\nThe use of tryptophan as a hypnotic is not a “natural” treatment, and taking tryptophan in tablet form is not a “dietary” treatment. Tryptophan is thought to act by increasing the synthesis of its metabolite serotonin. When tryptophan is ingested as part of the diet, it is accompanied by other large neutral amino acids that compete for the system that transports them all into the brain. As a result, dietary intake of tryptophan, unlike tryptophan in tablet form, does not raise brain tryptophan levels. Thus, the popular myth that a bedtime glass of milk has a hypnotic effect because of its tryptophan content is incorrect. \r\n\r\nIn Canada, tryptophan is regulated as a drug, although in the United States tryptophan, like many naturally occurring compounds, is regulated as a dietary supplement.\r\n\r\nThe interest of this patient in a natural treatment would be better served by ensuring that she adhered to good sleep hygiene, and only if this did not work, should tryptophan be considered.",

During training periods adequate supply of protein is a prerequisite. In competition periods of less than 20 minutes' duration, normal glycogen stores in muscle tissue seem to be adequate, but liver glycogen deficiency can limit the performance via a hypoglycemic effect on the central nervous system. Thus, a carbohydrate-rich diet should be given during the days before and between competition events. With heavy exercise of longer duration it can be of value to increase the glycogen store in muscle groups performing the heaviest work. This is achieved by first depleting muscles of glycogen through exercise and thereafter taking a diet rich in carbohydrate. This regimen also increases the liver glycogen store.",

      "title": "Thème 2. Les athlètes usent et abusent des compléments alimentaires",
      "abstract": "L'entraînement intensif régulier, ainsi que le stress physique et mental de la compétition, sont inhérents au sport de haut niveau et augmentent significativement les besoins nutritionnels en macro-et micronutriments. Ces besoins peuvent être généralement satisfaits grâce une alimentation contrôlée, sans apport de compléments alimentaires. Néanmoins, un petit nombre de compléments peuvent être utiles pour certains athlètes. Quand une carence en une vitamine ou un minéral spécifique est détectée, un complément peut constituer une solution bénéfique à court terme, associée à une solution diététique plus durable. Une complémentation alimentaire en créatine (3-5 g par jour pendant environ 30 jours, ou de plus fortes doses sur des périodes plus courtes) peut accroître la puissance musculaire, plus particulièrement au cours de sprints intermittents. Par ailleurs, la prise de créatine peut augmenter les adaptations du muscle lors d'entraînements en force. Les agents tampons, tels le bicarbonate et la β-alanine, peuvent être utilisés lors d'exercices de haute intensité pour lesquels l'acidose métabolique est un facteur limitant de la performance. L'action bénéfique de la caféine à faible dose (2-5 mg.kg-1 de masse corporelle) sur la performance est également bien établie. Selon des études récentes, les compléments alimentaires à base de nitrates permettraient aussi de réduire le coût énergétique lors de l'exercice ; ils amélioreraient ainsi la performance. La pratique du sport de haut niveau nécessite également la prévention des blessures et le maintien d'une bonne santé. Dans ce cadre, la glucosamine et le sulfate de chondroïtine peuvent être utiles pour le traitement des douleurs articulaires et contre l'ostéoarthrite chez certains athlètes ; cela étant, aucune étude n'a encore montré l'effet préventif de ces compléments. De façon unanime, l'ingestion excessive d'antioxydants ou de vitamine C au-delà des doses alimentaires recommandées est inefficace. Enfin, certains compléments alimentaires vendus dans le commerce peuvent malheureusement ne pas contenir d'éléments actifs. Pire, ils renferment parfois des substances interdites pouvant conduire à un contrôle antidopage positif. Il est recommandé d'ingérer des compléments alimentaires seulement sur l'avis d'un professionnel qualifié en nutrition sportive.",

      "abstract": "Due to an increasing incidence of stroke as well as a growing population of elderly individuals, the number of bedridden persons in Japan is increasing. Since their muscle and nervous system for oral functions may be lowered, many of them are suffered with difficulty in swallowing (dysphasia). In cases of severe swallowing disorders, patients may aspirate their food, in which bacteria carried with the food into the airway might cause a critical condition such as pneumonia. Tube feeding is one way to bypass the pharynx, and avoid the aspiration of food. However, tube feeding deprives patients of the pleasure associated with eating. Most patients want to take food through the mouth; thus methods need to be developed that address difficulties in swallowing. Mastication have been understood being a process to crash and mix with saliva for safe swallow; however, in addition to it humans sense the physical and chemical (i.e., taste) properties of food during mastication so that we secure security of the appetite. Swallowing is a reflex during which many muscles are activated in given timings to move food and/or liquid from the oral cavity to the stomach. Since affection system may strongly interpose in the swallowing process, a good appetite may be the most important factor for a smooth swallowing process. Properties required for the food include: clear taste, proper temperature, uniformity, agglutination, and moisture.",

Det fett vi far i oss med maten bryts ned till fettsyror och transporteras till de olika cellerna i kroppen. Inne i cellerna byggs sedan olika slags fetter upp pa nytt. Om vi far i oss klorerat fett kommer en del av fettsyrorna att vara klorerade. Nar nya fettmolekyler sedan byggs upp sa kommer ocksa de att vara klorerade. Sedan nagra ar tillbaks vet vi att just den sortens fetter som lagras som depafett innehaller klorerade fettsyror. Man vet inte varifran de klorerade fettsyrorna harstammar, men en teori som lagts fram pekar pa mojligheten att klorerade fettsyror kan bildas fran klorerade miljogifter eller fran avloppsvatten fran industri och hushall som kan innehaller hoga halter klor. Man har ocksa hittat klorerade fettsyror i avloppsvatten fran pappersmassa industrier som anvander klorblekning. Alla cellmembran i kroppen bestar till stor del av en viss sorts fetter som kallas fosfolipider som i sin tur till stor del bestar av fettsyror. Cellernas membran har manga viktiga uppgifter, bl a att avskilja cellens insida fran omgivningen, uppratthalla skillnader i koncentrationen av olika molekyler, och att transportera dessa molekyler genom membranen nar det behovs. I avhandlingen finns nagra artiklar som visar att bade fisk och tumlare har klorerade fettsyror i sina fosfolipider, till och med oftast i mycket hogre halter an i depafett. Konsekvenserna av detta vet vi bara lite om, hittills har vi sett att cellmembran med klorerade fettsyror i sig kan lacka viktiga cellkomponenter. Nagra av de andra artiklarna handlar om fragor kring klorerade fettsyrors egenskaper. Vi vet att klorerade fettsyror inte kanns igen av kroppen som kroppsframmande, och darfor gor kroppen heller inga forsok att gora sig av med dem. Daremot kan de inte brytas ned som vanliga fettsyror i maten bryts ned, utan verkar vara svarnedbrytbara pa ett satt som liknar andra miljogifter. Dessutom kan de transporteras i naringskedjan och darfor eventuellt ge hogre halter i rovdjur. Den kanske viktigaste fragan for framtiden ar hur klorerade fettsyror paverkar oss och andra djur. Eftersom oklorerade fettsyror ingar i manga funktioner och kontrollmekanismer i kroppen, bl a ar de viktiga i produktionen av vara konshormoner, sa kan man latt forestalla sig att klorerade fettsyror kan ge upphov till storningar, kanske i form av nedsatt formaga att fortplanta sig.

However, it is still debated whether their excessive intake can produce symptoms of dependence such as those seen in drug addiction. There is increasing evidence of neurobiological and clinical underpinnings of obesity and and drug addiction, and although there are still relevant differences between the two disorders, the food addiction phenothype seems to have an important role in obesity and Binge Eating Disorder (BED).

      "abstract": "Philosophers, moral psychologists and neuroscientists have written plenty about disgust as it concerns foul actions, revolting images and unsavory tastes. Far less has been written about stinky delicacies. Disgusting odours are typically treated as violations whose visceral reactions to danger prompt our protective recoil. I term this ‘basic disgust’. No matter how repulsive, meals rarely emit harmful aromas, even for people with particular food allergies. Allergic eaters must rely on labels. Moreover, neither taste nor smell is a reliable indicator of food safety, since most deadly toxins are flavorless. Food repulsions thus defy evolutionary explanations typical of basic disgust, so perhaps they are exemplary of ‘moderate disgust’, such that particular food smells disgust some people, somewhere, sometimes. Even if noxious dishes repel (basic disgust) or people find overcoming food aversions difficult (moderate disgust), neither approach accounts for the way innocuous stenches attract attention, frame perception, stage deceptions, signal values, enhance retention, boost concentration and accelerate task completion. Inspired by the Disgusting Food Museum’s scheme to prompt visitors to adopt new values, I develop value disgust, which considers disgust value-driven and subject to perceptual learning. In other words, negative reactions to stinky delicacies are dispositional. As identification improves, we feel less disgust. To develop value disgust, which teases out harmless stenches’ ‘superpowers’, I begin by describing how disgust compounds smell’s already complex properties. I next review philosophical accounts of disgusting smells, then survey the Disgusting Food Museum’s surfeit of value-driven results, articulate value disgust and summarise several experiments that offer corroborating evidence.",

Such advice must bear in mind the relative frequency and severity of allergies to certain foods. Some commonly allergenic foods (milk, egg, soya, wheat) are staple components of the diets of populations, used widely in prepared foods. The frequency of the allergies to these foods and their widespread uses means they and their derivatives must be declared on food labels. Less commonly used foods such as fish, shellfish, peanut, and tree nuts demand declaration due to the severity of reactions induced in the admittedly more rare, but increasingly common, sufferers of these allergies. Reactions to more unusual foods are increasingly being identified, and the \"minimum\" list is likely to be extended in the future.",

Jika efek ini terus terjadi, tubuh akan kejang-kejang, muncul halusinasi, perilaku lebih agresif, dan rasa sesak pada bagian dada. Jangka panjang dari dampak dehidrasi ini dapat menyebabkan kerusakan pada otak. Tidak hanya itu saja, dalam dosis berlebih juga bisa menyebabkan muntah, mual, rasa takut yang berlebih, serta gangguan kecemasan. Apabila pemakaian dalam jangka panjang, bisa mengakibatkan dampak yang lebih buruk seperti gangguan mental, depresi, serta kecemasan terus-menerus. Pemakai yang menggunakan obat-obatan tersebut dalam dosis yang berlebih, efeknya justru membuat tubuh terlalu rileks sehingga kesadaran berkurang drastis. Beberapa kasus si pemakai tidur secara terus-menerus dan tidak bangun-bangun. Hilangnya kesadaran tersebut membuat koordinasi tubuh terganggu, sering bingung, dan terjadi perubahan perilaku. Dampak narkoba yang cukup berisiko tinggi adalah hilangnya ingatan sehingga sulit mengenali lingkungan sekitar. Dampak narkoba yang paling buruk terjadi jika si pemakai menggunakan obat-obatan tersebut dalam dosis yang tinggi atau yang dikenal dengan overdosis. Pemakaian sabu-sabu, opium, dan kokain bisa menyebabkan tubuh kejang-kejang dan jika dibiarkan dapat menimbulkan kematian. Inilah akibat fatal yang harus dihadapi jika sampai kecanduan narkotika, nyawa menjadi taruhannya. Bahaya narkoba bukan hanya berdampak buruk bagi kondisi tubuh, penggunaan obat-obatan tersebut juga bisa mempengaruhi kualitas hidup misalnya susah berkonsentrasi saat bekerja, mengalami masalah keuangan, hingga harus berurusan dengan pihak kepolisian jika terbukti melanggar hukum. Pemakaian zat-zat narkotika hanya diperbolehkan untuk kepentingan medis sesuai dengan pengawasan dokter dan juga untuk keperluan penelitian. Selebihnya, obat-obatan tersebut tidak memberikan dampak positif bagi tubuh. Yang ada, kualitas hidup menjadi terganggu, relasi dengan keluarga kacau, kesehatan menurun, dan yang paling buruk adalah menyebabkan kematian. Karena itu, jangan coba-coba memakai barang berbahaya tersebut karena resikonya sangat tinggi bagi hidup dan kesehatan.",

      "title": "Behavioral Factors Affecting Obesity That Health/Fitness Professionals Need to Consider",
      "abstract": "PUZZLING PREDICAMENT. Weight is not a behavior. Rather, it almost always is a by-product of a series of behavioral choices. As such, when working with obese clients, the focus should be their behavior — not their weight. Change their behavior; change their weight. THE TRAPPINGS OF SUCCESS. One of the first tasks when dealing with obese people is to redefine success. Too many individuals (obese or not) view success, with regard to obesity, as a consequence of reaching an “external” goal, for example, losing a predetermined number of pounds or sculpting the body to attain a particular shape. In reality, being successful could be perceived more appropriately as achieving an enhanced level of health or sense of well-being. GOOD FOR THE GOOSE, GOOD FOR THE GANDER. Like everyone else in life, obese people tend to be motivated by different things. What may be an effective motivating strategy for one person may not work as well for another. Competition, for example, may cause one person to make positive lifestyle-related changes in their behavior and lead to a counterproductive level of pressure in another. THE RIGHT “F” WORD. Arguably, too many health/fitness professionals, when working with obese individuals, are often unduly concerned with the failure of their clients to attain one or more of the expectations that have been set for them. Such a focus is misplaced. For whatever reason, the approach that they are taking with their clients is virtually devoid of any emphasis on fun. The fact that the degree to which a person finds a particular undertaking to be enjoyable can impact that individual’s commitment to it should not be ignored. JOINING FORCES. Health/fitness professionals should view their role of working with obese people as one that is grounded in active collaboration. The center of attention should be on the client’s interests, needs, and goals. The focus on any exercise regimen should be on the client, not on complying with the numerical aspects of a workout. OUTSIDE THE BOX. The potential value of being creative with respect to increasing an obese client’s level of daily physical activity should not be underestimated. In reality, the underlying goal should be to ascertain how a client could feel and actually be successful and then be as resourceful as possible in making those opportunities become a reality. In that regard, the most effective tool is often an inventive open mind. CHANGING APPROACHES. Despite the fact that the obesity epidemic is a full-blown crisis that has been growing exponentially during the past three decades, the efforts to address it share at least one thing in common — they don’t work. In reality, any attempt to provide a viable solution to it will require a new approach, based on new insights. All factors considered, coming to grips with the behavioral basis of obesity offers a very promising way forward. FAD FASCINATION. If obese individuals are to make informed choices about their behavior, they need to receive advice and guidance that are based on science. Whatever assistance they are given should never be rooted in some “flavor-of-the-month” trend or craze. Not only will the empty promises attendant to such gimmicks waste their time and drain their wallets, it also can siphon off their resolve. ONE OF A KIND. Just as two obese individuals are never exactly the same, the most effective way to treat an obese person successfully also is not precisely the same from individual to individual. As such, each intervention should be tailored to meet the unique needs, interests, and goals of a particular person. As such, it is the responsibility of health/fitness professionals to ascertain what factors distinguish each of their obese clients as an individual and to respond accordingly. UNSPOKEN MESSAGES. Depending on the circumstances, bias, in any form, can have dire consequences. At a minimum, it can affect the prism through which a person sees the world. The sphere of obesity is no exception. Arguably, a number of health/fitness professionals convey a degree of obesity-related bias (e.g., thin is beautiful, fat is not; it is shameful that obese people don’t try harder to lose weight; etc.). Such narrow-mindedness can compromise their efforts to be part of the solution, rather than the problem, when working with obese clients.",

The basis of nutrient timing involves the consumption of combinations of nutrients--primarily protein and carbohydrate--in and around an exercise session.

Some have claimed that such timing strategies can produce dramatic improvements in body composition, particularly with respect to increases in fat-free mass [2]. It has even been postulated that the timing of nutritional consumption may be more important than the absolute daily intake of nutrients [3].",

      "abstract": "One of the mysteries of drug addiction is why people start to use drugs that are known to be addictive. Prior research has found that people generally under-predict the impact on their own future preferences of visceral states, such as hunger, thirst and fear that they are not currently experiencing. Based on this research, we hypothesized that people who are not currently craving a drug - even addicts who have experienced craving frequently in the past - will under-appreciate the impact of craving on their own future preferences. To test this prediction, we elicited the money value that addicts placed on an extra dose of the heroin substitute Buprenorphine, when they were either in a state of craving (right before receiving BUP) or in a drug-satiated state (right after receiving BUP). In the most important condition, the reward they ended up receiving - either money or BUP - would be delayed by 5 days. As would be predicted if addicts can't remember what craving is like when they aren't currently craving, addicts valued the extra dose of BUP to be received 5 days later more highly when they were craving than when they were satiated.",

Asi como hay personas que buscan bajar de peso, tenemos el lado contrario: aquellas que desean ganar peso. Con frecuencia no se conoce la razon exacta de la perdida del apetito, puede ser depresion, ansiedad o sintoma de alguna enfermedad; comunmente se presenta en adultos, y una vez que se haya descartado que la causa sea una patologia, se puede hacer uso de suplementos alimenticios. Hay que saber que la mayoria de los suplementos alimenticios estan basados en una accion llamada antiserotoninica, pues la serotonina es un mediador entre los centros cerebrales reguladores del apetito. Es importante decir que muchos suplementos tienen medicamentos, y otros, vitaminas y minerales. La mayoria de ellos requieren de recetas medicas, aunque otros, no.

      "title": "Resolutions, ambitions and action plans …",
      "abstract": "At the time of writing, it is January and the New Year is underway. It is a time that is typically rich in tradition across most cultures, where we reflect on what has past, and what is ahead. One tradition prevalent across Westernised cultures is that of the New Year's resolution: making a promise to address or change something in the coming year, to improve upon years gone past.1 In the UK, the most commonly made resolutions tend to centre on altering diets and lifestyle in order to improve health or lose weight.1, 2 Estimates suggest that the majority of people, however, break or give up on their New Year's resolution within 12 days.2 People who succeed in maintaining their resolutions beyond 12 days do so because of positive differences in: stimulus control (whether snacks are available to stare back at you when you open the cupboard); willpower (the effort available to expend on resisting an impulse); and reinforcement (positive reminders of the aims guiding the resolution).3 In health care, we often engage in strategies to promote behaviour change in our patients, colleagues and even ourselves. Change in health behaviour is notoriously challenging. It may be a source of stress and a drain on effort for both the person attempting to make the necessary change and those involved in supporting it. Behavioural psychologists suggest that there is a threshold point at which behaviours acquire an automaticity, and therefore cease to become effortful. It is at this point that the behaviour can be considered a habit, and research suggests that it can take anywhere up to 254 days to reach this tipping point.4 The beginning of 2019 has seen the publication of a set of resolutions for the health sphere too. In England, the long-term plan of the National Health Service (NHS England) lays out a set of ambitions for the next 10 years that propose to address divides, disparities and disruption in health for patients.5 Much of the rhetoric is welcome, and is considered common sense;6 however, there remain sceptics who point out that much of the 133-page document reflects non-specific high-level references that do little to outline what needs to be done in the ‘real world’ in order to achieve the laudable aims within the plan.7, 8 Will this too become another resolution that is abandoned in time? In one of last year's issues of The Clinical Teacher, Jo Hart and colleagues presented the findings of a project that looked at how medical students respond to feedback in communication skills teaching sessions.9 One key point is based on the principle that to optimally support the successful integration of feedback and promote positive behavioural change, learners need to develop action plans, and that these action plans need to be specific.10 In many resolutions, as some suggest with the NHS long-term plan, there is often a disconnect between higher-level abstract aims and specific action plans that translate into behavioural change; however, that is not to say we should eschew the ambitions that are outlined in such objectives. Indeed, these are often reflective of aims and values that are central to informing our subsequent actions and behaviours. So, in order to keep the guiding aims relatable to the proposed objectives, I recommend looking first to see how the two may complement each other, perhaps in an augmentation of the traditional ‘SMART’ framework. Originating in business management literature, the idea that conceptualising goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound has become a popular aid to developing objectives that are believed to be more likely to succeed.11 Ambition: keep, or return to, the original guiding aim and ambition (positive reinforcement) Learning: what key lessons or learning points can you take from prior attempts or experiences to help improve chances of success this time around? (willpower) Environment: what do you need in your environment to help you succeed? This may include timing and people, as well as other resources (stimulus control) Changes: what changes do you need to make to yourself (your approach to this kind of objective), and/or your environment – including the nature of your job and those around you (positive reinforcement and stimulus control) Aside from the common resolutions to improve health and fitness, medical educators may well strive to read more research, contribute more papers to the field, or institute changes to their teaching or environment with the aim of improving learners’ experiences. Keep in mind that our work is inherently complex and networked. Success is often dependent upon a number of factors outside of our control. I suggest having a guiding aim of making improvements to a particular educational activity or reading a paper or journal each month to keep up to date with developments in the field, as well as simultaneously being SMART about the factors that are within your direct influence, such as the time you set aside to dedicate to such activities. It is important to note that missing or slipping cues, such as missing a particular issue of The Clinical Teacher, does not have a detrimental impact on longer-term habit formation. It is a common myth from earlier psychological hypothesising that has led to a misbelief that missing single opportunities would cancel out all previous change efforts. Fortunately, this has been disproven. Therefore, small setbacks and slips should be interpreted as a cue to reinforce the aim, revisit the learning, review what environmental cues may or may not be helping and consider if any further changes may be necessary.

      "title": "Neurobiological implications of eating healthy.",
      "abstract": "Over the last decades, the importance of food in the development of chronic diseases has been examined, as well as the medical value of eating healthy. The contribution of the eating process itself to health and well-being, however, has not been questioned until most recently. Biology has linked eating to appetitive motivational processes with their underlying neurophysiology, including CNS reward circuitries: Eating uses the pleasure-reward physiology to motivate us to eat. Endogenous opiates, such as morphine, insure our survival by helping us to make eating motivational via pleasure induction. After taking in enough food, we become satisfied, i.e., tolerant to food. Our appetite, and so is our appetence, are then low and need a certain time span to reach their former levels for then inducing food-seeking behaviors, food intake, etc. again. When tolerance passes, we once more engage in this pleasurable process related to positive behavioral motivation. Opioid receptor agonists, however, may induce energy intake even beyond an actual need. This interesting potential of opioidergic signaling may have its roots in biological mechanisms that insured the intake and storage of high energy foods, hence preparing for future famines. In our world of today, however, such neurobiological pathways may pose a threat on our health. Thus, feedback mechanisms, such as tolerance, aversion and satiety, have to be finely tuned. Therefore central autoregulation that involves, for example, limbic mu receptor signaling and other endogenous signaling compounds comes into the focus of modern science. The time where research recognizes the importance of neurobiological pathways such as endogenous opiate autoregulation or CNS reward circuitries for examining the physiology of food intake has yet begun. Many questions remain open and have to be answered through future scientific inquiry.",

Maier et al. assessed how stress affects self-control in young adults that have a healthy lifestyle but reported indulging in fast-food treats regularly. Compared to control participants, participants who were experimentally stressed preferred tastier foods more often in a two-choice taste test, regardless of whether their choice was less healthy and in disagreement with their self-imposed dietary restrictions. Brain imaging revealed more-active reward and taste circuits in stressed participants and less activity in regions associated with self-control.

La sagesse populaire semble associer ces deux phenomenes.

Recemment, lorsque nous avons rapporte que la symptomatologie digestive des patients edentes semblait s'ameliorer apres la correction du deficit masticatoire, nous avons certainement ajoute un argument en faveur du role de la mastication dans la digestion. Lorsque nous avons voulu clarifier la relation physiopathologique entre ces deux phenomenes, nous avons cependant constate que les aliments solides, qu'ils aient ete mastiques avant leur deglutition ou qu'ils aient ete deglutis sans mastication, semblaient se vidanger de l'estomac a la meme vitesse. Les arguments scientifiques de l'implication physiologique et/ou physiopathologique de la mastication dans le processus de digestion demeurent donc embryonnaires. Meme s'il apparait premature de conclure que le traitement de la dyspepsie ou de certains troubles digestifs fonctionnels devrait inclure une correction de la dysfonction masticatoire, il apparait souhaitable et approprie de poursuivre les recherches scientifiques concernant l'implication de l'appareil dentaire dans le processus digestif.",

There was a close relation between drinking of alcoholic beverage and blood pressure but this concerned with men who acquired the habit of drinking by the force of surroundings. Strong tea and coffee, too, had something to do with blood pressure but in this case the surroundings were out of question. 2. Blood pressure was apt to rise with men who took meals hastily but it bad nothing to do with women. 3. Those who were fond of excessively salty or fatty food often suffered from hypertension. 4. Those who were particular about their food were found in the greatest number among the group of extreme hypertension. 5. Hypertension was rarely found among those with constant poor appetite. 6. Hypertension seldom attacked those who had the following complaints: To fall ill occasionally, to be always out of order, to have severe mental fatigue, to feel fatigue every morning, etc. But hereditary weak constitution had nothing to do with hypertension. 7. The blood pressure rose when the time for sleeting was less than 4 hours. It also rose with those who were easily awakened from their sleep or could not enjoy a sound sleep. But it was difficult to find any immediate relations between the failure to sleep readily or to have regular hours for sleep and the blood pressure. 8. Many heavy smokers were found among hypertensives which shows that smoking is the cause of high blood pressure. 9. The blood pressure rose of women whose household operates less than 50 area of farms while in the household with over one hectares, men's pressure rose. This is because in the former case, the stress of labor falls on women while in the latter, men bear the burden. 10.

Taste impairments from medications include: ageusia (absence of taste), hypogeusia (diminished sensitivity of taste), and dysgeusia (distortion of normal taste). The sites of action for most pharmaceutical compounds that induce taste losses are not known, but medications can act at several levels including peripheral receptors, chemosensory neural pathways, and/or the brain. Extensive research has shown that drugs are secreted into the saliva, and salivary levels of many drugs are high enough to exert adverse effects on taste sensations either by modifying taste transduction mechanisms or by producing a taste of their own.",

Too often the family diet is inadequate and poorly planned, even though a diet containing enough of each of the required vitamins, minerals and other nutrients is not necessarily an expensive one. Increasing the intake of Vitamin C increases the amount in the blood up to a saturated level. Body tissues store as much as they can hold and the amount left over is lost through urinary excretion. Therefore, the level of Vitamin C in the blood serves as a good guide to body storage. This storage is relatively small even with a high intake. It is quickly depleted during periods of decreased intake or increased need. Body stores of this vitamin are rapidly diminished under various kinds of physical stress. Because of the long summers of southern Arizona, with exposure over long periods of time to high tern peratures, the possible effect of heat stress becomes of special interest.",

      "abstract": "Summary A typical severely obese patient will have about 50 kg excess weight to lose, which is equivalent to a store of 350,000 kcal. The optimum rate of weight loss in such a patient is about 1 kg/week, which involves an energy deficit of 1000 kcal/day for about a year. It is difficult to maintain this degree of dietary restriction over such a long period, and procedures such as jaw wiring or stomach stapling may help in some cases. Maintenance of weight loss is difficult to achieve and may be helped by fitting a nylon waist cord after weight loss. On theoretical grounds, patients who do not lose weight despite keeping to a properly-designed reducing diet would not benefit from surgery, but in practice this problem does not arise. It is dangerous to resort to surgery for the treatment of severely obese patients who cannot diet by reason of psychiatric disorder.",

      "title": "Heartburn",
      "abstract": "Heartburn (pyrosis) can be defined as a burning sensation behind the sternum. Heartburn is typically caused by stomach acid that has refluxed back into the esophagus through the lower esophageal sphincter (which is normally closed except when swallowing). Most people who experience heartburn actually produce normal amounts of stomach acid, so heartburn is a problem of acid in the wrong place, not the production of too much acid. Lifestyle modifications that may reduce the risk of heartburn episodes include elevating the head of the bed by 6 to 8 inches, decreasing/avoiding certain foods (eg, chocolate, peppermint, fatty foods, caffeine, citrus, and tomatoes), avoiding large meals, and losing weight (decrease abdominal pressure). When lifestyle modifications are insufficient, there are numerous heartburn therapy options available over the counter. All 3 major categories of over-the-counter heartburn therapies are targeted at reducing acid already present in the esophagus (eg, antacids) or reducing gastric acid production (histamine 2 -receptor antagonists [H 2 RAs] and proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]). Antacids can provide rapid-onset heartburn relief by neutralizing acid already present in the esophagus. However, the transient increase in stomach pH caused by the antacid stimulates acid production, rapidly returning the stomach to a low pH. This rapid return to a low pH is why antacids do not prevent subsequent heartburn episodes and why frequent dosing (eg, up to 15 antacid tablets per day) may be required. Histamine 2 -receptor antagonists competitively inhibit 1 of the 3 stimuli for gastric acid production, which can slow acid production, so even a single dose can have a moderate effect on gastric pH. With repeat dosing, however, H 2 RAs rapidly develop tolerance that results in decreased acid control. While H 2 RAs can be effective for treating an isolated heartburn episode, they are less effective for controlling acid with repeat dosing (eg, frequent heartburn, defined as ≥2 days per week). Furthermore, H 2 RAs have an analgesic effect in the esophagus that is independent of acid control, so the esophagus may remain exposed to acid, even though the heartburn has been relieved. In contrast, PPIs block acid production at the final step, the proton pump, regardless of the 3 stimuli causing acid production. Proton pump inhibitors do not develop tolerance, and acid control actually increases over the first several days of dosing to a peak/sustained effect beginning on dosing day 4. Thus, PPIs provide both superior acid control and superior treatment of frequent heartburn when compared with H 2 RAs. Proton pump inhibitors show a dose-responsive effect on heartburn with less than 20 mg/d, but there is no additional heartburn control with higher doses (&gt;20 mg), so the optimal dose for treatment of frequent heartburn is 20 mg/d. Treating frequent heartburn with a minimal effective dose is consistent with the 2013 treatment guidelines established by the American College of Gastroenterology. If frequent heartburn is not effectively treated with 2 weeks of an over-the-counter therapy, then the patient should be evaluated by a physician. Furthermore, the presence of 1 or more alarm symptoms (eg, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, gastrointestinal bleeding, iron deficiency/anemia, weight loss, early satiety, and vomiting) should be evaluated by a specialist.",

Cela concerne en particulier la perception consciente des intentions et des possibilites de deduction d'autres individus du groupe, par exemple dans le cas d'un chimpanze qui a repere une banane dissimulee mais qui evite de regarder dans cette direction afin qu'un congenere, suivant la direction de son regard, ne puisse a son tour reperer le fruit et s'en accaparer. Aussi pouvons-nous nous demander si, dans le domaine du comportement alimentaire, il existe d'autres aspects cognitifs qui pourraient differencier les grand singes anthropoides des autres primates. D'ailleurs les humains sont-ils, de ce point de vue, si eloignes des autres hominides actuels ou fossiles ?",

The cause of HIV-related diarrhea varies from one area to another. Persistent diarrhea is more common among people who have advanced HIV disease than among those who do not, and is a major problem for many people with HIV/AIDS. The main dangers of diarrhea are dehydration and malnutrition. People with HIV-related diarrhea can become malnourished and lose weight quickly, mainly because they do not eat well due to poor appetite. Moreover, since weight loss is associated with HIV infection, people with diarrhea may be assumed to have HIV, and be stigmatized. Good hygiene and nutrition are the best ways to prevent diarrhea. While drinking boiled water is recommended, it is often not practical. Washing hands frequently with soap is a more practical prevention strategy. Other prevention strategies include storing food under a cover; washing eating and cooking utensils; washing raw fruit and vegetables; disposing of waste properly; and keeping anything dirty, such as soiled bedding, out of the reach of children. Nutritious, readily digestible food is also needed to prevent and treat diarrhea. Treatment recommendations are offered, as well as a guide to eating well.",

      "title": "Food Safety for the Holidays",
      "abstract": "Every holiday season brings celebrations involving lots of food, lots of food preparation, and with it, stressed-out chefs. Hawaii’s many extended families often have extended celebrations, meaning extended cooking and the use of short-cuts in the kitchen to keep the food coming. It can all be a recipe for potential health problems when food safety is ignored. Very often what we think is a short-term virus, a 24­ hour flu, or even an attack of holiday stress caused by excitement is none of those things—it is food poison­ ing. It comes from what food scientists call microbio­ logical contamination, mainly caused by “bad” bacte­ ria. Anyone can be affected by food poisoning, but the very young, the elderly, and those whose immune sys­ tems are weakened are especially vulnerable. Improper food handling and preparation is responsible for most food poisoning. Knowing and practicing proper food­ handling methods can prevent bad after-effects of good holiday eating. Salmonellosis, one of the most commonly occur­ ring foodborne illnesses, is caused by the bacterium Sal­ monella. Poultry and eggs are foods commonly associ­ ated with Salmonella. Other foods, such as beef and sal­ ads, also have been sources of salmonellosis, mainly through cross-contamination. Cross-contamination oc­ curs when harmful microorganisms are transferred by means of contaminated equipment, utensils, or human hands, from a food such as raw meat or its juice to an­ other food that will not be cooked. For example, a cook cuts up raw chicken on a cutting board that is then re­ used to cut fresh fruits and vegetables, without first washing the board in hot, soapy water. Harmful bacte­ ria from the raw chicken are transferred to the cutting board, then to the fruits and vegetables that are eaten without any further cooking. Fortunately, most of these harmful bacteria can be destroyed by proper cooking and food handling. Follow the food-handling directions below for safe food and healthy holiday celebrations. • Always follow strict personal hygiene practices, in­ cluding thorough hand-washing before and after han­ dling food. • Always cook by temperature! Foods vary in the tem­ perature at which they are thoroughly cooked. Some examples of “critical internal temperatures” are 165°F for poultry, 155°F for beef patties (no pink color), 145°F for pork, and 140°F for roast beef. A food ther­ mometer might be the best purchase you could make toward keeping your family’s food safe. • Thoroughly wash raw fruits and vegetables; also, wash the knives and peelers that you use on raw foods before using them again. • Pay cautious attention to holiday dishes—especially at buffets. Cold dishes that need watching include macaroni salad, meat salads, cream pies, and eggnog. Hot dishes that you should be careful with include poultry stuffing, egg rolls, rice (steamed or fried), and roasted meats. Keep cold dishes below 41°F. Hot foods should have a food temperature above 140°F. • Transport foods cold and reheat to above 165°F im­ mediately before serving. Precooked foods should be eaten within two hours of cooking. • Refrigerate leftovers immediately in small, shallow containers. Do not leave foods on the buffet table for more than two hours. • Clean the utensils that you will need for both raw and cooked foods in hot, soapy water between uses. • Buy only refrigerated eggs with unbroken shells. Eggs should always be thoroughly cooked, with no liquid parts. Avoid recipes that do not require the cooking of eggs, yolks, or whites.",

      "title": "Los efectos del alcohol y sus interacciones con los fármacos",
      "abstract": "Las bebidas con contenido alcoholico pueden interactuar con varios farmacos, drogas, alimentos, etc. Estas posibles interacciones han adquirido una gran importancia dentro de la farmacologia moderna, especialmente porque influyen sinergica o antagonicamente sobre algunos de los farmacos que mas prescriben los medicos, y que pueden inducir estados iatrogenicos, sobre todo cuando se combinan con diferentes bebidas alcoholicas. La mucosa gastrointestinal absorbe el alcohol de acuerdo con el volumen y el tipo de bebida que se haya ingerido y el tiempo que el sujeto lleve bebiendo, asi como con la cantidad de alimento que tenga en el estomago. La concentracion maxima de alcohol en la sangre suele obtenerse de 30 a 60 minutos despues de haberse ingerido. El grado de intoxicacion por alcohol varia de una persona a otra, dependiendo de diversos factores, como la edad, el peso y el estado fisico del sujeto. El higado metaboliza el alcohol, y cuando se ha bebido mucho y durante mucho tiempo, ocurren cambios en sus enzimas microsomicas. El alcohol tiene un alto contenido energetico; por ejemplo, ocho onzas de whisky tienen el mismo contenido energetico que un litro de leche. El sistema nerviosos central es el mas afectado por el consumo de alcohol. Inicialmente suele ser estimulante, pero posteriormente se presenta una accion depresiva sobre las zonas corticales y en la formacion reticular. Tambien afecta la psique y los sistemas cardiovascular, digestivo, urinario, etc. Cuando la ingestion es excesiva, el etanol influye considerablemente sobre la absorcion y el metabolismo de los diferentes farmacos. El alcohol puede inhibir considerablemente el metabolismo del fenobarbital, del meprobamato y del hidrato de cloral. El consumo de farmacos, combinado con el bebidas alcoholicas, produce diferentes interacciones que tienen indudablemente una importancia clinica. Cuando el alcohol se combina con analgesicos, tranquilizantes e hipnoticos, hay un sinergismo de los efectos depresores y, por lo tanto, disminuye la habilidad motora. Los factores que influyen en la interaccion entre el alcohol y los farmacos pueden ser geneticos, fisiologicos, sociopsicologicos o patologicos. Una interaccion clasica entre el alcohol y un farmaco es la combinacion disulfiram-alcohol, que actualmente se utiliza con fines terapeuticos para combatir el alcoholismo. La interaccion farmacocinetica y farmacodinamica de un determinado farmaco con el alcohol depende, en cierta forma, del periodo de exposicion al alcohol, de la cantidad del mismo y de las condiciones fisiologicas corporales. El medico debe conocer los efectos iatrogenicos de la combinacion del alcohol con ciertos farmacos para poder orientar adecuadamente a sus pacientes.",

      "title": "Criação e aplicação de projeto de educação nutricional para praticantes de atividade física",
      "abstract": "Há uma necessidade crescente de orientação e educação em nutrição esportiva para auxiliar os esportistas, principalmente amadores, a melhorarem seus hábitos alimentares, em virtude do desconhecimento por parte destes sobre a existência de dietas apropriadas nas diferentes fases do exercício. A eficácia da ingestão balanceada de alimentos ricos nos diversos macro e micronutrientes além de líquidos, baseada em uma correta educação alimentar, garante ao praticante de atividade física condições adequadas para preservar a saúde e melhorar seu rendimento. Uma dieta desequilibrada em variedade e quantidade de alimentos, assim como a inadequada ingestão no pré e pós exercício, pode acarretar deficiências alimentares, levando ao comprometimento da saúde e, consequentemente, perda de qualidade de vida. A ingestão de alimentos ricos em determinados nutrientes (gorduras, proteínas e fibras) e/ou grandes refeições antes da atividade física predispõem à manifestação de sintomas gastrintestinais, como vômitos, náuseas, cólica abdominal, aceleração dos movimentos intestinais, entre outros. Desta forma, ressalta-se que pode haver o comprometimento no desempenho do praticante ao alimentar-se imediatamente antes do início do exercício, com influência, inclusive, da quantidade de alimentos ingeridos. Criar um projeto de Educação Nutricional realizado por estudantes do curso de Nutrição e com este, orientar praticantes de atividade física (caminhada e corrida) sobre alimentação saudável e hidratação no pré e pós treino. Foi criado o projeto Nutrição na Rua: Orientar para Prevenir, inserido na disciplina de Educação Nutricional. Uma das atividades deste projeto foi realizada no campus da Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF) com 10 integrantes de um grupo de caminhada e corrida, voluntários, adultos e idosos de ambos os sexos, contando com a colaboração de uma educadora física, demonstrando a importância da união entre Nutrição e Educação Física para a qualidade de vida dos praticantes de atividades. Foram realizadas palestra de modo informal e dinâmico, prática de atividade física e degustação de sugestões de lanches a serem consumidos antes, durante e após o treino. Os participantes ainda receberam cartilhas contendo informações sobre alimentação e hidratação. Para avaliação, foi aplicado um questionário para verificar se os objetivos propostos foram alcançados. O grupo foi classificado como ativo e informal, sendo este formado por indivíduos saudáveis, com formação superior e idade variando entre 24 e 60 anos. Os indivíduos participantes sanaram suas dúvidas e compreenderam a real importância da alimentação saudável, principalmente para indivíduos praticantes de atividades físicas. Os participantes avaliaram o treinamento de forma positiva e julgaram o conteúdo trabalhado como esclarecedor. Além disso, asseguraram que a palestra foi ministrada de forma clara, objetiva e útil, declarando que irão realizar as mudanças necessárias nos seus hábitos de vida e de alimentação. Confirmamos a afirmativa da existência de uma relação direta entre alimentação saudável e êxito na prática de atividade física. O plano alimentar é único e individual, cada indivíduo requer suas quantidades de energia e nutrientes específicos. A utilização de planos alimentares não baseados nas informações individuais e científicas podem acarretar déficits nutricionais e comprometimento do treino.",

Constipation that is not secondary to underlying disease or caused by factors such as side-effects of drugs or laxative abuse is known as simple constipation. Its causes include insufficient fluid and fibre in the diet, failure to respond to the urge to defaecate, and lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise or mobility, stress, and long-haul air travel. These can often be resolved without recourse to medication, but short-term use of a laxative may be helpful in restoring normal bowel function.",

      "title": "Carbohydrate for athletic training and performance.",
      "abstract": "Although fats and protein contribute to energy demands of exercise, carbohydrate, principally glycogen, is the preferred fuel for muscular activity. Because of its limited storage, depletion of muscle glycogen has been shown to be one factor responsible for fatigue and exhaustion during prolonged exercise. Thus, dietary carbohydrate plays a key role in exercise performance and training. When the athlete's diet is low in carbohydrate, little glycogen is resynthesized between training sessions, leaving the individuals with low muscle glycogen and a state of chronic fatigue. The most sensitive period for glycogen resynthesis is within the first few hours after exercise. Optimal recovery from an exhaustive exercise bout depends on a reasonably rich carbohydrate diet soon after the exercise. Such feedings serve to replenish carbohydrate stores in both liver and muscles. Exertional hypoglycemia can occur when liver glucose output falls below the rate of muscle glucose uptake. Though this seldom occurs in well-fed and highly trained individuals, sugar feedings during long-term exercise has been shown to enhance performance. Thus, the important role of dietary carbohydrate before, during and after endurance activities is well established, whereas our understanding of the nutritional needs for protein and fat remain unclear.",

      "abstract": "Both scientific and anecdotal evidence indicates that social drinkers can develop resistance (i.e., behavioral tolerance) to alcohol's impairing effects over time. Although repeated exposure to alcohol is thought to explain tolerance development on a physiological level, the acquisition of behavioral tolerance appears to involve additional factors. In particular, learned associations between a drinker's behavior following alcohol consumption and the subsequent consequences may play an important role. When favorable consequences result from displaying unimpaired (i.e., tolerant) behavior after drinking, a drinker learns to develop behavioral strategies to compensate for alcohol's effects. In contrast, if a drinker does not receive a reward for unimpaired behavior--or finds that a more favorable outcome follows the display of intoxicated behavior--tolerance does not develop. Studies show that subjects also can develop behavioral tolerance to alcohol when they practice a task while impaired by factors other than alcohol or when they mentally rehearse task performance while under the influence of alcohol.",

      "title": "Is the Outcome of Alcohol Dependence Treatment Related to Intelligence of Patients",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAlcohol is considered to be the leading cause of addiction in the world and its use over time does not diminish. Alcohol not only causes problems to people who are de- pendent on alcohol but also for a society as a whole because of its impact on health, welfare and the economy.1In Slovenia, for a decade or more, the officially registered consumption of pure alcohol per capita is around 11 liters. However, it is more realistic to estimate the pure alcohol consumption at around 15 liters because of the unchecked consumption of uncontrolled domestic production.2Harmful alcohol use is a transitional stage between a prudent drinker and a man who is alcohol dependent. Confirmation of the diagnosis of harmful alcohol use needs to meet one of the following criteria:3- repeated drinking prevents successful performance of the tasks at home or in the workplace;- the person drinks in circumstances where this may endanger himself or others;- recurring legal consequences, such as hardening of peace, driving under the influence of alcohol etc.;- repeated drinking despite problems in relationships caused by drinking.Longer harmful alcohol use may develop in the syndrome of alcohol dependence. Dependence is a medical condition in which a person, due to frequent, prolonged and excessive drinking becomes mentally or physically dependent on alcohol. The result is the typical behavior and thinking which is guided by a craving for alcohol and stick to drinking despite physical illness and adverse consequences in interpersonal relationships.3Treatment of alcohol dependenceTreatment may be roughly divided into three stages:- the preparatory phase,- the level of intensive care,- rehabilitation.In the preparatory phase a patient is deployed in a psychiatric clinic where psychiatrist performs ambulatory inspection and, if necessary, refers the person to check in to the clinical psychologist. The intensive treatment takes place in a mental institution or psychiatric hospital. »Length of stay« in the hospital is about 3 months. The second phase is followed by a third phase, which means the inclusion of the patients in the club for recovering alcoholics (in which their family members are also included) or inclusion in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).The goal of therapy is the abstinence. Patients who complete the treatment mostly return to the same environment in which they came up with excessive alcohol consumption, so it is important that the person after treatment is able to solve everyday problems without alcohol. Usually the patients are forced to treatment under pressure from family or employer and threatened with dismissal. During the treatment, patents become familiar with the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption and negative effects on their social life, cognitive ability and health. Modern methods of treatment allow a shift from inpatient to outpatient care but hospital care is often necessary, especially for people who can't establish abstinence in their own environment, have severe abstinence symptoms or mental illness or other medical complications, are deeply depressed or prone to suicide, or live in difficult social circumstances with weak support in their environment.3Intelligence in alcoholicsIntelligence is one of the major areas of psychological research. Most of authors understand intelligence as a general mental ability or general ability of effective thinking and problem solving, i.e. general intelligence factor.4'5General factor (g-factor) of intelligence is defined as a common denominator of all the components of our mental abilities. Spearman has an opinion that the achievements on tests of general intelligence are dependent on g-factor as well as the specific additional factors which he described as s-factor.4 Cattell introduced a division between fluid and crystallized intelligence.5Fluid abilities develop earlier and faster and are dependent on cognitive flexibility, adaptability and speed of information processing (e. …",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores the methods of nutritional geometry on the modern human diet, applying the geometric approach to an analysis of a key aspect of human nutrition: the topical subject of human obesity. This analysis leads to three conclusions. First, the available evidence suggests that humans can regulate macronutrient intake, but that the intake target contains a built-in component for fat storage. Failure to use this stored fat promotes obesity. Second, when humans are faced with imbalanced diets, protein intake is prioritized. When the ratio of protein to carbohydrate in the diet is lower than optimal, it is easier to gain the required amount of protein—and hence overconsume fat and carbohydrate—when foods are high in energy density, present in great variety, and easily available throughout the day. Lastly, the regulation of nutrient intake in humans has evolved “assuming” a higher level of energetic expenditure than is usual today.",

However hard we try to go beyond a stress situation, life seems to find new ways of stressing us out and plaguing us with anxiety attacks.There can be innumerable stress factors since different individuals react differently to the same stress conditions. The brain doesn’t differentiate between real and imagined stress. Failure in adopting a realistic attitude to events creates symptoms of depression and aggravates stress situations.Do “stressed out” parents necessarily have stressed out kids? Besides being at higher genetic risk for stress, children of stressed parents can also learn the tendency to get stressed out in reaction to life’s challenges from their parents.”Children of stressed out parents are more likely to be ill equipped to handle stressors positively. Research shows that nicotine dependency actually increases stress levels in smokers-adults and adolescence alike. Adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking. The repeated occurrence of stressed moods between smoking means that smokers tend to experience distinctly above-average levels of daily stress. When adults quit smoking, they become less stressed rather than more stressed. Reduces stress hormones (studies shows, laughter induces reduction of at least four of neuroendocrine hormones—epinephrine, cortisol, dopac, and growth hormone, associated with stress response).It is well known that either a quick or constant stress can induce risky mind-body disorders. Stressed out individuals carry a great deal of physical tension in their bodies. Under stress the stiff muscles restrict the circulation of blood. Yogic asanas, meditation and breathing can help stress affected persons in many ways such as:(1)Reduce stress and tension, and (2) Mindfulness meditation helps stress reduction, improving physical and mental health.",

      "abstract": "The majority of research on nutrition and physical performance centers around continuous endurance exercise. That appropriate food intake can influence endurance performance is widely recognized. Considering that games in general and soccer in particular enjoy an enormous amount of participation, it should come as no surprise that nutritional influences on soccer performance has been studied. The literature shows that soccer is a glycogen-depleting activity and that work volume and rate are influenced by level of muscle glycogen. The dietary habits of soccer players do not appear to contain optimal carbohydrate intake given the varied, and sometimes minimal, amount of time between games. Nutritional assessment and counseling, if necessary, are suggested to afford the player adequate glycogen stores to work at the rate and volume demanded by the game.",

      "abstract": "Generalist feeders commonly ingest a mixture of different food items and in some situations it is known that dietary mixing involves an improvement in overall nutrient balance. Grasshoppers have been demonstrated to compensate for low nutrients by eating more of a food or eating an alternative one (Simpson and Simpson, 1990), although the details of the mechanisms involved have not been teased apart. This paper provides data that indicate a role for non-nutrient flavors in dietary mixing. Even with nutritionally identical foods, individuals mix two foods much less intensively when there are distinctive flavors added to them. This implies that flavor cues can be important in structuring foraging behavior. The different possible interpretations of these effects are discussed with reference to learning, novelty effects, ‘boredom’ and a basic tendency to alternate spatially.",

Manusia yang telah berusia lansia identik dengan penurunan intensitas kegiatan sehari-hari akibat keterbatasan fungsi fisik yang telah mengalami penurunan apabila dibandingkan dengan kualitas fisik diusia muda. Hal tersebut dapat ditemukan berbagai jenis penyakit yang rentan terkena pada penduduk yang telah berusia lansia seperti penurunan penglihatan, osteoporosis, menurunnya ketajaman pendengaran, berkurangnya kemampuan ingatan, dan nyeri sendi. Salah satu hal yang sering diperhatikan bahwa para lansia sangatlah rentan terhadap beberapa penyakit tersebut adalah gizi. Makanan sering menjadi kendala bagi para lansia dalam menunjang asupan gizi bagi mereka karena beberapa bagian organ yang digunakan dalam sistem pencernaan tidak berfungsi secara maksimal saat mencerna makanan. Hal tersebut dapat dibuktikan dengan timbulnya rasa sakit seperti di bagian lambung apabila para lansia sembarangan memilih makanan. Tujuan dari kegiatan ini adalah memberikan penyuluhan dan pemberian asupan gizi bagi para lansia adalah mempertambah pengetahuan lansia tentang gizi, meningkatnya angka harapan hidup lansia, lansia yang aktif dan produktif. Metode yang digunakan dalam kegiatan ini adalah melalui penyuluhan dan pemberian asupan gizi secara langsung. Hasil kegiatan menunjukkan bahwa sebagaian besar peserta kegiatan sudah melaksanakan pola hidup yang sehat dikarenakan posyandu yang ada sudah dikelola dengan baik. Adapun pola hidup sehat yang selama ini diterapkan diantaranya adalah cek kesehatan secara teratur, dan senam lansia yang rutin setiap 1 bulan sekali. Walaupun demikian masih ada beberapa kekurangan diantaranya seperti pengetahuan tentang gizi yang minim, tempat posyandu yang belum permanen, dana yang minim, perlatan cek kesehatan yang kurang, dan dan jumlah tenaga kesehatan yang minim",

They may be offered alternative servings developed for eating by their fingers. The present study investigated which kind of vegetables and cooking techniques suited this consumer group in order to accomplish a high level of acceptance. Vegetable preferences in Swedish adults older than 65 years (n = 97) were initially measured by a survey tool followed by digital focus groups. The findings were used to develop vegetable finger foods for older adults with motoric eating difficulties. The vegetable preferences among those with motoric eating difficulties did not differ in comparison to a more general older adult population. Among the vegetables, broccoli, carrot, tomato, cauliflower and red bell pepper were highly appreciated. However, for those with major eating difficulties, the choice of vegetables was restricted to fewer textures, which were more easily processed in the mouth. Vegetables served as snacks, traditionally on the plate, or deep-fried were considered most appropriate as finger foods. Finally, attractive meals for older adults unable to eat with common cutlery should also be accompanied with other nutritive finger foods servings.",

      "abstract": "False beliefs and memories can affect people's attitudes, at least in the short term. But can they produce real changes in behavior? This study explored whether falsely suggesting to subjects that they had experienced a food-related event in their childhood would lead to a change in their behavior shortly after the suggestion and up to 4 months later. We falsely suggested to 180 subjects that, as children, they had gotten ill after eating egg salad. Results showed that, after this manipulation, a significant majority of subjects came to believe they experienced this childhood event even though they initially denied having experienced it. This newfound autobiographical belief was accompanied by the intent to avoid egg salad, and also by significantly reduced consumption of egg salad sandwiches, both immediately and 4 months after the false suggestion. The false suggestion of a childhood event can lead to persistent false beliefs that have lasting behavioral consequences.",

      "abstract": "This paper shows that if an individual’s health costs are U-shaped in weight with a minimum at some healthy weight level and if the individual has both self control problems and rational motives for over- or underweight, the optimal paternalistic tax on unhealthy food mitigates the individual’s weight problem (intensive margin), but does not induce the individual to choose healthy weight (extensive margin). Implementing healthy weight requires a further distortion (e.g. subsidy on other goods), which may render the tax on unhealthy food inferior to the option of not taxing the individual at all. In addition, with heterogeneous individuals the optimal uniform paternalistic tax may have the negative side effect of rendering otherwise healthy individuals underweight.",

Because smoking cessation requires self-control, it was hypothesized that a treatment that builds self-control should help in quitting smoking. A total of 122 smokers either practiced small acts of self-control for 2 weeks before quitting smoking or practiced a task that increased their awareness of self-control or feelings of confidence, without exercising self-control. Their smoking status was assessed using daily telephone calls and biochemically verified. Individuals who practiced self-control remained abstinent longer than those who practiced tasks that did not require self-control. Supplemental analyses suggested that the increased survival times were a product of building self-control strength and were not produced by changes in feelings that practicing should help in cessation, effort exerted on the practice task, or thinking more about self-control while practicing.",

Consumir alimentos, les “ayuda” a sentirse mejor, evitando, disminuyendo o enfrentando así, esas emociones. Este comportamiento se conoce como alimentación emocional. Las personas con alimentación emocional seleccionan alimentos de buen sabor, habitualmente ricos en calorías, grasas o azúcares (por lo general poco saludables), porque les proporcionan placer y recompensa inmediata. Presentar alimentación emocional suele incrementar el riesgo de tener sobrepeso, obesidad y otras enfermedades. Por las implicaciones negativas de la alimentación emocional, es relevante identificarla y atenderla con apoyo profesional. Este artículo proporciona información general sobre estos temas.",

In the postabsorptive state, nearly all of the carbohydrate used during exercise comes from muscle and liver glycogen. The size of these glycogen stores plays a major role in determining how long vigorous endurance exercise can be performed if other causes of fatigue, such as dehydration or heat exhaustion, are avoided. In a \"fight or flight\" situation, individuals whose muscles are glycogen depleted are helpless, as they are unable to either run or fight. The same is true of someone who has become markedly hypoglycemic as a result of liver glycogen depletion.",

      "abstract": "Er is in toenemende mate aandacht voor de rol van voeding in het verouderingsproces. De waardering (of de afwezigheid daarvan) die we ervaren bij het zien en consumeren van voedsel heeft een belangrijke invloed op eetgedrag. Mensen zijn zich ervan bewust welke voedselproducten zij vies en lekker vinden. Echter, zij zijn zich vaak niet bewust van de lichamelijke (bijv. honger) en psychologische (bijv. emoties en geheugen) processen, die ervoor zorgen dat zij een product vies of lekker vinden (oftewel waardering; ‘Pleasure from Food’). Hoewel er veel onderzoek is gedaan naar de invloed van producteigenschappen van voedsel op het ouder worden (bijvoorbeeld de relatie tussen vitamine B en geheugen), weten we nog maar weinig over de processen, die ten grondslag liggen aan de waardering tijdens het zien en consumeren van voedsel in jongeren en ouderen. In het onderzoek beschreven in dit proefschrift hebben we deze processen onderzocht. De resultaten van dit proefschrift laten zien dat smaaksensatie (hoe intens een smaak wordt ervaren) niet verschillend is tussen gezonde jongeren en ouderen. Het effect van leeftijd op de waardering van smaken lijkt het gevolg van veranderingen in de complexe interactie tussen deze smaaksensatie, emoties en informatie die in ons geheugen is opgeslagen. Om het verband tussen smaakbeleving en eetgedrag in relatie met veroudering te begrijpen, is inzicht in de manier waarop veranderingen in psychologische processen ertoe bijdragen dat ouderen een adequate waardering van voedsel en daarmee eetgedrag behouden cruciaal.",

Insulin resistance and elevated blood sugar levels can be reduced, by avoiding foods rich in simple carbohydrates, sugar and by preferring complex carbohydrates (whole grains, starchy foods, fruits, vegetables). Due to the high risk of osteoporosis, it is recommended to consume three servings of dairy products and fish per day in order to obtain an adequate intake of vitamin D.

Using a hormone called leptin, the fat tissue regularly sends messages to the brain about the body’s energy reserves. When the brain receives a lot of leptin, it tells the body, “you are full, stop eating.” In certain situations, like obesity and pregnancy, the brain is less sensitive to leptin—so people do not feel full and they keep eating. We hypothesize that obesity and pregnancy change the blood vessels that transport leptin to the brain. As a result, an “illusion” of low energy reserves is created in the body, causing the brain to send fewer “stop eating” commands. As a result, people keep eating and gain weight.",

      "title": "Man Shall Not Live by Peanut Alone!",
      "abstract": "In addition to being a popular snack, the peanut is frequently incorporated in several common foods. Peanut consumption in the United States is very high, possibly the highest worldwide. By 2 years of age, an estimated 80% of children have been exposed to the peanut, primarily because of the common use of peanut butter early in life. Most peanut proteins are heat-stable and maintain their allergenicity in roasted peanut.1 Allergy to peanut is usually severe and long-lasting. In fact, it has been responsible for most cases of food-induced fatal anaphylaxis.A similar problem, albeit not as common, is allergy to tree nuts. Whereas peanut is a legume, the true tree nut family includes Brazil nut, hazelnut, pecan, and walnut. Less common allergic reactions have been reported to other nuts, such as almond (plum family), cashew and pistachio (cashew family), and chestnut and beechnut (beech family).Several recent studies have demonstrated that although cross-antigenicity (positive skin test or in vitro test) between various members of a botanical family is relatively common, clinical cross-allergenicity is uncommon. A peanut-allergic subject usually tolerates most members of the legume family.2 A strong cross-allergenicity, however, has been reported between chestnut, banana, and latex,3 and between cashew nut, mango rind, and rhus plant.4In this issue of Pediatrics electronic pages, an epidemiologic/clinical study on allergic reactions to peanut and tree nuts in children is reported by Sicherer, Burks, and Sampson.5 Identification of the subjects and collection of data were performed through a questionnaire to the pediatric allergy clinic patients and sera were analyzed for immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to peanut and various tree nuts. Although the history of allergic reactions was not confirmed by oral challenge testing, the authors reported several interesting findings. I would like to comment on a few of them.First, in 72% of cases, the initial reaction was claimed to have followed the first exposure. Sera of children with no history of exposure contained IgE antibodies to peanut in 100% and to various tree nuts in 50 to 82%. In another report from Canada,6 a positive radioallergosorbent test to peanut was noted in 64% of children who gave no history of eating it. These observations underscore the large magnitude of subtle or hidden exposure to such foods either by ingestion or by inhalation.The role of the latter route is markedly underestimated and deserves investigation.Second, accidental ingestion of peanut occurred in 56% and of tree nuts in 30% of the children known to have such allergies. Hidden ingestion can be through intentional incorporation in other foods (eg, candy, marzipan, and oriental dishes) or through accidental contamination or wrong labeling of packaged foods in the manufacturing plant. Whereas refined peanut oil is generally safe, crude and cold-pressed oils may cause reactions.78 Food labeling, although much better in recent years, still remains far from ideal. Manufacturers are allowed to use some meaningless labeling such as “may contain,” “contains either/or,” “natural and artificial flavors,” and “vegetable oil.” The Food Allergy Network,a among its several valuable services, has been keeping close collaboration with the food industry in the United States in issuing alerts about such discovered contamination or changes in food labeling that are relevant to food-sensitive subjects. Severe life-threatening reactions have occurred from trivial accidental exposures, even through inhalation.9 One schoolchild in my town is so exquisitely sensitive to peanut to a degree that a complete elimination of peanut from his classroom was necessary. On one occasion, he developed acute bronchospasm in the classroom after a teacher who had just eaten peanuts entered the room.Third, 83% of children reported to have allergy to peanut or tree nuts were breastfed. This raises the possibility, at least in some cases with a strong genetic predisposition to atopy, of sensitization through breast milk or across the placenta. Perhaps some of the children who reported reactions on first exposure were sensitized through these routes. In this series, >90% of the mothers ingested peanut and at least one kind of tree nut during pregnancy and/or lactation.Fourth, specific IgE antibodies were not detected in the sera of 9 children who reported clinical reactions. Among several factors that may be responsible for this finding is that in some patients the IgE antibodies can be primarily attached to the mast cells of the shock organ, with minimal quantities free in the circulation.Finally, I would like to address an issue that has raised controversy and heated debates in some parts of the nation, namely, should peanut be banned from schools where peanut-allergic children attend? Or from all schools? Should the vast majority of children be deprived of their popular nutritious snack for the sake of a very small number of allergic children? Can this be strictly enforced? And would this increase or reduce the liability of the school system? How about other food allergens such as milk and egg? Should the children be searched for bringing to school a prohibited food allergen, whereas searching for drugs and guns is not enforced?For some children, the question can be: “Is there life without peanut butter?”",

      "abstract": "Summary Alcohol consumption in pregnancy can produce a spectrum of abnormalities in the developing foetus, ranging from minor retardation of growth to the fully developed ‘foetal alcohol syndrome’. This syndrome comprises a constellation of physical and mental defects associated with a charateristic facial appearance that is found in children: born to chronic alcoholic women. Although it was thought to be extremely rare in the U.K., several case studies have recently appeared in the literature, and its incidence is probably increasing. In moderately drinking pregnant women increased rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and congenital malformation as well as growth retardation have been reported, though some of these findings await confurmation. It is likely also that certain behavioural abnormalities are consequent on maternal alcohol intake. The major U.K. finding so far is that consumption of more than 100g alcohol per week in the early stages of pregnancy is associated with reduced birth weight. There is no doubt that alcohol is teratogenic in laboratory animals and that the effects are dose‐related. In humans the threshold dose necessary to produce damage to the foetus and the time in pregnancy that alcohol is particularly likely to have deleterious effects have not yet been established. In the present state of knowledge there are difficulties in recommending safe limits. It is obvious that abstinence before and during pregancy is the safest course, but one drink a day is unlikely to be harmful. Greater efforts are needed to educate women about the dangers of alcohol consumption in pregnancy.",

Puffing but not inhalation became less intense as a cigarette was smoked. It was not possible to predict indices of absorption from smoking patterns.

However, many adolescents do not know and realize this behavior, which if done excessively can lead to overweight or even obesity. So through this research, we try to find out the extent of adolescent knowledge regarding emotional eating behavior. Our findings indicate that differences in school levels determine this knowledge, so that the provision of material related to eating disorders is not fully understood by adolescents. In fact, the prevention of obesity in adolescents is more effective if given since early adolescence, namely by including the curriculum in schools related to self-control and basic knowledge related to eating disorders and other disorders that generally begin to occur in adolescence.",

      "title": "Life before birth: are the dice tossed for the rest of our lives?",
      "abstract": "Without any exception, every human being has spent at least a considerable amount of time in the womb and has gone through the stressful process of being born. However, the quantity and quality of our life before birth varies tremendously between people. That is, some individuals survive birth after only 22 weeks of pregnancy [1] and others have the luxury of being born after spending more than 40 weeks in utero. Perhaps more importantly than the duration are the conditions of our stay: Do we receive enough and healthy nutrition? Are we exposed to toxics like tobacco, alcohol or drugs? Is the oxygen supply sufficient? Are we being subjected to high levels of stress hormones? Are we getting infected by bacteria or viruses? And then…birth. By some considered as the most stressful life event we will ever have to endure. A certain amount of stress is actually necessary for survival: The high level of hormones released during birth, which are also involved in the stress response, are believed to make the newborn more alert promoting the bonding process and, by extension, the child’s physical survival [2]. However, while a certain amount of stress is necessary for survival, extreme and/or prolonged stress can affect health adversely [3]. For example, it has been shown that people who had underwent an extremely stressful birth (defined as vaginal delivery with fetal suffering or forceps use, urgent cesarean section indicated by fetal suffering or twin birth with death of the other fetus) were 5 times more likely to have developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in the year following a stressful life event compared to OCD patients without an extremely stressful birth [4]. In other words, the former group had more often a stress-event-related onset of OCD compared to the latter group, indexing the possibility that a very stressful birth creates a life-long enhanced vulnerability to stress and an enhanced risk of developing anxiety related symptoms, such as OCD. Animal studies also suggest that a single aversive life event may be capable of permanently affecting the individual’s sensitivity towards experiences in life after birth [5].\r\n\r\nThe importance of a prosperous prenatal environment and birth process for future health has long been recognized. Conversely, exposure to early adversity during a sensitive period of development is thought to lead to structural, physiological and metabolic changes in the fetus that increase susceptibility to later disease [6]. For instance, antenatal maternal and infant malnutrition [7, 8], antenatal maternal stress [9], low birth weight, younger maternal age and increasing birth order [10–13] have all, amongst others, been linked to poorer mental health. Particularly in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the role of adverse prenatal and perinatal factors is well-documented. Compelling evidence exists for associations between an increased risk for ASD on the one hand and maternal infections during pregnancy, increased parental age, fetal hypoxia, prematurity, and low birth weight on the other hand [14–16]. More broadly viewed, as reported by Guedeney et al. in this issue and previously by others [17–19], associations have been found between pre- and perinatal risks and sustained social withdrawal behavior (more prevalent than ASD but considered a red flag for developing clinical disorders such as ASD, attachment disorders and depression) [20–22]. In any case, life before birth is related to mental health outcomes in life after birth.\r\n\r\nHowever, it remains to be determined to what extent these factors are true risk mediators (causally involved) or rather risk indicators (linked to an increased risk but not contributing causally to the adverse outcome). Two main reasons why prenatal risks may act as risk indicators, are that these factors are associated with postnatal risks (such as social adversity and parent mental health problems) and that they relate to unmeasured confounders, such as maternally transmitted inherited factors [6]. Studies commonly deal with these two possibilities by adjusting for measured confounders. For instance, it was recently shown that when social class, family structure and religion were corrected for, prenatal circumstances were not or only marginally associated with mental health outcomes in adolescence and young adulthood [23]. Further support for the hypothesis that perinatal factors may often act as indicators instead of mediators of poor mental health was reported in a series of elegantly designed studies by Thapar and colleagues [24–26]. Using genetically informative designs, in which mothers were either genetically related or unrelated to their child as a result of assisted reproductive technologies, they showed that relationships between smoking during pregnancy and ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms, and also between breastfeeding and lower levels of conduct problems, were only present in the genetically related group and not in the genetically unrelated group [24–26]. These studies teased apart the intrauterine and genetic influences normally intertwined in explaining the fetal origins of chronic diseases and suggest pre- and perinatal risk factors may sometimes act as a proxy for the underlying genetic risk transmitted to offspring.\r\n\r\nHowever, elegant as these studies may be in examining the role of prenatal risks in isolation from a genetic background, the reality of life is that the vast majority of people are conceived in the natural way and spend their life before and after birth with their biological parents. Therefore, genetic and environmental factors correlate and interact in various complex ways, causing substantial differences between people in their exposure and susceptibility to both positive and negative environmental influences [27, 28]. This differential susceptibility may be labeled as “prenatal programming of postnatal plasticity” [29] and one of the mechanisms underlying this may be epigenetics. Epigenetics can be broadly defined as those heritable changes not dependant on the genomic sequence and encompasses a variety of mechanisms to dynamically modify the expression of the genome [30]. There appear to be “discrete epigenetic checkpoints” [30] during which the genome is extra sensitive to modifications by environmental factors. This illustrates that in real life there is no effect of prenatal risk in isolation from a genetic background or vice versa.\r\n\r\nSo, in life before birth, are the dice tossed for the rest of our lives? The influence of the prenatal environment on mental health later in life is unequivocally present. Often the dice are unfairly being tossed, with some children receiving the best of odds and others the worst. However, what the best odds are is not predetermined, but may vary according to the environment in which the child grows up. In some cases, the last shall be the first.",

This dictates consideration of the timing of drug administration with respect to the time of meal ingestion. There are several reasons for taking a drug with a meal or nutrient beverage. It may be expedient for clinical staff in hospitals and assisted living centers to administer a drug at a time when meals are provided for inpatients. Outpatient compliance with the prescribed drug dosage regimen may be aided with administration at regular mealtimes. Some drugs are irritating in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and their administration with food or a nutrient beverage can diminish this effect as compared to administration with water.",

Breakfast is the first meal of the day eaten in the morning. It provides the body with fuel by breaking our overnight fast and from this the name comes as breakfast. The famous phrase “Breakfast like a king, Lunch like a prince, and Dine like a pauper” is quoted more often than actually practiced in the modern era due to either ignorance or improper lifestyle habits. A lot of research has been done to validate this old saying, and all of them support the importance of a proper breakfast on a regular basis. Therefore, we wanted to highlight this basic aspect of our daily life to promote good health and awareness among our readers as a part of preventive and promotive physiology.\r\nWhy do people skip breakfast or eat it poorly? Some individuals do not feel hungry in the morning. Lack of sleep or heavy dinner in the previous night, lack of time to get ready in the morning, or the hurry to school/college/office are some of the common reasons cited.[1] Read more...",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Übergewicht und Adipositas im Kindes- und Jugendalter haben sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten zunehmend zu einer Herausforderung für das Gesundheitssystem und die Gesellschaft entwickelt. Der wachsende Außer- Haus-Verzehr von hoch prozessierten Lebensmitteln, bedingt durch deren Omnipräsenz, ist mit einer gesteigerten Energieaufnahme assoziiert. Es handelt sich um eine komplexe Ernährungsumwelt, in der Essensentscheidungen oft auf Gewohnheit und Intuition basieren, nicht aber bewusst und kontrolliert getroffen werden. Präventionsstrategien bei Übergewicht und Adipositas adressieren entweder das Verhalten des Individuums (=Verhaltensprävention) per se oder die Verhältnisse, in denen das Individuum lebt (=Verhältnisprävention). Im Bereich der Verhältnisprävention von Übergewicht und Adipositas gewann in den letzten Jahren der sogenannte “nudging”-Ansatz (“Verhaltensstupser”) an Bedeutung. Das Prinzip “Nudging” wird häufig in ernährungsassoziierten Kontexten eingesetzt. In Deutschland existieren bisher nur wenige Präventionsprogramme, die den verhältnispräventiven Ansatz gegen Übergewicht und Adipositas bei Kindern und Jugendlichen adressieren. Gerade in den Settings “Kindergarten” und “Schule” besteht die Möglichkeit, im Rahmen von einfachen Modifikationen der bestehenden Ernährungsumwelt durch sog. “Stupser” gesundheitsförderliche Auswahlroutinen zu etablieren. Für eine Evidenzbegründung von “Nudging”-Maßnahmen fehlen derzeit noch randomisiert-kontrollierte Studien.",

      "abstract": "Increasing rates of obesity and overweight have been attributed to the growing proportion of dietary energy that is consumed in liquid form. Liquids reportedly fail to trigger physiological satiety mechanisms so that compensation for energy consumed as beverages may be imprecise and incomplete. Sweetened beverages have come under particular scrutiny, as their consumption exceeds that of milk and fruit and vegetable juices. However, the evidence that liquids have less impact on satiety than do solid foods remains inconclusive. Some published studies have reported that liquids are less satiating than solids, whereas other studies have reported that solids are less satiating than liquids. In laboratory studies, the degree of energy compensation following pre-load ingestion was influenced by subject characteristics, pre-load volume, or the time lag between the pre-load and the next meal. Such factors appear to interact with pre-load texture in their impact on hunger and satiety and later food consumption.",

      "abstract": "You need to ensure that you are not mistaking haemoptysis with: • Haematemesis: brownish-red blood that is vomited from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. • Epistaxis (nosebleed): particularly a posterior nosebleed. • Bleeding gums: combined with a cough, this may be confused with true haemoptysis. To tell if it is really haemoptysis, you can ask the patient where they think the blood is coming from (they may say it initially dripped from their nose), its colour (darker, coffee-ground appearance suggests partially digested blood), any history of nosebleeds, nausea, vomiting, gastric disease, or alcoholism. For the latter, asking if he is an alcoholic is unlikely to yield a valid response. Instead, you can try the TACE questions to detect alcohol dependence: . . . Does it Take more than three drinks to make you feel high? Have you ever been Annoyed by people’s criticism of your drinking? Are you trying to Cut down on drinking? Have you ever used alcohol as an Eye-opener in the morning? A positive response to the first question scores 2 points and a positive response to each of the rest, scores 1 point each. A positive response to two of these four questions is considered to indicate possible alcohol abuse or dependence as does a total score of two or more points. Haemoptysis should always be investigated thoroughly for two reasons: 1 It may be the presenting symptom for life-threatening lung disease. 2 Massive haemoptysis, variably defined as anything from &gt;100 mL to &gt;1000 mL over 24 hours, may be life-threatening itself, usually through asphyxiation but potentially also shock. Haemoptysis is thus a ‘red flag’ symptom and any patient with haemoptysis requires a thorough diagnostic work-up. These can be grouped together under a ‘surgical sieve’—we have used INVITED MD: Infective: pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), bronchitis, pneumonia, lung abscess, mycetoma Neoplastic: primary lung cancer, metastatic lung cancer Vascular: pulmonary embolism, left ventricular failure, bleeding diathesis (i.e. a bleeding tendency e.g. coagulopathy, severe thrombocytopenia), arteriovenous malformation, vascular–bronchial fistula Inflammatory: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener’s granulomatosis), Goodpasture’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome), polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis",

Una delle maggiori sfide del fumatore in remissione e quello di riuscire a gestire il desiderio impulsivo di ricominciare a fumare che compare specie nelle situazioni ad alto rischio. L’obiettivo della ricerca e stato quello di comprendere quali sono le situazioni ambientali di forte richiamo al fumo nei primi cinque giorni dopo l’interruzione ed esplorare le strategie di adattamento alla situazione astinenziale, in particolare le modalita di coping messe in atto dai soggetti durante la comparsa delle tentazioni. I risultati indicano che i momenti e i contesti della giornata di maggiore tentazione sono la mattina e la situazione post-prandiale, la prima connessa con meccanismi fisiologici, la seconda di ordine psicosociale. Per quanto riguarda le strategie di coping, e stata creata una tavola tassonomica in cui si distinguono tre macro-categorie: agire, pensare e aspettare che passi. Le strategie comportamentali, piu frequenti, allontanano il soggetto dalla situazione ad alto rischio rendendo piu difficile il richiamo della sigaretta; le strategie cognitive mirano ad aumentare il livello di fiducia in se stessi e di autoefficacia del soggetto, alimentando la convinzione di diventare un ex-fumatore; infine nel terzo caso, i soggetti resistono all’impulso aspettando che questo autonomamente si affievolisca, mantenendo lo stato comportamentale precedente alla sua comparsa.",

      "abstract": "The intake of alcoholic beverages is a huge social issue. Worldwide, an estimated 2.3 billion individuals consume alcohol, with an average daily consumption of 33 grammes of pure alcohol. Self-esteem is a measure of one’s self-awareness and sense of personal worth. The process of behaving and then thinking about acts, as well as how others interpret actions, shapes one’s self-perception. Self-esteem refers to how we feel about ourselves and how much we regard ourselves. Alcoholism has far-reaching consequences and might result in mental health issues. One of the most typical effects found in alcoholics is the development of poor self-esteem. This term refers to a person’s total subjective sentiments of personal worth and value. It has a wide range of effects. It has an impact on a variety aspect of life, including substance abuse and recovery. The majority of alcoholics have a low sense of self-esteem. They have struggled to cope with their lives and frequently have significant emotional, family, social, and occupational issues, as well as financial, legal, and sexual issues. Coping is frequently studied in terms of its potential to reduce negative consequences. Coping skills can also help you achieve more favourable results.",

Elle entraîne des déficits cognitifs en impliquant probablement des processus neuroinflammatoires et épigénétiques. Toutefois, le mode d’action de l’alcool au cours des expositions initiales de type BD, est peu connu. Il pourrait pourtant être à l’origine de ces déficits cognitifs à long terme. Des études récentes, réalisées chez le rat adolescent, révèlent que la perte de mémoire se produit dès les premiers BD, avec des mécanismes similaires à ceux d’une exposition plus longue. L’initiation au BD chez le jeune serait donc responsable de déficits qui seront probablement entretenus par la répétition de cette pratique. Ces données originales devraient permettre de renforcer les campagnes de prévention auprès de la jeune population qui pratique le BD.",

      "abstract": "The basic aim of the current study was to relate the blood sugar with the noodle delineation. Glucose is the primary and essential metabolite necessary for the normal functioning of the body. Pancreas is responsible for maintaining the level of glucose or its consolidation in the body. In the body, when the consolidation of glucose is high glycogen is formed. Pancreas secrete insulin when sugar level is high while utilize the glycogen (stored form of glucose) when sugar level declines in body. The normal fasting sugar level is 70mg/dl – 100mg/dl. After eating meal, the maximum sugar level is 170mg/dl – 200mg/dl. When the normal functioning of pancreas disrupts it either leads to hyperglycemia (persistently high level of glucose) or diabetic mellitus. The nutritional, renowned, amazing handy meal with lots of flavors and is liked by many cultures is noodles. Noodles provide essential nutrients which fulfill the requirement of the healthy body. First of all, it is boiled then different flavors are added according to the taste of the consumers. Wheat noodles actually formed from wheat with salt added into it then different types of shapes may given to it according to the requirement while rice noodles are formed from extruded rice then steamed may given to it and they are converted into strip shaped noodles. It was closured from the current task that subjects with high blood pressure are noodle depicted while other subjects who have low blood pressure are not much noodle delineated.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, high-carbohydrate diets have been recommended for endurance and ultra-endurance athletes. For many endurance events, the habitual consumption of a high-carbohydrate diet, with supplemental carbohydrate before and during exercise, is appropriate for many athletes. However, there are some situations for which alternative dietary options are beneficial. Diets relatively higher in fat than is currently recommended may be beneficial for exercise in which energy expenditure is high and time for recovery is limited, and for events in which athletes transport their food supply. The number of grueling events that challenge the limits of human endurance is increasing. Such events are also challenging the limits of current dietary recommendations, which may need to be expanded to allow for easier consumption of sufficient calories to minimize loss of lean body mass. The choice of diet for optimal physical performance depends on several factors, including type and duration of exercise, total energy expenditure, time for recovery, dietary preference of the athlete, and whether or not the sporting event is unassisted (and hence athletes are required to transport their food). A variety of diets ranging in macronutrient composition may be recommended based on these parameters.",

      "abstract": "Найбільш популярні домашні улюбленці – собаки та коти – нині вважаються повноцінними членами більшості родин на всій земній кулі. Вони є товариськими тваринами, добре ладнають як з дорослими, так і з дітьми, завжди раді своєму господарю і всіляко виражають свою любов до нього. Вважається, що собаки й коти не надто вибагливі до продуктів харчування, й інколи можна спостерігати, що тварини залюбки поїдають невластиві цьому виду тварин продукти. Наприклад, собаки можуть ласо куштують цукерки й шоколадні вироби, а коти – мариновані огірки та чіпси. Звичайно, таке харчування негативно впливає на організм улюбленців і навіть тоді, коли на перший погляд це лишається непомітним. Варто відмітити, що переважно поява харчових отруєнь у тварин є причиною повної відсутності або ж браку інформації у власників щодо особливостей годівлі своїх улюбленців. Нині у світі почастішали випадки звернень громадян до лікарів ветеринарної медицини з отруєннями собак та котів різними харчовими продуктами, серед яких є такі, як цибуля (Allium cepa L.) та часник (Allium sativum L.). Незважаючи на користь цих рослин при споживанні їх людиною, все ж для собак та котів вони є токсичними через наявність у їхньому складі таких речовин, як сульфоксиди і сульфіди, особливо аліл і пропіл ді-, три- і тетрасульфіди, що містяться в цибулі, та аліцин (діалліл-дисульфід-S-оксид) і аджоен (2-пропеніл-3[3-(2-пропенілсульфініл)-1-пропеніл] дисульфід), які має у своєму складі часник. Особливо часто випадки отруєнь фіксують серед власників тварин, яким подобається годувати своїх тварин «зі столу», тобто тими ж продуктами, які вживають і самі. Тому метою цієї розвідки було охарактеризувати токсичні властивості, які мають цибуля та часник, дати характеристику змінам, які відбуваються в організмі тварин при вживанні цих овочів, та коротко навести основні принципи лікувальних маніпуляцій при отруєнні ними. Розкриття таких аспектів дасть змогу лікарям ветеринарної медицини отримати додаткові знання в цій області, що, своєю чергою, сприятиме правильному діагностуванню вищенаведеної патології і, відповідно, проведенню лікувальних заходів у разі такої необхідності. Слід мати на увазі, що наведена в розвідці інформація буде корисною не лише для спеціалістів ветеринарного фаху, але і для власників собак та котів, адже дасть певне розуміння щодо особливостей годівлі своїх домашніх улюбленців.",

      "title": "Low‐ or No‐Energy Sweeteners and Body Weight Management: Dissecting a “Minor” Effect",
      "abstract": "Nonnutritive sweeteners were introduced on the market over a century ago to displace the calories of added sugars in foods and beverages and, therefore, facilitate weight loss. In spite of their widespread use, obesity has reached epidemic proportions. The present paper addresses this apparent paradox. Low- or no-energy sweeteners (LNES) are a small group of widely different substances that can be used to modify one single aspect of energy intake, i.e., consumption of added sugars. Their potential benefits for weight management can be predicted by energy balance equations. Decades of research confirm that LNES affect weight via a purely nutritional mechanism, in proportion of their actual displacement of sugar energy. LNES allow a substantial decrease in energy density of beverages (as opposed to solid foods) and can be maximally effective in consumers of sugar-containing drinks. Their average effect is robust but modest (1-2-kg weight loss) compared to comprehensive weight-loss programs (±5 kg), medication, or surgery (+10% of initial weight). Other benefits of LNES include sensory-specific satiety for sweet foods, improved diet adherence, and facilitation of weight-loss maintenance. Whether these effects are considered minor or major benefits in the present obesogenic context is a matter of individual definition.",

Such weight reduction should result only from reduction in excess body fat. In most instances, weight reduction should be achieved at a rate of no more than 1 kg a week, through a modest reduction in diet and a moderate increase in exercise. More rapid weight reduction by starvation and dehydration compromises strength and endurance. Athletes attempting to gain weight should increase weight as muscle mass, not fat. Muscle mass is increased only through muscle work supported by an appropriate increase in food intake. No food, vitamin, drug, or hormone will increase muscle mass. It is recommended that the high caloric diet required to support muscle growth from increased work should be low in animal fats and cholesterol. (<i>JAMA</i>236:149-151, 1976)",

      "abstract": "Toxicology cases involve approximately 10% of bovine cases typically seen in practice. Because toxicology cases are not seen every day you might not feel familiar with how to work up a toxicology case. Sometimes the hardest part of a toxicology case is deciding when the case you are working on involves a potential toxin. In this presentation I mention the commonly requested toxicology analysis involving cattle. History and a time line are critical parts of a toxicology workup. To be a good veterinary toxicologist you have to have good observational skills and know what common management practices can result in potential toxicology issues. Toxicology is not always just an overdose, many cases involving deficiencies that can mimic infectious disease. Collection of the correct feed sample is critical to making a diagnosis in toxicology. Many times the feed sample we need is not available because the actual toxicosis occurs days before. We collect a feed sample when animals are dying but many times this is not the appropriate feed sample. In many cases of vaccine failure or animals not responding to natural challenge with an infectious agent, nutrition is involved. Poisonous plant involvement in a case is always an enigma but can be worked out with the proper work up.",

      "title": "Ingested poisons in adults",
      "abstract": "An ingested poison is considered any substance that's harmful to the body when ingested, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Any substance that's ingested can be poisonous if enough is consumed, even water. Poisons cause damage by altering cellular metabolism in a harmful or destructive way. They can act very quickly, within minutes in the case of heroin overdose, or over a period of time as with alcohol abuse. Most patients who've ingested a poison have minimal morbidity and fully recover within a short period of time. In this article, I'll discuss how to develop and utilize a general approach to the management of patients with suspected or confirmed poisoning. Unintentional or intentional? If a substance is ingested without intent to harm, it's assumed that it was an unintentional poisoning. This includes the consumption of drugs, medications, or other chemicals that are used in excessive amounts and result in an overdose. A poisoning is also considered unintentional when a substance is ingested accidentally and unknowingly, such as with children or older adults. When a substance is ingested with the intent to harm, it's considered an intentional poisoning, such as in a suicide attempt or assault on another person. When you can't make the distinction between the two because of circumstances, then the poisoning may be considered undetermined until proven otherwise. Substances most likely to be ingested include over-the-counter pain medicines, cleaning products, cosmetics, plants, prescription medications, and cough and cold preparations. Fatalities usually result from the ingestion of analgesics, sedative-hypnotics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, illegal drugs, cardiovascular medications, or alcohol.FigureTo evaluate a patient suspected of poisoning, you must discover what the likely poison is and when the ingestion occurred and assess the severity of the poisoning and the likelihood for toxicity. Nursing management is geared toward supportive care, preventing further absorption, and providing antidotes or promoting the elimination of the poison. Remember, the sequence, methods, and priorities of management are dictated by the poison and the severity of its presentation. The phases of poisoning are as follows: preclinical phase—some signs and symptoms may not be evident during this phase; the priority is decontamination toxic phase—signs and symptoms and lab changes are evident during this phase and guide treatment; the emphasis is on shortening the duration of poisoning and lessening the severity of toxicity resolution phase—this phase encompasses peak toxicity to recovery; the goal is to shorten the duration of toxicity. Initially speaking Your initial physical exam of the patient will focus on the ABCs—airway, breathing, and circulation—to stabilize him and prevent any further deterioration. Always ensure that his airway is patent; any doubt should prompt you to prepare for endotracheal intubation. Act quickly, but remain cool and observant. Signs and symptoms are important clues to identifying a poison, such as noticing there are burns on the patient's mouth. If the patient vomits, collect the vomitus and send it to the lab for analysis. Assess his vital signs, including pulse oximetry value and blood glucose level; assess and record his mental status and pupil size; obtain blood tests and urine samples as ordered; and make sure appropriate advanced cardiac life support measures are immediately available. Next, you'll want to confirm the history of the poisoning and correlate it with the information gathered from your initial survey. Sometimes you may need to talk with the paramedics, the patient's family or friends, or the police to gather sufficient information. Ask about the presence of pill bottles, medications, drug paraphernalia, empty bottles of alcohol, or a suicide note. If you suspect an overdose of medication, ask to see the pill bottles or the actual pills or ask for a description of the pills. If a substance can't be identified, call your local poison control center or check the computerized poison identification system or material safety data sheet. A computerized ID system gives you instant access to critical information about the management of exposure, such as clinical effects, range of toxicity, and treatment of specific and general categories of substances. A material safety data sheet provides comprehensive information regarding the physical properties, toxicity, physical effects, reactivity, proper storage and disposal, protective equipment, first aid, and containment process associated with a specific substance. Imaging tests may be warranted to determine the location, source, and likelihood of what was ingested. A chest X-ray may reveal undigested metals, radiopaque foreign bodies, or drug packets, vials, or supplies (called body packing, the internal concealment of illegal drugs such as heroin). Continue to assess the patient's vital signs, mental status, and pupil size repeatedly (from every 15 to 30 minutes to every hour). Check for the following: physiologic excitation (increased agitation, BP, respiratory rate, pulse, temperature, and pupil dilation) physiologic depression (coma; somnolence; diminished BP, respiratory rate, pulse, and temperature; and pupil constriction) odors (bodily or breath) acetone (fruity), caused by ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, chloroform, or salicylates bitter almond, caused by cyanide garlic, caused by arsenic, organophosphates, phosphorus, thallium, or selenium rotten eggs, caused by hydrogen sulfide wintergreen, caused by methyl salicylate. For more information about how to use assessment findings to help determine what type of poison is causing your patient's signs and symptoms, see Pinpointing poison's effects. Decontamination and antidotes After the patient is stabilized, some degree of decontamination should be initiated as soon as possible. Options include: activated charcoal to prevent further absorption (check for bowel obstruction, ileus, perforation, or significant gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding) whole bowel irrigation performed orally or via a nasogastric (NG) tube, usually in conjunction with sodium bicarbonate osmotic laxative solution; can be given after activated charcoal, especially if symptoms continue or if continued poisoning is suspected (check for bowel obstruction, ileus, perforation, or significant GI bleeding) cathartics, such as sorbitol, to decrease absorption by enhancing rectal evacuation of the poison; can be given after activated charcoal (check for bowel obstruction, perforation, ileus, electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, or renal insufficiency) administration of an antidote (see Common antidotes used in the ED). Table: Common antidotes used in the EDWith more severe and life-threatening cases, decontamination options include repeated doses of activated charcoal, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, hemofiltration, and exchange transfusion. Tailoring nursing interventions An important aspect of caring for a poisoned patient is understanding the course of management thus far and tailoring your nursing interventions accordingly. Ongoing interventions include: ensuring airway patency and assessing for the risk of aspiration, especially after any gastric decontamination process (make sure adequate suctioning equipment is readily available) checking vital signs and monitoring for hypotension or hypertension ensuring telemetry monitoring is intact and active (check for ventricular tachycardias or bradyarrhythmias with hypotension) initiating seizures precautions if necessary. After successful decontamination, a short period of observation will be warranted and a disposition determination will be based on the observed and predicted severity of toxicity. Mild presentations of toxicity may only require a short period of observation for 4 to 12 hours in the ED, but moderate to high levels of toxicity may require admission to the hospital intermediate care floor, observational units, or ICU on the basis of the patient's history and clinical data. Keep in mind that any concern for an underlying psychiatric condition should warrant a consultation.

      "abstract": "Most older Americans are not physically fit and do not exercise regularly. This is especially true of older women, who are weaker than men and become disabled and dependent in the later years at a much greater rate. Exercise can increase the body's metabolism and make it more efficient in burning calories. Physical fitness also makes respiration more efficient. Evidence suggests strongly that the physically fit live 2 to 3 years longer and have a better quality of life than sedentary individuals. Any time is the best time for a person of any age to start exercising. Exercise is movement--dancing, walking, lifting a weight, using the body. Older individuals tend to be willing to exercise if they are given appropriate recommendations and follow-up.",

Peanut allergy in all patients explained the anaphylactic reactions due to ingestion of hidden peanut in the food.Patients were told to avoid the allergen. Because accidental ingestion is frequent in peanut allergy, they were equipped with a document stating the severity of the allergy and emergency medication (antihistamines, oral steroids, adrenaline injector).Peanuts can be concealed in different kinds of food because they are cheap, rich in protein and are often used to change the viscosity of other foods. Especially the American and Asian cuisines use peanuts in a wide variety of recipes. Furthermore accidental ingestion can occur due to false or lacking declaration of peanuts in processed food. Patients with peanut allergy should be informed about these possibilities.",

This may induce soothing effects, which are especially relevant to people with certain types of mood depression (e.g., atypical depression).\r\n\r\n\r\nChocolate consumption may be a personality marker of high neuroticism and represent a strategy to cope with the propensity to experience intense negative emotions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the psychoactive substances present in chocolate, at least methylxanthines (theobromine and caffeine) have significant psychopharmacological effects. Methylxanthines have an impact on mood and improve performance in specific tasks. Methylxanthines may therefore play the role of chocolate as an “energizer.”\r\n\r\n\r\nChocolate addiction should be regarded as an inaccurate and misleading term. “Moreishness” may be a better term. It translates as the ambivalence associated with the desire to eat more chocolate (due to high palatability) and self-imposed dietary restraint (due to personal and cultural beliefs), which limits chocolate intake before satiation is attained, making the “desire for chocolate” more salient (craving).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orosensory qualities of chocolate are uncontested determinants for chocolate liking, but ­methylxanthines also contribute to an acquired taste for chocolate liking.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEA and anandamide are unlikely to exert significant biological effects. Also, an increase in brain serotonin related to carbohydrates after chocolate consumption is unlikely to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnandamide-related compounds, salsolinol, THBCs, and magnesium cannot be discarded as ­effective psychoactive agents (see Table 31.1).",

Convincere le persone a seguire una dieta equilibrata, tuttavia, non e facile. Un uso adeguato del framing del messaggio puo rendere la comunicazione alimentare piu efficace, promuovendo scelte piu sane. Attraverso il framing infatti si possono mettere in risalto gli aspetti del messaggio che possono piu facilmente motivare le persone a cambiare abitudini consolidate. In una serie di studi sperimentali abbiamo indagato i fattori che possono influenzare l’efficacia della comunicazione alimentare rivolta agli anziani. E emerso che i messaggi possono essere persuasivi sia ponendo l’accento sulla dimensione della salute sia su quella del benessere, finora relativamente meno esplorata. In questo secondo caso, in particolare, una formulazione di tipo prefattuale (ad es. Se si mangia troppa carne, la qualita della vita peggiora) puo aumentare l’interesse e il coinvolgimento dei destinatari, cosi come la loro intenzione di seguire le raccomandazioni contenute nel messaggio.",

The food addiction hypothesis suggests that certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive-like response in vulnerable individuals in a similar manner to drugs of abuse. The incentive-sensitization theory of addiction proposes one explanation for why some people display greater susceptibility to addictive behaviours. One aspect of an addiction perspective that may not be easily integrated into existing eating treatments is the role the food plays in excess food consumption. The Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) for binge eating take the approach that there are no good foods or bad foods.",

The distressing act of vomiting becomes associated with that particular food, and it teaches the child a lesson it may never forget.

Le statut pondéral et les préférences alimentaires s’enracinent dans la période prénatale. L’obésité, une fois établie durant l’enfance, tend à persister tout au long de la vie. De la même façon, la formation des préférences et choix alimentaires apparaît largement acquise aux environs de 4 ans. L’ontogenèse du statut pondéral et des préférences alimentaires requiert une meilleure compréhension des facteurs qui contribuent au développement d’un régime obésogène. Nous examinons brièvement les données épidémiologiques et neurobiologiques qui suggèrent que l’excès alimentaire et les préférences pour le sucré et le gras relèvent de comportements addictifs, et que l’obésité relève d’un trouble addictif. Une préférence innée ou précoce pour le sucré, les propriétés apaisantes et opioïdergiques du goût sucré qui favorisent son ingestion, et la réticence à essayer des aliments non familiers, rendent très difficile toute modification du développement précoce des préférences pour des aliments sucrés, gras et riches en calories. Par ailleurs, le mode de vie moderne favorise la réduction des dépenses énergétiques et l’accroissement de la consommation de calories à travers l’offre constante et la promotion de produits alimentaires caloriques et agréables au goût. Cet environnement aggrave les facteurs de risque liés aux propriétés addictives des aliments. Des mesures de santé publique ont fait face avec succès à d’autres urgences sanitaires nationales et internationales d’importance comparable, et une approche basée sur une connaissance concertée et précise des faits pourrait être tout aussi efficace pour circonvenir l’obésité.",

I agree for the provided evidences. But some facts should be considered. Focusing on rice, there are many kinds of rice in Asia. The difference in basic properties and appearances can be detected. Whether different kinds of rice lead to the same reaction on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a question to be proved. Indeed, a recent paper showed different glycemic responses to different kinds of rice.2 Second, spicy seems to be a subjective term. The measurement of this sensation is very difficult. One might have different meaning on from the others.3 In addition, several food ingredients can provide taste and the action on GI of different ingredients should be further studied. In addition, the Asia usually eats a combined mixed food, rice with many other compositions. It is still questionable whether this style of eating can cause GI effect or not.",

      "abstract": "Although nausea and vomiting are diagnostic migraine symptoms, most patients can take tablets by mouth and a few say they can eat some food. This study was conducted to determine the proportion who could eat or drink, what was consumable and with what effect. One-hundred-and-nine migraineurs were asked what they could eat or drink at the beginning or height of their attacks; 59 could not take any food by mouth, but 50 could eat during the headache phase of their migraine attacks. Four ate normally, 5 took smaller amounts of their normal dietary intake, and 3 took lighter meals. Dry, carbohydrate foods were consumable by the remaining 38: a few had specific cravings, most stated the precise variety which, when eaten, reduced nausea, headache, other symptoms or length of attacks. Patients should therefore be encouraged to eat what they can tolerate, with their tablets taken as early as possible after the onset of attacks. Simultaneous nausea, tolerance or even craving for specific foods occur in other conditions, particularly high altitude headaches which share other features of migraine attacks. The observations in this paper support the notion that migraine is a central neuronal metabolic disturbance.",

Among the warning signs to look for are changes in patterns of sleeping or eating, weight loss, extreme fatigue, increased preoccupation with bodily functions, increased alcohol consumption, mood or behavioral changes, and sudden interest or disinterest in religion. Many of these signal depression. Most of the elderly who commit suicide do so not long after visiting a physician. Thus, responsibility for prevention lies not only with family and friends of the suicidal elderly person but with the physician as well.

      "abstract": "Several evidence-based lifestyle habits focusing on the composition, timing, and sequence of meals and on pre- and postmeal exercise can improve diabetes management. Consuming low-carbohydrate, balanced meals and eating most carbohydrates early in the day are helpful habits. Eating the protein and vegetable components of a meal first and consuming the carbohydrates 30 minutes later can moderate glucose levels. Postmeal glucose surges can be blunted without precipitating hypoglycemia with moderate exercise 30–60 minutes before the anticipated peak. Short-duration, high-intensity exercise could also be effective. Premeal exercise can improve insulin sensitivity but can also cause post-exertion glucose elevations. Moreover, high-intensity premeal exercise may precipitate delayed hypoglycemia in some people. Glycemia benefits can be enhanced by eating a light, balanced breakfast after premeal exercise.",

Similar situation can arise in cases of decreased food intake due to severe deliberate restriction or other factors like decreased appetite from cocaine. In these cases, salt free liquid intake may still be adequate. Such situations are conducive to the development of hyponatremia. Some of the solutes in diet, such as salt and protein, act as osmoles in urine. In these conditions, understanding the role played by solutes in diet and osmoles in urine is of vital importance for appropriate treatment of hyponatremia.",

      "abstract": "Intra-day changes in the levels of biochemistry parametersA n organism needs energy regularly for maintaining its life and functions.The main energy nutrients include carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins [1].Fasting and nonfasting statuses are the most interesting issues in the nutritional area [2].People mostly live in the nonfasting state during a normal 24-h cycle.Therefore, nonfasting metabolic panels may be a confident indicator of average biochemical parameter levels because the fasting state only consists after fasting for at least 8 h [3,4].At hospital laboratories, biochemical tests are generally performed on samples taken on fasting (preferably) between 08:00 and 10:00 [5].Due to the increased workload of hospitals since the 2000s, patients have to wait for hours for sample collection even if they arrive at hospitals early in the morn-ing [6].This situation might cause stress in patients.Due to reasons such as the difficulties of employees in getting permission from their jobs and the fast pace of life, patients visit hospitals to provide their samples for testing in the evening.Additionally, the number of blood samples taken during nonfasting may often be higher than the number of those taken during fasting.In another aspect, it might not be possible for children and infants, who constitute an important part of the population, to stay hungry for many hours.The increased average age of the population also increases the number of patients aged over 70 years and those with chronic diseases.Prolonged fasting may cause health problems in these people.In fact, the body's metabolism is in a state of nonfasting Objectives: People mostly live in the nonfasting state during a normal 24-h cycle.This study aims to compare the levels of 18 biochemical parameters during different hours of the day.Methods: A total of 18 biochemical tests of patients who visited outpatient clinics only once between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019, were evaluated at the Hatay Mustafa Kemal University (HMKU) Central Laboratory by using hospital database information.The tests are albumin (Alb), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), amylase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium (Ca), total cholesterol (TC), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine (Cr), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), inorganic phosphorus (Pi), iron (Fe), total protein (TP), triglyceride (TG), and lipase.The blood samples of the patient were divided into eight groups according to their collection time as follows: (a) 07:00-07:59, (b) 08:00-08:59, (c) 09:00-09:59, (d) 10:00-10:59, (e) 11:00-11:59, (f ) 12:00-13:59, (g) 14:00-14:59, and (h) 15:00-17:00.Results: A statistically significant difference was found between the groups in terms of all parameters except amylase, GGT, and TP (p<0.05).The effect size refers to the minimum amount of difference that is clinically significant.According to the effect size values, there was no significant difference between time groups in the following parameters: Alb, ALT, AST, Pi, Ca, TC, Cr, Fe, glucose, BUN, lipase, TG, ALP, HDL-C, and CK (ʈ<0.30). Conclusion:When considering all of the results, nonfasting screening would not only be acceptable but also make physiologic sense.",

To increase fluid palatability, drinks should be flavoured, according to the child's individual preference. The efficacy and safety of 'carbohydrate loading' have not been studied in children.",

Meanwhile, as the number of people losing weight increases, so do eating disorders because of incorrect and extreme weight loss methods. From an eating perspective, understanding food rewards is essential to knowing how to lose weight healthily. Food rewards include wanting and liking. The paper uses the literature review research method to summarize and discuss two opposite opinions about wanting and liking different or combined systems and the relationship between food rewards and eating control methods. The paper finds that wanting and liking are different systems. Understanding and identifying the difference between them reveals the appropriate eating control methods. People will realize they are hungry or they are greedy. People need to eat food when they feel hungry, but there is no need to eat food when they are greedy.",

      "abstract": "Could the simple reframing of physical activity‐‐as an exercise walk versus a scenic walk‐‐influence the eating behavior of nutritionists? We sought to determine whether compensation or reward behavior occurred outside of a lab, and to determine if compensation effects persist over time. 34 female nutritionists were asked to discuss a study where people who believed they were on an exercise walk ate more at lunch than those believing they were on a scenic walk. Two hours later the retreat participants took a similar walk. Their lunch selections were observed as well as subsequent afternoon snacking behavior. The data were collected and analyzed in 2014. People who believed they had been on a scenic walk consumed only 62% as many afternoon snack calories compared to those who believed they were on an exercise walk. Participants in the scenic condition also consumed more salad and vegetables during lunch, although there were no differences in the total amount of calories served or eaten across conditions. While exercisers might be immediately resistant in their lunchtime choices, they can be easily influenced later when eating snacks. This could provide useful insights or reframing that health professionals, fitness coaches, and everyday athletes could use to motivate themselves without the promise of a reward.",

The possibility of \"spontaneous recovery\" (overcoming an eating disorder without professional treatment or formal help) often faces scepticism on the part of professionals. Clearly, self-change is an underestimated pathway to recovery from an eating disorder, but open-minded clinicians can learn a lot from it. Active coping and making use of one's \"recovery capital\" are key features of self-change even if maintenance of change is associated with social support and positive life changes.",

Uzrocnik jedne od netoksicnih alergija na hranu je upravo alergen gluten. Gluten je bjelancevina koja se nalazi u psenicnim proizvodima poput psenice, raži, jecma i svim njihovim prerađevinama. Kod pojedinih ljudi postoji genetska sklonost nepodnosenja glutena. Ta itolerancija na gluten izaziva ne samo alergijske reakcije kod ljudi vec i bolest crijeva, odnosno celijakiju. Kod osoba sa celijakijom ingestija glutena nadražuje njihovu crijevnu sluznicu, sto dovodi do poremecaja apsorpcije hranjivih tvari i vode u organizmu. Osobe koje imaju itoleranciju na gluten ili su izrazito osjetljive na konzumaciju hrane koja sadrži gluten, primorane su usvojiti bezglutensku prehanu kao nacin života. Takva vrsta prehrane ukljucuje konzumaciju hrane koja prirodno ne sadrži gluten, te konzumaciju proizvoda deklariranih kao “gluten free”, odnosno bez glutena. Uz razvoj prehrambene industrije i uslijed porasta broja oboljelih od celijakije, te sve vecim porastom broja osoba s razvijenom intolerancijom ili osjetljivosti na gluten, sve je i veci broj proizvođaca koji se okrece proizvodnji bezglutenskih proizvoda. Tržiste je preplavljeno raznolikim proizvodima koji su na svojim ambalažama deklarirani kao “gluten free”. Kako bi taj isti proizvod mogao biti deklairan kao proizvod bez glutena on mora udovoljiti propisanim uvjetima. Od zakonskih propisa primjenjuju se Uredba Komisije (EU) br.828/2014 o zahtjevima za informiranje potrosaca o odustnosti ili smanjenju prisutnosti glutena u hrani, te Zakon o informiranju potrosaca o hrani (NN br. 56/13, 14/14, 56/16, 32/19). Cilj ovog rada je utvrditi prisutnost alergena glutena u skupini hrane koja deklarira pristutnost glutena u visim kolicinama ili se deklarira kao proizvod bezglutenske hrane, “gluten free”. Analiza je provedena imunoenzimatskom tehnikom (ELISA), te su dobiveni rezultati uspoređeni sa deklariranom kolicinim glutena na deklaraciji proizvoda.",

      "title": "[Points in nutritional management of the elderly].",
      "abstract": "The most important aim of nutritional management in the elderly is to maintain the strength of skeletal muscle and ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). The total energy expenditure (TEE) decreases with age and accelerates after the age of 65 years. Impaired glucose tolerance becomes progressively more common with advancing age. On the other hand, healthy elderly people have a capacity similar to that of healthy young people to clear and oxidize a triacylglycerol load. Consequently, fat appears to be a more suitable fuel for the elderly than glucose. It is recommended that the elderly have a higher protein intake compared with young adults to maintain skeletal muscle. The TEE of the elderly is 20-25 kcal/kg/day, and the recommended daily allowance of protein is 1.0-12 g/kg/day. Furthermore, the ratio of fat in nonprotein calories should be the same as that for young adults. Eating fruit and vegetables can prevent the development of cancer. However, most elderly individuals do not take the time to prepare and eat fruit and vegetables regularly. Elderly people whose ability to perform ADL is impaired should undergo rehabilitation. Unnecessary rest should be avoided during inpatient rehabilitation. Impairment of the ability to perform ADL due to iatrogenic factors or an inappropriate understanding of the elderly metabolism must be avoided.",

      "title": "Preference for High-Fat Food in Animals",
      "abstract": "The phenomenon of animals preferring high-fat foods has been accepted as natural behavior. Animals are equipped with fat not only for energy storage, but also for regulation of body temperature and as a source of many hormones. It is reasonable that animals eat and store fat based on physiological demands. On the other hand, eating an excessive amount of fat causes many metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease. Reflecting the current health situation in industrialized nations, fat studies are focused on why we overeat high-fat foods and how we can cope with accumulating body fat. Ironically, many tasty and palatable foods such as snack foods, ice cream, donuts, and so on, contain large amounts of fat. The high palatability of fatty foods has been reported in many articles. Animals, including humans, show a hedonic preference for fat that increases with fat concentration (Drewnowski and Greenwood, 1983; Imaizumi et al., 2000a). When it comes to dietary fat, we cannot regulate proper calorie intake, and so we consume more calories than we physiologically need. In a long-term drinking test for corn oil in mice, the mice continued to prefer corn oil and ingested excess calories beyond their physiological needs (Takeda et al., 2001a).Why are fatty foods so tasty? Why do we lose our desire to balance calorie intake when ingesting fat? Researchers are increasingly interested in studying the palatable features of fat to address these simple questions. Accumulating data suggest that the high palatability of fat can be attributed to many factors, including its texture (Rolls et al., 2003; De Araujo and Rolls, 2004; Kadohisa et al., 2005), flavor (Ramirez, 1993; Kinney and Antill, 1996), taste (Gilbertson et al., 1997; Gilbertson, 1998; Abumrad, 2005; Laugerette et al., 2005; Matsumura et al., 2007), and postingestive effect (Sclafani and Vigorito, 1987; Suzuki et al., 2003).In this chapter, we discuss a wide range of physiological responses to fat, from fat recognition on the tongue to laboratory animal behavior in response to fat.",

El equilibrio energetico es alcanzado cuando la cantidad de energia ingerida (por ejemplo, todas las comidas y bebidas consumidas) equiparan la energia gastada en todo el dia. Tu gasto de energia se compone de tres partes: 1) tu gasto energetico de reposo, o la cantidad de energia que usarias si permanecieras acostada; 2) tu gasto energetico proveniente las actividades diarias normales, tales como caminar hasta la parada de bus u ocuparse de las tareas del hogar; y 3) tu gasto energetico del ejercicio, tal como salir a correr, bailar, o nadar. Este ultimo componente generalmente es el mas variable entre las personas, e individuos que a traves del ejercicio regular consumen muchas mas energias que una persona sedentaria. Por tanto, estar fisicamente activa y participar en algun deporte requiere que alcances niveles mas altos de ingesta energetica para prevenir un deficit energetico.",

      "title": "Updating the Definition of the Alcohol Hangover",
      "abstract": "In 2016, the Alcohol Hangover Research Group defined the alcohol hangover as \"the combination of mental and physical symptoms experienced the day after a single episode of heavy drinking, starting when blood alcohol concentration (BAC) approaches zero\". In the light of new findings and evidence, we carefully reviewed the different components of that definition. Several studies demonstrated that alcohol hangovers are not limited to heavy drinking occasions. Instead, data from both student and non-student samples revealed that at a group level, alcohol hangover may occur at much lower BAC levels than previously thought. Regression analysis further revealed that for individual drinkers, the occurrence of hangovers is more likely when subjects consume more alcohol than they usually do. However, hangovers may also occur at a drinker's usual BAC, and in some cases even at lower BAC (e.g. in case of illness). We also carefully reviewed and modified other parts of the definition. Finally, hangovers are not necessarily limited to the 'next day'. They can start at any time of day or night, whenever BAC approaches zero after a single dinking occasion. This may also be on the same day as the drinking occasion (e.g. when drinking in, or until the morning and subsequently having a hangover in the afternoon or evening). To better reflect the new insights and sharpen the description of the concept, we hereby propose to update the definition of the alcohol hangover as follows: \"The alcohol hangover refers to the combination of negative mental and physical symptoms which can be experienced after a single episode of alcohol consumption, starting when blood alcohol concentration (BAC) approaches zero\", and recommend to use this new definition in future hangover research.",

      "abstract": "La variete de l'offre alimentaire actuelle incite a l'hyperphagie qui est en partie responsable de la prise de poids corporel. Reduire la consommation est ainsi devenu une contrainte pour une certaine partie de la population. Dans ce contexte, les fibres, qui sont des glucides non-digestibles dans l'intestin grele, permettent de reduire la prise alimentaire, d'attenuer les sensations de faim et/ou d'augmenter les sensations de satiete. Cependant, les mecanismes comportementaux, peripheriques et centraux a l'origine de ces effets sont mal-connus. Leur capacite a maintenir cet effet anorexigene en presence d'autres nutriments comme les lipides et les proteines a egalement ete tres peu etudiee.L'etude de ces mecanismes est l'objet de cette these. Des fibres telles que la gomme de guar (GG) fortement viscosifiante et le fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) tres fermentescible ont ete administrees, en debut de journee, aux souris sous forme de solution a raison de 700 µL et a une dose de 3%, 5% et 14% via un gavage intra-gastrique. Cette etude a montre que les solutions fortement visqueuses, notamment le GG 5% et le melange GG-FOS 14% etaient les seules capables d'exercer un effet anorexigene a court terme comparees aux solutions moins visqueuses comme l'eau, le GG 3%, le FOS 14% et les solutions de nutriments comme les proteines (peptides de caseine) et les lipides (huile de colza) qui fournissent 10% de l'ingere calorique quotidien des animaux (1.2 kcal). Pour le cas du melange visqueux GG-FOS 14%, la baisse de la prise alimentaire est due au rassasiement (reduction de 50% de la taille et de la duree du repas dans les 30 premieres minutes post-ingestion). Cette baisse, non compensee jusqu'a la fin de la journee, n'est pas associee a une aversion gustative conditionnee. Ce rassasiement est du a l'integration au niveau du centre de controle de la taille du repas (NTS), des signaux vagaux de distension gastrique et de la cholecystokinine (CCK). Quand les fibres visqueuses GG 5% et GG-FOS 14% sont melangees avec des proteines, elles perdent leur effet anorexigene. L'action de les melanger avec les lipides a par contre montre que seul le melange visqueux GG-FOS 14% est capable d'exercer un effet anorexigene. L'effet anorexigene du melange lipide et GG-FOS 14% est du au niveau de chaque repas aux signaux mecaniques gastriques et CCK vagaux, et a l'axe PYY- systeme melanocortique hypothalamique pour le maintien de l'effet sur la journee.En conclusion, les fibres visqueuses sont des nutriments qui peuvent participer au controle de la prise alimentaire en stimulant le rassasiement. Elles sont capables de maintenir cet effet en milieu lipidique. Elles pourraient ainsi etre ajoutees aux aliments riches en lipides pour mieux controler la prise alimentaire et le poids corporel.",

However, restrictive or imbalanced vegetarian diets may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly during periods of high metabolic demand. Some micronutrients are at greater risk of being deficient, since they are found in animal products, which are scarcely consumed. Added to this lower intake, their absorption may be affected by the high contents of phytates, oxalates and fiber which distinguish these diets. Health professionals should be informed about the benefits and potential risks of being vegetarian in order to design a well-balanced nutritional plan, as well as using fortified foods or specific micronutrient supplements to avoid deficiencies.",

      "abstract": "The evidence for food's addictive properties is steadily growing. In addition to clinical and evolutionary plausibility, the possibility of addiction to food is supported by animal model research and increasingly by research with humans. Much as classic drugs of abuse \"hijack\" the brain, accumulating evidence with food suggests a similar impact, but with weaker effects. Although neurobiological evidence for food addiction is compelling, dependence as conceptualized with respect to alcohol and other drugs of abuse is fundamentally a behavioral disorder. Thus, we review the current state of food addiction research in the context of each of the diagnostic criterion for dependence (ie, tolerance, withdrawal, loss of control) and briefly explore other relevant addiction topics such as expectancies, reinforcement, and incentive salience. There is substantial evidence that some people lose control over their food consumption, suffer from repeated failed attempts to reduce their intake, and are unable to abstain from certain types of food or reduce consumption in the face of negative consequences. Although there is some evidence for other dependence criterion, further research is needed to examine tolerance and withdrawal to high-fat sweets, time spent in obtaining, using, and recovering from excess food consumption and the degree to which important activities are given up due to overconsumption. As science continues forward and both the public and elected leaders become aware that food may trigger an addictive process, this information will likely be used to inform policy. Thus, researchers need to carefully consider the implications of their work and the way in which the results may be interpreted.",

      "title": "Carbohydrates and fat for training and recovery",
      "abstract": "Abstract An important goal of the athlete's everyday diet is to provide the muscle with substrates to fuel the training programme that will achieve optimal adaptation for performance enhancements. In reviewing the scientific literature on post-exercise glycogen storage since 1991, the following guidelines for the training diet are proposed. Athletes should aim to achieve carbohydrate intakes to meet the fuel requirements of their training programme and to optimize restoration of muscle glycogen stores between workouts. General recommendations can be provided, preferably in terms of grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of the athlete's body mass, but should be fine-tuned with individual consideration of total energy needs, specific training needs and feedback from training performance. It is valuable to choose nutrient-rich carbohydrate foods and to add other foods to recovery meals and snacks to provide a good source of protein and other nutrients. These nutrients may assist in other recovery processes and, in the case of protein, may promote additional glycogen recovery when carbohydrate intake is suboptimal or when frequent snacking is not possible. When the period between exercise sessions is <8 h, the athlete should begin carbohydrate intake as soon as practical after the first workout to maximize the effective recovery time between sessions. There may be some advantages in meeting carbohydrate intake targets as a series of snacks during the early recovery phase, but during longer recovery periods (24 h) the athlete should organize the pattern and timing of carbohydrate-rich meals and snacks according to what is practical and comfortable for their individual situation. Carbohydrate-rich foods with a moderate to high glycaemic index provide a readily available source of carbohydrate for muscle glycogen synthesis, and should be the major carbohydrate choices in recovery meals. Although there is new interest in the recovery of intramuscular triglyceride stores between training sessions, there is no evidence that diets which are high in fat and restricted in carbohydrate enhance training.

Vitamin C intakes of nearly 80 per cent of respondents met or exceeded Recommended Daily Dietary Allowances. Fourteen per cent or fewer appeared to have inadequate vitamin C intake. Vitamin C supplements were taken daily by 29 per cent, occasionally by 21 per cent. Most respondents obtained 100 mg or less of vitamin C daily; 2 per cent had more than 2000 mg. Proportionately, more women than men took vitamin C pills daily. Men aged 16 to 44 were the most likely to have neither vitamin C foods nor pills. Persons 45 years and older tended to take vitamin C pills daily, younger persons to take them occasionally. Respondents who did not eat breakfast or who smoked cigarettes had lower vitamin C intakes. People in poor health took more vitamin C than those in good health. Health status may have influenced vitamin C intake rather than vitamin C intake influencing health status.",

There is, however, no information which explains why some persons are contented with an intake equal to their energy output while others choose an excessive or a deficient intake of food. It is possible that the sensation of satiety is the controlling factor in making this choice. The physiologic reactions which are the components of this sensation have not been fully established. The production of heat resulting from the ingestion of food is well known, and it is conceivable that the sudden change in the rate of production of heat by the body during a meal may bear some relation to the sensation of satiety. The disposition of the heat, particularly its dissipation, may be of importance in this relationship. One factor of the dissipation of heat is reflected in the changes",

Such placebo-like effects are typically attributed to conditioning, motivation, or expectations about product efficacy. The present research shows such effects can also occur because, under some conditions, people are more prone to underestimate the time to onset of products they have used in the past. These recollections of too short a time to onset alter people’s experience of products and cause them to report more rapid effects. Participants who were led to believe there was a strong causal link between having consumed a product and improved performance on a task recalled that less time elapsed before they experienced an effect. In subsequent consumption, they felt comfortable using the product later in time, started working on a similar task earlier upon use, experienced the product’s effect sooner, and were less inclined to switch to competing products.",

      "title": "SHAREABLE RESOURCE",
      "abstract": "THE NOSE KNOWS. Having mild body odor, on occasion, is normal. Excessive body odor, however, can lead to several negative outcomes. For example, not only can it be a source of considerable discomfort for others, it also can be very embarrassing for the person who is experiencing this unpleasant occurrence. NOT THE WHOLE STORY. Although poor personal hygiene typically is the primary contributor to body odor, there can be other causes as well, including a nutrient deficiency, gastrointestinal problems, medical conditions, and the presence of certain toxins in the body. Individuals who do not change their clothes regularly or who smoke also are very likely to have a disagreeable body odor. UNWARRANTED BLAME. An unpleasant body odor and sweat seem to go hand-in-hand. Sweating does not cause body odor, however. In reality, sweat is almost totally odorless. Rather, the pungent smell is a byproduct of bacteria that are growing in and on the body — bacteria that thrive in a warm, moist environment, such as in the presence of sweat. MALODOROUS BREATH. In an attempt to neutralize any evidence of unwanted odors, people often brush their teeth or reach for a mint after eating well-known pungent foods, such as garlic, onions, and coffee. These efforts, unfortunately, often are in vain. In reality, aromatic foods can permeate the skin and subsequently trigger unwanted odors, which can persist for up to 24 hours. JUST LIKE A FINGERPRINT. Everyone has a distinct odor. Some scientists refer to it as a person’s odorprint. This odor type is determined, in part, by an individual’s genes. Odor type information is transmitted through body fluids, such as sweat and urine. This factor is why dogs can track fugitives on the run and why perfume may smell slightly different on one person than it does on another. THE SMELL OF AGE. It’s not clear why body odor may change as people age, but often it does. One plausible explanation for such an occurrence involves the fact that body odors originate from an interaction between the secretions of the body’s skin glands and bacteria that are present on the skin. As a person ages, the activity of different types of skin glands changes, thereby contributing to the possible existence of “old people’s smell.” UNDERARM UPHEAVAL. Certain areas of the body, including the underarms, contain a specific type of sweat gland (i.e., apocrine) that is responsible for a person having a problem with body odor. These glands, also known as scent glands, expel a secretion that subsequently breaks down, leading to the production of several substances, such as ammonia, which can cause offensive underarm odor. FLUSHING THE SYSTEM. The world is full of toxins. When toxins accumulate in the body over a long time, unwanted body odor can result. One of the best ways to remove these toxins is to exercise on a regular basis. When people exercise, they sweat, which helps to detoxify the body by expelling toxins through perspiration. THE THINKING-STINKING CONNECTION. Body odor can be more than a purely physical problem. In fact, mental factors can contribute to this issue, as well. Stress, anxiety, and depression, for example, can lead to unwanted body odor. In that regard, trying to achieve moments of peace and serenity can be a viable antidote for such a situation. HEALTH ALERT. Everyone has their own unique smell. Some types of body odor, however, may be an indication of the presence of certain health problems. For example, sweat that smells like bleach may be a sign of a liver or kidney disease. In turn, body odor that has a fruity smell may point to diabetes. Furthermore, fish-like body odor may be an inkling of a rare genetic disorder called trimethylaminuria.",

Often, children lose their food intolerances as they mature. Food allergies and intolerances differ in that a food allergy involves the immune system, whereas food intolerance is restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. Lactose intolerance is an example of the latter, whereas gluten-induced enteropathy is an example of the former. Treatment of both is similar: exclusion of the troublesome food component.",

      "title": "A review of the need for biofortified foods to combat malnutrition",
      "abstract": "Urbanization has led to increased consumption of industrially produced foods, including in developing countries. Many countries are now addressing micronutrient malnutrition through the use of fortified foods, reaching a larger portion of their population. Poverty has an impact on populations that are essentially deficient in adequate micronutrients. Therefore, it is common practice to include multiple forms of micronutrients. It is often possible to fortify foods with micronutrients. In most cases, adding one or more micronutrients to foods does not significantly increase the cost. In most cases, if the technology is available and the distribution system is appropriate, reinforcement is more cost-effective than other strategies. By consuming fortified foods regularly and frequently, dietary supplements will be more effective in maintaining nutrient reserves than taking supplements intermittently. Adding nutrients to food helps reduce the incidence of undernutrition problems, as well as problems caused by seasonal fluctuations in food supply and bad habits. This will benefit children and pregnant women who need adequate nutrient stores during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as well as pregnant women who need a steady supply of micronutrients for growth and development. Fortification is beneficial for postpartum women and their babies because it raises the vitamin content in breast milk and reduces their nutritional needs. Fortification of widely consumed and widely distributed foods not only improves the nutritional status of large segments of the population, but also serves other purposes. This review is intended to highlight the importance of using fortified foods to effectively combat malnutrition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Over the years, we have heard numerous discussions and views on the nutritional plans for the bodybuilding and fitness practitioner. The most controversial meal of the day is with no doubt the dinner. Supporters of the principle according to which dinner should be eliminated and the last meal of the day should be taken in the afternoon, support their theory with solid arguments, at least theoretically. The others, more tolerant, recommend that dinner is taken at least one hour before going to bed and the latter bring relevant counterarguments to support their opinion. It is no less true that what, how much and when you are eating in the evening is essential in achieving the set goals. For example, for someone interested in increasing body weight and muscle, dinner and its caloric intake is particularly important. On the opposite end are those who want to lose weight and even more, want to keep their muscle. They will definitely not try to get more calories, but will be interested in where these calories come from.",

Individuals wishing to lose weight by running must run more than 9 miles a week for as much as a year to achieve weight loss. The muscle glycogen content is a limiting factor in the stamina required to run regularly for more than one and half hours. The levels necessary for endurance running can be achieved and maintained by a daily carbohydrate intake of 500 g a day. During marathon runs it is essential to drink water at regular intervals along with some glucose.",

This chapter discusses the impact of foods on human health and wellbeing, as well as the events that occur when foods pass through our gastrointestinal tracts and are absorbed by our bodies. It then considers the evolution of the human gastrointestinal tract and whether we were designed to eat meat or not. The macronutrient and micronutrient compositions of omnivore and meat-free diets are different, which can have important nutritional and health implications. The role of different macronutrients (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates), micronutrients (iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin B12, vitamin D), omega-3 fatty acids, dietary fibers, and nutraceuticals on human health and wellbeing is therefore discussed. It is often assumed that a plant-based diet is better for our health, but this depends on the types and amounts of foods we eat. A meat-free diet may be more or less healthy than an omnivore one depending on whether you are eating fruit, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains or eating plant-based burgers, French fries, cookies, and potato chips. The concept of unhealthful and healthful plant-based diets is therefore introduced.",

      "title": "High-carbohydrate versus high-fat diets in endurance sports",
      "abstract": "High-carbohydrate diets have been commonplace in the athletic population for many years but more recently high-fat diets have gained popularity. It is becoming more and more clear that in trained athletes extreme dietary and training regimes are not necessary to achieve optimal muscle glycogen stores. With adequate carbohydrate intake (7-10 g.kg -1 body mass per day) muscle glycogen stores can be returned to normal resting levels (to 350-800 mmol.kg -1 dry weight muscle) within 24 hours. Normalized stores appear adequate for the fuel needs of events of less than 90 minutes in duration and supercompensated glycogen levels do not seem to enhance the performance of these events. Optimal glycogen stores will typically postpone fatigue and extend the duration of steady state exercise by ∼20%, and improve performance over a set distance or workload by 2-3%. Extremely high-carbohydrate intakes are not necessary to achieve this and may result in increased risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. High-fat diets can result in increased fat oxidation after 5 days on a high-fat diet which is only partly explained by substrate availability. Adaptations at the muscular level that result in changes in substrate utilization in response to a diet may also occur after 5 days. However, high-fat diets will reduce muscle and liver glycogen concentrations and therefore performance may be reduced. The potential benefits of an adaptation period to a high-fat diet followed by a period of carbo-loading are not clear but the vast majority of studies reports no effect on performance. Therefore, there is currently very little or no evidence to support the use of high-fat diets and long term health effects of such diets in athletes are unknown. A diet containing 7-10 g.kg -1 body mass per day of carbohydrate, 10-15 energy percent from protein and the remainder from fat seems a good compromise that will allow endurance athletes to train hard and perform well.",

Individuals who suppressed their thoughts consumed more and achieved a higher blood alcohol content than those who did arithmetic. The groups did not differ in mood, arousal, or frustration. Individuals higher in trait temptation to drink consumed more after suppressing their thoughts relative to those lower in trait temptation.

Implementing healthy weight requires a further distortion (e.g. subsidy on other goods), which may render the tax on unhealthy food inferior to the option of not taxing the individual at all. In addition, with heterogeneous individuals the optimal uniform paternalistic tax may have the negative side effect of rendering otherwise healthy individuals underweight.",

      "abstract": "Werknemers die lang achtereen zitten zonder tussentijds te bewegen, hebben een grotere kans op ernstige chronische ziekten zoals diabetes type II en op overgewicht. Het inlassen van Beweegmomentjes in het werk is daarom een nieuw advies van TNO en het Nederlands Instituut voor Sport en Bewegen (NISB) voor werknemers die tijdens hun werk langdurig zitten. Wat zijn Beweegmomentjes? Staand telefoneren bijvoorbeeld, of naar een collega lopen in plaats van hem of haar te mailen. Staand of wandelend lunchen in plaats van zittend of gaan staan als een collega aan je bureau komt om even te overleggen. Naast te weinig sporten en bewegen, vormt ook langdurig zitten een risico op gezondheidsklachten voor de ruim 3 miljoen mensen in Nederland met een ‘zittend’ beroep. Kantoormedewerkers, chauffeurs, maar bijvoorbeeld ook laboranten. Ook al sporten en bewegen deze mensen misschien voldoende in hun vrije tijd, er is toch een risico op gezondheidsklachten als de functie of het beroep periodes van langdurig zitten omvat die zij niet regelmatig onderbreken. Boodschap is: iedereen die door de dag heen regelmatig langer dan een half uur achter elkaar zit, is gebaat bij het inlassen van Beweegmomentjes. Uit de eerste studies komt een voorlopige vuistregel: onderbreek het zitten een keer per half uur voor minimaal twee minuten. Het belangrijkste daarbij is opstaan en de benen in actie brengen. Het effect van Beweegmomentjes. Werknemers die niet lang achtereen zitten of het zitten regelmatig onderbreken hebben een kleinere kans op ernstige chronische ziekten zoals diabetes type II (suikerziekte) en op overgewicht. Beweegmomentjes kunnen dus bijdragen aan een betere gezondheid! Benieuwd of u voldoende beweegt op het werk: doe de test.",

      "abstract": "Le concept d’addiction à l’alimentation a été récemment proposé en appliquant les critères diagnostiques DSM de dépendance à une substance dans le champ de l’alimentation . Selon ces auteurs, il est possible de développer vis-à-vis de l’alimentation (et notamment vis-à-vis de certains aliments riches en graisse ou en sucre) une relation de dépendance similaire aux autres addictions. L’intérêt de ce concept est de pouvoir identifier un sous-groupe plus homogène de patients pour lesquels il serait possible de proposer des stratégies thérapeutiques plus ciblées. Bien qu’il ne soit pas démontré que l’addiction à l’alimentation mène nécessairement à l’obésité, la plupart des travaux sur l’addiction à l’alimentation ont été réalisés chez des patients obèses car ce trouble y est plus fréquent qu’en population générale. Ainsi, l’addiction à l’alimentation (mesurée à l’aide de la Yale Food Addiction Scale ) était plus fréquente chez certains patients obèses : patients célibataires, présentant certaines caractéristiques psychopathologiques (symptômes de dépression, de TDAH, de stress post-traumatique, antécédent de traumatisme physique ou sexuel dans l’enfance, difficultés de régulation émotionnelle) et ayant des altérations du circuit opioïde et du système de la récompense . L’addiction à l’alimentation était plus fréquente chez les individus consommant plus fréquemment et en plus grande quantité des aliments riches en graisse, à fort index glycémique ou industriels, mais n’était pas associée à la sévérité de l’obésité. Ces résultats soulignent la pertinence de considérer l’addiction à l’alimentation comme une addiction à part entière ainsi que l’intérêt de proposer à ces patients des prises en charge classiquement efficaces en addictologie (entretiens motivationnels, prévention de la rechute, psychothérapies, traitements médicamenteux ciblant les systèmes neurobiologiques impliqués dans les addictions, voire traitements de substitution, prévention et politique de réduction des risques) .",

However, in many situations clients are unable to meet their nutritional requirements by food alone and nutritional supplement products are then extremely useful. The nutritional status of all those receiving nutritional support should be monitored regularly; as the client's nutritional status improves, his/her intake of these products may need to be reduced or stopped.

      "abstract": "En las ultimas decadas ha adquirido especial relevancia, entre los jovenes y adolescentes, el patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol, el cual presenta alta prevalencia en la mayoria de los paises occidentales. En la literatura anglosajona se denomina binge drinking (BD) y se caracteriza por la ingesta de grandes cantidades de alcohol en un corto periodo de tiempo, normalmente el fin de semana, que suele llevar a la embriaguez, y alternando periodos de abstinencia entre los episodios de consumo intensivo. El consumo intensivo de alcohol (CIA) parece resultar significativamente mas danino para el cerebro que su consumo regular, y mayores aun son las implicaciones al tratarse de poblacion juvenil. El cortex prefrontal, soporte neuronal de los procesos ejecutivos y de los rasgos de personalidad, parece resultar especialmente afectado por el consumo de alcohol. Aspectos como la desinhibicion o la impulsividad, plausiblemente mediado por la actividad neuronal en los circuitos prefrontales se han considerado como una consecuencia habitual del consumo de alcohol; sin embargo esta misma impulsividad puede representar un indicador de vulnerabilidad para la adiccion al alcohol y otras sustancias. El objetivo general de este estudio es determinar las relaciones existentes entre el consumo intensivo de alcohol en jovenes y su actividad prefrontal, estimada a partir de su rendimiento neuropsicologico y su perfil de personalidad. Los resultados obtenidos nos permiten establecer las siguientes conclusiones: Existen diferencias en el perfil de personalidad entre los jovenes CIA y No CIA. El perfil de personalidad de los sujetos CIA permite explicar aspectos relacionados con el consumo de alcohol. De este perfil, el factor desinhibicion es el que mejor explica estas conductas. El mayor consumo de alcohol se asocia con mas errores atencionales y disminucion de la velocidad de procesamiento, pero no con menor rendimiento en memoria de trabajo u otras funciones ejecutivas. Existe asociacion entre el perfil de personalidad CIA y el rendimiento neuropsicologico. El perfil de personalidad predice en mayor grado que el rendimiento en las pruebas neuropsicologicas el consumo de alcohol al cabo de dos anos. El mantenimiento del patron CIA implica la persistencia de diferencias de rendimiento en tareas de control atencional y velocidad de procesamiento, sensibles al funcionamiento prefrontal.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a spiraling and debilitating condition that has severe social and economic consequences for the individual and society. Recently, much work has examined the relationship between drug addiction and the circadian timing system. The master circadian pacemaker directs a daily temporal rhythm throughout the brain and body including the consumption of alcohol. Many drugs, including alcohol, can have myriad effects at different times of day. Conversely, alcohol can alter circadian physiology at multiple levels within the system. Few studies, however, have examined the role that the timing of chronic drug exposure and withdrawal plays in the development and maintenance of drug addiction. Alcohol use, for example, follows a circadian pattern with consumption peaking in the early evening in non-dependent individuals and withdrawal likely occurring late at night. In the transition to dependence, however, craving and consumption expand earlier into the day. What consequences this altered timing of drug use plays in the physiological and psychological consequences of drug addiction remains to be seen. Herein, we specifically examine if: 1) controlling for time of day in alcohol exposure/withdrawal can alter the development of physical dependence, 2) the development of psychological dependence, and 3) if time of day can become a conditioned environmental cue that triggers craving and behavioral sensitization in an amphetamine model of addiction",

This kind of flour has more nutrients and fiber, along with much less processing. In order to help children meet their optimal Synogut Reviews nutritional needs, try to give meals and snacks on a regular schedule. This helps their bodies to know when to expect the next meal, and regulates their hunger signals. Also, if they fill up on snacks just before mealtimes, they will not be hungry for the \"real\" foods at that meal. If you want to give your children the best nutrion possible, and they seem to be picky about it, trying making it fun. Cut food into fun shapes or provide vegetables with a favorite dip. This will make your child see that good food can be just as much fun as junk food. Saturated fat consumption is strongly linked to metabolic syndrome, which is the name for the constellation of symptoms that includes, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and high blood cholesterol. In order to reduce your consumption of saturated fat, you should use liquid plant oils, such as olive or peanut oil when possible, for frying, as well as, reducing the consumption of fatty foods in general. If you are worried about the dark circles around your eyes, you should try to eat healthier. If you eat more healthily, your complexion will clear up and the dark rings around your eyes and puffiness will improve. Start right now to make healthy choices. High fructose corn syrup, sugar, and other forms of carbohydrates are all essentially the same when it comes to nutrition. They might react in a different manner with the body, diffusing sugar faster, but they all carry similar calorie contents and behave like sugars. Starches like bread and pasta provide a large portion of carbohydrates which allows you to store up energy in fat cells. Moderation is the key to nutrition. An innutritious diet is often caused by overindulgence in what would otherwise be good things. So, before you sit down to your next meal or pick up another snack, think about how to moderate your eating. Don't eat too much of any one food. A moderated, balanced diet is the most nutritious diet. You probably just learned a lot about nutrition: which of these tips are you going to adopt? If you are still unsure of what to do, you should give healthy nutrition a chance by watching your diet for a few weeks. The results should convince you that watching what you eat is good for you. https://www.metrotimes.com/sponsored/synogut-reviews-can-this-prebiotic-supplement-improve-healthy-digestion-safe-ingredients-customer-reviews-28133665",

      "abstract": "Improving the overweight nutritional management is important because of the high obesity prevalence in modern societies. The overweight nutritional management has the aim of improving patient’s feeding and body weight through a feeding system that ease diet adherence and energy intake control. Nutritional concepts that have proven to have an impact on energy balance such as energy density and portion size of foods, among others, should be basic for the overweight nutritional management. Moreover, the functional management of foods and eating patterns may ease the body weight control, for example, dairy products consumption may accelerate body weight loss; consuming foods high in protein as meat, fish, egg, and so on, increase satiety and may improve diet adherence; vegetables consumption results in a decreasing of energy density and an increasing of satiety; non-saturated fat consumption is related to less body weight gain; regulating foods that could increase energy intake easily such as the bread, fruit and fat groups may help to settle an hypocaloric intake. Moreover, it is suggested to restrict caloric soft drinks and junkie food due to their obesogenic qualities. On the contrary, it is also recommended to use body fat as indicator of energy balance during the nutritional management due to the fact that body weight may not offer a precise lecture of the changes of corporal tissues in short periods of time.",

In many cases the object of these restrictions is very evidently that of reserving the best food for the elder men and women, but in others it is difficult to assign any adequate reason. In some instances it is quite possible that, for example, a woman, while bearing a child, may once have eaten some special food and have, afterwards, been seriously ill. That, in itself, would be quite enough reason for a restriction to be placed on that particular food in regard to all women in the same condition.",

      "abstract": "A autoimagem corporal consiste na representação mental sobre seu próprio corpo e que, quando de difere da idealizada, gera insatisfação. Considerando os padrões de beleza ideal estabelecidos pela mídia, frequentemente indivíduos sofrem de uma insatisfação excessiva, o que pode levar a distorção da autoimagem e transtornos alimentares. Diante disso, o presente estudo buscou realizar um panorama sobre a influência das mídias sociais na autoimagem corporal e na ocorrência de transtornos alimentares, destacando o papel do nutricionista nesses casos. Pode-se observar que as mídias sociais possuem impacto direto na insatisfação corporal, repassando o corpo magro como sinônimo de status, sucesso e sensualidade, com maior destaque para as redes sociais. Nesse cenário, as mais atingidas são as mulheres, principalmente as adolescentes, que passam por mudanças corporais nesse período, ficam mais expostas as mídias e são mais influenciáveis. Casos de transtornos alimentares, como anorexia e bulimia nervosa, podem ser desenvolvidos e constantemente são acompanhados por uma autoimagem distorcida. Por fim, foi possível identificar que o nutricionista, dentro de uma equipe multidisciplinar de tratamento, possui papel fundamental, pois pode atuar tanto no diagnóstico, ao verificar alterações, quanto no tratamento em si, através da reeducação alimentar e outras metodologias, sendo essencial o conhecimento específico do tema.",

As many as 11% of elderly persons using multiple drugs report taste aberrations. The main danger of taste decline and disturbance in the old is food-anhedonia, causing loss of body weight via decreased calorie and nutrient intake.To overview drug related taste disturbances emphasizing the elderly.Review of Hebrew and English medical literature.Taste-disturbances can be divided into hypogeusia [diminished sense of taste], ageusia [absence of taste], and the 2 types of dysgeusia [taste distortion]: aliageusia [food related] and phantogeusia [taste illusions]. The mechanisms by which drugs impair taste are numerous, and may be related to drug chemical structure. The treatment of taste disturbances is empiric and has limited success. Treatments include: shifting drugs within the same class, zinc replacement (proven to enhance taste sensation for sweet, bitter and salty flavors), palliative measures (use of mints, sugarless chewing-gums, and bicarbonate mouthwashes), niacin and vitamin A ameliorate hypo and dysgeusia.Disturbed taste sensation is common among the elderly, and should be considered whenever unexplained nutritional decline is present. Scrupulous drug screening is mandatory, and other intervention modalities can be beneficial.",

Prick skin testings with available food allergens only revealed a positive reaction to a 1:10 w/v of wheat flour extract. A diagnosis of wheat-induced anaphylaxis was made and a double blind food challenge was suggested however was declined by the family. The patient was instructed to avoid all wheat containing foods and to carry a kit containing an epinephrine pre-loaded syringe and an antihistamine tablet to be used in the event of inadvertant consumption with an instruction to seek medical assistance as soon as possible. Thus far, no further recurrence of anaphylaxis was encountered. A review of the current literature discloses that wheat-induced anaphylaxis is an uncommon event and could occur either immediately after the ingestion or with a concomitant exercise. The natural history of wheat allergy is currently not fully understood but may possibly be a life long event.",

Assuming the guests at a banquet ate normal sized portions, they would get more than twice this amount; and while this will not produce an allergic reaction, it will mean that they have more biogenic amine than can be removed rapidly from the body. The result is likely to be a throbbing headache lasting several hours. By themselves, the foods on this menu can be tolerated with no problems, but together they stimulate receptors and overload the body’s mechanisms for detoxifying biogenic amines.",

On several occasions in American history concerns have arisen over the safety of our food supply (e.g., harmful ingredients in processed foods) and the potential that processing might deplete foods of their nutrients. These concerns help explain how food characteristics such as freshness, natural, organic, and unprocessed have become important to Americans.Bad Foods traces how the food nutrients fat, salt, and sugar have acquired negative reputations for health as well as any controversies and outright misconceptions of the dangers of these nutrients. Bad Foods also explores confusion that can in part be attributed to biased media coverage about foods. Modern Americans are routinely bombarded with information about the health value of certain foods and the dangers of others. Frequently, health information about certain nutrients receives exaggerated coverage (e.g., dietary fat) while the importance of other nutrients gets ignored (e.g., vitamins and minerals). Moreover, health information about foods is often perceived as contradictory.While some readers may be startled by what they perceive to be a challenge to sacred beliefs about foods, others will see the honesty in both the research and the writing and recognize the social benefits of examining our beliefs about foods. Bad Foods will be of interest to sociologists, food science specialists, and social historians.",

      "title": "Encouraging (Nudging) People to Increase Their Fluid Intake",
      "abstract": "This narrative historical review considers the various routes to nudging consumers towards drinking more, given self-reported evidence that many people are often not adequately hydrated. This review builds on the related notion of ‘visual hunger’. Interestingly, however, while many desirable foods are associated with distinctive sensory qualities (such as an appetizing smell), that may capture the consumer’s (visual) attention, it is less clear that there is an equivalent sensory attentional capture by hydration-related cues. One of the other important differences between satiety and thirst is that people tend to overconsume if they use interoceptive satiety cues to decide when to stop eating, while the evidence suggests that people typically stop drinking prior to being adequately hydrated. What is more, the increasing amount of time we spend in consistently warm indoor environments may also be exacerbating our need to drink more. A number of concrete suggestions are made concerning how people may be encouraged (or nudged) to imbibe sufficient water.",

Australian food allergy rates are the highest in the world with up to 10\" of 12 month old children having a food allergy. There are several explanations as to why nuts are particularly more allergenic compared to other foods, and only a trace amount is capable of eliciting an immune response. Peanuts in particular are the major cause of an anaphylactic death after consuming a food allergen. Most nuts contain more than one major allergen. Most nut allergens are structurally resilient and resistant to thermal treatment and degradation during gastrointestinal digestion. Many nut allergens have been observed to also act in other ways to have increased allergenic potential. Current therapies used to mitigate peanut allergy are mucosally targeted. The specific role that a more permeable intestinal barrier plays in food allergy is yet undefined.",

However, many patients complain of an inability to manage their appetite and thereby find it difficult to control their calorie intake. Dysregulated appetite leads to glycaemic swings, and creates a challenge for metabolic management. Moreover, short term non-structured methods to suppress appetite often can cause a rebound excess of food intake, which can even overshoot more than the baseline intake. This article shares the non-pharmacological heuristics and hacks to help suppress and optimize appetite which can be used in day-to-day clinical practice.",

      "title": "En kropp utan socker - hälsosamt eller inte?",
      "abstract": "Ett liv utan socker Det finns fa av oss som arligt kan saga att de aldrig bantat eller i alla fall aldrig tankt pa maten de ater och hur mycket de tranar. I vart utseendefixerade samhalle dar modet, att se slankast ut eller ha mest muskler ar det svart att erkanna att man alskar att ata pizza tva ganger i veckan. Eller att man struntat i den dar grupptraningen kl 17 en tisdag for att sitta hemma och frossa. Man struntade ju i traningen mest for att det regnade ute och man inte orkade bli blot. Inte for att man faktiskt inte hade lust att trana, det skulle man aldrig erkanna for den traningsgalna kompisen. Eftersom man anda fortsatter att frossa kommer man nagon gang att tanka pa ” Tank om jag blir sa overviktig att jag faktiskt blir sjuk?” Med bakgrund i vad valfardssjukdomar som fetma och hjart- och karlsjukdomar kan medfora var jag intresserad av hur man hade kunnat minska risken for att drabbas av dem. Det ar kant att matvaror rika pa socker och mattade fetter samt fattiga pa frukt, gront och notter hojer risken att drabbas. Forst kommer overvikten och snabbare an man anar ater man kolesterolsankande tabletter. Hur blir det utan socker? For att klara av sockersuget maste man utrusta sig med mat som man sjalv tycker ar god och aven sotsaker. Inte sotsaker som kex, godis och lask utan notter och frukt. For att minska risken att drabbas av sjukdomar ville jag undersoka om bortagning av allt raffinerat och tillsatt socker samt matvaror med hogre sockerindex an 2,5g socker/100g livsmedel var nyckeln till kroppens lagre blodsocker, blodtryck och lagre kolesterolhalt i blodet. Skulle kroppens fettmassa minska ocksa? Tanken var dock inte att minska pa kalorier utan pa sockret. Darfor var det mycket viktigt att alltid ata sig matt och kanna sig nojd med maten. Resultatet som jag fick forvanade inte bara mig utan ocksa halsocoachen som gjorde Body Composition Analyze och undersokte kroppens fettmassa. Kroppens fettmassa minskade fran 21,9% till 20,1%. Det ar nastan 2% av fettminskning under en manad utan socker och utan traning. Det var armarna och balen som forlorade mest fett. Balen forlorade 1kg fett och armarna 0,2kg sammanlagt. Blodtester visade att kroppens kolesterolhalt sjunkit. Det totala kolesterolet som i borjan hade varde 6,4 mmol/L (vilket ar strax over den rekommenderade gransen for kolesterol i blodet) hade varde 5,6 mmol/L vid den sista provtagningen. LDL (low density lipoprotein), det onda kolesterolets niva i blodet sjonk ocksa till en halt som var relevant for en frisk manniska. Fran 4,2 mmol/L (som ar precis under den ovre gransen for rekommenderat LDL- niva i blodet) till 2,6 mmol/L i slutet av testperioden.. Det ar en sankning som gor att det fria kolesterolet i blodet sjunker och att HDL-niva (high density liporotein), det goda kolesterolet, kan oka.

      "title": "Food addiction: un concetto di scarsa validità e utilità clinica",
      "abstract": "Il concetto di food addiction ha attratto un crescente interesse nei media e ha stimolato molti dibattiti nella comunità scientifica. Scopo di questo articolo è analizzare la validità e l’utilità clinica del modello del food addiction applicato in particolare ai disturbi dell’alimentazione e all’obesità. Sebbene esistano alcune similitudini tra gli episodi di abbuffata riportati dalle persone con disturbi dell’alimentazione e il disturbo da uso di sostanze, esistono fondamentali differenze tra i due disturbi che riguardano la psicopatologia, l’epidemiologia e i fattori di rischio. Nelle persone con obesità, sebbene alcuni studi abbiano rivelato elementi comuni nei processi di ricompensa cerebrale tra l’assunzione di alcuni alimenti e l’uso di sostanze, questo non significa che un alimento in grado di attivare il sistema della ricompensa possa essere classificato come sostanza che crea dipendenza. L’alimentazione in eccesso riportata da alcune persone con obesità può, infatti, essere spiegata attraverso l’acquisizione di abitudini determinate dall’attivazione di processi edonici normali (non patologici), in un ambiente alimentare denso di energia e culturalmente permissivo. Inoltre, tra l’obesità e il disturbo da uso di sostanze esistono importanti differenze, come il decorso temporale della ricaduta e gli esiti del trattamento. Infine, l’adozione di un trattamento basato sul modello della food addiction nei disturbi dell’alimentazione e dell’obesità è fonte di preoccupazioni perché potrebbe allontanare le persone affette da questi disturbi da terapie di provata efficacia.",

      "abstract": "It is widely believed that addiction entails a loss of free will, even though this point is controversial among scholars. There is arguably a downside to this belief, in that addicts who believe they lack the free will to quit an addiction might therefore fail to quit an addiction.A correlational study tested the relationship between belief in free will and addiction. Follow-up studies tested steps of a potential mechanism: 1) people think drugs undermine free will 2) people believe addiction undermines free will more when doing so serves the self 3) disbelief in free will leads people to perceive various temptations as more addictive.People with lower belief in free will were more likely to have a history of addiction to alcohol and other drugs, and also less likely to have successfully quit alcohol. People believe that drugs undermine free will, and they use this belief to self-servingly attribute less free will to their bad actions than to good ones. Low belief in free will also increases perceptions that things are addictive.Addiction is widely seen as loss of free will. The belief can be used in self-serving ways that may undermine people's efforts to quit.",

      "title": "The Benefit of Healthy Lifestyle in the Era of New Medications to Treat Obesity",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Incretin-based medications for treating obesity produce substantial short- and long-term weight loss and improve obesity-related comorbidities. However, associating lifestyle modification with new medications to treat obesity is generally advisable for several reasons. Firstly, healthy eating patterns and physical activity may offer important additional benefits, enhancing the patient's health and well-being. In addition, regular specialist counselling in lifestyle modification can help patients maintain their motivation levels and develop specific skills for addressing obstacles during the lengthy process of weight loss and maintenance, potentially improving outcomes in the long term. Given the high efficacy of the new weight-loss drugs, it would be timely to streamline and simplify the current gold standard of obesity management based on lifestyle modification. For example, it now seems redundant to prescribe strict diets or meal replacements to reduce calorie intake, or to recommend patients practice 200 to 300 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise for enhanced weight loss. Moderate calorie restriction and, at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and two sessions of muscle-strengthening activities per week may be more achievable and appropriate goals for sustainable weight loss in most patients on pharmaceutical obesity treatment. As regards lifestyle modification counselling, future studies should assess its optimal intensity and duration in the \"new medications for obesity era\".

If you do the arithmetic (proportion of air extracted as oxygen, times tidal volume, times respiratory rate, times minutes per day) it comes to around 500 litres per day. We are largely unaware that we consume so much gas, probably because we cannot see or feel it, just as fish presumably cannot see or feel water. We are of course far more aware of how much food we consume, because we can detect it with every one of our senses. It totals around 600 grams per day for the average healthy person. These gaseous and solid fuels enter our bodies by different and parallel tubes, but they end up interacting with each other in the same way as in any other internal combustion engine, with the release of energy and production of waste products along the way. We may use the citric acid cycle in our cells rather than cylinders, but the principle is the same.\n\nEssentially, the purpose of all this energy is self-replication. Living forms first …",

Particularly for the prevention of weight increase after a period of weight loss. So far, it is not known whether it makes a difference which specific proteins are used in these diets. This dissertation studies which proteins have the greatest effect on a feeling of hunger and food intake. It turns out that proteins from peas have the greatest effect. It also turned out that inhibition of the decomposition of this protein in the stomach even increases the effect. Obese men ate less after they had been administered pea protein directly in the intestines, than after they had eaten this protein. These results can contribute to new perspectives in the treatment of overweight and obesity.",

This act is somehow inspired by the culture and non-operational values of the particular religion. Fasting is primarily an act of willing moderation or reduction of certain or all types of foods, drinks or both, for a particular period of time. This period differs according to the religion and the type of fast. An absolute fast is normally defined as abstinence from all types of foods and liquids for a defined period, usually a single day (24 hours) or several days. Other fasts may be only partially restrictive. In other words, they allow consumption of some kind of food and drink in a day. Although fasting diets have been criticised by nutritionists for being unhealthy, yet, it has been proven that fasting can regenerate the entire immune system by producing new white blood cells.",

In addition to documenting the actual diet consumed, a food diary may also reveal an erratic eating pattern, irregular meals, periods of fasting, excessively restricted eating, frequent snacking, grazing, or binge eating. Evidence shows that augmenting the diet with low-density food enhances weight loss but only when the food is palatable enough to ensure compliance. Low-fat diets are as good as other interventions at reducing weight but not better. Plant-based eating is common in traditional societies, particularly in the Mediterranean and in Asia. Advantages of partial meal replacement therapy over full meal replacements are that they offer participants choice and flexibility in social situations whilst reducing decision making at other times. The fundamental aim of dietary management in overweight and obesity is to create an energy deficit that achieves weight loss and that can be maintained long term.",

It doesn’t add up to much. Yet one billion of the world’s seven billion inhabitants can’t afford to buy this food—or cheaper equivalent amounts of protein, fats, and carbohydrates—each day.\n\nNevertheless, I’m having problems with the attention given to the “hidden hunger” of micronutrient deficiency, which afflicts an estimated two billion people ( BMJ 2011;342:d1086, doi:10.1136/bmj.d1086). The micronutrients in question—iron, iodine, and vitamin A—make up about 0.0005% by weight of the daily ration described above.\n\nIt’s not that I don’t believe in micronutrient deficiency—or in efforts to rectify it—it’s just that I think we should be concentrating on food you can see, and the absence thereof.

Factors affecting consumptionConsumption of alcohol depends on several variables.Sex-Although men are twice as likely to have alcohol related problems, the gap between the sexes is narrowing.Occupation-Alcohol misuse is more common in jobs related to catering, brewing, and distilling.In others, such as doctors, sailors, and demolition workers, high consumption is perceived as the social norm.Homelessness-About a third of homeless people have alcohol problems.Race-British Afro-Caribbeans and south Asians have lower average consumption and lower hospital admission rates for alcohol related problems than white people.However, pockets of high consumption exist, as has been reported among Sikh men (particularly of spirits).About a fifth of Chinese and Japanese people cannot drink alcohol because of an inherited lack of the liver enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine addiction is a complex process that begins with self-administration. Consequently, this process has been studied extensively using animal models. A person is usually not called \"smoker\" if s/he has smoked for a week or a month in a lifetime; in general, a smoker has been smoking for many years. Furthermore, a smoker has free access to cigarettes and can smoke whenever she/he wants, provided there are no social/legal restraints. Subsequently, in an animal model of tobacco addiction, it will be desirable to expose the animal to free access nicotine for 24 hours/day for many weeks, starting at different stages of development. Oral nicotine self-administration studies in rodents present some important advantages and mimic human smoking nicely. For example, animals are not food deprived, are exposed to nicotine choice for up to 24 hours a day for extended periods, environmental cues and learning does not interfere with self-administration of nicotine. Oral alcohol selfadministration has been used in rodents for over five decades and has contributed significantly to the understanding of alcohol addiction. We provide a review of literature and compare oral alcohol and nicotine intake in rodents. Methodological issues, post ingestional and systemic effects, discrimination and the important influences of taste, genetic vulnerability, sex and age on intake are discussed. The review ends with recommendations for future research on oral self-administration of nicotine.",

      "title": "Trastornos del comportamiento alimentario en adolescentes",
      "abstract": "espanolEl cambio puberal supone, entre otras cosas, el desarrollo del cuerpo del adolescente, de su silueta. Los cambios que experimenta le llevan a atender mucho mas que antes su aspecto corporal. Debe proceder, y procede, a evaluar su cuerpo desde el punto de vista estetico. Si su imagen corporal (el cuerpo que cree tener) coincide con el modelo de cuerpo ideal que ha adquirido, se sentira satisfecho de su cuerpo y de si mismo. Si no es asi, experimentara insatisfaccion corporal y su autoestima sera baja. Mayoritariamente, las chicas desean ser delgadas; los chicos musculosos. Unas y otros no hacen sino seguir los modelos esteticos definidos culturalmente. Pero ello conlleva que muchas muchachas insatisfechas con sus cuerpos intenten perder peso y bastantes varones procuren aumentarlo. Cuando los intentos de modificar el peso afectan a la nutricion, pueden aparecer los llamados trastornos de la conducta alimentaria (TCA): anorexia nerviosa, bulimia nerviosa, trastorno por atracones y otros no especificados. Puesto que son las muchachas las que experimentan mayor insatisfaccion corporal y practican mas dietas restrictivas, logicamente seran mas proclives a padecer este tipo de trastornos. Pero son muchos los factores que intervienen y contribuyen a la genesis de un TCA. A pesar de la potente influencia del modelo cultural de cuerpo ideal, los factores geneticos constituyen el principal factor de predisposicion. Esta influencia tiene lugar a traves del papel que la herencia biologica juega en la aparicion de distintos factores de riesgo para tales trastornos: disfunciones del sistema serotoninergico, susceptibilidad al estres, pubertad precoz, indice de masa corporal elevado, neuroticismo alto, impulsividad, obsesividad, evitacion de danos, etc. Pero para que estos factores den lugar a un TCA es preciso que, preocupado por su peso y su cuerpo, el adolescente practique dietas hipocaloricas. Esta preocupacion en la mayoria de casos procede de haber asumido el modelo estetico corporal vigente. Este modelo le ha sido y es transmitido por distintos agentes sociales, fundamentalmente su familia, su grupo de companeras o companeros y, sobre todo, los medios de comunicacion social. Tambien la busqueda de un mejor rendimiento deportivo o la practica de deportes esteticos (gimnasia, danza, etc.) puede conducir a las conductas alimentarias de riesgo. En los ultimos anos se ha comprobado la influencia de otros factores, concretamente trastornos y problemas durante el embarazo, el parto y las primeras epocas de la vida. La experimentacion de sintomas o trastornos depresivos tambien predispone a los TCA, especialmente a la bulimia nerviosa. La homosexualidad masculina es otro factor de riesgo. Cuando el TCA ya esta establecido, sus consecuencias psicologicas y sociales, pero sobre todo las nutricionales, se constituyen en factores de mantenimiento y agravamiento del trastorno, y suponen un notable impedimento terapeutico. Sin embargo, el obstaculo principal es la falta de conciencia de enfermedad de muchos de estos pacientes, especialmente los que sufren anorexia nerviosa. EnglishThe puberal change, among other facts, involves the development of the body and along with it the silhouette of the teenager. The changes experienced by the teenagers lead them to pay much more attention to their body image. They must proceed and proceed to take a closer look at their bodies from an esthetic point of view. If their body image, the body they believe they have, matches the acquired ideal body models, they will feel satisfied with their bodies and themselves. If not, they will experience body dissatisfaction and their self-esteem will drop. Mainly, the girls wish to be thin; the boys aim at increasing their muscle mass. Both of them do nothing but follow the culturally framed aesthetic models. But this implies that many girls feeling dissatisfied with their bodies try to lose weight and plenty of males try to gain it. When the attempts to modify the weight affect the nutrition, the so-called eating disorders (ED) can take place: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorders and some other ones. Since the girls are the ones that experience greater body dissatisfaction and go on more restrictive diets, they are more prone to suffer this type of disorders. But there are many factors that have to do with the genesis of an ED and contribute to it. In spite of the powerful influence of the cultural aesthetic models, the main predisposition factor is the genetic one. This influence takes place through the role that the biological inheritance plays in the appearance of different risk factors for such disorders: serotonergic system dysfunctions, stress sensitivity, precocious puberty, high body mass index, high neuroticism, impulsiveness, obsessiveness, damage avoidance, etc. However, for these factors to give rise to an ED it is precise that, the teenagers that are worried about their weight and their body go on lowcalorie diets. In most cases, this worry has to do with the assumption on the part of the teenager of the current esthetic model. This model has been and is being transmitted to them through several social agents, basically their families, their classmates and, above all, the social mass media. Also, the search for a better sports performance or the practice of esthetic sports like gymnastics, dance, and others can lead to risk eating behaviors. In recent years, the influence of other factors has been verified, concretely, disorders and problems during the pregnancy, the labor and the first life stages. The experimentation of symptoms or depressive disorders also predispose to the ED, especially to the bulimia nervosa. Male homosexuality is another risk factor. Once the ED has appeared, its social and psychological consequences, but above all the nutritious ones, are factors of maintenance and worsening of the disorder, and therefore a noticeable therapeutic obstacle. Nevertheless, the main obstacle is the lack of consciousness over the disorder on behalf of many patients, especially the ones who suffer anorexia nervosa.",

      "abstract": "Acute marijuana use is classically associated with snacking behavior (colloquially referred to as \"the munchies\"). In support of these acute appetite-enhancing effects, several authorities report that marijuana may increase body mass index in patients suffering from human immunodeficiency virus and cancer. However, for these medical conditions, while appetite may be stimulated, some studies indicate that weight gain is not always clinically meaningful. In addition, in a study of cancer patients in which weight gain did occur, it was less than the comparator drug (megestrol). However, data generally suggest that acute marijuana use stimulates appetite, and that marijuana use may stimulate appetite in low-weight individuals. As for large epidemiological studies in the general population, findings consistently indicate that users of marijuana tend to have lower body mass indices than nonusers. While paradoxical and somewhat perplexing, these findings may be explained by various study confounds, such as potential differences between acute versus chronic marijuana use; the tendency for marijuana use to be associated with other types of drug use; and/or the possible competition between food and drugs for the same reward sites in the brain. Likewise, perhaps the effects of marijuana are a function of initial weight status-i.e., maybe marijuana is a metabolic regulatory substance that increases body weight in low-weight individuals but not in normal-weight or overweight individuals. Only further research will clarify the complex relationships between marijuana and body weight.",

      "abstract": "It is well established that regular exercise plays an important role in achieving a number of health and wellbeing outcomes. However, certain post-exercise behaviors, including the consumption of unhealthy high-calorie foods, can counteract some of the benefits of physical activity. There are at least three overlapping pathways through which exercise may increase the likelihood of consuming pleasurable but unhealthy foods: through impulsive cognitive processes, reflective cognitive processes, and/or physiological responses. It is argued in this paper that motivation toward exercise can influence each of these pathways. Drawing from literature from various domains, we postulate that controlled exercise motivation, as opposed to autonomous exercise motivation, is more likely to influence each of these pathways in a manner that leaves individuals susceptible to the post-exercise consumption of pleasurable but unhealthy foods.",

      "abstract": "The number of people following plant-based diets to a greater or lesser degree is increasing, but the more restrictive a diet, the greater the risk of nutritional deficiencies. The childhood stage is a stage of great physical and maturational growth, therefore, nutritional deficiencies at this stage can have serious and sometimes permanent consequences. People who follow restrictive diets of any kind, such as plant-based diets, should receive support from specialized staff to ensure that their diets are varied and balanced, as is desirable in any case.Está aumentando el número de personas que siguen dietas basadas en vegetales en mayor o menor grado, pero cuanto más restrictiva es una dieta, más riesgos existen de presentar deficiencias nutricionales. La etapa infantil es una etapa de gran crecimiento físico y madurativo, por ello, las deficiencias nutricionales en esta etapa pueden acarrear consecuencias graves y, en ocasiones, permanentes. Las personas que siguen dietas restrictivas de cualquier tipo, como son las dietas basadas en vegetales, deben recibir apoyo de personal especializado para conseguir que sus dietas sean variadas y equilibradas, como es deseable en cualquier caso.",

      "abstract": "Obtener la informacion deseada de la lista de ingredientes de un producto\r\nalimenticio no siempre es facil.\r\nMuchas personas necesitan obtener datos muy concretos de una lista de\r\ningredientes y en un tiempo razonable para poder decidir si ese producto es\r\napto para su dieta. Personas con alergias, intolerancias, celiacos, diabeticos,\r\nvegetarianos o que sigan cualquier otro tipo de dieta o normativa como por\r\nejemplo la normativa islamica (alimentos Halal) necesitan saber exactamente\r\nque contiene lo que se van a comer. Ademas existe el problema del idioma,\r\nalgunos productos de importacion no tienen la lista de ingredientes traducida\r\ncorrectamente, suelen llevar una pegatina con los ingredientes en el idioma del\r\npais y esta, cuando existe, no siempre tiene la informacion exacta. El problema\r\ndel idioma se presenta tambien cuando estamos de viaje o viviendo en un pais\r\nen el que no dominamos el idioma. Y por ultimo tambien existen a menudo\r\nproblemas fisicos para leer los ingredientes. En la mayoria de los casos el tipo\r\nde letra es demasiado pequeno y en muchos la combinacion de colores usada\r\nhace que la lectura sea dificil. Si ademas el consumidor tiene algun problema\r\nde vision la lectura de la lista de ingredientes se vuelve muy complicada o\r\nimposible.\r\nPor tanto, no siempre podemos llegar a la conclusion de si se puede o no\r\nconsumir un producto por su lista de ingredientes.\r\nPara poder leer una lista de ingredientes sin importar donde nos encontremos o\r\nel idioma y el modo en que este escrita, y ser capaces de obtener toda la\r\ninformacion deseada en un idioma que entendamos y todo esto en pocos\r\nsegundos necesitamos un Lector de Ingredientes.\r\nEl lector de ingredientes que se describe en este proyecto tiene por objeto\r\nexactamente eso, leer automaticamente la lista de ingredientes de cualquier\r\nproducto alimenticio y darnos la informacion deseada. Esta informacion puede simple “es apto”/”no es apto” para nuestra dieta.\r\nEsta idea nos obliga a disenar una nueva manera de escribir y de leer la lista\r\nde ingredientes.\r\nPara que la lista de ingredientes pueda ser entendida por todo el mundo esta\r\ndebe estar escrita en un idioma universal. Se va a crear pues una Base de\r\nDatos de Ingredientes con todos los ingredientes posibles. Estos ingredientes\r\nvendran identificados con un codigo y sera este codigo el que aparezca en la\r\nnueva lista de ingredientes. De esta manera este codigo puede ser traducido al\r\nidioma deseado en el proceso de lectura de la lista de ingredientes.\r\nEl fabricante, en el momento de crear la etiqueta, debera elegir los ingredientes\r\nde la Base de Datos de Ingredientes, especificandolos lo mas posible.\r\nPara poder leer la lista de ingredientes de forma automatica necesitamos\r\ncodificar la nueva lista de ingredientes (donde cada ingrediente ha sido\r\nsustituido por su codigo universal) con alguno de los metodos de identificacion\r\nautomatica (RFID, codigos de barras, etc.). El metodo seleccionado ha sido\r\nQR-Code. QR-Code (Quick Response Code) es un codigo de dos dimensiones\r\no de matriz con alta capacidad para el almacenamiento de datos. El sistema,\r\nuna vez especificada la lista de ingredientes y obtenidos los codigos de estos\r\ningredientes, generara el QR-Code correspondiente que sera imprimido en la\r\netiqueta del producto.\r\nPara leer esta lista de ingredientes codificada en QR-Code se utilizara la\r\ncamara del telefono movil. Muchos telefonos modernos ya vienen con el lector\r\nde QR-Code preinstalado. El lector de QR-Code lee el codigo y lo decodifica,\r\nes decir nos daria la lista de ingredientes con los ingredientes codificados. Los\r\nprogramas del Lector de Ingredientes que tambien estarian instalados en el\r\ntelefono movil traducen, con ayuda de la Base de Datos de Ingredientes, esta\r\nlista al idioma deseado. Ademas sera posible predefinir nuestra dieta para que\r\nel lector de ingredientes nos diga si el producto es apto o no para ella.\r\nLa Base de Datos de Ingredientes esta disenada de tal manera que cada\r\nusuario podra instalarla en su telefono en el idioma que desee.\r\nPara este proyecto se ha creado la Base de Datos de Ingredientes en ingles.\r\nLa Base de Datos ha sido generada con Metakit, contiene 2885 ingredientes\r\ndiferentes con sus codigos identificativos, nombre y otras informaciones sobre\r\nlas dietas mas habituales y solo ocupa 256 KB.\r\nTambien se han desarrollado programas para el prototipo: lectura de la Lista de\r\nIngredientes, traducir esta lista a ingles o a espanol, comprobar si es apto para\r\nlas dietas vegetarianas, dieta celiaca, halal y kosher. Estos programas estan\r\nescritos en Tcl y en total ocupan 24 KB.\r\nLas medidas de tiempo de ejecucion del prototipo para funciones que acceden\r\na la BDI han dado como resultado tiempos inferiores al medio segundo. Estos datos de ocupacion de memoria y de tiempo de ejecucion demuestran la\r\nviabilidad del proyecto ya que el objetivo final es que la aplicacion este\r\nempotrada en telefonos moviles.",

      "abstract": "Most diet programs fail because they don't address the underlying metabolic conditions that contribute to increased hunger and weight gain. In fact, they often worsen the problem by cutting calories and causing deprivation that prompts food cravings and leaves dieters hungrier - and heavier - than ever. The Body Economy Diet remedies this by identifying and treating metabolic imbalances with balanced food intake and recommended 'indulgences'. Based on the results of simple quizzes that uncover an individual's particular imbalances, readers choose between two eating plans that prescribe the ideal nutrient ratios needed to heal disordered metabolisms and turn off faulty hunger signals. On both plans, readers enjoy additive-free meat, fish, eggs, cheese, and vegetables, plus metabolism-boosting ingredients such as avocados, vegetable juice, lemon juice, and olive and coconut oils. Readers with less damaged metabolisms, including those who have already made metabolic repairs using the basic plan, incorporate 'luxury' foods - indulging in ice cream, salty snacks, chocolate, wine or beer, or even bread-to stay on track without feeling deprived. A tailored supplement program, carefully controlled exercise, and stress-reduction techniques complete the metabolic cure.",

      "abstract": "Putting things off as long as possible (procrastination) is a well-known tendency. Less well known is the tendency to attempt to get things done as soon as possible, even if that involves extra effort ( precrastination). Since its discovery in 2014, precrastination has been demonstrated in humans and animals and has recently been revealed in an analogous tendency called the mere-urgency effect. Trying to get things done as soon as one can may reflect optimal foraging, but another less obvious factor may also contribute—reducing cognitive demands associated with having to remember what to do when. Individual differences may also play a role. Understanding precrastination will have important implications for explaining why hurrying happens as often as it does and may help reduce the chance that haste makes waste.",

A 45-year old man presented with a 30-year history of high-dose nicotine gum use (up to 200mg nicotine per day). He was highly nicotine dependent and had failed repeatedly to stop using nicotine gum use in the past. Within a week of commencing nicotine patches he was able to cease nicotine gum with minimal discomfort and has remained nicotine-free for 6 months, with abstinence confirmed biochemically. His severe sweating disorder rapidly resolved with cessation of the gum. Nicotine patches may be an effective treatment for long-term nicotine gum addiction.",

      "title": "Complementary feeding: Vegetables first, frequently and in variety",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diets rich in fruit and vegetables are associated with lower risk of a number of chronic health problems, but the majority of people do not consume enough of these foods. The main predictor of fruit and vegetable intake is enjoyment of these foods, but vegetables are often disliked, especially by children. Food preferences developed in the early years track throughout childhood and beyond and, therefore, it is critical that vegetable liking is promoted at the very earliest opportunity. The start of complementary feeding is a sensitive period for the development of food preferences, as infants will readily accept new foods and quickly learn to like them. Repeated exposure to a variety of vegetables during complementary feeding is an effective way to encourage infants to accept these foods. Recent research has suggested that offering vegetables exclusively for the first few weeks of complementary feeding offers additional benefits, but survey data indicate that this is not yet commonly practised in the UK . Encouraging UK parents to adopt a ‘vegetables first, frequently and in variety’ approach to complementary feeding is likely to steer children towards a lifelong preference for these foods and all the associated health benefits.",

Of these, only a relatively small number have been proved of relevance for human nutrition under the conditions of real diets. These interactions most often occur at the intestinal lumen, but they may also take place during utilization or storage of nutrients. Traditional diets of developing countries, which usually include non-refined cereals and other sources of fibre, may inhibit the bioavailability of mineral nutrients, contributing to specific deficiencies. Drug-nutrient interactions may also impact on nutritional status, particularly in population groups such as the elderly, who frequently receive prolonged medication and may have an inadequate food intake.",

      "title": "Let Go of Emotional Overeating and Love Your Food",
      "abstract": "Let Go of Emotional Overeating and Love Your Food is for anyone who would like to eat whatever they like, yet stop just at the point of satisfaction without overeating. Written by a Columbia University trained psychotherapist and former emotional overeater, Let Go of Emotional Overeating and Love Your Food offers psychologically sound techniques for recognizing the symptoms of emotional overeating and methods for addressing it in ways that are both effective and enjoyable. Readers will learn how to become aware of the difference between eating in a healthy way and eating emotionally – neither to satisfy hunger, nor for enjoyment, but in a desperate attempt to distract oneself from painful thoughts and feelings. Diets don’t work for people who eat through their emotions. Instead, learning to recognize the stressors that lead to emotional eating and to address those tensions through other methods besides eating is the goal. When we handle stress well away from the table, we’re free to relax and really savor our food when we choose to eat. Proven techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) are presented in an innovative, easy-to-remember way. Learning to eat mindfully, for health and enjoyment, becomes the goal, and Arlene Englander walks readers through table techniques designed to make mindful eating easier, habitual, and ultimately second-nature. Allowing for both fun foods and healthy foods, Englander’s approach emphasizes eating healthfully and being aware of best practices and the behavioral objectives of coping with stress, exercising regularly, mindful eating, good nutrition and hydration, and controlling overeating situations. She addresses late-night eating, parties, vacation, and other situations where overindulging may be a risk. She concludes with a prescription that is meant to last so that readers can love their food for a lifetime.",

We falsely suggested to 180 subjects that, as children, they had gotten ill after eating egg salad. Results showed that, after this manipulation, a significant minority of subjects came to believe they had experienced this childhood event even though they had initially denied having experienced it. This newfound autobiographical belief was accompanied by the intent to avoid egg salad, and also by significantly reduced consumption of egg-salad sandwiches, both immediately and 4 months after the false suggestion. The false suggestion of a childhood event can lead to persistent false beliefs that have lasting behavioral consequences.",

      "title": "Nothing After Midnight?",
      "abstract": "The practice of restricting a patient's oral intake prior to surgery is almost as old as the discovery of anesthesia itself. Starting in the late 19th century with Sir Joseph Lister who permitted the consumption of “tea or beef tea,” preoperative fasting instructions drastically changed following Mendelson's 1946 report in which 2 patients who ate full meals 6 to 8 hours prior to surgery died because of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia. The recommendation of “NPO after midnight” for liquids and solids soon followed to combat intraoperative vomiting and aspiration risks with little to no consideration of the individual patient's medical status or existing comorbidities. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) formally established evidence-based NPO guidelines in 1998, and virtually all anesthesia societies today have adopted some modest variation of the ASA's “2-4-6-8 rule.” Healthy patients are permitted clear (nonparticulate) liquids up to 2 hours prior to surgery, breast milk for 4 hours, nonhuman milk and a light (nonfatty) meal up to 6 hours, and heavy (fatty) foods 8+ hours. Despite these contemporary fasting guidelines, the adage “nothing after midnight” seems to persist, resurfacing frequently during preoperative discussions with dental patients, their parents or caregivers, and even other health professionals and staff. Does continuing such outdated preoperative fasting instructions really make a difference? Conversely, are there times when prolonged fasting is appropriate?The obvious need to confirm proper preoperative fasting goes without saying as anyone who has dealt with vomiting/aspiration during sedation or general anesthesia can attest. Managing perioperative pulmonary aspiration is daunting enough within the confines of a fully staffed traditional hospital operating room. Add in the relatively isolated nature of the dental clinic or oral surgeon's office and the difficulties mount exponentially. Patients presenting for treatment who fail to fast appropriately (eg, ate a full meal 2 hours prior) must be rescheduled—no ifs, ands, or buts. Failing to delay or reschedule such a case after its discovery puts the patient at significant risk for undue harm, and such a poor decision to proceed would be exceedingly difficult to defend.To that end, implementing multiple check points throughout the preoperative period to double and triple check patient adherence to NPO instructions is strongly recommended. This process can easily start with the receptionist asking the patient upon their arrival when they last ate or drank, moving onward to include the dental assistant/nurse and finally the sedation or anesthesia provider as the last stop. This purposeful repetition may trigger a patient or parent to “fess up,” uncovering a critical fasting violation. A classic example is the parent who felt the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups his child consumed while driving to the dental office were not food but rather candy and therefore fine to eat prior to general anesthesia. Equally frustrating was the mother disclosing she gave several full cups of ice to her child before arriving to the office because “it wasn't food or water, it was ice,” and therefore fine to consume. In both examples, the front desk staff were told the patients had not consumed anything only to have the violation uncovered by the attentive nurse. Staff should be encouraged to speak up if a potential NPO violation is at all suspected, like the patient who presents for treatment carrying a partially full Starbucks drink. These are “red flag” events that warrant further investigation prior to proceeding.Although preoperative fasting is critical for patient safety, prolonged fasting should ideally be avoided when appropriate and possible as patients can develop irritability, dehydration, fatigue, drowsiness, and hypoglycemia, particularly in the pediatric population.1 A patient who is inconsolable, crying, and irritated preoperatively is at a higher risk for developing emergence delirium postoperatively.2,3 This can be especially difficult in the ambulatory dental environment as emergence delirium can delay recovery, mask postoperative complications, and negatively impact patient and parent satisfaction. Balkaya et al4 assessed fasting times and emergence delirium in 110 pediatric patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging with sedation. Weak positive correlations were found with emergence delirium and longer fasting times for solids (13.05 h vs 11.32 h) and fluids (11.42 h vs 10.38 h).4 Khanna et al2 reported a similar study on pediatric patients undergoing ophthalmic exams under anesthesia and found a positive correlation between clear fluid fasting times and increased emergence delirium scores during the early (up to 20 min) postoperative period. Additional advantages to minimizing extended fasting may include improved venous anatomy visualization, intravenous access, and intraoperative cardiovascular stability.Although there are clear benefits to minimizing fasting times, providers should be cautious and selective in their application. Patients and parents/caregivers must fully comprehend not only the gravity of why NPO guidelines should be followed but also the particulars of the instructions themselves. To be thorough, written preoperative instructions should include fasting guidelines, which should be further discussed to ensure complete understanding. Simply stating “clear liquids ≥2 hours” can easily be misinterpreted and result in disaster. Consider instead clarifying exactly what liquid options are acceptable (eg, water, Sprite, nonparticulate apple juice) and which are not (eg, milk, orange juice with pulp). Furthermore, it may be beneficial to consider adding a modest time buffer in case schedules are adjusted, like permitting clear fluids up to 2.5 to 3 hours preoperatively. This can be quite useful for patients scheduled later in the morning or afternoon. Reaching out to patients the night before surgery to remind them once again of the need to present appropriately NPO is often quite helpful. Many patients prefer texting, which can be especially effective for communicating simple reminders these days. Regardless of the particulars, clear and concise communication is of the utmost importance when discussing fasting instructions with patients.Many factors can influence the decision to prolong preoperative fasting times. Medical comorbidities that result in delayed gastric emptying (eg, diabetes mellitus) or lower esophageal sphincter tone warrant consideration for extending normal NPO recommendations to reduce elevated aspiration risks. Patient scheduling is another factor as unforeseen cancellations could prompt later cases to be unexpectedly moved up. This easily can create a situation where a patient originally scheduled for early afternoon is called in midmorning instead, unintentionally violating fasting instructions unless they were given extended NPO times in anticipation. Additionally, it may be considered prudent to stick to “nothing after midnight” if substantial concerns exist about a patient's ability to understand and comply with more contemporary guidelines. The benefits of recommending and ensuring prolonged fasting may outweigh the risks for these types of scenarios and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.Sedation and anesthesia providers for dentistry can certainly improve upon the old recommendations of “nothing after midnight” in most circumstances. Although the use of contemporary NPO guidelines benefits the general welfare of our patients, it does not come without risk if applied inappropriately or indiscriminately. Effective communication, establishing purposeful redundancies into preoperative routines, and creating efficient supportive team environments are keys to minimizing those risks and maximizing patient safety.",

However, due to geographic difference Moslems from different part of the world will experience different length of daytime. Those in equatorial regions have more or less little variation, while those in northern or southern hemisphere very much depend on season varia¬tion. Previous studies reveal that fasting during Ramadan may affect biochemi¬cal parameters in human body, however, they seem to remain in normal range. During fasting, the body consumes mainly glucose from gluconeogenesis to produce energy. Glycerol, lactate, and certain amino acids are among others utilised as substrate for gluconeogenesis. This biochemical process produces urea, changes in muscle mass and reduced fat in adiposa tissue. It is sug¬gested that more fat should be consumed while practicing Ramadan fasting. Puasa di bulan Ramadan merupakan kewajiban bagi muslim yang sudah akil baliq. Puasa dilakukan dengan menahan makan dan minum sejak matahari terbit sampai tenggelam, selama 30 hari di bulan Ramadan.

Pada negara di daerah equator sedikit megalami perubahan, sedangkan yang terletak di utara dan selatan garis equator dapat memiliki variasi waktu tergantung musim. Penelitian yang telah dilakukan menunjukkan bahwa puasa Ramadan dapat mempengaruhi parameter biokimiawi tubuh, walaupun masih dalam batas normal Selama puasa, glukosa merupakan sumber energi utama yang berasal dari proses glukoneogenesis.

The most common eating pattern in modern societies, three meals plus snacks every day, is abnormal from an evolutionary perspective. Emerging findings from studies of animal models and human subjects suggest that intermittent energy restriction periods of as little as 16 h can improve health indicators and counteract disease processes. The mechanisms involve a metabolic shift to fat metabolism and ketone production, and stimulation of adaptive cellular stress responses that prevent and repair molecular damage. As data on the optimal frequency and timing of meals crystalizes, it will be critical to develop strategies to incorporate those eating patterns into health care policy and practice, and the lifestyles of the population.",

The patient describes using marijuana, “because it's the only thing that has worked for my anxiety and made me not care about my depression.” She describes craving marijuana every day, especially when she smells marijuana on her clothes, smells marijuana on someone else, hears a song on the radio that she has enjoyed while high, or sees images of people smoking on TV. She doesn't intend to stop smoking altogether, but she doesn't want to feel like she needs to smoke every day. She has a history of occasional alcohol use (less than once a month) and occasional cigarettes (less than five per week).",

Es wird angenommen, dass Craving und AB sich wechselseitig beeinflussen: Craving kann zu verstärkter Aufmerksamkeit für Essensreize führen und umgekehrt. Höheres Craving und AB sind mit gesteigertem Nahrungsmittelkonsum verbunden und spielen vermutlich eine Rolle bei der Entstehung von Essanfällen. In dieser DFG-geförderten Studie wurde daher untersucht, ob durch eine gezielte Reduktion des ABs über ein Aufmerksamkeits-Modifikations-Training (AMT) das Craving und die Essstörungspathologie bei Personen mit BES verringert werden können.",

Diet and lifestyle of Indians are blamed for the increase. Majority of Indians are lacto-vegetarians and do not culturally permit all kind of food. Further, Indians being poor the dietary ingrediant, must be affordable. Health infrastructure in rural India is poor and hence neutraceutical aided control is helpful in villagers. A particular food composite used daily reduces the compliance and hence alternative approaches like use of different sets of neutraceuticals or use of same neutraceuticals not on daily basis is suggested. Chances are there that on non daily use the beneficial effects of neutraceutical may reduce. This study shows that flax oil and fenugreek with sesame oil used as the cooking medium, a neutraceutical of use in diabetes remains effective on non regular use rather the effect potentiates on being used at two days interval.",

Sensitization to fish can occur by ingestion, skin contact or inhalation. The manifestations can be IgE or non-IgE mediated. Several fish allergens have been identified, with parvalbumins being the major allergen in various species. Allergenicity varies among fish species and is affected by processing or preparation methods. Adverse reactions after eating fish are often claimed to be 'allergy' but could be a reaction to hidden food allergen, fish parasite, fish toxins or histamine in spoiled fish. Identifying such causes would allow free consumption of fish. Correct diagnosis of fish allergy, including the specific species, might provide the patient with safe alternatives. Patients have been generally advised for strict universal avoidance of fish. However, testing with various fish species or preparations might identify one or more forms that can be tolerated.",

On average, for instance an adult spends approximately 10 hours each day sitting-in Asia, Europe as well as US. While a brief period of sitting here and there is natural, long periods of sitting day-in and day-out can seriously impact health and are associated with a significantly higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and depression, as well as muscle and joint problems. Even working out vigorously may not compensate for long sitting sessions. The key is to build frequent movement variety into the day and to change the sitting position from time to time. About every 20--30 minutes the body needs a posture break by moving for a couple of minutes or, at least, by changing the sitting position.",

A serious drug misuse problem in the parents can be devastating for the lives of their children.1Addiction to opiates, most commonly heroin, is one of the forms of drug misuse that is potentially most damaging to the child's home environment. Recent figures produced by the European Commission suggest that about 0.2–0.3% of European adults fulfil diagnostic criteria for heroin addiction at any given time,2 and higher rates exist in inner city areas. Department of Health figures suggest that heroin use is the form of drug misuse most commonly presented to treatment services in the United Kingdom.3 \n\nThe financial pressure of obtaining large sums of money (typically £10–100 a day) to buy heroin can lock a person into a daily cycle of seeking out, buying, and using heroin, which can lead to poverty, criminal activity, and imprisonment.4 Chaotic lifestyles may preclude attention being given to basics such as nutrition and attending appointments, and may lead to the presence of unsafe persons in the home, unsuitable carers, and frequent parental absences. Dependent heroin users are also at greatly increased risk of death from overdose, infectious diseases, and other causes.4Addiction to stimulants such as amphetamines and crack cocaine may also produce adverse home circumstances, although anonymous testing of pregnant women suggests that there does not yet appear to be the misuse of these drugs in epidemic proportions in the United Kingdom that is reported in the United States.5 \n\nIt is difficult to obtain clear figures about the scale of parental drug use and the numbers of children affected.

That’s right, we were being poisoned by the evil clown with deadly fat and something had to be done!Yeah, because we’re not adults or anything…So the government stepped in and the burger giant was forced to change their frying oil. On the surface of it, it’s nice of good old Uncle Sam to take care of us right? To watch out for we, the ignorant masses, and make sure that when we’re shoving super-sized fries into our feed holes that they’re not entirely unhealthy!Okay… but do you know that despite the choice you make to visit Mickey Dee’s, there is in fact something found in virtually every can, box or bag of food in the grocery aisle that’s incredibly addictive, almost immediately turns to fat when you eat it and is one of the leading causes of most of the ailments we suffer today?So what is this killer, which is not only ignored by the government but actually supported by it?SUGARThat’s right, processed sugar in its many forms is one of the most used ingredients in all processed and packaged foods. That includes regular white sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, maltodextrin and a host of others.Want proof? Try this experiment the next time you go shopping. Walk down the aisles and examine the stuff you normally buy. Including stuff you wouldn’t even think they’d put sugar in – soup, salad dressing, instant potatoes, juice, frozen foods and even baby foods…Now, if you read the list of ingredients you’ll find some of the sugars I mentioned above. Keep in mind that this list of ingredients is organized from the highest concentration to the lowest. So if some kind of sugar is listed in the first three ingredients – and it’s often #1 or #2 – then you’re eating a whole lot of it.Sugar is a killer and, while okay in small quantities, is extremely unhealthy, fattening and addictive. That’s right – thousands of independent clinical studies have shown that sugar is more addictive than cocaine and even heroine……and it’s in virtually everything we eat!So is it any wonder why you might find it hard to drop the poundage?Here’s something else to ponder before we say goodbye. There’s actually a list of vegetables that are routinely served in restaurants and found in the produce section of the grocery store that are generally thought to be healthy… but are actually very bad for you and inhibit your ability to drop weight!Health, fitness and weight loss are complex issues and we’ve been fed a lot of myths over the years. That’s why I’ve made it my goal in life to share the truth about foods, exercise and weight loss that we westerners have been denied for so long!If you’re looking to lose weight, have ever struggled with your weight or are just sick and tired of paying for the next big fitness craze, diet or gizmo that never seems to work, then I’d like to invite you to learn more about the foods you eat and the way your body works.Click this link now and watch my presentation where I’ll reveal some of the biggest weight loss myths and prove to you through hard science why they don’t work and how we’ve all been bilked for billions!",

It is generally conceded that the peoples of the Third World are, for the most part, underfed, ill-nourished and prone to suffer from certain types of disease. One must be wary, however, of making blanket statements about the populations of the underdeveloped world. For example, one often sees on film, on television, and in photographs in magazines pictures of negroes with splendid physique and dazzling white teeth or of Amazonian native Indians with fine bodies and happy faces or athletic Polynesians and these images fit ill with the general idea that the peoples of the Third World are physically weak, live in semi-starvation, and are diseased. This is not to deny that large numbers, very large numbers, are weak, undernourished and diseased but the point should be made that it is possible for peoples in the Third World to live active, healthy lives providing they get enough to eat We pay much attention to what we call 'a balanced diet', but as Carpenter has said, 'there is no one \"right\" pattern for a good diet. Many quite different combinations of food can be used — combinations including individual foods that are, taken by themselves, quite unbalanced'.1 Thus, he goes on to say, 'a housewife in Britain is wise to feel that she should serve her family a dish containing milk and a green vegetable every day; but it would not be equally sensible to teach Eskimo women that they must do the same thing.",

      "title": "Pattern of food allergy in adults",
      "abstract": "The pattern of food allergy in adults is different from that of children in various aspects. The typical foods involved in infants are milk, egg, peanut and probably tree nuts, whereas in older children and adults fruits and nuts are the most frequent allergenic foods. In addition, allergy to vegetables can occur. Allergy to milk and egg largely disappears at young age, but can still be present in adults, in part because of persistence from childhood, but also as de novo allergies developing in adolescents or adults.\r\n\r\nThe high prevalence of fruit and nut allergy in adults and older children is for a large part due to the pollen-food syndrome: the result of cross-reactivity between allergens in tree (birch) pollen and in fruits, nuts and vegetables. The list of foods cross-reacting with birch pollen is steadily increasing and contains members of different plant food families. Also some less frequently eaten tropical fruits are on the list. In general reactions due to the pollen-food syndrome tend to be relatively mild, but (more) severe reactions have been reported especially for soy, celery and tropical fruits. Severe reactions on first exposure of cross-reactive foods were reported.\r\n\r\nAnother important cross-reactive allergy is that between latex and foods and vice versa. The most frequently involved foods are kiwi, banana, avocado, chestnut and buckwheat.\r\n\r\nIn clinical practice the most important problem is how to confirm which are the culprit foods and how to judge the severity of the food allergy.\r\n\r\nStudies from different geographical regions have show that there can be significant differences in the prevalence and severity of specific food allergies due a.o. to differences in pollen exposure and eating habits, which is also partly reflected in differences in patterns of allergen profiles.\r\n\r\nThe increasing knowledge on relevant allergen recognition patterns, known as component resolved diagnostics, will help to improve our insight in the relevant allergens involved, the routes of sensitisation and, at least partially, to estimate the risk of severe reactions.",

Тобто він проявляється як довготермінова реакція на стрес, щонайменше після чотирьох тижнів після травматичної події. Лікування посттравматичного стресового розладу включає психотерапевтичні підходи, застосування медикаментів та харчування, оскільки неправильне харчування здатне погіршити перебіг посттравматичного стресового синдрому. В статті пропонується створення мультинутрієнтного функціонального напою на основі рослинної сировини для посилення в лікуванні ПТСР, оскільки стрес може різними способами впливати на використання організмом калорій і поживних речовин. Це підвищує метаболічні потреби організму та збільшує використання та виведення багатьох поживних речовин. Якщо людина не дотримується поживної дієти, може виникнути їх дефіцит .Для забезпечення повноцінного і збалансованого харчування з урахуванням лікувально-оздоровних функцій в раціоні кожної людини повинні бути присутні близько 600 нутрієнтів.

      "abstract": "People's lifestyles have changed, this change is more or less influenced by the increase in people's welfare levels, which in fact has changed the type of food intake favored by the community (Sahi, 2020). Some people, especially urban people who are busy working, rarely cook themselves to meet the family's daily food needs, instead they rely on their food menu from buying ready-to-eat food from stalls or restaurants in large numbers. From habits like this people tend to choose janis food that offers the power of taste derived from fatty foods, chemical cooking spices from the factory, how to cook fried or grilled and provided a variety of flavors of chili sauce also with chemical spices factory with a variety of flavors. Diabetes Mellitus is a non-communicable disease caused by the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body can not process insulin that has been produced effectively. To reduce the risk of complications, blood sugar levels in patients with some of the families in the community even rarely consume vegetables, so many of their children no longer want to eat vegetables because they are not accustomed to eating vegetables in their families, which is actually a very beneficial vegetable for the body. From that background and to help patients with diabetes mellitus, the author wants to design a system or application that can control the food to be eaten, namely by choosing foods that are suitable for patients with the disease. The selection of these foods, will be assessed in accordance with the nutrients contained in the food to be consumed.",

      "title": "Functional Out-of-Home Eating: 'Towards product concepts to support people in making healthy food choices in the out-of-home context'",
      "abstract": "Food consumed outside of our home is an increasingly important part of our diet. Every day around 4 million Dutch consumers eat one or more main meals outside the household premises. More than half of these meals are not consumed when eating out of our home in a traditional way, e.g. at a full-service restaurant, but are what is called functional out-of-home eating. Functional out-of-home eating considers food on-the-go, for instance while travelling or shopping. Also eating at work or at school is considered functional out-of-home eating. Research shows that out-of-home foods are often higher in energy and moreover, frequent consumption of out-of-home food is linked to poorer diet quality and risk for obesity. Although most people have the basic knowledge about what healthy food is, they do not yet put this knowledge into practice, often resulting in bad food choices. Especially for people leading busy lives, working long hours at demanding jobs and often being on the road – keeping a healthy diet can be difficult. This master thesis describes the user-centred research and design process towards product concepts that support these people in making healthy food choices in the out-of-home context. To get insight in the food choices of users and the context surrounding them three user studies were carried out: an online questionnaire, a probe study and a field study. With the online questionnaire the key descriptors of functional out-of-home eating in the Netherlands were found, such as locations, frequency and timeslots of functional out-of-home eating. The probe study gave insight in the experiences of users and the key motives, patterns, dilemmas and factors that influence eating habits. With the field study, an attempt was made to grasp the moment of the act of participants eating out of home, to find actual qualities, feelings and attitudes of food choices. The results were used to describe the present context of functional out-of-home eaters and defined the factors that influence food decisions. It was found that functional out-of-home eating brings about complex interactions. It became clear that the barrier to healthy nutrition is not the lack of desire or motivation, but is instead the result of lack of some of the key elements that enable a person to make healthy choices and the influence of external and internal factors that consciously or unconsciously influence choice. These barriers were translated to design goals which enabled the formulation of a design brief. Based on the design brief, four concepts were developed that differed on several aspects, such as interaction-, technological or content dimensions. In an evaluation session all aspects of these three dimensions were evaluated. Healthy food choices in the out-of-home context contribute to a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle. This report presents a design proposal for breaking down the barriers to healthy food choices in the out-of-home context. The proposal can serve as a direction for further development.",

This is quite different from the dosages involved when anorexiants are used properly as an adjunct in the total treatment of obesity. They constitute an initial “crutch” to help strongly motivated stable patients to change their eating habits. Anorexiants should never be used on a long‐term basis. As the total program is difficult for both patient and physician, any temporary therapy of such value to the obese patient should not be prohibited if given under the supervision of an experienced physician who knows the indications for withdrawal. Under these circumstances, the hazards are minimal.",

      "title": "Eating for a lifetime of healthy skin",
      "abstract": "The idea that you can eat your way to healthy skin is a concept gaining traction in consumer circles due to intense media activity in this area. Skin vitamins, skin drinks, and skin nutritional supplements are widely available each purporting to contain those nutrients necessary for “healthy” skin. Certainly, dermatologists are asked frequently by patients for dietary advice and may have crafted answers based on their own beliefs regarding skin nutrition. While textbook chapters on skin health are limited primarily to nutritional deficiencies, limited knowledge exists on eating for superb skin health. The easiest patient answer regarding eating for healthy skin is to consume a well-balanced diet. However, it is unclear exactly what constitutes a “well-balanced” diet. Early in humanity, the concept of three balanced meals was not a reality. Humans ate when food was available with intervening periods of fasting. Consequently, the human body is designed to function and withstand the challenges of intermittent feeding. Fat is stored when food in abundant for use as a fuel source during fasting. This survival mechanism has worked well until recently when modern agricultural practices in developed countries have provided a continuous food supply. The constant availability of food in the United States has led to an epidemic increase in childhood obesity, which will translate into a meteoric rise in type II diabetes within one generation. Diabetes is an interesting model of accelerated skin aging due to increased protein glycation. Protein glycation occurs when sugars crosslink to structural proteins in the body and DNA. Glycated proteins exhibit decreased elastic rebound causing decreased myocardial contraction and a decreased ejection fraction. Glycated proteins also account for the increased incidence of cataracts and renal disease found in diabetes. Finally, protein glycation leads to decreased skin elasticity and decreased arterial wall elasticity causing the development of leg ulcers. Current trends point toward accelerated rather than decelerated skin aging in the US youth. How could the current concepts of nutritional excellence lead to major health issues? The answer may lie in how the recommended daily allowances (RDA) were determined. The RDA was developed by consensus rather than evidence-based medicine. Experts in nutrition convened a meeting and set the RDAs based on personal observation and experience. The committee did an excellent job of determining the minimum nutritional standards as rickets, due to vitamin D deficiency, is no longer seen in the US and scurvy, due to vitamin C deficiency, is rarely seen. These standards represent the minimum, however, and not the optimum. Nutritional deficiencies can be compensated by the vigor of youth, but ill health effects can be observed with maturity. Thus, age-adjusted RDAs should be developed with new longevity predictions and a better understanding of age-related nutritional deficiencies. Perhaps the best example of the need for age-adjusted nutritional standards is the present vitamin D controversy. Vitamin D is mislabeled as a vitamin and should be reclassified as a hormone, since it exhibits structural homology to testosterone. While vitamin D can be synthesized by UVB exposure, the synthetic ability decreases with age. Lower UVB exposure during the winter months, skin cancer concerns, and poor diet has led to epidemic vitamin D deficiency in mature individuals. Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency include lassitude, depression, muscle pain, bone loss, and increased cancer risk. These symptoms are also characteristic of menopause when bone loss increases exponentially. Indeed, the poor physical health associated with menopause may be in part due to vitamin D deficiency. The RDA for vitamin D is 400IU. This amount is sufficient for the prevention of rickets during childhood, but it is not sufficient for menopausal women. The RDA for vitamin D is probably closer to 1000IU for women in their 40s and maybe even as high as 2000IU for women in their 60s. It is difficult to consume this amount of vitamin D without increasing caloric intake. Whole milk is vitamin D enriched, but most mature women consume reduced fat or skim milk to minimize fat and caloric intake. Since vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin, it is in limited quantity in skim milk. Vitamin D enrichment is not required in other milk products, such as ice cream, cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese, unless the manufacturer elects to do so. This means that a nutritional supplement is the best method of maintaining vitamin D stores in mature women. Maintaining the bony architecture of the face is key to providing the structural support necessary for beautiful skin. Certainly, an argument could be made that vitamin D supplementation is critical for a lifetime of healthy skin. Manufacturers of vitamin D–enriched yogurts are making the claim that consuming their food makes for lovely skin. While vitamin D is necessary for healthy skin, so are vitamins E, C, and A. Vitamin D levels can be measured and replaced until individuals are within the normal bounds, but measurements of serum vitamin E, C, and A are not mainstream. Normal age-adjusted bounds have not been set for these vitamins, yet their ability to function as endogenous antioxidants is important to skin health. Without the ability of vitamin E to act as the primary skin antioxidant and vitamin C to act as the secondary skin antioxidant, a dramatic increase in premature wrinkling and possibly even carcinogenesis would occur. This then leads to the original question of what should be consumed for a lifetime of healthy skin. It is clear that current nutrition in the US is suboptimal. People are consuming excessive calories without meeting currently acceptable vitamin standards. This problem may arise from lack of knowledge. The RDAs need to be reconsidered in light of medical evidence. Further, the RDAs should be age stratified based on different metabolic needs. RDAs should also be considered for both minimal and optimal levels. These questions need to be answered before dermatologists can tell their patients how to eat for a lifetime of healthy skin. In the mean time, what should dermatologists tell their patients when the healthy skin diet question arises? Instead of pleading ignorance, I would like to suggest a medically savvy answer based on current nutritional understandings. All vitamins and other nutrients possess color. These colors are visually attractive and used by both animals and humans to select foods for consumption. Color-based food selection is even seen in children who select bright colored foods over dull appearing foods. Food manufacturers are aware of this fact and add food coloring to many prepackaged and prepared foods where oxidation has dulled the color. The dull color indicates vitamin degradation, which is not affected by the addition of food coloring. With this in mind, I would like to suggest dermatologists recommend that patients eat something of every color every day. Eating something green, red, pink, orange, yellow, blue, and every shade available in between is the best way to insure adequate nutrition accompanied by a multivitamin with minerals. Other supplements, such as vitamin D, may be necessary on a case-by-case basis. Variety in food consumption is the only logical way to insure adequate nutrition in light of our current ignorance. Something as basic to human life as eating demands more attention. Eating for a lifetime of healthy skin is based on medical art and not science at present. Dermatologists need to take the lead in developing this fund of knowledge. Oral consumption certainly drives skin health, but exactly what constitutes the optimum diet for a lifetime of healthy skin is presently unknown.",

      "abstract": "The belief that high income is associated with good mood is widespread but mostly illusory. People with above-average income are relatively satisfied with their lives but are barely happier than others in moment-to-moment experience, tend to be more tense, and do not spend more time in particularly enjoyable activities. Moreover, the effect of income on life satisfaction seems to be transient. We argue that people exaggerate the contribution of income to happiness because they focus, in part, on conventional achievements when evaluating their life or the lives of others.",

The fact of the matter is that many of us just eat badly. We only think of good nutrition once we find ourselves with some food related ailment such as overweight, or diabetes, and so on. Something I have observed, though, is that the better off we become economically, the more we eat, and the more meats find their way in our diets. If you live in Africa, clearly more meat in the diet is good for you as we tend to derive most of our proteins from plant sources. There are exceptions, though.",

When responding to this argument, the position of the vegan is similar to the atheist who time and again is confronted with the same fallacious arguments in support of the existence of god(s). Veganism and atheism are both ethical default positions. Similarly, not killing other people is also a default position.",

      "abstract": "Considérée comme une maladie chronique par l’OMS, l’obésité se démarque pourtant des autres maladies chroniques. Le diabétique, par exemple, ne va pas voir le diabétologue pour ne plus être diabétique, il sait qu’il ne peut faire disparaître sa maladie; il ne peut que se soigner au mieux pour ne pas souffrir en plus des effets indésirables du diabète. L’obèse, en revanche, ira souvent voir le nutritionniste pour perdre du poids, autrement dit pour ne plus être obèse, pour guérir l’obésité. Qu’il soit arrivé là de son propre chef ou envoyé par un médecin, la volonté n’est pas d’éviter les conséquences possibles de l’obésité, mais d’éviter l’obésité elle-même. Comment expliquer cette différence ? L’équation est simple: l’obèse est obèse parce qu’il a trop et mal mangé. S’il mange moins, et mieux, il ne sera plus obèse. Il est, autrement dit, responsable de son obésité, et peut, de la même manière, agir pour ne plus l’être. Pourtant, si la question de la responsabilité était si simple, verrait-on la prévalence de l’obésité croître de la sorte dans les pays occidentaux ? Les obèses sont-ils vraiment responsables de leur maladie, et peuvent-ils vraiment changer leur état ? Le premier problème à soulever est celui de la responsabilité du patient obèse: le « gros », pointé du doigt par son entourage, par la société, par la médecine, est considéré comme bien plus que responsable: il est coupable de son état, il n’est pas « normal », il doit changer. Cette culpabilité, loin de l’aider à agir, peut l’amener à une forme de complaisance dans son état, et au rejet de toute forme de responsabilité. Alors que le corps médical participe trop souvent à cette stigmatisation, comment le soignant peut-il aider ces individus à faire face à leur maladie chronique ? Comment leur redonner une possibilité d’agir face à l’obésité, d’avoir une part de responsabilité face à la maladie pour éviter d’en souffrir ?",

People sometimes overborrow money in order to spend it on leisure and/or luxury items, overeat, spend indulgent times, smoke, and gamble to the point of destitution. In all of these situations, the results of the choice to engage in such behaviors have adverse effects on the individual’s future. Moreover, self-harmful behavior is not always limited to the extreme cases described above. For example, on occasion, we sometimes stay up drinking until late at night even though we have a meeting early the next morning. As another example, rather than completing an important task with an impending deadline, we often engage in trivial tasks such as cleaning our work desk, checking e-mails, and self-grooming.",

Participants (N = 118 young adults) completed a 7 day Tobacco Consumption Diary by recording for each cigarette smoked: time and day, location, number of people present, number of smokers present, mood, and whether alcohol was consumed. Results suggest light smoking is most strongly associated with the alcohol intake, later time of day, and multiple locations both within and outside the social context (but not at work). The amount smoked per day by light smokers does not appear to be influenced by the number of people present and number of smokers present. Overall, young adult light smokers appear to be cue oriented in their smoking similar to heavier smokers, despite lower levels of addiction and fewer cigarettes per day than heavier smokers. Light smokers may benefit from tailored intervention approaches to identifying the ideographic triggers that occur in certain locations and later time of day and are likely to include alcohol intake.",

It is suggested that during Ramadan similar general dietary guidelines should be followed as those throughout the year. The pre dawn meal should be taken as late as possible, before the start of the fast and should have a high proportion of carbohydrates with fibre. The traditional sugar drinks and foods rich in fat taken at iftar should be avoided. The evening meal or dinner should be consumed as early as possible at iftar and contain whole wheat flour chapattis, vegetables and a meat dish. Salads increase the fiber intake.

But when suffering from brain-fag this teaching may fail even in man. Unquestionably a lunch at bedtime is wholesome and conducive to sleep, especially in brain-workers who sup early and retire late.

I know exactly what they are saying; however, I have come to accept that control is beyond my capability. Merriam Webster defines “control” as, “to direct the behavior of something to do what you want; to have power over” (1). If only I had this super power! On the other hand, the definition of management is, “to handle or direct with a degree of skill” and “to take care of and make decisions about” (2). This is something I can do!\n\nLet me illustrate the difference. If you have children, you may believe you are controlling your children when they do what you are asking them to do. However, you only have the illusion of control. The children maintain control over their actions; they just decide to cooperate and to do what you want them to do. Diabetes is very much like a child.

Babies need nutrients from the food you eat to help them grow. You don’t have to eat twice as much while you are pregnant, just twice as wisely. Keep in mind MyPyramid when choosing meals and snacks each day. The food groups are listed below along with the recommended number of daily servings and some examples of what one serving is.",

Nutrisi yang tidak tepat dapat menyebabkan burung rentan terhadap banyak penyakit dan mengakibatkan performa yang buruk secara keseluruhan dan kurangnya vitalitas. Istilah \"gizi yang tidak tepat\" tidak selalu berarti kekurangan gizi, dapat juga berarti kelebihan gizi. Menyediakan terlalu banyak makanan dengan frekuensi terlalu sering dan memberikan terlalu banyak hal yang baik serta kurang bervariasi seringkali menjadi penyebab masalah Ada lebih dari 8000 jenis burung, mungkin tidak akan pernah ada diet yang ideal untuk semua jenis burung.

The idea that alcoholism is a discrete entity has been undermined by a second major line of advance — the survey investigation of population drinking practices. In any culture where alcohol is an accepted recreational drug, dependence on alcohol is in a statistical sense a normal condition -most people will have some degree of drive toward seeking alcohol actuated by a variety of external or internal cues. Traditionally a distinction has been made between psychological dependence and physical dependence. In Anglo-Saxon literature the 'psychopathic' alcoholic is a familiar stereotype. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms are typically experienced on waking, but with the highly dependent person careful questioning may reveal that he experiences sub-acute withdrawal during the day, or indeed wakes during the night disturbed by withdrawal symptoms.",

Fatty fish, such as salmon and tuna, and fish oil are rich sources of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Flaxseed, canola oil, and walnuts also are good dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids. In addition to being antiarrhythmic, the omega-3 fatty acids are antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory. In contrast, omega-6 fatty acids, which are present in most seeds, vegetable oils, and meat, are prothrombotic and proinflammatory. Omega-3 fatty acids also are used to treat hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis. There are no significant drug interactions with omega-3 fatty acids. The American Heart Association recommends consumption of two servings of fish per week for persons with no history of coronary heart disease and at least one serving of fish daily for those with known coronary heart disease. Approximately 1 g per day of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid is recommended for cardioprotection. Higher dosages of omega-3 fatty acids are required to reduce elevated triglyceride levels (2 to 4 g per day) and to reduce morning stiffness and the number of tender joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (at least 3 g per day). Modest decreases in blood pressure occur with significantly higher dosages of omega-3 fatty acids.",

Fundamentally it is the attribute of a substance or drug that makes it more toxic to a parasite than to the host. When that is a function of the dose, as in the case of antimony compounds for example, the same substance will kill or damage both—it merely takes more to kill the host perhaps due to his greater mass and size. The ideal is to kill or injure one organism without hurting another. The problem of selective toxicity is not limited to man but also refers to the same phenomenon in lower animal life and in plant life with regard to economic poisons. There are many factors which have to do with the toxicity or activity of a drug. Substances which are quite similar, chemically, may be due to one or more of the",

Importantly, physical activity has the potential to be a successful method of obesity prevention, but only if there is compliance with the prescribed amount, together with judicious control over food choice that involves selection of low- to medium-energy dense diet. There are many examples in the literature of food-induced reductions in energy intake. It is often believed that physical activity is a poor strategy for losing weight since the energy expended will drive up hunger and food intake to compensate for the energy deficit incurred. Therefore, physical activity seems to enhance the sensitivity of satiety signals and improves appetite control through better meal to meal regulation. An increase in physical activity does not automatically protect against inappropriate food choice.",

      "abstract": "Author(s): Wyss, Jeffrey | Abstract: Obesity and its accompanying morbidity and mortality is arguably one of the greatest health care challenges currently facing the United States. Recently studies have shown that the vast majority of Americans do not meet fruit and vegetable recommendations. Other studies have suggested that humans tend to eat the same mass of food irrespective of the type of food eaten. This finding suggests that one of the reasons fruits and vegetables support weight loss is that they generally have low calories per unit mass and thereby displace foods that high high calorie density. Most people associate weight loss with diet and exercise, and most people associate diet with restricting type/quantity of food leading to cravings/hunger. This project proposed a different mental framework for those trying to lose weight: instead of restricting yourself from eating certain types/amounts of food, make an effort to eat the recommended portions of fruits and vegetables before each meal. This approach to weight loss is almost completely absent from popular culture and given the enormous number of Americans who are overweight/obese, even if only a small fraction of them benefited from exposure to this approach it would be a worthwhile endeavor. I developed a website (http://nosasdiet.com) that explains the evidence and logic for this type of approach and provides a personalized calculator that tells users exactly how much fruit and vegetables they should buy weekly and consume daily given their taste preferences to meet USDA recommendations. The website shows which foods are in season and the calculator includes a cost estimate as well as a summary of relevant micro and macronutrients contained in the recommended fruits and vegetables. I also included charts showing the energy density, protein per energy, and fiber per enery for fruits, vegetables, and many other common foods so people can quantitatively compare foods to help make informed choices.",

      "abstract": "Der vorliegende Abschnitt behandelt die Frage, unter welchen Umstaenden der Alkoholkonsument zum Taeter wird. Die beim Delikt im Verkehr festgestellten Durchschnittswerte von Blutalkoholkonzentrationen (BAK) sind so hoch, dass die Mehrheit der Bevoelkerung gar nicht faehig ist, diese bei Trinkversuchen zu erreichen. Das Verkehrsrisiko im Verkehr wird hauptsaechlich von der Gruppe der starken Trinker und der Gruppe der gelegentlichen Rauschtrinker mit erheblicher Alkoholgewoehnung verursacht. Es muessen verschiedene Gruppen von Alkoholkonsumenten und daraus abgeleitet von alkoholisierten Verkehrsteilnehmern unterschieden werden: 1. Genuss- oder Konsumtrinker mit risikoarmem durchschnittlichem Alkoholkonsum, die auch die Gefahren der Verkehrsteilnahme unter Alkoholeinfluss unterschaetzen. 2. An Alkohol Gewoehnte beziehungsweise Risiko- oder Schwellentrinker mit riskantem bis starkem Alkoholkonsum, die aufgrund der entwickelten hohen Alkoholtoleranz die koerperlichen Gefahrensignale fuer eine bestehende Trunkenheit nicht mehr zuverlaessig wahrnehmen. 3. Harte Trinker und Alkoholabhaengige, die laengst alle Verhaltensziele der Sucht untergeordnet haben und regelmaessig Alkoholfahrten in Kauf nehmen. Am haeufigsten sind Verkehrsmediziner in der Begutachtungsstelle fuer Fahreignung mit der Gruppe der Risiko- oder Schwellentrinker konfrontiert. Auf sie trifft meist die Definition des Alkoholmissbrauchs zu. Bei BAK-Werten von ueber 1,09 Promille ist in allen Faellen - unabhaengig von der persoenlichen Konstitutionen, Befindlichkeit und Alkoholvertraeglichkeit - eine Beeintraechtigung der Fahrsicherheit gegeben. Die Alkoholabhaengigen sind auch ohne Auffaelligkeit im Strassenverkehr nach Anlage 4 zur Fahrerlaubnis-Verordnung (FeV) zum Fuehren eines Kfz nicht geeignet. Signifikante neuropsychologische Defizite Alkoholkranker sind auch bei Abstinenz nicht schnell reversibel, so dass bei chronischem Alkoholmissbrauch eine Ueberpruefung des Leistungsvermoegens vor Wiedererteilung einer Fahrerlaubnis angezeigt erscheint. Die Voraussetzungen, unter denen eine Fahreignung wieder angenommen werden kann, sind im Kommentar zu den Begutachtungs-Leitlinien sowie in den Beurteilungskriterien ausfuehrlich beschrieben. Dabei sind sowohl psychologische als auch medizinische Befunde zu beachten und haeufig interdisziplinaer zu interpretieren. Die Verkehrsmedizin hat dabei zu beantworten, wie der Alkoholkonsum in der Vorgeschichte diagnostisch einzuordnen ist und welcher Behandlungsbedarf daraus abzuleiten ist, ob ein chronischer Alkoholmissbrauch zu koerperlichen und/oder geistigen Folgeschaeden gefuehrt hat und ob aktuelle Befunde vorliegen, die mit der Behauptung einer gegebenenfalls erfolgten Distanzierung vom Alkoholkonsum nicht kompatibel sind.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Dietary intake and physical activity were assessed in approximately 700 members of the health professions. It was found that although the diets of both exercisers and nonexercisers contained about the same number of calories, there was a great difference in the proportions of nutrients involved in these calories. For the exercisers, the intake of every vitamin, mineral and amino acid studied exceeded that for the nonexercisers, and many of the differences were statistically significant. Since these nutrients are classified as resistance agents because they decrease the likelihood of disease, the dietary pattern adopted by these exercisers should be encouraged. The nonexercisers consumed more refined carbohydrates than did the exercisers; the difference was highly significant statistically. Since refined carbohydrates are classified as susceptibility agents because they enhance the possibility of disease, the dietary pattern adopted by these nonexercisers is to be avoided. Diet and exercise, either independently or together, affect emotional health. A poor nutrient intake and lack of exercise are susceptibility factors which diminish mental health, whereas a good nutrient intake and exercise are resistance factors which promote mental health.",

      "abstract": "Het is algemeen bekend dat het aantal mensen met (ernstig) overgewicht steeds verder toeneemt. Meer inzicht in de processen die ervoor zorgen dat mensen gaan eten of stoppen met eten zou kunnen helpen bij de ontwikkeling van voedingsmiddelen gericht op gewichtsbeheersing. Er zijn aanwijzingen dat het hormoon ghreline een belangrijk hongersignaal is. In samenwerking met de afdeling Humane Voeding van Wageningen Universiteit is bij TNO Kwaliteit van Leven in Zeist de rol van ghreline als hongersignaal onderzocht in gezonde vrijwilligers. Uit deze studies blijkt dat veranderingen in ghreline concentraties in het bloed positief gerelateerd zijn aan veranderingen in eetlust. Desondanks lijkt de stijging in ghreline concentratie niet te voorspellen hoeveel iemand tijdens een maaltijd eet. Er werden wel aanwijzingen gevonden dat onderdrukking van ghreline concentraties mogelijk de volgende maaltijd zou kunnen uitstellen. De mate waarmee ghreline concentraties worden onderdrukt na een maaltijd is afhankelijk van de hoeveelheid energie die een maaltijd bevat en van het type macronutrient. De conclusie is dat ghreline een korte termijn honger signaal is, die niet bepaalt wanneer je stopt met eten (en hoeveel je eet), maar die lijkt te bepalen wanneer je begint te eten. Nutrienten (bijvoorbeeld melkeiwit) die ghreline concentraties kunnen onderdrukken zouden kunnen helpen bij de preventie van overgewicht en obesitas.The number of people with (severe) overweight is increasing. More insight into the mechanism of food intake may help to develop foods for weight maintenance. There are indications that ghrelin is an important hunger signal. The role of ghrelin in the regulation of food intake was investigated in human volunteers at TNO Quality of Life in Zeist, in collaboration with the department of Human Nutrition of Wageningen University. Our studies showed that changes in ghrelin concentrations were related to changes in appetite, but these changes did not predict food intake. Suppression of ghrelin concentrations, however, did predict initiation of the next meal. Such suppression of ghrelin appears to depend on type of macronutrient and energy content of a meal. We conclude that ghrelin is a hunger signal that does not determine meal size (satiation), but that regulates next meal initiation (satiety). Foods that contain nutrients (for example dairy protein) that effectively suppress ghrelin concentrations, may help prevent overweight and obesity.",

Previous eating evaluation tools may not be appropriate for early detection of nutrition problems.  The objective of this study was to develop a self-dietary assessment tool.  The research method was qualitative, performed by the following steps: evaluate a previous eating evaluation tool; review previous research studies; develop 2 models for a self-dietary assessment tool; organize a focus group to discuss and gather opinions on the develop self-dietary assessment tool; revise the tool to get a prototype of a self-dietary assessment tool; and assess the tool using a questionnaire. Content and quantitative data were analyzed. The total number of those engaged in the development process was 15, 3 patients, 8 nurses, and 4 nutritionists who participated in the focus group. Suggestions to adjust the tool included adding more pictures for conveying meaning; reducing the use of technical terms and needless details; marking pictures to indicate the amount of food eaten; developing a set of self-dietary assessment materials as a tool for patients and a handbook for medical officers; using traffic signal light symbols to indicate food intake adequacy.  The research team revised the two models to get only one prototype and assessed it.  It was found that more than 60% of participants in this development process agreed with the prototype for self-dietary assessment in all 6 of its major dimensions.  However, this assessment tool should be further tested for its validity among inpatients before its use.",

      "title": "Effects of Dietary Fibre on People with Constipation",
      "abstract": "Constipation is common in modern society and affects people's quality of life. The symptoms of constipation vary from person to person. The frequency of bowel movements, the state of the bowel movement and the shape of the stool are some symptoms that determine whether a person is constipated. Constipation is classified as either primary or secondary constipation. Fibre is a compound of plant origin classified as soluble or insoluble fibre. Its function is to maintain a healthy digestive system, with insoluble fibre increasing bowel movements and faecal output to relieve constipation. Dietary fibre is the fibre that people obtain through eating. The prevalence varies from age group to age, as well as dietary fibre intake. In childhood, consuming \"age + 5g\" of dietary fibre is recommended. According to studies, adding a certain amount of dietary fibre can help children improve the symptoms of chronic constipation. In the adult population, the number of recommendations varies from country to country, and women are more likely than men to suffer from chronic constipation. According to studies, dietary fibre intake can improve the symptoms of constipation in adult patients. However, some patients with unique constipation need to reduce dietary fibre intake to relieve the symptoms of constipation. For the elderly, the prevalence is higher, and 20-25g is a more suitable nutritional fibre intake. And increasing dietary fibre intake can positively impact elderly patients with constipation.",

      "title": "“Food First but Not Always Food Only”: Recommendations for Using Dietary Supplements in Sport",
      "abstract": "The term \"food first\" has been widely accepted as the preferred strategy within sport nutrition, although there is no agreed definition of this and often limited consideration of the implications. We propose that food first should mean \"where practically possible, nutrient provision should come from whole foods and drinks rather than from isolated food components or dietary supplements.\" There are many reasons to commend a food first strategy, including the risk of supplement contamination resulting in anti-doping violations. However, a few supplements can enhance health and/or performance, and therefore a food only approach could be inappropriate. We propose six reasons why a food only approach may not always be optimal for athletes: (a) some nutrients are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities in the diet, or may require excessive energy intake and/or consumption of other nutrients; (b) some nutrients are abundant only in foods athletes do not eat/like; (c) the nutrient content of some foods with established ergogenic benefits is highly variable; (d) concentrated doses of some nutrients are required to correct deficiencies and/or promote immune tolerance; (e) some foods may be difficult to consume immediately before, during or immediately after exercise; and (f) tested supplements could help where there are concerns about food hygiene or contamination. In these situations, it is acceptable for the athlete to consider sports supplements providing that a comprehensive risk minimization strategy is implemented. As a consequence, it is important to stress that the correct terminology should be \"food first but not always food only.\"",

      "abstract": "A brief feeling state questionnaire was com- pleted before and after each cigarette, over a day of smok- ing. Feelings of stress/anxiety demonstrated a pattern of repetitive vacilation over the day, with high stress before smoking, reduced stress after smoking, and stress levels increasing again between cigarettes. There was no evi- dence of acute pharmacodynamic tolerance, with ciga- rettes leading to altered feelings of anxiety/stress over the whole day of smoking. Self-rated feelings of arousal also demonstrated a pattern of vacilation over the day, with low arousal pre-smoking, increased arousal post-smok- ing, but arousal levels reducing again between cigarettes. The ANOVA drug x time interaction was significant, with the greatest arousal change following the first cigarette of the day. However, later cigarettes led to similar amounts of arousal change over the rest of day, thus questioning whether acute pharmacodynamic tolerance was occur- ring. Instead, the heightened arousal response to the first cigarette of the day may reflect the influence of two other factors. Firstly, overnight deprivation, with the first ciga- rette of the day leading to the greatest increase in plasma nicotine. Secondly, low early-morning arousal with its associated potential for increased arousal. Overall, there- fore, there was little indication of acute pharmacodynamic tolerance to the subjective effects of nicotine. Cigarettes were associated with altered feelings of stress and arousal, over the whole day of smoking.",

The most beneficial changes result from reducing intake of saturated and trans fats; increasing intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats; fortifying foods with plant stanols or sterols; isocalorically adding tree nuts to the diet; consuming one or two alcoholic drinks per day; and adopting a Portfolio, Mediterranean, low-carbohydrate, or low-fat diet. Smaller but still beneficial effects result from reducing intake of dietary cholesterol, increasing intake of soluble fiber and soy protein, and eating fatty marine fish or taking marine-derived omega-3 fatty acid supplements. Red yeast rice supplements have effects similar to those of statin medications and are better tolerated in some patients. Regular aerobic exercise has beneficial effects on lipid levels, particularly if performed for at least 120 minutes per week. Brief physician counseling will have relatively small effects on unselected patients, so efforts should be concentrated on patients who are motivated and ready to make lifestyle changes.",

L’addiction à la nourriture et aux sucres est corrélée à des altérations fonctionnelles dans les circuits du cerveau impliqués dans l’apprentissage par récompense, la motivation et le contrôle des impulsions. Ces altérations ressemblent à celles observées dans l’addiction aux drogues (ex. cocaïne). Les études précliniques chez l’animal ont montré que ces altérations neurobiologiques peuvent être causées par la surconsommation chronique de produits riches en sucres (et/ou en graisses). Cependant, tous les individus (obèses ou non) ne développent pas une addiction à la nourriture et aux sucres, ce qui suggère la présence d’une vulnérabilité initiale dont l’origine reste à élucider.",

However, few people successfully maintain their weight loss.1 One explanation for the poor efficacy of conventional diets relates to psychological factors, since the motivation to adhere to restrictive regimens diminishes with time, especially in an environment with virtually instantaneous availability of food. A second, perhaps more fundamental, explanation is that weight loss elicits physiological adaptations — principally an increase in hunger and a decrease in resting energy expenditure2 — that oppose ongoing . . .",

      "abstract": "Food-drug interactions are defined as alterations of pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of a drug or nutritional element or a compromise in nutritional status as a result of the addition of a drug. Elderly patients are particularly at risk because more than 30% of all the prescription drugs are taken by this population. Failure to identify and properly manage drug-nutrient interactions can lead to serious consequences. For instance, drug-nutrient interactions can result in reduced absorption of certain oral antibiotics and may lead to suboptimal antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection. This predisposes the patient to treatment failure. Induction or inhibition of enzymes in the gut by nutrients may lead to a significant change in oral bioavailability of drugs or vice versa. For example, grapefruit juice is a selective intestinal CYP3A4 inhibitor. The overall exposure of some drugs can be increased by more than fivefold when taken with grapefruit juice and increase the risk of adverse effects. The use of certain drugs may affect GI tract function and may lead to a loss of bodily electrolytes and fluid. Limiting drug prescriptions to essential medications for as short a period as possible and periodic re-evaluations of the treatment chosen are essential to minimize adverse drug-nutrient interactions.",

      "title": "Is enhanced energy utilization the answer to prevention of excessive adiposity?",
      "abstract": "Excessive adiposity is the result of an imbalance in energy homeostasis whereby excessive food intake is not balanced by increased energy utilization. Much has been learned about the physiology of energy expenditure during resting, eating, and physical activity that allows optimal energy utilization that could reduce excessive adiposity. Resting metabolic rate and diet-induced thermogenesis collectively contribute 75% of energy expenditure that is largely based on carbohydrate rather than fat metabolism. Conversely, physical activity, whether active (planned) or spontaneous (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), predominately utilizes fatty acids as sources of energy expenditure. Such enhanced fat-derived thermogenesis most optimally results in weight loss to achieve maintenance of balanced energy homeostasis. While decreased energy expenditure of 100-200 Kcal/day from sedentary activities can cause weight gain, unplanned spontaneous physical activity expenditure of 100-800 Kcal/day from routine activities such as walking and fidgeting is sufficient to prevent weight gain. Furthermore, planned physical activity can be enhanced up to 16-fold, such that additional fat thermogenesis can be optimized. Such physical activity also achieves adaptive conditioning for more efficient energy utilization and weight loss. It is, therefore, necessary that children as well as adults embrace all forms of non-exercise and planned active exercise activities to achieve optimal fat thermogenesis for optimal energy homeostasis including weight loss for either the overweight or obese. Such lifestyles need to be promoted through educational, environmental, and legislative changes that optimize healthy nutrition and physical activity.",

      "title": "Physical activity and appetite control: can we close the energy gap?",
      "abstract": "Appetite control can be effectively investigated within an energy balance framework. When people are sedentary, weight gain is favoured because appetite is poorly regulated, and energy expenditure is low. Consequently, people can exist in a chronic state of positive energy balance. This positive energy balance can be construed as an energy gap. This gap that leads to weight gain and maintains the weight different between overweight and lean people is larger than usually recognised. Physical activity can influence body weight by moving people from a sedentary ‘non-regulated’ zone into a physiologically ‘regulated zone’, where energy expenditure and energy intake are more in equilibrium. In this regulated zone, physical activity improves the sensitivity of appetite control as well as increasing energy expenditure. The effect on body composition is much more important than an effect on bodyweight. Physical activity can reduce fat mass and waist circumference and increase lean (fat-free) mass. Other health benefits include a decrease in resting heart rate and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), an increase in cardiovascular fitness and in mood. Consequently, even though there may be some compensation for the energy expended, people have a better regulated appetite and are healthier.",

      "abstract": "Becoming addicted to food is described as a biopsychosocial process. Addiction is described as a neural phenomenon in which dopamine secretions first bring pleasure, effectively a balm and an analgesic to assuage physiological and psychological disturbances that are created by obesity. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, and her associates have done the recent ground-breaking research on food addiction. They recognized that the pleasurable sensations of eating will disappear due to the reduction of dopamine neurons. This leaves anhedonia, and the promise of pleasurable sensations without being fulfilled. Because of this, one desires to eat more, especially hypercaloric foods, to gain these sensations. Therefore, addiction is a cause of obesity. Endocrinological findings suggest that obesity is a cause of addiction, responsible for physiological and psychological disturbances that are mollified by dopaminergic secretions from eating. Consequently, obesity is both a cause and consequence of addiction. The sources of obesity are another matter and this paper looks at the social and behavioral sciences to understand the development of obesity.",

      "abstract": "연구목적 자기 통제의 성공을 통해 원하는 몸무게 도달하기 등 바람직한 목표를 달성하는 것은 만족스러운 삶을 누리는데 필수적이라 할 수 있다. 자기 통제는 기존의 반응을 억제하고, 그 반응 대신 다른 새 반응을 하도록 하는 과정이기에(Baumeister, 2002), 현재의 환경 내에서 행동을 바꾸고, 이 행동을 시작하고 지속하는 것이 자기 통제 성공의 중요한 요인이 된다고 볼 수 있다(Ajzen, 2002; Wood & Neal, 2007). 사람들은 라이프 스타일에 쉽게 적용될 수 있는 작은 행동의 변화를 통해 다이어트 등의 바람직한 장기 목표에 집중하고자 한다. 이러한 이유로, 사람들은 같은 음식을 사더라도 작은 패키지의 음식을 구매하며 이로 인해 자기 통제가 성공할 것이라고 본다(Hoch & Loewenstein, 1991; Stunkard, 1980). 하지만, 작은 패키지를 구매할 때 사람들은 유혹 대안에 대해 덜 방어적인 태도를 취하게 되어, 실제로 더 많이 먹게 되는 등 자기 통제에 실패할 수 있다(Do Vale, Pieters & Zeelenberg, 2008). 이 때, 패키지 사이즈를 이용하여 효과적인 자기통제를 하는데 무엇보다 중요한 것은, 소비자들이 평소 목표 추구를 지속하고 자기 통제를 할 때 사용하는 유혹 대안 거절방식이라 볼 수 있다. 작은 패키지는 소비자들에게 수용할만하다고 느껴지며 보다 자기 통제를 대체하는 도구로 여겨지기에, 소비자의 초점이 외부와 관련되어 있는 상태이다. 이때, 목표의 초점이 내부적일 때보다 외부적일 때 더욱 효과적인 “I can``t” 유혹 대안 거절 방식을 사용할 경우(Patrick & Hagtvedt, 2012)자기 통제 의도가 더 증가할 것이라 볼 수 있다. 반면에, 큰 패키지의 경우, 소비자들에게 수용할만하다고 느껴지지 않으며 자기 통제 갈등을 활성화 시키고 이를 다루기 위해 내적 통제를 더 하도록 만들기 때문에(Do Vale, Pieters & Zeelenberg, 2008), 소비자의 초점은 내부에 있게 된다. 이 때 유혹 대안 거절 방식중 자기(self)와 관련된 안정적이고 변하지 않는 상태를 의미하는 “Idon``t”를 사용 할 경우, 목표의 초점이 내재적이고 자기(self)와 관련되어 있기에(Patrick & Hagtvedt, 2012)자기 통제가 더 증가할 것이라 볼 수 있다. 이에 따라, 본 연구는 패키지 사이즈를 제공할 때 떠오르는 초점에 맞춰 유혹 대안 거절 방식을 함께 표상할 때 더욱 더 효과적으로 자기 통제를 증진시킬 수 있을 것이라 본다. 연구방법 서울지역에 소재한 대학생 120명을 대상으로 패키지 사이즈(큰/작은) * 유혹 대안 거절 방식(I don``t/I can``t) 설계로 실험을 진행하고자 하였다. 연구결과 첫째, I don``t 프레이밍을 한 집단은 유혹 대안의 패키지 사이즈가 작은 조건보다 큰 조건일 경우에 자기 통제가 증가하였고, 둘째, I can``t 프레이밍을 한 집단은 유혹 대안의 패키지 사이즈가 큰 조건보다 작은 조건일 경우에 자기 통제가 감소하였다. 본 연구는 패키지 사이즈를 제공할 때 떠오르는 초점에 맞춘 유혹 대안 거절 방식을 활용해 더욱 효과적으로 자기 통제를 지속해 나갈 수 있도록 이끄는 방안을 제시했다는 점에서 연구 의의를 가진다.",

      "title": "Influence of Time of Day in the Development of Physiological and Behavioral Drug Dependence in Mice",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a spiraling and debilitating condition that has severe social and economic consequences for the individual and society. Recently, much work has examined the relationship between drug addiction and the circadian timing system. The master circadian pacemaker directs a daily temporal rhythm throughout the brain and body including the consumption of alcohol. Many drugs, including alcohol, can have myriad effects at different times of day. Conversely, alcohol can alter circadian physiology at multiple levels within the system. Few studies, however, have examined the role that the timing of chronic drug exposure and withdrawal plays in the development and maintenance of drug addiction. Alcohol use, for example, follows a circadian pattern with consumption peaking in the early evening in non-dependent individuals and withdrawal likely occurring late at night. In the transition to dependence, however, craving and consumption expand earlier into the day. What consequences this altered timing of drug use plays in the physiological and psychological consequences of drug addiction remains to be seen. Herein, we specifically examine if: 1) controlling for time of day in alcohol exposure/withdrawal can alter the development of physical dependence, 2) the development of psychological dependence, and 3) if time of day can become a conditioned environmental cue that triggers craving and behavioral sensitization in an amphetamine model of addiction",

It is used in our clinic to describe a variable clinical picture and does not have a specific physiological connotation. It does not indicate why the nutrition has failed but simply that it has failed. The orderly process of growth can be retarded in many ways by inadequate or improper nutrition. To evaluate these effects, we need to know as much as possible about the growing process of the child. The growth of the body goes on under our eyes every day. The phenomenon is extremely delicate; yet, because it is so familiar, we think little of it. How do we develop cell by cell from the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe? How is the plan for growth,",

La drogadiccion en sentido amplio, como cualquier comportamiento irregular, se acostumbra a explicar en terminos de disfuncion sociologica (el sistema social, en su defectuosidad, es el que propicia el consumo de drogas), de caracter (las limitaciones de muchos individuos para la integracion social les motiva a usar productos artificiales), o biologica (un deficit de dopamina en la composicion cerebral estimula la ingesta).

      "abstract": "Exercise-associated hyponatraemia (EAH) is a dilutional hyponatraemia that is caused primarily by the intake of hypotonic fluid beyond the dictates of thirst and exacerbated by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion as well as an inability to mobilise osmotically inactive sodium stores. Runners who drink more than to their thirst do so for a reason, and understanding and curtailing this behaviour will probably decrease the incidence of this highly preventable condition.To determine the beliefs about fluid replacement held by runners and whether these beliefs are reflected in hydration behaviours.An online survey was filled out by 197 runners solicited by personal solicitation, e-mail and flyers distributed at three local races in autumn 2009.Most runners (58%) drink only when thirsty. Runners drinking to a set schedule are significantly older, more experienced and faster than those drinking when thirsty. Gastrointestinal distress is the most frequently cited (71.5%) reason to avoid overhydration. Runners have a poor understanding of the physiological consequences of hydration behaviours that frequently reflect messages of advertising.Runners at highest risk of EAH exhibit behaviour that is shaped by their beliefs about the benefits and risks of hydration. These beliefs are frequently based on misconceptions about basic exercise physiology.",

Cette prise deconscience par les pouvoirs publics se traduit dans le projetde loi HPST, couplee a des actions de prevention afin desensibiliser les jeunes aux dangers lies a l’exces d’alcool.Mots cles Alcoolisme · Adolescence · IvresseAbstract Binge drinking refers to an alcohol intake of atleast 5 drinks on a single occasion and in a limited period oftime (less than two hours). Most of the time, binge drinkingoccurs during weekend evenings. The only goal of the bingedrinker is to get drunk, whatever quantity of alcohol isneeded. This behavior usually begins around 12-13 years ofage, and dramatically increases after high school, in thecontext of parties. The 18-25 age range represents almosthalf of binge drinking prevalence. Maintenance of thisbehavior after 25 could be a predictive factor of futurealcohol dependence; about 50% of binge drinkers becomedependent. Health care professionals have an important roleto play, not only during routine visits, but particularly afteran accident or suicide attempt. Adolescents should beroutinely asked about their alcohol drinking behavior, inorder to give them the opportunity to talk freely about theirproblems. Once problems are recognized, they should bereferred to the appropriate forums. Parents should beinvolved in the therapeutic process whenever possible.Recent public awareness of the binge drinking problem hasled to government action, together with prevention activitiesoriented towards the youth.Keywords Alcoholism · Adolescence · IntoxificationEn 2006, pres de 80 millions d’Europeensâgesdeplusde15 ans reconnaissaient avoir recours au binge drinking,consommationexcessived ’alcoolquiapourbutl etatd ivresse.Repandu chez les adolescents et developpe au cours deces 20 dernieres annees au Royaume-Uni, le binge drinkingetait tellement populaire que l’on a parle de binge Britain.Iln’y a pas de traduction precise en francais, meme si l’onpeut parler de « beuverie express », de « mines », de« defonce », de « cuites » ou de « blindes ».Le binge drinking est une consommation superieure acinq verres d’alcool pris a la suite en un temps limite(inferieur a deux heures), en general lors d’une soireependant un week-end [1-3].

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe lifestyle today is new.We sit with our computers, televisions etc. Usually, we do not carry heavy things.We gain weight and loose muscle strength.Through history the life has included moments with physical efforts.The body has not changed.It still needs physical training and efforts.The person who is untrained gets quickly tired.Therefore it is important to make the efforts regularly.The capacity of the heart to transport oxygen increases and the energy increases with physical training.The muscle condition is important.The mitochondria in the muscles cells may increase with 30-40 % after one month of exercise.With more mitochondria more fat is consumed and less carbohydrate is needed.Consequently, less lactic acid is formed and the blood does not change the pH towards acidosis as easily.Thus, modern people need exercise.You need not to go to a gym or run every day.It is more about having an active life.Take the cycle or walk to the job or to the shop, take the stairs instead of escalator or elevator.The exercise is a part of the natural common life and the body is a tool which needs to be used.It could be enough with 30 minutes of activity to reach physical efforts the heart rate has to increase, maybe to 120 beats/minute.This could be a dilemma for many patients since they have decreased maximal capacity and interacting medication.The training program has to be individualized but the goal is to improve the capacity.If success the daily normal activities feel easier and the patients get more improved trust and comfort.Physical activities mean also better control and less fear of having fall accidents.With a feeling of control there are fewer obstacles.Thus exercise and effort are important to all of us which are true for many people with different diseases.For patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, diabetes mellitus there are often exercise programs but for patients with different stages of chronic kidney disease, CKD, there is no obvious exercise treatment program.However, more and more evidence exists that exercises are important for these patients.The dialysis treatment hours have increased more and more to increase KT/V, the dialysis dose, but this also means less time for activities like exercise, work, family life and spear time.How could we help these patients?www.intechopen.comProgress in Hemodialysis -From Emergent Biotechnology to Clinical Practice 430 Hence, this chapter is chosen with the intention to provide the reader with information concerning exercise capacity and level of physical activity in adults with chronic kidney disease.It also has the aim to make health-care providers within renal medicine aware of exercise training as an evidence-based intervention to improve health and well-being in adults with CKD.Despite the fact that exercise training is easy, cost effective and preventive, exercise training has not been implemented into clinical practice.We hope that this chapter will stimulate to action and provide some knowledge about these patients and their problems in order to understand why exercise training should be included in the standard care for adults with CKD.The chapter also contains general information about exercise and expected effects in healthy individuals.",

      "title": "Role of leucine on muscle preservation during weight loss in young and elderly men",
      "abstract": "Overweightness and obesity are a burgeoning health epidemic. Many diets like alternate-day fasting (ADF) are effective in combatting obesity, but most studies are long in duration (8-48 weeks) which can be challenging and demotivating to people trying to lose weight. Importantly, the weight loss attained comes with significant muscle loss, which has dire health consequences especially among seniors who are at risk of developing sarcopenia. To combat muscle loss, dietary protein interventions have been examined. Protein stimulates muscle protein synthesis (MPS), a process that helps construct new muscle protein over time. However, there is evidence that increasing protein intake alone beyond normal recommended levels may not improve muscular outcomes. Leucine has been proposed to be the key driver of MPS and is even shown to reduce muscle protein breakdown. One important benefit of leucine over protein is the need to consume fewer overall nutrients and calories to attain the same MPS response: around 2-4 g of leucine maximises MPS compared to 20-40 g of protein. While absolute doses (e.g., 2-4 g) have been examined, a more useful and individualised leucine dose adjusted to body mass (e.g., g/kg) has not been determined. Additionally, the dose-response of different leucine amounts on muscular outcomes have not been investigated. In this doctoral thesis, a preliminary study was first conducted to ascertain short-term ADFâ€™s effects on weight loss and muscle loss. The results show that short-term ADF over just four weeks is effective in promoting weight and fat loss. However, it also led to significant muscle loss which was not attenuated by increased protein intake on the fasting day. Study 1 was then conducted to examine the efficacy of body mass-adjusted leucine doses on muscle preservation during weight loss, to determine if it is possible to lose weight without significant muscle loss through increased leucine intake. There were no significant interactions in changes/responses in body composition and muscular outcomes across groups, indicating that increased leucine intake was not efficacious, and a dose-response was not present, in preserving muscle. In Study 2, the effectiveness of body mass-adjusted leucine or protein supplementation, versus control, on muscular and sarcopenic outcomes during weight loss, was examined, to determine whether it is possible for seniors to lose weight without significant muscle loss through increased leucine and/or protein intake. There were no significant interactions in body composition, muscular or sarcopenic outcomes across groups, indicating that increased leucine or protein intake was not effective in preserving these outcomes. This thesis affirms ADF as a safe and effective weight loss strategy with high adherence rates among young and older men in Singapore. Increased leucine and/or protein intake is not effective in improving body composition and muscular outcomes during weight loss. While dietary leucine and protein have important roles to play, it is speculated that resistance exercise may be even more important to the muscle building/preservation equation. It is proposed that future studies implement a resistance exercise protocol when investigating the role of body mass-adjusted leucine doses on body composition and muscular outcomes.",

      "title": "Is Fast Food Addictive?",
      "abstract": "Studies of food addiction have focused on highly palatable foods. While fast food falls squarely into that category, it has several other attributes that may increase its salience. This review examines whether the nutrients present in fast food, the characteristics of fast food consumers or the presentation and packaging of fast food may encourage substance dependence, as defined by the American Psychiatric Association. The majority of fast food meals are accompanied by a soda, which increases the sugar content 10-fold. Sugar addiction, including tolerance and withdrawal, has been demonstrated in rodents but not humans. Caffeine is a \"model\" substance of dependence; coffee drinks are driving the recent increase in fast food sales. Limited evidence suggests that the high fat and salt content of fast food may increase addictive potential. Fast food restaurants cluster in poorer neighborhoods and obese adults eat more fast food than those who are normal weight. Obesity is characterized by resistance to insulin, leptin and other hormonal signals that would normally control appetite and limit reward. Neuroimaging studies in obese subjects provide evidence of altered reward and tolerance. Once obese, many individuals meet criteria for psychological dependence. Stress and dieting may sensitize an individual to reward. Finally, fast food advertisements, restaurants and menus all provide environmental cues that may trigger addictive overeating. While the concept of fast food addiction remains to be proven, these findings support the role of fast food as a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations.",

      "abstract": "Consumption By Christa Ahrens Abstract Lifestyle choices of college students influence their risk of obesity and/or developing chronic heart disease later in life. Many students gain weight during college due to decreased exercise, overeating, and poor nutritional choices. Exercise may increase food consumption and/or the consumption of unhealthy foods due to compensation. The purpose of the study was to determine if individuals who discussed exercise-related topics would compensate by taking more food after the exercise session than those who discussed entertainment-related topics. Sixteen female college students were randomly assigned to participate in either the exerciserelated or entertainment-related conversations while working out, both consisting of power walking at the same absolute intensity for the same duration. To determine if there was a difference in food intake between groups, the calories of the snacks that subjects took after their session were recorded. The subjects who participated in the session that had exercise-related conversations had a significantly higher intake of food than the subjects in the entertainmentrelated conversation session. In conclusion, individuals may compensate with food more if are talking about exercise-related topics than entertainment related topics while exercising.",

      "abstract": "Women may have difficulty maintaining smoking cessation efforts due to negative affect and fear of weight gain. Dieting smokers who rely on cigarettes for affect regulation and weight management may be especially prone to weight gain and smoking relapse following initial smoking abstinence. The present study, which included 82 women smokers, assessed the relationship between dieting status, self-efficacy, and temptation to smoke and eat following a depressing or elating mood induction. Women with high levels of dietary restraint (i.e., more dieting behavior) had more confidence in their ability to refrain from smoking when in the elated mood condition, and they were more tempted to smoke when in the depressed condition. At low levels of dietary restraint (i.e., less dieting behavior), depressed or elated mood condition appeared to have little impact on women's confidence to refrain from smoking or their temptation to smoke. Dieting status seems to moderate the impact of positive and negative mood states, especially with respect to women's smoking behavior. These findings may have implications for dieters who are trying to quit smoking and also maintain their weight.",

Energy expenditure is the energy released by the body as heat and consists of three major components: basal metabolic rate, the thermic effect of food, and the energy expended in physical activity. Women who are very active in their sport and have low calorie intakes should be evaluated for adequate nutrient intake and the possibility for eating disorders.

      "title": "Hardening is dead, long live softening; time to focus on reducing disparities in smoking",
      "abstract": "The hardening hypothesis proposes that as smoking prevalence declines, the proportion of ‘hard-core’ or ‘hardened’ smokers increases. The intuitively plausible logic is that less addicted and more motivated smokers are more likely to quit, leaving behind a growing proportion of ‘hardened’ smokers. If true, the hypothesis has implications for policy formulation and smoking cessation practice. For example, smokefree policies, health promotion campaigns and smoking cessation support services may need to be modified to ensure they reach and support quitting among the growing proportion of hardened smokers. Also, hardening would strengthen the justification for harm reduction strategies due to the need to provide less harmful alternatives to the increasing proportion of ‘hardened’ smokers who struggle to quit.\n\nThere are many ways in which hardening could manifest, creating multiple hypotheses which can be tested. For example, the population of smokers could become: (1) more highly addicted (eg, an increase in heavier or more dependent smokers); (2) less motivated to quit (eg, more smokers with no or low intention to quit, not making quit attempts or with lower self-efficacy about quitting); and (3) increasingly disadvantaged and marginalised (eg, more smokers who are disadvantaged or have mental health conditions). The net effect should be a reduced rate of quitting among the smoking population over time.\n\nSo what is the evidence for hardening? Most studies that have looked at the different aspects of hardening, either singly or in combination, are repeated surveys from the same population. Investigations from a variety of countries have generally found little or no …",

      "abstract": "Several epidemiological studies have observed an inverse relationship between people's habitual frequency of eating and body weight, leading to the suggestion that a 'nibbling' meal pattern may help in the avoidance of obesity. A review of all pertinent studies shows that, although many fail to find any significant relationship, the relationship is consistently inverse in those that do observe a relationship. However, this finding is highly vulnerable to the probable confounding effects of post hoc changes in dietary patterns as a consequence of weight gain and to dietary under-reporting which undoubtedly invalidates some of the studies. We conclude that the epidemiological evidence is at best very weak, and almost certainly represents an artefact. A detailed review of the possible mechanistic explanations for a metabolic advantage of nibbling meal patterns failed to reveal significant benefits in respect of energy expenditure. Although some short-term studies suggest that the thermic effect of feeding is higher when an isoenergetic test load is divided into multiple small meals, other studies refute this, and most are neutral. More importantly, studies using whole-body calorimetry and doubly-labelled water to assess total 24 h energy expenditure find no difference between nibbling and gorging. Finally, with the exception of a single study, there is no evidence that weight loss on hypoenergetic regimens is altered by meal frequency. We conclude that any effects of meal pattern on the regulation of body weight are likely to be mediated through effects on the food intake side of the energy balance equation.",

      "abstract": "Research evidence is suggestive of a strength model of self-control, also known as ego depletion, in social psychological literature. Engaging in an initial task of self-control depletes a limited resource, resulting in less self-control on a subsequent, unrelated task. The strength model of self-control has been applied to many practical, everyday situations, such as eating behaviors among dieters. Newer studies suggest that blood glucose is the resource consumed during acts of self-control. Consuming glucose seems to \"replete\" individuals who have been depleted, improving performance and self-control. The current study aimed to examine the effects of ego-depletion on restrained eaters. The hypothesis was that restrained eaters who were depleted by a task of self-control would exhibit more disinhibition on a taste-test task than would restrained eaters who were not depleted. However, if the participants were given glucose following the depletion task, then their self-control would be \"repleted\" and they would exhibit similar control to that of the non-depleted participants. Contrary to expectations there were no differences between the groups in terms of total amount of cookies consumed. These results are inconsistent with a glucose model of self-control. Suggestions for future research and implications of the findings are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Regular physical exercise belongs to the non pharmacological tools for the control of high blood pressure. When practising it almost daily at low intensity during 30 minutes, and mainly on a dynamic mode, blood pressure can decrease almost of the same order of magnitude as with an antihypertensive drug. In severe hypertension, blood pressure must be first controlled by drugs before starting the physical exercise training. An exercise test is preferable before exercise suggestion in sedentary people older than 40 years. In hypertensive people who enter sportive competition, diuretics and betablockers are forbidden. These agents can also reduce performance.",

      "title": "Consecuencias neuropsicológicas del consumo intensivo de alcohol (binge drinking) en jóvenes universitarios",
      "abstract": "En Espana, el consumo de alcohol se ha asociado tradicionalmente a la poblacion adulta y se ha caracterizado por la regularidad de su uso, la vinculacion a la dieta y a los acontecimientos sociales. Sin embargo, los ultimos informes del Observatorio Espanol sobre Drogas han destacado la emergencia de un nuevo patron de consumo de alcohol con una gran prevalencia entre adolescentes y jovenes adultos. Esta forma de consumir se caracteriza por la ingesta de grandes cantidades de alcohol en cortos espacios de tiempo, principalmente en fin de semana, que suele llevar a la embriaguez. La literatura anglosajona denomina mayoritariamente a este patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol binge drinking (BD) o heavy episodic drinking (HED).\nEstudios realizados recientemente mediante modelos animales apuntan a una mayor vulnerabilidad del cerebro adolescente a los efectos neurotoxicos del alcohol, debido a la importante reestructuracion estructural y funcional que sufre el cerebro durante esta etapa, que en humanos abarca la segunda decada de la vida. Ademas, parece que el patron de consumo BD puede resultar significativamente mas danino para el cerebro que el consumo regular de alcohol.\n Sin embargo, a pesar de estos preocupantes datos y de la alta prevalencia del patron BD, el estudio de las posibles consecuencias neuropsicologicas asociadas a este modo de consumo es todavia escaso, no existiendo resultados concluyentes al respecto.\n El presente estudio tiene por objetivo principal determinar las consecuencias neuropsicologicas asociadas al patron de consumo BD en estudiantes universitarios de primer ano de carrera. Para ello, administramos una amplia bateria de pruebas neuropsicologicas que nos han permitido valorar diferentes funciones cognitivas. Los resultados muestran que los jovenes BD presentan, en relacion con sus pares No BD, un menor rendimiento en tarea que impliquen: memoria de trabajo verbal, memoria declarativa episodica verbal (tanto de forma inmediata como demorado) y funcionamiento ejecutivo (mayor susceptibilidad a la interferencia proactiva, menor flexibilidad cognitiva, y mayores dificultades de planificacion). Asimismo, tambien se ha comprobado que con una historia de consumo breve (media de cuatro anos), la vulnerabilidad a los efectos neurotoxicos del alcohol entre jovenes con patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol es semejante para ambos sexos.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung. Ernährungsempfehlungen stehen auf wackligen Füssen [1, 2]. Dies im Widerspruch zur Wahrnehmung vieler Menschen, dass Gebote und Verbote rund ums Essen und Trinken Dogma-Charakter haben. Da diese von den Medien gebetsmühlenartig wiederholt werden, ohne dass Wert auf Alter, Zahl, Art, Unabhängigkeit und Qualität der ursprünglichen Studien gelegt wird, halten sich vermeintliche Ernährungsweisheiten hartnäckig. Empfehlungen beruhen auf Expertenkonsens, die sich wiederum meistens auf Beobachtungsstudien stützen. Diese Studien haben zahlreiche Schwächen und lassen damit viel Raum für fehlerhafte Resultate und Interpretationen [1,2]. Somit können wir mit einer gewissen Entspanntheit an den Esstisch sitzen und uns auch mal zwischendurch etwas (angeblich) «Ungesundes» gönnen. Dies umso mehr, als dass es wahrscheinlich auch nicht schadet sich an eine Empfehlung zu halten, auch wenn sie nicht fundiert ist. Die Empfehlung täglich 1.5 bis zwei Liter Wasser kann kaum schaden, selbst wenn ihr Nutzen unklar ist [3 – 5]. Wichtig ist aber Augen und Ohren offen halten und Studienresultate kritisch zu werten und zu hinterfragen. Vom Knochen allein wird schliesslich niemand satt. Zugegeben: Manchmal fällt es einem schwer sich von fixen Vorstellungen zu lösen und neue Erkenntnisse anzunehmen: Wer hätte schon vor kurzem noch seinem allergiegefährdeten Kleinkind Erdnüsse zur Prophylaxe vorgesetzt [6]?",

With the necessary elimination of practically all fruits and many vegetables, because of their carbohydrate content, the diet of the diabetic becomes very much restricted and monotonous and undesirably reduced in bulk. The withdrawal of fruits and vegetables from the diet is keenly felt, and the diabetic craves the variety that is furnished by this type of food. The usual analysis of our ordinary food materials gives their percentage composition in terms of so-called protein, fat, carbohydrate, ash and water, and from such data lists of foods have been compiled for the use of the diabetic.

      "abstract": "Este informe desarrolla una hipotesis metabolico-nutricional, explicativa de la posible generacion de\ncasos, aislados pero significativos, de dano hepatico en grupos de poblacion consistentes en consumidores\nde productos adelgazantes de forma incontrolada. Se plantea como alternativa a la imposibilidad\nde poder atribuir una relacion causa-efecto al consumo per se de complementos alimenticios\ny de productos alimenticios destinados a una alimentacion especial, relacionados con dietas de control\nde peso y los danos hepaticos observados en personas expuestas. No parece existir una relacion\nentre las anomalias hepaticas observadas con el consumo de un producto concreto sino, mas bien, los\nefectos adversos se asocian a un determinado tipo de habitos de consumo de algunos de estos productos,\nque tienen en comun el tener atribuidos beneficios para adelgazar y para mejorar el bienestar\ngeneral. Entre este grupo de personas no es infrecuente encontrar ejemplos de comportamientos\npara adelgazar de forma muy rapida, con combinaciones de esfuerzos de privacion de alimentos, con\nalteracion de otros habitos alimentarios y/o con la ingesta de diversos extractos botanicos o de productos\nde sintesis o, en general, ingesta de suplementos alimenticios a los que se atribuyen esperanzadoras\npropiedades adelgazantes.\nSe plantea aqui la potencial relacion de los danos hepaticos observados con una respuesta hepatica,\nhasta cierto punto fisiologica pero anomala o exacerbada por la excesiva liberacion de grasa en\nperiodos de movilizacion acelerada de los depositos del tejido adiposo. Asi, se plantea que el exceso\nde acidos grasos captados por el higado, en presencia de una limitada capacidad de metabolizacion\ny/o de reexportacion de trigliceridos, en personas sensibles puede incrementar la infiltracion grasa, la\nformacion de un higado graso (esteatosis); en general una alteracion suave y reversible y, de continuar,\nuna posible progresion inflamatoria a esteatohepatitis, es decir con danos hepaticos ya muy serios.\nNumero de referencia: AESAN-2009-001\nDocumento aprobado por el Comite Cientifico en\nsu sesion plenaria de 21 de enero de 2009\nGrupo de Trabajo\nAndreu Palou Oliver (Coordinador)\nCatalina Pico Segura (Consultora externa)\nMa Luisa Bonet Pina (Consultora externa)\nConcepcion Becerril Moral (AESAN)\nMiembros del Comite Cientifico\nAndreu Palou Oliver, Juan Jose Badiola Diez, Arturo Anadon Navarro,\nAlbert Bosch Navarro, Juan Francisco Cacho Palomar, Ana Maria Camean\nFernandez, Alberto Cepeda Saez, Lucas Dominguez Rodriguez, Rosaura\nFarre Rovira, Manuela Juarez Iglesias, Francisco Martin Bermudo, Manuel\nMartin Esteban, Albert Mas Baron, Teresa Ortega Hernandez-Agero,\nAndres Otero Carballeira, Perfecto Paseiro Losada, Daniel Ramon Vidal,\nElias Rodriguez Ferri, Ma Carmen Vidal Carou, Gonzalo Zurera Cosano\nSecretario\nJesus Campos Amado\nInforme del Comite Cientifico de la Agencia Espanola de Segu -\nridad Alimentaria y Nutricion (AESAN) sobre una hipotesis metabolica\nrelativa a la hepatotoxicidad asociada al consumo de ciertos\ncomplementos alimenticios y a productos alimenticios destinados\na una alimentacion especial, relacionados con dietas de control\nde peso\nSe analiza esta posibilidad a la luz de los antecedentes sobre los casos detectados, la informacion\nsobre las propiedades toxicologicas de algunos complementos alimenticios y de productos alimenticios\ndestinados a una alimentacion especial relacionados con dietas de control de peso, la etiologia\ny condicionantes del higado graso y el estado actual del conocimiento sobre el metabolismo de las\ngrasas y las interrelaciones higado-tejido adiposo. Se concluye que es bastante plausible que los casos\nobservados puedan obedecer, al menos en parte, al stress hepatico que, en personas especialmente\nmas sensibles, es ocasionado por un exceso de disponibilidad de acidos grasos en respuesta a unas\ncondiciones de incrementada lipolisis y movilizacion de la grasa almacenada en el tejido adiposo. En\nestas personas, la incapacidad de metabolizar el exceso de acidos grasos, ni suficientemente de modo\nparcial (formando y exportando cuerpos cetonicos), junto a la limitacion para la sintesis de lipoproteinas\n(VLDL) y asi re-exportar la grasa hacia otros tejidos; todo ello llevaria a una alternativa metabolica\ndesequilibrante, desesestabilizadora de la homeostasis hepatica, y acumular el exceso de trigliceridos\nen las propias celulas hepaticas (higado graso). El propio exceso de cuerpos cetonicos, por su\ncaracter anorexigenico, tambien podria contribuir en estas personas a acentuar esta respuesta anomala,\nal facilitar una menor ingesta energetica, incrementar consecuentemente los procesos lipoliticos\ny asi la captacion hepatica y la infiltracion grasa de los hepatocitos. En ciertos casos determinados\n(tales como una mayor susceptibilidad por razones geneticas o adquiridas, o la propia condicion\nde resistencia a la insulina) la respuesta puede resultar aun mas exacerbada y desestabilizadora. En\ncasos mas extremos, las condiciones pueden incluso progresar hasta cuadros claros de esteatohepatitis,\ncuyas caracteristicas pueden asimilarse (al menos en parte) con las descritas y que serian, en\ngran parte, reversibles, al desaparecer las condiciones desencadenantes (adelgazamiento rapido).\nCabe recomendar que en este tipo de productos se incluya un aviso sobre posibles riesgos para la\nsalud asociados a las perdidas muy aceleradas de peso.",

From all these new enhancements in the real world it has been quite hard for them to keep up with everything evolving around them. Keeping all this in mind they work day in and out to make sure that their knowledge on their surroundings up to date, however we believe that they fail to properly take care of themselves in the process. No matter how much a certain individual may withstand in terms of workload, stress, or other mental & emotional barriers our physical body will always be the key aspect to overcoming them. Most people believe that working out and maintaining physical fitness are the major aspects to sustain a healthy physical form but they simply overlook the most important aspect which are their eating habits. Although our body may be physically fit, the nourishment of our body depends on the eating styles that we follow on a day to day basis. Food is what nourishes our body with most of the proteins & minerals that we require, without it we wouldn't be able to accomplish much. On conducting a worldwide research on people's lifestyles we were able to conclude that over the past 33 years the obesity rate among human beings has increased by a mere 27.5%. What seems to be the most thoughtful yet intriguing fact is that although many people are overweight as well as obese they still believe that their eating habits are healthy. Most people are living in the dilemma of the fact that they maintain a healthy lifestyle. We aim to study the views on a healthy lifestyle as per the norms of our current generation. We would like to analyse their daily eating habits as well as their own thoughts on their lifestyle. So the question that remains is... \"What exactly is a Healthy Eating Lifestyle?\".",

      "title": "Drop It Like It Is Fat",
      "abstract": "“No dessert until you finish your dinner.” The words flew out of my mouth without stopping at the frontal lobe to collect a few synapses. My five-year-old gave a motivated nod and polished off his plate in record time, earning a solid reward of 200 empty calories. In turn, I learned I was incredibly effective at teaching bad lessons. Growing up, my mother made a permanent impression on me to not waste food. This mindset prevails for many. “Eat! There are people starving in ...,” parents everywhere drone in unison. However ridiculous this argument is economically, the psychological drive to not let a valuable commodity go to waste is overpowering. In addition to unhealthy food content, does the urge to polish the plate contribute to the obesity epidemic? As an emergency physician, I deal daily with devastating health problems related to obesity. I empathize with my patients’ weight struggles, which persist despite a plethora of complex diets, calorie counting tools, medications, and public health efforts. Many emergency physicians believe that a health problem as huge as obesity (pun intended) is simply beyond our scope of practice, choosing to ignore this fundamental source of many patients’ emergency presentations. Perhaps emergency physicians should stand up to the challenge when we talk to our patients: “When cooking or buying food you are probably hungry and get more than you actually need. What stops you, once you are full, from pushing the plate away with food still on it? Do you hear a voice whispering, ‘No dessert until you finish ...?’ You know about making healthy food choices. In addition, there is a trick you can use to just eat less. Halfway through your meal, consider the benefits of stopping. Being in control of your body empowers you. Use the impulse, walk over to the trash with your leftovers, and ‘DROP IT LIKE IT’S FAT.’ Maybe you can also buy and cook smaller portions in the future. I strongly recommend seeing your doctor and a dietitian for professional assistance with your efforts. Best of luck on your journey to better health.” The pitch takes 30 seconds, which I consider well spent. Most of my patients are intrigued and promise to follow up and try the technique. Many are surprised that the emergency physician cares about this. I respond that I care about their future health. As a specialty we may be well served to consider obesity a fundamental emergency within our scope of practice that deserves a conscientious approach. We need research into the most effective and practical methods to empower our efforts. For now, I will suggest my patients drop it like it’s fat.",

A search for potentially treatable causes of constipation should always be undertaken, with particular attention being paid to diet, disability, drug use, metabolic causes and anorectal disorders. The diagnosis can usually be made from the history and physical findings, although a plain x-ray of the abdomen is often helpful. Constipation of recent onset deserves a thorough investigation, particularly when it occurs in association with other lower gut symptoms. Most elderly patients complaining of a recent onset of constipation will respond to advice, attention to diet, fibre supplementation and increased mobility. An increase in fibre intake should be complemented with an adequate fluid intake. An osmotic laxative may be required for long standing refractory constipation, but stimulant and other non-osmotic laxatives should be avoided. (author abstract)",

      "abstract": "Appetite is the desire to satisfy the need to consume food, felt as hunger. It is regulated by the balance of food intake and energy expenditure via signals between the brain, the digestive tract and the adipose tissue. Males and females vary in terms of eating behavior as well as the way the body fat is stored. Energy balance and body fat distribution are part of the sexual dimorphism in many mammalian species including human beings. These sex dissimilarities could be related to the different sex steroid hormone profile in each sex. Gonadal steroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis. Human epidemiological and experimental animal studies have shown that estradiol has a key role in the control of food intake and energy balance. Estradiol has long been known to inhibit feeding in animals. There are important changes in food intake patterns during the estrous cycle, with a reduction of food intake around the time of ovulation, when estradiol presents its highest levels. Men have less total fat and more central fat distribution which carries a much greater risk for metabolic disorders while women have more total fat and more gluteal/femoral subcutaneous fat distribution. Men and postmenopausal women accumulate more fat in the intraabdominal depot. This review is focused on the mechanism by which sex steroids affect feeding behavior and fat distribution. Keywords: Gonadal steroid, appetite, food intake, estradiol, leptin, insulin, neuropeptide, adiponectin, CART",

Healthy adults are generally highly resistant to attempts to lose body fat, which stores a remarkably constant amount of energy overall. Normally, highly precise controls work to ensure that energy expenditure and energy intake are matched (energy homeostasis), so that there is neither net loss nor net gain of body energy stores. In the patient with advanced cancer, however, a failure to maintain food intake relative to energy expenditure results in a failure to maintain energy homeostasis and is a primary contributor to involuntary weight loss. Reported levels of food intake in weight-losing patients with cancer are often lower than the basal metabolic rate of the same or similar patient populations.",

The act of eating, although necessary for the provision of energy, is a particularly disruptive event in a homeostatic sense. Just as humans learn responses to help them tolerate the administration of dangerous drugs, so do they learn to make anticipatory responses that help minimize the impact of meals on the body, to limit the amount of food consumed within any individual meal, to recruit several parts of the protective stress-response system while meals are being processed, and to limit postprandial behaviors so as to minimize the possibility of disrupting homeostatic systems even more. It is further hypothesized that defenses against eating too much may become activated inappropriately and contribute to clinical problems such as reactive hypoglycemia.",

This imbalance can result from either overeating or a constitutional decrease in one or several of the components of energy expenditure: resting metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis, or exercise-related thermogenesis. Decreased energy expenditure is probably at least partly genetic in origin, contributing to the significant clustering of obesity in families. Management aims at reducing the imbalance by decreasing the caloric intake. Once the desired weight is achieved, intake must be adjusted to expenditure to avoid weight regain.",

      "abstract": "Research shows that problem behaviors manifested early tend to persist into later life. Problem drinking does not necessarily commit the young adolescent to a life course of this behavior, but it does alter the probabilities. Conversely, early abstinence is a strong predictor of later healthful behavior. An important observation is that alcohol and other drug use tends to decrease along with smoking decreases. Young adolescents tend to believe that most of their peers engage in a particular type of behavior whether that is the actual case or not. There is a tendency across populations of adolescents to overestimate such behaviors by a factor of six or eight. In one study, school children estimated that about two-thirds of their peers smoked while the actual figure was about one-tenth. Adolescents tend to have weak orientation to the future, especially in regard to consequences of risk-taking behavior. College-bound adolescents tend to have a longer view of the future than those who do not pursue college, but in general adolescents think, \"It can't happen to me,\" or, \"It's so far off that I just can't think about it.\" They are focused on the here and now. Many youngsters when they think about it have a dismal view of the future. They are doubtful about their own ability to influence events in ways that build toward a rewarding life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "The high end of medical science is the preservation of health and it can be attained in two ways, first of all by eradicating the diseases, which may invade the body, secondly by due observation of such rules as would keep away the disease.Ayurveda elaborate about different dietary regimens including recopies advocated for health promotion, prevention of illness and also prescribed for management of diseases as well which further provide a great scope for the development of nutraceuticals and dietary supplements. Rasayanas are the foods, therapies or practices that are conducive and beneficial to body tissues and its functions. Diet plays an important role in keeping our mind healthy and explicit psycho-pharmacological effects of food led to classification of food in to following 3 categories. 1. Satvik diet: ideal diet containing vegetarian, non-oily, non-spicy articles which are congenial to the body and mind. 2. Rajasik diet: too spicy, hot, sour, salty; excite the mental faculties.3. Tamsik diet: too oily and heavy food. But in the age of systems biology, personalised medicine, and the wider context of a more holistic transition in sciences generally, modern knowledge is reinventing and advancing a number of these ideas. Transdisciplinary study could be important for advancing the fields of food and health sciences as well as for offering real-world remedies for current health issues. This article highlights the need for a deeper engagement with traditional knowledge systems, such as Ayurveda, by quickly reviewing the similarities between Ayurveda and Technology.",

I happen to know two persons who are made ill by eating cake or other food containing egg,-never by eating eggs themselves, because neither could be bribed to taste them willingly. Not a few have to pay the penalty of total abstinence from some delicacy for having once indulged in a surfeit of it. Possibly the majority of us have discovered some generally wholesome article of diet which it is prudence on our part to avoid. One of the theories offered to explain some of these vagaries of digestion is that many kinds of food, particularly those for which a taste has to be acquired, contain substances-call them poisons if you like-which our leucocytes have to learn to neutralize. Another theory is that in the chemical laboratory of the digestive system there are made a great variety of compounds; in exceptional cases or under exceptional circumstances, some of these may be poisonous enough to cause auto-intoxication. The imagination, too, sometimes exercises a remarkable influence upon the digestive organs. Workers in a logging camp are not apt to be squeamish. I knew of a case where one of a number of them who had just disposed very acceptably of a deep pie, on being informed of the kind of meat it contained, was immediately seized with violent mal de mer.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is an appearance of psychical or physical (metabolic) addiction of alcohol or some other medium. Beside from being addicted to some psychoactive substance, we can see more and more people in recent years whose addiction has developed from some activity or frequent behaviour, that is now shifting from obsession to obsessive and addictive behaviour. Among these types of addictions, is also the addiction to the games of chance (dices) that can be manifest itself precisely through betting. Today, very few people actually know what it is and what kind of addiction it is, often not looking at it as such and not realizing that it leads to considerably big problems and consequences, even greater than dependence on some psychoactive substance. Addictive betting is sometimes referred to as a concealed disease because the physical symptoms are not visible, but are projected to almost the entire psychological condition of the psychological condition of the addict himself. If we look at just a little around the world around us, we can see how more and more open sports betting today and notice how the dice literally offers itself and watches at each step to find someone to devour. Unfortunately, sports bookmakers have become increasingly frequent places where people of all ages and sex groups spend their free time, fooling themselves of just having a little fun and killing boredom. That originally lying to ourselves, becoming more and more reflected in other aspects of life in which the family is most affected. The awareness of how dangerous this addiction is, derives from the fact that an addict who is blind and trapped begins to commit violence against his spouse and children. The child, though is very small, notice that something is wrong with his family, when there is no joy and laughter in the house, but tears and tears have become a sad reality everyday. Often because of the suppression of the problem and the avoidance of being confronted with it, parents become locked in themselves, in this way they obviously ignoring their own child by denying his time, attention, and love. The child then begins to feel guilty and thinks the family breaks down just because of it. From feeling guilty, emotional (anger depression, anxiety, hopelessness), physical disturbances (asthma allergies, chronic headaches) and behavioural disorders are beginning develop in the child. Parents are the most powerful model of behaviour for their children, so a child who experienced trauma because of addiction by one or both parents can start modelling such behaviours, and they could also start to play games of chances. In order to solve the problem in time, we must take the first step, look to the truth in the eye, acknowledge the problem and seek help through treatment through various prevention programs and specially designed therapies.",

Vegans, and anyone who significantly limits intake of animal-based foods, require vitamin B12-fortified foods or supplements. Vitamin B12 deficiency has several stages and may be present even if a person does not have anaemia. Anyone following a vegan or vegetarian diet should have their vitamin B12 status regularly assessed to identify a potential problem. A useful process for assessing vitamin B12 status in clinical practice is the combination of taking a diet history, testing serum vitamin B12 level and testing homocysteine, holotranscobalamin II or methylmalonic acid serum levels. Pregnant and lactating vegan or vegetarian women should ensure an adequate intake of vitamin B12 to provide for their developing baby. In people who can absorb vitamin B12, small amounts (in line with the recommended dietary intake) and frequent (daily) doses appear to be more effective than infrequent large doses, including intramuscular injections. Fortification of a wider range of foods products with vitamin B12, particularly foods commonly consumed by vegetarians, is likely to be beneficial, and the feasibility of this should be explored by relevant food authorities.",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores the role of water as an essential nutrient and the physiological basis of hydration. In hydration science, the effect of any beverage on body fluid status is judged by the balance between how much the body retains of any volume that is consumed. Since most fluid consumed by athletes is co-ingested with meals and/or snacks, the influence of food on rehydration has significant practical application. A low-alcohol beer with added sodium may provide a compromise to the dehydrated athlete following exercise, in that it is a beverage with high social acceptance that avoids the poor fluid retention observed with full-strength beer. The timing of consumption relative to the exercise bout has a significant influence on beverage recommendations given to athletes to optimise performance. Exercise can also elicit high electrolyte losses through the sweating response, particularly in warm to hot conditions.",

      "title": "El paradigma de la obesidad",
      "abstract": "Mucho se viene publicando en los ultimos meses sobre el alarmante aumento de las tasas de obesidad en todos los grupos de edad, pero muy especialmente en ninos y adolescentes. Los cientificos veniamos dando la voz de alarma desde hace mas de una decada, pero no es hasta que el problema ha tenido unas dimensiones que afectan a mas de una cuarta parte de la poblacion, cuando el tema ha trascendido a la opinion publica. En un articulo que a mi me gusta mucho citar, los australianos Egger y Swinburn (1997) ya proponen un cambio en la orientacion tanto del problema como de la solucion. El individuo con sobrepeso u obeso, hasta entonces culpabilizado y demonizado por no saber controlar su apetito que le ha llevado a tener una adiposidad superior a la deseada, se convierte segun estos autores en victima. No es el individuo el que esta respondiendo mal a un entorno y una situacion adecuada, sino que el individuo responde a un entorno que favorece el desarrollo de la obesidad (ambiente obesogenico). Por citar unos ejemplos: poco se puede hacer para tomar 5 frutas y verduras al dia si estos productos son de los mas caros del mercado o dificilmente se puede ir en bicicleta al trabajo si el urbanismo no ha previsto carriles-bici (contaminacion aparte). Este planteamiento es la base sobre la que se han formulado el programa NAOS del Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo, y los programas similares que han puesto en marcha la mayoria de gobiernos de la Union Europea. Sin duda, un gran paso en la direccion correcta, al que se han sumado muchas empresas de alimentacion, restauracion, publicidad, etc. Si no es entre todos, jamas podremos frenar el aumento de la obesidad.

      "abstract": "The effect of drug on a person may be different than expected because that drug interacts with another drug the person is taking (drug-drug interaction), food, beverages, dietary supplements the person is consuming (drug-nutrient/food interaction) or another disease the person has (drug-disease interaction). A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance affects the activity of a drug, i.e. the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce a new effect that neither produces on its own. These interactions may occur out of accidental misuse or due to lack of knowledge about the active ingredients involved in the relevant substances. Regarding food-drug interactions physicians and pharmacists recognize that some foods and drugs, when taken simultaneously, can alter the body's ability to utilize a particular food or drug, or cause serious side effects. Clinically significant drug interactions, which pose potential harm to the patient, may result from changes in pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic properties. Some may be taken advantage of, to the benefit of patients, but more commonly drug interactions result in adverse drug events. Therefore it is advisable for patients to follow the physician and doctors instructions to obtain maximum benefits with least food-drug interactions. The literature survey was conducted by extracting data from different review and original articles on general or specific drug interactions with food. This review gives information about various interactions between different foods and drugs and will help physicians and pharmacists prescribe drugs cautiously with only suitable food supplement to get maximum benefit for the patient.",

      "abstract": "Obesity, like baseball, is a game of inches. Weight gain cannot occur unless energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. Such positive energy balance is a sine qua non for normal growth in the child, and for obesity in the adult. Very small excesses of intake over expenditure can make a big difference if present over a long period of time. Consider the children in the study reported by Klesges et al1 elsewhere in this journal (pages 126-130). At about 4½ years of age, these children were estimated (by diet history) to have been ingesting about 2000 kcal per day. This is almost certainly an overestimate of the actual caloric intake of these children (see below).",

      "title": "Coca Chewing and High-Altitude Stress: A Spurious Correlation [and Comments and Reply]",
      "abstract": "Because the main present-day centres of coca chewing are in the high altiplano regions of Peru and Bolivia, it has been widely assumed that the habit evolved primarily as a response to the stresses of life at high altitudes. When archaeological, ethnohistorical, and botanical sources of evidence are considered, a different emphasis emerges. Before the European conquest, coca was chewed everywhere from Nicaragua to Chile and at all altitudes. This pattern goes back to at least 2000 B.C. in coastal Peru and Ecuador and has considerable time-depth elsewhere. Even today, coca taking is linked not primarily with high-altitude life, but with the survival of traditional Indian culture. Apart from its role in indigenous culture, coca is everywhere regarded as a stimulant conferring resistance against hunger, thirst, and fatigue, none of which is specifically a high-altitude problem. Pharmacological data confirm that coca acts as a general stimulant by preventing the removal of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline from its site of action. This action resembles the effect of drugs used in medicine to treat depression and, more distantly, the action of caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee.",

      "abstract": "D ass in unseren Kopfen viel geschieht, von dem wir nicht das Geringste mitbekommen, war an dieser Stelle schon mehrfach Thema (12-16). Zudem glaubt jeder zu wissen, dass wir „unbewussten“ Wahrnehmungen unterliegen, die beispielsweise von der Werbewirtschaft geschickt genutzt werden. Als Beispiel wird nicht selten die Hintergrundmusik genannt, die in den USA auch wallpaper music (Tapetenmusik) genannt wird, weil sie uns uberall wie eine Tapete umgibt. Auch diese Musik hat Effekte auf unser Verhalten, was Supermarkte, Kneipen und Fusballstadien (5) gleichermasen zur Kontrolle der Massen einsetzen. Aber was genau geht in dieser Hinsicht wirklich vor und wie stark sind diese Effekte? Untersuchungen hierzu gibt es seit Jahrzehnten. So fand man, dass die Besucher von Bars mehr Geld ausgeben, wenn Musik lauft (3) und dass die Kunden eines Supermarktes bei lauter Musik nicht so lange (aber genau so viel) einkaufen wie bei leiser Musik, was zunachst positiv gewertet wurde. Man kann mehr Leute durchschleusen, wenn sie sich mit der Auswahl der Waren nicht so lange Zeit lassen (2). Und dies geschieht offenbar, wenn ihnen laute Musik auf die Nerven geht. Ein ahnliches Ergebnis hatte eine Studie von Gueguen und Mitarbeitern in Frankreich, die herausfanden, dass die Besucher einer Bar mehr tranken, wenn die Musik ungewohnlich laut war (4). Nicht nur die Lautstarke der Musik, auch deren Tempo hat messbare Auswirkungen auf das Konsumverhalten der Menschen: Sie sausen rascher durch den Supermarkt, kaufen allerdings auch weniger ein (8). In der Kneipe fuhrt schnelle Musik zu schnellerem Trinken (7) und zum rascheren Essen (mehr Bissen pro Minute; 11). Langsame Musik in Restaurants fuhrt dazu, dass die Besucher langer bleiben und mehr an der Bar ausgeben (9). Die Effekte sind also keineswegs immer ganz einfach zu interpretieren. Wahrscheinlich hangt es nicht zuletzt von derArt des Restaurants ab, wie die Kunden auf welche Musik reagieren. Wer nur rasch Kalorien aufnehmen mochte, der wird durch laute und schnelle Musik womoglich „angepeitscht“ und isst schneller. Wer sich hingegen bei einem schonen Essen entspannen mochte, der wird mit leiser getragener",

Taste aversion learning has received a great deal of attention in recent years because it appears to be an unusually robust type of learning marked by extremely rapid acquisition and a high resistance to extinction. Familiar tastes are relatively resistant to the development of learned food aversions whereas novel tastes rapidly become the target of such aversions. The development of diet aversions in the novel but not the familiar diet group enabled us to assess the potential contribution of learned aversions to the anorexia produced by a chronic, aversive United States (US). The presence of learned aversions in animals with certain tumors indicates that physiological consequences of tumor growth can act as USs in aversion conditioning. The amino acids constitute one group of nutrients known to be influenced by tumor growth.",

To investigate this assumption, the authors compare prices of healthy and less healthy foods using three different price metrics: the price of food energy ($/calorie), the price of edible weight ($/100 edible grams), and the price of an average portion ($/average portion). They also calculate the cost of meeting the recommendations for each food group. For all metrics except the price of food energy, the authors find that healthy foods cost less than less healthy foods (defined for this study as foods that are high in saturated fat, added sugar, and/or sodium, or that contribute little to meeting dietary recommendations).",

But why this is the case is unclear. Across two studies (Study 1: N = 98; Study 2: N = 120), we found that the mere anticipation of social interaction is all that is needed to promote the selection of larger meals, and that this occurs even when a person is alone when they make their decision. Adult women served themselves larger portions when they knew they were going to eat socially versus when they knew they were going to eat alone. These data suggest that how other people influence our food intake reaches beyond the specific eating context to affect pre-meal portion size decisions, suggesting that a fundamental shift is required in our thinking about social influences on eating.",

      "abstract": "A balanced diet is of great importance for health and wellbeing of our body, since it provides us with all the necessary nutrients to function normally. Food supplements, also called nutritional or dietary supplements, are concentrated nutrient sources, which can supplement a regular diet. Food supplements are not intended to prevent or treat illness, although a lot of people confuse them with medications. Todays’ lifestyle, fast way of life, also misconception about the use of dietary supplements, increased the use of food supplements. The purpose of this bachelor's thesis was to find out the attitude adults have towards food supplements. The descriptive research method was used in the research part of the thesis. Results were collected through a survey. The analysis of the results showed, adults know, that food supplements are only a supplement to a regular diet and not a substitute for a balanced diet. However, they are not convinced that food supplements are not really a form of medication. The main reason adults consume food supplements, is their desire for health and desire not to get sick. Many people consume food supplements (especially those with high protein content) due to their increased sports activity. Among food supplements containing vitamins and minerals, most users consume multivitamin preparations, vitamin C and magnesium on daily basis. Based on research results, I can conclude, that it is necessary to raise awareness of food supplements consumption, which should be adjusted according to the needs of the body; and that healthy nutrition is important for general health and wellbeing, while food supplements are only supplement to inadequate nutrition.",

      "title": "A Critical Examination of Dietary Protein Requirements, Benefits, and Excesses in Athletes",
      "abstract": "There is likely no other dietary component that inspires as much debate, insofar as athletes are concerned, as protein. How much dietary protein is required, optimal, or excessive? Dietary guidelines from a variety of sources have settled on an adequate dietary protein intake for those over the age of 19 of ~0.8–0.9 g protein·kg body weight −1 ·d −1 . According to U.S. and Canadian dietary reference intakes (33), the recommended allowance for protein of 0.8 g protein·kg −1 ·d −1 is “the average daily intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all [~98%] . . . healthy individuals” (p. 22). The panel also stated, “in view of the lack of compelling evidence to the contrary, no additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults undertaking resistance or endurance exercise” (33, p. 661). Currently, no group or groups of scientists involved in establishing dietary guidelines see a need for any statement that athletes or people engaging in regular physical activity require more protein than their sedentary counterparts. Popular magazines, numerous Web sites, trainers, and many athletes decry protein intakes even close to those recommended. Even joint position stands from policy-setting groups state that “protein recommendations for endurance athletes are 1.2 to 1.4 g/kg body weight per day, whereas those for resistance and strength-trained athletes may be as high as 1.6 to 1.7 g/kg body weight per day” (1, p. 1544). The divide between those setting dietary protein requirements and those who might be making practical recommendations for athletes appears substantial, but ultimately, most athletes indicate that they consume protein at levels beyond even the highest recommendations. Thus, one might conclude that any debate on protein “requirements” for athletes is inconsequential; however, a critical analysis of existing and new data reveals novel ideas and concepts that may represent some common ground between these apparently conflicted groups. The goal of this review was to provide a critical and thorough analysis of current data on protein requirements in an attempt to provide some guidance to athletes, trainers, coaches, and sport dietitians on athletes’ protein intake. In addition, an effort was made to clearly distinguish between “required” dietary protein, “optimal” intakes, and intakes that are likely “excessive,” perhaps not from the standpoint of health, but certainly from the standpoint of potentially compromised performance.",

But the way they behave to their children makes it likely that their attitudes are a great deal more complicated than that would suggest. Many parents who would be horrified if their 13-year-old went to a party where unlimited alcohol was on offer would think it quite normal to let their child have a glass of wine when the family was having a celebratory meal at home. And why not? In contrast, they would probably not feel at all relaxed if their 19-year-old son or daughter was frequently drunk, drinking to relieve feelings of depression, getting into fights while drunk, or having unprotected sex with numerous different partners while drunk. So the answer to the question about how parents feel about their children and alcohol is not straightforward. Clearly the age of the child in question is a major consideration, but so is the amount drunk and the circumstances in which drinking is taking place.",

Cette analyse explore ce plateau sous l'angle de la balance énergétique et des modifications éventuelles de la dépense d'énergie, de la consommation alimentaire et de l'observance thérapeutique à la restriction alimentaire ainsi que de l'absorption des nutriments. La diminution de la dépense énergétique de repos, modeste, peut le plus souvent être expliquée par les changements de masse. Quand il y a adaptation de la dépense énergétique, ou «coup de frein métabolique», une diminution de dépense plus importante que ne laisse présager la variation de masse apparaît. Ceci n'est pas fréquent dans les situations de restriction calorique modeste et surtout, est difficile à mettre en évidence avec les outils statistiques classiques. Une réduction de la dépense associée à l'activité physique a aussi été décrite. Il est probable que cette adaptation est plus fréquente en cas de restriction calorique sévère. Une diminution de l'adhésion aux mesures diététiques est probable, mais difficile à vérifier. Enfin, une meilleure absorption des nutriments est possible, mais non démontrée. Les études à venir devraient permettre de mieux «typer» les profils de réponse des patients pour affiner les stratégies. L'utilisation d'outils diagnostiques tels que la mesure de la dépense énergétique totale et de repos devrait permettre de comprendre certaines de ces situations de plateau pondéral.",

      "title": "Lifestyle Modification to Promote Weight Loss in the Absence of Energy Restriction",
      "abstract": "With the obesity epidemic showing no signs of abating, there is ongoing interest in altering energy balance (i.e., decreasing energy intake and/or increasing energy expenditure) to promote weight, specifically fat, loss. However, short- and long-term outcomes of, and adherence to, decreasing energy intake are variable, and reports of weight regain are common. There is thus increasing interest, both at the lay public and scientific levels, in lifestyle modifications to promote weight loss in the absence of energy restriction. In this special issue, we present two review papers and three randomized control trials that address such lifestyle modifications.\r\n\r\nThe first paper is a review of weight control strategies and the effects of these strategies on the hormonal responses associated with appetite control and regulation. A. Schwarz et al. conclude that consumption of smaller and more frequent meals comprised of lower fat and moderate protein, normal sleep of 8 hours/day, and control of stressors and psychological stress may help to attenuate the hormonal responses associated with appetite control. This is followed by the review of B. N. Wu and A. J. O'Sullivan, in which the authors stress the importance of considering gender differences in energy metabolism. This conclusion arises from the observation that compared to men, women consume fewer calories per kilogram lean mass and burn fat more preferentially during exercise, suggesting that the relationship between energy consumed and energy expended is different between the genders. The authors attribute the greater fat mass observed in women to ovarian hormones, particularly estrogen, which may promote postprandial conversion of dietary energy into body fat. From these two reviews, we appreciate the influence of lifestyle modification and gender on various aspects of energy balance. This understanding may in turn culminate in strategies to control or reverse fat gain beyond those that emphasize only energy restriction. \r\n\r\nIn line with the dietary recommendations presented in the review of A. Schwarz et al., L. Ferguson-Stegall et al., in the first of three studies presented as part of this special issue, compared the effects of three experimental beverages: low-fat chocolate milk, an isocaloric carbohydrate beverage and a placebo beverage on training adaptation (cycling) of 32 untrained nonobese men and women. After each daily training session, the participants consumed their assigned experimental beverages immediately and again 1 hour after exercise. After 4.5 weeks, the differentials in fat mass loss and lean mass gain at the whole body and trunk levels were greater for the chocolate milk group versus carbohydrate group. The authors attribute this observation to the availability of amino acids in milk for anabolism and muscle mass gain, and the fat-loss-promoting effect of dairy calcium and protein, consistent with Schwarz and colleagues' recommendation for consumption of moderate protein and lower fat foods.\r\n\r\nThe next study, by S. L. Tey et al., examined the effects of daily isocaloric consumption of hazelnuts, chocolate, or potato chips for 12 weeks, compared to a control group receiving no snacks. Participants were 118 nonobese men and women; they were not provided any dietary counselling nor were they instructed to change their diets in any way. Despite the finding of no main effect of treatment, a subanalysis of adherent participants revealed that a higher baseline BMI was associated with a lower waist circumference at 12 weeks in the nut group versus control group. Also, dietary quality improved significantly in the nut group. The authors conclude that nuts can be incorporated into the diet without adversely affecting body weight, while improving overall diet quality. We extend this conclusion with the suggestion that if this observation were to hold over a longer study duration, then nuts might help to reverse the fat gain seen with aging. It is also tempting to suggest that regular consumption of nuts may reduce abdominal obesity in people with higher BMIs, although this requires confirmation.\r\n\r\nIn the final study, M. H. Pedersen et al. randomized 78 overweight adolescent boys to consume bread with fish oil or vegetable oil for 16 weeks. Unlike the previous study, in this study participants were counselled to improve diet and exercise habits. No changes were observed in resting metabolic rate, lipid oxidation, leptin levels, or body composition. However, this does not rule out metabolic benefits of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in adults or adolescents not undergoing their pubertal growth spurt, nor does it rule out the possibility that obese boys with more pronounced metabolic complications may respond more favourably to a fish oil intervention. The lifestyle intervention was successful in decreasing the boys' sugar consumption, but had no impact on physical activity level, which the authors suggest indicates that changing an obviously poor dietary habit is easier than committing to increasing physical activity.\r\n\r\nGiven that weight loss success via energy restriction is difficult to achieve in the short term, with long-term success being even more elusive, novel approaches to control the obesity epidemic are warranted. Taken together, the five papers presented in this special issue support various lifestyle modifications to promote weight loss in the absence of energy restriction, although as with most diet-disease relationships, not consistently so. These modifications may include, but are not limited to, smaller and more frequent meals comprised of lower fat and moderate protein (e.g., dairy products and nuts, the latter of which are high in total fat that may not be highly bioavailable and are low in saturated fats), normal sleep of 8 hours/day, and control of stressors and levels of psychological stress. Further research is required to confirm these associations at various stages of the lifecycle, particularly in obese people.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea C.

      "title": "Roentgenologic Examination of the Digestive Tracts of Infants and Children",
      "abstract": "IN a very young infant, or an unruly older child, it may be necessary to administer the opaque meal through a catheter or stomach tube. In order to facilitate this procedure, as the mixture is usually too thick to flow quickly through a tube attached to a funnel, the meal may be introduced through a syringe attached to the end of the stomach tube. Infants able to nurse from a bottle may have the opaque meal given in this way, using the ordinary feeding formula, and adding to it one part of barium sulphate to about eight parts of food. The quantity of food administered is about that of an average feeding for the age of the child. In children over two years of age, a mixed feeding may be given, such as a cup of cocoa and a dish of cereal to which has been added one part of barium sulphate to eight parts of the substances used. Some children can be tempted to take the barium in ice cream. Occasionally, an older child will take the ordinary barium sulphate cream used in the examination of adults. Whatever food is given, it is advisable to observe fluoroscopically at least a part of it as it passes through the esophagus, in order not to overlook a lesion in this region, such as stricture or cardiospasm. The filled stomach is studied fluoroscopically for evidence of pylorospasm and for the character of the peristaltic waves. The stomach is usually palpated in an endeavor to fill the duodenum. However, this organ rarely shows the typical caplike appearance in very young children. A colon injection is then given, using the same kind of opaque mixture that is used for adults, but in quantity proportionate to the size and age of the child. In a case of megacolon, which may have been disclosed in the course of the opaque meal examination, an unusually large amount of injection may be required. This may be determined by watching through the horizontal fluoroscope the injection flow into the bowel. Stereoscopic roentgenograms are made in the prone position, followed by single or stereoscopic exposures in the vertical position. In unusual cases, these may be supplemented by oblique or lateral exposures. The child is then allowed to eliminate the infection. The amount of retention in the colon and the condition of the ileocecal valve are noted in exposures immediately after the elimination. In cases of dilatation of the cecum, the emptying of the sigmoid will allow the cecum to be observed much more clearly and remove all doubt of the shadow produced by an elongated sigmoid passing far to the right and overlapping the cecum. Special study of the appendix may be made at 24-hour intervals, until it is empty. Among congenital anomalies of the esophagus, one of the most important is the type of atresia in which the lower end communicates with the respiratory tract, while the upper end terminates in a blind pouch.",

      "abstract": "L‘augmentation constante de la prevalence de l‘obesite dans le monde constitue la raison majeure de l‘interet actuel des chercheurs pour la determination des mecanismes de regulation du comportement alimentaire. Au cours des trente dernieres annees, des progres importants ont ete faits pour trouver les facteurs impliques dans le declenchement et l‘arret de la prise de nourriture. Plusieurs experimentateurs ont montre que la chute de la glycemie enregistree au niveau de neurones gluco‐sensibles hypothalamiques est un facteur d‘induction d‘un repas. La ghreline, un nouveau peptide orexigene present en grande quantite dans l‘estomac, contribue egalement a cette phase de declenchement. D‘autres peptides centraux orexigenes comme le neuropeptide Y dont les concentrations locales varient avec l‘etat nutritionnel, et qui agissent sur les phenomenes de motivation pour manger, pourraient egalement jouer un role. La prolongation de la duree du repas et donc le retard de l‘installation de l‘etat de satiete, pourraient etre medies par des composes opiaces ou par des cannabinoides endogenes dont la liberation centrale est observee lors de l‘ingestion de mets particulierement plaisants (palatables) ou les qualites hedoniques et de convivialite ont un impact important. L‘arret de la prise alimentaire par un panel de peptides intestinaux (cholecystokinine (CCK), PYY 3‐36, enterostatine, etc.) est bien documente. Certains de ces peptides sont associes a l‘ingestion de graisses. Leur action centrale est souvent relayee vers le tronc cerebral via le nerf vague puis par des circuits specifiques vers les centres hypothalamiques superieurs. Ces centres hypothalamiques integrent aussi des informations liees a la memoire ou a l‘apprentissage mais aussi aux contraintes environnementales (stress par exemple). La leptine produite par le tissu adipeux et qui inhibe la prise de nourriture semble plutot jouer un role dans les regulations a long terme mais des travaux recents ont montre des synergies avec des signaux de regulation a court terme tels que la CCK. La diversite des facteurs et la redondance des circuits intervenant dans la regulation de la prise de nourriture font qu‘il est difficile a l‘heure actuelle de combattre efficacement les desordres alimentaires et ponderaux par des monotherapies.",

Besinlerin tadı ve diğer duyusal özellikleri besinlerin seçiminde en önemli kriterdir. Doğada ekşi, acı, tatlı, tuzlu ve umami tat, tat verici özelliği olan tatlar olarak sınıflandırılmaktadır. Tat algılamada bireysel farklılıklar önemli olmakla birlikte, genetik özellikler, yaş, cinsiyet, şişmanlık, hastalıklar, kullanılan ilaçlar, sigara, alkol vb. pek çok faktör de etkili olmaktadır. Tat alma durumunun olumlu veya olumsuz bir şekilde etkilenmesi yeme durumunu da değiştirecektir. Lezzetli yiyecekler nükleus akümbenste bulunan dopaminin salınımını uyarmakta olup, bu sayede iştah açıcı özelliği bulunmaktadır. Biyolojik olarak enerji ihtiyacı sonucu oluşan açlık durumu homeostatik açlık olarak tanımlanmaktadır. Enerji ihtiyacı olmaksızın lezzetli besinlerin tüketiminden sağlanan haz amacıyla besin tüketimi durumu ise hedonik açlık olarak tanımlanmaktadır. Lezzetli yiyeceklerin tüketimiyle hedonik mekanizmalar homeostatik mekanizmaların önüne geçerek tüketimi arttırmaktadır. Böylece lezzetli yiyecekler ile artan besin tüketimi obeziteye neden olmaktadır. Sonuç olarak, hedonik açlık vücudun ihtiyacı olmamasına rağmen tüketime yöneltmektedir. Yemek sonrası tok olunmasına rağmen kişinin en çok sevdiği tatlıyı tüketmesi bu duruma örnek oluşturmaktadır. Bu nedenle modern obezojenik yaşam tarzı ile besin tüketimi arasında dengeli bir ilişki kurmak önemli olmaktadır. Bu çalışmada, günümüzde artan besin tüketimi ve obezite prevalansı nedeniyle hedonik açlık ve obezite ilişkisi ele alınmıştır.",

      "abstract": "Americans report interest in eating more whole grains, yet national surveys consistently suggest that intakes are unchanged, continuing to be less than what is recommended.Improving the availability and increasing the variety of affordable food products containing whole grains have been promoted as ways to increase whole grain consumption.Providing more whole grain foods with higher whole grain content is key, but encouraging and rewarding individuals, families, and communities for consuming more whole grains, even small amounts, over the long term is equally important.While health benefits of whole grains may encourage some individuals to consume (more) whole grains, other individuals may respond favorably to other aspects (e.g., modifying a whole grain food's sensory characteristics or lowering the food's cost).Formulating with whole grains at higher levels in a broad array of foods could assist consumers in meeting their whole grain needs.Similarly, moving toward higher intakes may be successful with \"simply\" substituting whole grain versions of familiar commonly consumed foods and ingredients or substituting modest amounts of whole grain ingredients in recipes, especially those that are frequently prepared.Consumers should be encouraged to be adventurous and to try different, possibly novel, whole grains and whole grain foods, while simultaneously moderating intakes of nutrients of concern in a variety of foods acceptable to themselves and their families.At the same time, industry must develop whole grain foods that are acceptable both to business realities and to public tolerance and that maximize nutritional value.Finding an oasis in the whole grain desert is possible when consumers, health professionals, and food manufacturers agree that providing and eating more whole grains of all sorts is the desired goal.",

      "title": "Health Hazards of Food Allergens and Related Safety Measures",
      "abstract": "Food safety is one of the most important aspects of food manufacturing that needs to be considered in order to avoid any foodborne illnesses for consumers. Some foodborne illnesses are caused by the normal constituent of food itself, not because it is a contaminant but because the person is allergic to it. An allergy is caused by some specific protein molecules which act as antigens to trigger a vigorous immune response in the body. Usually, these protein molecules are harmless but the body perceives them as dangerous. Food allergies are very common and are usually self-diagnosable but are not deadly, however, in some cases, the allergy may prove to be fatal, as in the case of anaphylaxis. A food allergy is mainly caused by the ingestion of the allergen, even if it is in a small amount. The common symptoms which are seen in the allergy include itching (eczema) skin, swelling, nasal congestion, trouble in breathing, abdominal or stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. To prevent food allergies, the best way is to avoid eating the food with that particular allergen as the main constituent. Reading the constituents in the nutrition table of ready-to-eat food and semi-processed food may reduce the chances of allergy. Genetically modified plants can be prepared to have genetically modified proteins which do not have allergic properties. Hypoallergenic foods production may help to eliminate allergic reactions to food. Rapid detection of allergens in food while on the production line to eliminate the chances of introducing allergens while processing would be a great help. The guidelines given by USFDA and other regulatory bodies regarding food allergens during the food manufacturing processes can reduce the cases of food allergy. Food allergies, types, and safety measures are discussed in detail in this chapter.",

      "title": "Tackling sabotaging cognitive processes to reduce overeating; expectancy violation during food cue exposure",
      "abstract": "Calorie-reduced diets to combat obesity do work, but they only work when one sticks to the diet and the - relatively small - weight loss usually is short-lived. It is argued that calorie-reduced diets should converge with enduring lifestyle changes: the diet is just the start of a lifelong new eating pattern. Getting people to change their lifestyles forever could increase the amount of lost weight and prevent relapse. However, a real behavior change is difficult, especially when longstanding habits are involved and the change is intended for the rest of life. It is argued here that adherence to a new lifestyle is much easier if sabotaging cognitive processes are tackled. An overview is given of four studies into the effects of exposure to reduce appetitive responding to tempting food cues. A robust effect of exposure on the ad lib intake of exposed foods was found in all studies: participants ate significantly less of exposed foods after exposure compared to control interventions but no generalization to non-exposed foods was found. The reduced food intake after exposure was associated with a violation of overeating expectancies. It is discussed that lifestyle interventions might benefit from techniques that are really able to change longstanding habits. Specifically, the violation of overeating expectancies during exposure seems to be critical for controlled eating and should therefore be part of lifestyle interventions for obesity.",

      "abstract": "Carbohydrate feeding has been shown to enhance endurance performance. During exercise of 2 h or more, the delivery of carbohydrates to the muscle is the crucial step and appears to be limited by intestinal absorption. It is therefore important to identify ways to overcome this limitation and study the positive and negative effects of chronic carbohydrate supplementation. There is evidence that intestinal absorption can, at least partly, be overcome by making use of multiple transportable carbohydrates. Ingestion of these carbohydrates may result in higher intestinal absorption rates and has been shown to lead to higher rates of exogenous carbohydrate oxidation which can result in better endurance performance. It also seems possible to increase the absorptive capacity of the intestine by adapting to a high-carbohydrate diet. Carbohydrate supplementation during exercise has been suggested to reduce training adaptations, but at present there is little or no evidence to support this. Despite the fact that it has long been known that carbohydrate supplementation can enhance endurance performance, there are still many unanswered questions. However, there is potential to develop strategies that enhance the delivery of carbohydrates and thereby improve endurance performance.",

This study used descriptive qualitative method. The results of this study indicate that basic choumiryou has a large influence on the health of Japanese people. Although some basic spices are not good for health, this does not prevent Japanese from consuming them. Japanese consume choumiryou in a safe portion that does not damage health. In addition, the role of the basic choumiryou in the high life expectancy of Japanese people can also be seen from various kinds of substances that are good for health contained in the basic sashisuseso choumiryou. The taste of choumiryou has always been maintained by the Japanese for the sake of acquiring a distinctive Japanese flavor that has a characteristic soft taste.",

      "abstract": "The notion that most of the glucose ingested with the food is directly oxidized is incorrect. When the glucose and insulin levels of the blood rise, the tissues take up large amounts of glucose. The larger the glucose uptake, the higher the percentage of glucose that is converted to glycogen (i.e., stored). Insulin has an antilypolytic action, so that the concentration of free fatty acids declines and the percentage of glucose used for oxidative processes increases. The respiratory quotient of approximately 1 after eating implies that much of the glucose is converted to fat rather than oxidized. This means that the glucose ingested with the food is for the most part stored, and not oxidized. Only a limited amount of glucose is stored as glycogen. The liver can store a maximum of 10% of its weight in the form of glycogen, or about 150 g. This quantity of glycogen is available for use as glucose during fasting. The liver reconverts glycogen to glucose and releases it into the blood, from where it can be taken up by tissues such as the brain. Up to 50% of the glucose administered orally or intravenously can be stored as glycogen by the liver. The rest is taken up mainly by the muscles, which can also store a total of about 150–200 g glycogen. Unlike the liver, the muscles cannot release glucose in the blood because they lack the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase.",

Immer steht eine Diabetesberaterin dabei, die anleitet, Fragen beantwortet und aufpasst, dass sich keine Fehler einschleichen. Für viele Diabetiker ist es nicht leicht, vor dem Essen erst einmal nachzudenken, zu messen, zu planen, wie viel man tatsächlich essen wird, die Broteinheiten abzuschätzen und die richtige Insulinmenge zu berechnen. Sie empfinden diese Pflichten zunächst als Verlust von Spontaneität und können das Essen gar nicht richtig genießen. Sie spüren aber nach ein paar Tagen, dass diese Pflicht vor dem Essen zur Routine werden kann. Und sie sehen an den immer besser werdenden postprandialen Blutzuckerwerten, dass sich der Einsatz lohnt. Besonders für Menschen, denen flexible Essenszeiten und -mengen wichtig sind, ist diese Form der Therapie richtig. Und die Möglichkeit, zu hohe Blutzuckerwerte schnell korrigieren zu können, schafft Sicherheit, vermindert die Angst vor Folgeerkrankungen und erhöht das Selbstvertrauen und Kompetenzgefühl.",

      "title": "Impact of meal frequency and energy turnover on the regulation of energy intake",
      "abstract": "Over the last decades, consumption of liquid calories as sugar containing beverages like fruit juices, soft drinks and sweetened coffees increased and became a major risk factor for weight gain. The aim of the first study was to investigate if orange juice consumption together with meals improves energy balance compared to juice consumption in-between meals. The impact of consuming 20% of individual daily energy requirement as orange juice with or in-between three meals per day on weight gain and body composition was therefore investigated in a 2 x 2-week crossover intervention under free-living conditions in 26 healthy adults. Despite the same energy intake in both interventions only the consumption of orange juice in-between meals resulted in a gain in fat mass. This discrepancy seems to be explained by a lack in compensation of energy intake at the following meal when orange juice is consumed in-between meals compared to juice consumption with meals. In conclusion, consumption of liquid calories in-between meals is a risk factor for weight gain and thus snacking should be avoided. In contrast, consumption of sugar containing beverages together with only three meals per day was able to prevent weight gain.\nBeyond liquid calories, a low energy turnover may also be a risk factor for weight gain. In line with this hypothesis it was proposed that weight control is improved when physical activity and energy intake are both high (high energy turnover) but not with sedentary behavior. In a second study, the acute impact of energy turnover on appetite control was therefore investigated in 16 healthy adults under strictly controlled conditions in a metabolic chamber at different levels of energy balance. Three levels of 24h energy turnover (low PAL 1.31; medium PAL 1.55; high PAL 1.76) were compared in a randomized crossover intervention each under ad libitum energy intake, zero energy balance, caloric restriction (-25%) and overfeeding (+25%). Different levels of energy turnover were achieved by varying durations of low intensity physical activity on a treadmill (low 0 min; medium 3 x 55 min; high 3 x 110 min). Independent from energy balance, appetite control was improved with high energy turnover as shown by lower ghrelin and higher GLP-1 concentrations, correspondingly reduced hunger and desire to eat and an equal energy balance during ad libitum energy intake. Thus, inactivity is a risk factor for weight gain and low intensity physical activity can be sufficient to maintain energy balance as long as a physical activity level of 1.76 is reached. Accordingly, the beneficial effect of physical activity on energy balance is not solely explained by burning up more calories but also by an improved appetite control resulting in an energy intake closely matching energy expenditure.%%%%Der Verzehr kalorienhaltiger Getranke wie Fruchtsaft, Limonade und gesuste Kaffeegetranke hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten zugenommen und ist zu einem Hauptrisikofaktor fur Gewichtszunahme geworden.

Sedentary behavior has been linked to mental health problems like anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. These days, life is extremely busy - almost chaotic. Despite our increased productivity, we still feel there is never enough time to accomplish our true goals. This extremely rapid pace and the pressure that follows to \"get things done\" are serious issues that have a deeper impact on our bodies and minds than we may realize. We are all making ourselves sick by stressing about something that is not even a small inconvenience. The body contains thousands of homeostatic regulatory mechanisms. Among the most crucial ones are the control of body temperature, the maintenance of cell nutrition, the removal of waste, and the proper balance of hormones. So, the term \"stress\" is fairly wide and can take many various forms, it can interfere with several vital physiological processes.",

Traditionally, chronic CR is the reduction of daily energy intake without malnutrition. Recently, paradigms have emerged that recapitulate some of the beneficial aspects of this intervention, avoiding some of its challenges. The length of daily fasting length and periodicity have emerged as potential drivers behind CR’s beneficial health effects. Numerous strategies and eating patterns, including prolonged periods of fasting, have been successfully developed to mimic many of CR’s benefits without its austerity. These new feeding protocols range from short mealtimes designed to interact with our circadian system (daily time-restricted feeding) to more extended fasting regimens known as intermittent fasting. We will discuss the current status of knowledge on different strategies to reap the benefits of CR on metabolic health in rodent models and humans without the rigor of chronic reductions in caloric intake.",

Medication can cause constipation by slowing peristaltic contractions in the bowel. Environmental factors affecting constipation include the height of the toilet which affects the ability to have both feet on the floor to aid emptying of the rectum, lack of privacy, and seating comfort on the toilet. Using commodes at the bedside can cause people to hold on to faeces for fear of making a smell or sound. Some patients ignore the rectal sensation because of difficulty with mobility or because carers are not available at the right time. The longer the stool remains in the rectum the more water content is reabsorbed resulting in a harder stool.",

Objetivos En las últimas décadas ha aumentado el número de estudios centrados en cómo los trastornos alimentarios pueden conducir al desarrollo de la adicción a las drogas y en la comorbilidad que existe entre ambos trastornos. Nuestro objetivo es subrayar las similitudes entre el trastorno por atracón y los trastornos por uso de sustancias.Incluye los puntos en común conductuales y neurobiológicos entre el trastorno por atracón y la adicción a las drogas, centrándose especialmente en estudios recientes con animales. 2. Material y métodos Se realizó una revisión literaria no sistemática en las bases de datos Pubmed y PsicINFO, buscando las siguientes palabras clave: “trastorno por atracón”; “adicción” y “trastorno por uso de sustancias”. 3. Resultados y conclusiones Los atracones pueden ser un factor de riesgo o una puerta de entrada a la adicción a las drogas y, por otro lado, la adicción a los psicoestimulantes puede conducir a varios trastornos alimentarios. Si la alimentación es un factor de riesgo que afecta los mismos mecanismos neurobiológicos que las drogas de abuso, la exposición temprana a ciertos tipos de alimentos ultraprocesados podría ser una puerta de entrada a una mayor sensibilidad a la recompensa. La alta comorbilidad que existe entre los dos trastornos apoya la hipótesis y destaca la importancia de identificar y tratar ambas condiciones.Sin embargo hasta el momento, los psiquiatras que trabajan en centros de abuso de sustancias no siguen protocolos que aborden los trastornos alimentarios entre sus pacientes. Asimismo, los psiquiatras que se ocupan de los trastornos alimentarios no están capacitados para detectar o investigar el posible uso indebido de sustancias de abuso.",

Although these psychological processes are correlated, we find that memory for liking, rather than wanting, determines the number of days that pass until the consumption of a food is repeated. Experiment 1 found that liking (but not wanting) for a food at the end of a consumption experience predicted how many days passed until participants wanted to consume it again. Experiment 2 showed that mitigating the decrease in liking resulting from the repeated consumption of a food eliminates its effect on delay. Together, these findings suggest that end liking has a greater influence on when people will consume a food again in the future.",

In the obese person the appetite is not satisfied on such a level, and an excessive amount of food is ingested.

While clients may be overly focused about the consequence of weight gain, over time they may come to value recovery from other consequences even more than weight loss. Research shows extensive consequences from chronic use of processed foods. Although the pathology is distressing, educating clients about the link between compulsive chronic consumption of processed foods and relief from so many conditions can create a positive attitude toward recovery. Probing for the extensive consequences of food addiction motivates clients to start recovery and stay with it. Gently guiding clients through the process of uncovering the extent of consequences may be distressing, but as the myriad of conditions moves into remission clients can be reinforced in their determination to stick to a program of recovery.",

An appetite depressant can support, but cannot take the place of strong motivation (‘will power’), and hence perseverance with the diet.

Low sugar or no sugar in sweet products, food, or beverages seems to be the \"holy grail\" of the food industry. It is true that an important contributor to increased obesity in many populations is sugar in all its forms. The chapter discusses the role and virtue of infrequent or frequent short-term fasting. It describes temporary ketosis as a vehicle for body detoxification as well as weight control. The development of low-calorie fats and fat substitutes has been enormously long and has cost a few of the large food companies. The chapter also discusses nutrition controversies and analyzes at the example of the so-called food pyramid.",

      "title": "Aging, Basal Metabolic Rate, and Nutrition.",
      "abstract": "Age is one of the most important factor of changes in energy metabolism. The basal metabolic rate decreases almost linearly with age. Skeletal musculature is a fundamental organ that consumes the largest part of energy in the normal human body. The total volume of skeletal muscle can be estimated by 24-hours creatinine excretion. The volume of skeletal musculature decreases and the percentage of fat tissue increases with age. It is shown that the decrease in muscle mass relative to total body may be wholly responsible for the age-related decreases in basal metabolic rate. Energy consumption by physical activity also decreases with atrophic changes of skeletal muscle. Thus, energy requirement in the elderly decreases. With decrease of energy intake, intake of essential nutrients also decreases. If energy intake, on the other hand, exceeds individual energy needs, fat accumulates in the body. Body fat tends to accumulate in the abdomen in the elderly. Fat tissue in the abdominal cavity is connected directly with the liver through portal vein. Accumulation of abdominal fat causes disturbance in glucose and lipid metabolism. It is shown that glucose tolerance decreases with age. Although age contributes independently to the deterioration in glucose tolerance, the decrease in glucose tolerance may be partly prevented through changes of life-style variables, energy metabolism is essential for the physiological functions. It may also be possible to delay the aging process of various physiological functions by change of dietary habits, stopping smoking, and physical activity.",

Konzumace alkoholu jako drogy se specifickými projevy a přiznaky ma tisiciletou tradici . Alkoholismus je považovan za nejběžnějsi formu zavislosti. K zavislosti na alkoholu dochazi tehdy, když si tělo navykne přijimat velka množstvi alkoholu natolik, že už neni schopno po nějakou delsi dobu bez alkoholu normalně fungovat. Přiznakem zavislosti je neustala chuť na alkohol, neschopnost pit umirněně, a jakmile se choroba rozvine, potřeba větsiho množstvi alkoholu k tomu, aby postižený dosahl tehož ucinku. Postižený může zacit pit proto, aby zapadl do party, aby si zvedl naladu nebo aby zapomněl na svoje starosti. Za cas zacne být jeho organismus na alkoholu zavislý, a pokud ho nedostane, zacne trpět abstinencnimi přiznaky, např. horecnatosti, nespavosti a třesem, spojenými s halucinacemi. Alkoholismus by měl vždy lecit lekař, trvale a těžke piti může totiž způsobit važne jaterni obtiže, poskozeni mozku, rakovinu ust, hrdla, slinivky břisni, obezitu, chudokrevnost, sexualni obtiže a poruchy žaludecni, nervove a srdecni potiže.

      "title": "SHAREABLE RESOURCE",
      "abstract": "A slow, steady weight reduction of 1 to 2 lbs per week is the recommended way to lose and sustain a healthy weight. We are overwrought with misleading information on weight loss and fitness programs that lead us to believe exercise is grueling work and nutrition is deprivation. No wonder we are amidst an obesity epidemic! People tend to believe that eating healthy is expensive; but it doesn’t need to be. According to research from the Harvard School of Public Health, the healthiest diets only cost about $1.50 more per day than the least healthy diets (1). To lose weight and maintain weight, a simple, systematic, multifaceted approach is necessary: attitude rewiring, physical preparation, and emotional control. REWIRE YOUR ATTITUDE Think about health and fitness in a positive way. Often, people think of fitness as a difficult, time-consuming, expensive endeavor. However, physical activity can be as simple as finding time each day to walk the dog. To create and maintain healthy habits for a lifetime, you need to rewire your behavior. Once you rewire your attitude, you will approach tasks differently and begin to make changes. Making small changes at first, then gradually introducing more and more “good habits,” is the key to success. Consider exercising after work. If you go home after work, you feel “done” for the evening. Bring exercise clothes to work and leave them in the car. This “cue” is one of the best ways to create a new habit. The cue leads to the desired response (going straight to the gym from work). The desired response then leads to the “reward,” which is the wonderful feeling you get after a great workout. The feeling you get from the reward response then becomes something you desire and seek to obtain daily. PREPARE PHYSICALLY To ensure adherence, it is imperative to take initiative each day to prepare for your fit lifestyle. This preparation can be accomplished by preparing meals in advance, gathering gym shoes and clothes each morning, and plotting out your day to include at least 30 minutes of physical activity.CONTROL EMOTIONS Emotional control is the most important aspect of this three-pronged approach. People tend to consume “comfort food” in times of distress. This type of behavior can completely sabotage an otherwise fit day. It is very important to recognize a stressful situation and take the proper measures to ensure you are not eating for comfort. FIRST STEPS Few people can lose weight without cutting the calories they consume. As the saying goes, “You can’t exercise your way out of a poor diet.” A 500 kcal per day deficit is associated with a weight loss of about 1 lb a week (2). Cutting calories can be challenging and may leave you quite hungry. Choosing unrefined carbohydrates with a low glycemic index may help to curb your appetite. For those trying to lose weight, strict portion control of energy-dense foods is essential. Learning to avoid so-called supersize options and choosing mini or snack-size varieties can be a useful strategy. MAINTENANCE To be successful in the long-term, you need to be able to identify high-risk situations (when you may be likely to overeat) and to develop practical coping strategies. A mental dilemma occurs when you regress to old habits. To avoid this pitfall, new habits must be formed. Good habits can include learning how to shop for groceries or finding new cooking methods. This knowledge also is fundamental when eating at a restaurant or cooking on a budget and is vital for long-term weight loss maintenance. Here are some quick tips: Eat vegetables to help you feel full. Drink plenty of water. Get tempting foods out of your home. Stay busy — you don’t want to eat just because you’re bored. Eat only from a plate, while seated at a table. No grazing in front of the ‘fridge. Don’t skip meals. Keep a food journal. Remember, motivation is what gets you started; habit keeps you going!",

      "abstract": "Monosodium glutamate or MSG is a food additive that is widely used in various countries to add flavor to the food to be served. If MSG is consumed by someone who cannot tolerate the amount of more than 3g / day, it will cause detrimental effects on health. Symptoms of the complex syndrome include: burning sensation in the back of the neck spreading to the arms and chest, numbness in the back of the neck, facial stiffness, chest pain, nausea, and drowsiness. The writing of this article uses a review article study. The source of the literature used in compiling this literature uses manuals and recent studies obtained through the process of literature searching related to the relationship of MSG to health. The publication year of the articles used is between 2000-2018 from several sources obtained. Based on a review of the scientific evidence that has been conducted on the safety of MSG, it is concluded that there is no scientific evidence that the addition of MSG in food in the long term causes nerve cell damage.",

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the most recent food trends is the quest for products that provide ‘sustained energy’; a term that is garnering considerable attention within the marketplace. Often, ‘sustained energy’ health claims are based on a food's post‐prandial glycaemic response. However, are generalised health claims regarding ‘sustained energy’ valid when only supported by glycaemic response data? Without context, the short answer is: probably not. Health claims that link sustained energy to a glycaemic response, or any other attribute of a food or diet, require context to ensure that the public correctly interprets and experiences the claimed effect and is not misled in their quest for healthy foods that impose the desired physiological benefit.",

Dies dient als Erklärungsmodell für das Hungern bei Patientinnen mit Anorexia nervosa, die durch ihren kachektischen Körper belohnt werden. Alternative Modelle zur Anorexia nervosa vermuten den zusätzlichen oder alleinigen Einfluss negativer Verstärkung, indem das Hungern negative Emotionen reduziert. Die vorliegende Arbeit gibt eine Übersicht über die Datenlage und stellt eine eigene Studie an anorektischen Patientinnen vor, die einen Hinweis auf den Belohnungsaspekt des Hungerns liefert.",

Özellikle Covid-19 küresel salgını sebebiyle obezite prevelansının daha da artacağı öngörülmektedir. Yaşam tarzı değişikliği stratejisi olarak temelde hem enerji alımının azaltılması hem de enerji harcamasının artırılması önerilmektedir. Obez adölesanlarda genellikle orta şiddette (%40-75 VO2max) aerobik egzersizler önerilmektedir. Bununla birlikte egzersiz şiddetinden bağımsız olarak farklı egzersiz modellerinin obezite tedavisindeki etkisi araştırılmaya devam edilmektedir. Ancak obezite tedavisinde egzersizin iştah üzerindeki değişimleri de dikkate alınmalıdır. Obez adölesanlarda egzersiz sonrası enerji alımı ve iştah değişimlerini derleyen araştırmamızın sonuçlarına göre akut egzersiz müdahalesinin, sonraki subjektif iştah duygularını değiştirmeden enerji alımını azalttığı görülmektedir. Bununla birlikte egzersiz ile öğün arasındaki zamanlamanın enerji alımı üzerine etkisi olmaksızın; açlık, doygunluk, yemek yeme arzusu gibi duyguların ve besinlere yönelim üzerine etkisi olduğu sonucuna varılmıştır. Türü, şiddeti, sıklığı ve süresi programlanmış egzersiz modellerinin obezite tanılı adölesanlarda enerji alımı ve iştah üzerine etkilerini inceleyen daha fazla çalışmaya ihtiyaç vardır.",

      "title": "Would offering vegetables to children for breakfast increase their total daily vegetable intake?",
      "abstract": "The consumption of vegetables is vitally important for children's health and development. However, in many Westernised countries, most children do not eat sufficient quantities of vegetables and consume many energy-dense and high-sugar foods; a health behaviour associated with the onset of non-communicable diseases. To address this important public health concern, it is necessary to think 'outside the box' and consider innovative and pragmatic ways to increase children's daily vegetable intake. In many countries, caregivers implementing best-practice child feeding methods typically offer children vegetables at lunch, dinner and for snacks. It is unusual for children to be routinely offered vegetables for breakfast, yet there is no nutritional, physiological or medical reason why vegetables should not be eaten at breakfast. Indeed, in some countries, children frequently consume vegetables for breakfast. Increasing children's exposure to vegetables at breakfast from an early age would allow for the development of a positive association between eating vegetables and breakfast, thus providing another opportunity in the day where vegetables might be regularly consumed by children. In this paper, we propose a rationale for why vegetables should be routinely offered to young children at breakfast time in countries where this may not be the norm. Future research assessing the feasibility and acceptability of such a public health intervention would provide health policy agencies with evidence about a potentially effective and easily implementable approach for increasing children's vegetable intake, thus improving their overall nutritional status, as well as their heath and development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Ramadan fasting, involving abstinence from fluid and food from sunrise to sundown, results in prolonged periods without nutrient intake and inflexibility with the timing of eating and drinking over the day. Dietary choices may also change due to special eating rituals. Although nutrition guidelines are specific to the sport, to the periodized training and competition calendar, and to the individual, many promote the consumption of carbohydrate and fluid before and during exercise, and consumption of protein, carbohydrate, and fluids soon after the session is completed. Failing to meet overall nutritional needs, or to provide specific nutritional support to a session of exercise, is likely to impair acute performance and reduce the effectiveness of training or recovery. Muslim athletes who fast during Ramadan should use overnight opportunities to consume foods and drinks that can supply the nutrients needed to promote performance, adaptation, and recovery in their sports. Because of the benefits of being able to consume at least some of these nutrients before, during or after an exercise session, the schedule of exercise should be shifted where possible to the beginning or end of the day, or during the evening when some nutritional support can be provided.",

While undernutrition (in terms of deficient nutrient intake) continues to be a problem for many children, overnutrition (in terms of energy intake in excess of needs) is an increasing public health concern. Our genetic make−up has evolved to deal with an environment where food is scarce at times and plentiful at other times. In this type of environment the capacity for fat deposition means that we are more likely to survive through periods when food is scarce. Our bodies may also seek to minimise energy expenditure in order not to expend too much of our fat stores. Children today are faced with an environment where food is of a high quality and plentiful, and there are many opportunities to limit physical activity. Play is often focused on sedentary games and entertainment,such as watching television. Many children today are, therefore, dealing with an environment which promotes obesity.",

Unter dem Druck des derzeit herrschenden Schlankheitsideals und aufgrund tiefgreifender Unzulänglichkeitsgefühle fixieren sie sich zwanghaft auf ihren Körper, um Kontrolle über ihr Leben zu erlangen, indem sie wenigstens beim Essen alles im Griff haben. Der Preis dafür sind zunehmende Isolation und Einsamkeit sowie körperliche Folgeschäden, die bis zum Tod führen können. Unter einer Essstörung leiden aber immer auch die Familien, die Freunde und andere Menschen, die den Betroffenen nahestehen. Sie alle benötigen Hilfe und Unterstützung, damit sie gemeinsam mit den Betroffenen die Essstörung überwinden können. Das vorliegende Buch zeigt, wie jeder Einzelne dazu beitragen kann, dass Wege aus der Essstörung gefunden werden. Es räumt auf mit Vorurteilen und Fehlannahmen über «gesundes» Essen, über Essstörungen und über Psychotherapie. Es informiert über die Ursachen und Hintergründe von Essstörungen und bietet Orientierung in der Vielfalt professioneller Hilfsmöglichkeiten. Prof. Dr. Manfred Fichter ist langjähriger ärztlicher Direktor und Chefarzt der Medizinisch-psychosomatischen Klinik Roseneck in Prien am Chiemsee. Bis heute begleitet er täglich Betroffene und Angehörige bei der Überwindung ihrer Essstörung.

      "abstract": "THE PLACE of parenteral protein feeding depends first of all on the importance of protein feeding itself and second on the availablity of adequate methods. The need for protein feeding has become emphasized only in the past decade or two. The old ideas that protein is not important and that there are large stores of dispensable body protein have been almost completely discarded. One may assume as proved the harmful effects of protein starvation even for short periods. These evils, to be sure, are slight in the beginning. Certainly a person who is well nourished may withstand deprivation of protein and even considerable loss of protein as such without serious difficulty; but this does not mean that protein losses are without effect. A basic principle in the treatment of disease is that all deficits be avoided. Protein is no exception. Indeed, there is much evidence to show that protein deprivation",

      "abstract": "Der vorliegende Abschnitt behandelt die Frage, unter welchen Umstaenden der Alkoholkonsument zum Taeter wird. Die beim Delikt im Verkehr festgestellten Durchschnittswerte von Blutalkoholkonzentrationen (BAK) sind so hoch, dass die Mehrheit der Bevoelkerung gar nicht faehig ist, diese bei Trinkversuchen zu erreichen. Das Verkehrsrisiko im Verkehr wird hauptsaechlich von der Gruppe der starken Trinker und der Gruppe der gelegentlichen Rauschtrinker mit erheblicher Alkoholgewoehnung verursacht. Es muessen verschiedene Gruppen von Alkoholkonsumenten und daraus abgeleitet von alkoholisierten Verkehrsteilnehmern unterschieden werden: 1. Genuss- oder Konsumtrinker mit risikoarmem durchschnittlichem Alkoholkonsum, die die Gefahren der Verkehrsteilnahme unter Alkoholeinfluss unterschaetzen. 2. An Alkohol Gewoehnte mit riskantem bis starkem Alkoholkonsum, die aufgrund der entwickelten hohen Alkoholtoleranz die koerperlichen Gefahrensignale fuer eine bestehende Trunkenheit nicht mehr zuverlaessig wahrnehmen. 3. Harte Trinker und Alkoholabhaengige, die laengst alle Verhaltensziele der Sucht untergeordnet haben und regelmaessig Alkoholfahrten in Kauf nehmen. Am haeufigsten sind Verkehrsmediziner in der Begutachtungsstelle fuer Fahreignung mit der Gruppe der Risiko- oder Schwellentrinker konfrontiert. Auf sie trifft meist die Definition des Alkoholmissbrauchs zu. Bei BAK-Werten von ueber 1,09 Promille ist in allen Faellen, unabhaengig von der persoenlichen Konstitutionen, Befindlichkeit und Alkoholvertraeglichkeit, eine Beeintraechtigung der Fahrsicherheit gegeben. Die Alkoholabhaengigen sind auch ohne Auffaelligkeit im Strassenverkehr nach Anlage 4 zur Fahrerlaubnis-Verordnung (FeV) zum Fuehren eines Kfz nicht geeignet. Signifikante neuropsychologische Defizite Alkoholkranker sind auch bei Abstinenz nicht schnell reversibel, sodass bei chronischem Alkoholmissbrauch eine Ueberpruefung des Leistungsvermoegens vor Wiedererteilung einer Fahrerlaubnis angezeigt erscheint. Die Voraussetzungen, unter denen eine Fahreignung wieder angenommen werden kann, sind im Kommentar zu den Begutachtungs-Leitlinien sowie in den Beurteilungskriterien ausfuehrlich beschrieben. Hierbei sind sowohl psychologische als auch medizinische Befunde zu beachten und haeufig interdisziplinaer zu interpretieren. Die Verkehrsmedizin hat dabei zu beantworten, wie der Alkoholkonsum in der Vorgeschichte diagnostisch einzuordnen ist und welcher Behandlungsbedarf daraus abzuleiten ist, ob ein chronischer Alkoholmissbrauch zu koerperlichen und/oder geistigen Folgeschaeden gefuehrt hat und ob aktuelle Befunde vorliegen, die mit der Behauptung einer gegebenenfalls erfolgten Distanzierung vom Alkoholkonsum nicht kompatibel sind.

      "title": "Commitment Devices",
      "abstract": "Unhealthy behaviors are responsible for a high percentage of health care costs and poor health outcomes. In large companies, unhealthy behaviors by employees are considered an important challenge to affordable benefits coverage. Employers increasingly leverage incentives to encourage changes in employees’ health-related behaviors. In this viewpoint, the authors discuss the potential and the limitations of commitment devices, as distinct from incentives, to influence health behaviors. Many people intend to improve their health behaviors in the future, but when the future arrives, they fail to follow through. Many will precommit their “future selves” to follow-through by purchasing gym memberships or scheduling workouts with friends; persons with alcoholism take disulfiram in the morning so drinking alcohol in the evening will make them ill. The commitment devices increase the probability of individuals’ compliance with voluntarily imposed restrictions until they have accomplished their goals or their voluntarily imposed penalties for not reaching their goals. A common form of commitment device, also called a deposit or commitment contract, involves people voluntarily depositing money into accounts they can access again only if they accomplish a goal. These devices can help people lose weight, improve their diets, exercise more, and quit smoking. Such commitment devices have 2 basic features: people voluntarily use them and the devices link consequences to an individual’s failure to achieve preset goals. Commitment devices can be associated with various consequences. Immutable consequences cannot be reversed by future choices. They can have monetary aspects in which people risk losing their own money if, by a predetermined date, an independent assessor reports that they did not reach their goals. Commitment devices involving mutable consequences constrain future behaviors but allow people future latitude to mitigate the consequences. One form is temptation bundling or allowing people to restrict their access to instantly gratifying experiences only to occasions in which they engage in goal-consistent behaviors. Commitment devices are powerful tools for changing health behaviors, but they are underused. Maximizing the population health benefits of commitment devices requires increasing the numbers of people who use them and increasing their effectiveness. Health professionals can educate patients about the gap between intention and action. Making enrollment and participation as simple as possible by eliminating unnecessary complexity could also facilitate greater use of commitment devices. To improve population health, such devices need to be more effective. Often, health-relevant goals require changing long-term behavior even after an initial objective has been achieved. Research should investigate whether and how commitment devices can be effective tools to assist with long-term behavior change. Commitment devices can provide positive feedback as soon as people begin using them. One promising direction for future research involves leveraging the influence of existing social networks. Commitment devices that involve these networks by creating social consequences for failing to achieve goals can be implemented inexpensively. Patients are more successful at achieving their health goals when they have access to commitment devices. Strategies for achieving higher rates of ongoing engagement and sustained behavior change are needed for the devices to have widespread influence and benefit.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness that alcohol and drug abuse and smoking are not only harmful for the consumer but will also, when taken by a pregnant woman, adversely affect her unborn child. The consequence of the abuse will result from a combination of specific toxic effects of abusing substances and a nonspecific effect from the often very unstable environment of an alcohol- or drug-dependent mother. Poor prenatal care is a common finding in alcohol and drug abuse leading to a high incidence of complications during pregnancy and delivery including premature labor and small-for-gestational-age babies. An increased perinatal mortality has been reported following all types of abuse including tobacco use, probably as a consequence of poor prenatal care as well as of a toxic effect on the fetus. Withdrawal symptoms after birth are most prominent in opiate addiction. The already intrauterinely damaged child will if it stays with its parents often continue to be exposed to several abverse environmental factors. However, symptoms such as mental retardation following alcohol abuse and hyperactivity and emotional disturbances following drug exposure during intrauterine life have also been found in children who have been taken from the parents and placed in foster homes immediately after birth. This means that children of abusing parents both in their custody and in foster home will have to be regarded as risk children that should be subjected to careful medical and psychological follow-up.",

      "title": "Mood and Food",
      "abstract": "The relationship between mood and food is complex. Mood can influence the foods we choose to eat. Sometimes we hear friends or family saying that they were so stressed by events in their lives that their eating was out of control – either they overate or, less frequently, that they could not eat. Overeating when stressed is a common reaction. More than a third of the participants in a national survey conducted by National Public Radio, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health (2014) said they change their diets during stressful times. The term ‘comfort food’ has entered our lexicon and refers to traditional foods that we feel provide a relief from negative emotions and an increase in positive feelings; eating comfort food is seen as a response to emotional stress. Comfort food is specific to culture and frequently has a high carbohydrate level and a simple preparation. When we feel stressed, we reach for foods that will comfort us immediately, but one theory proposes that this can lead to a vicious cycle: foods high in carbohydrates may lead to surges and crashes in blood sugar accompanied by a surge in adrenaline, or epinephrine, often called ‘the stress hormone’ (Aubrey, 2014). According to this explanation, eating lots of refined carbohydrates and sugar may exacerbate our responses to stress. The relationship between food and mood can also go the other way: the food we choose to eat may affect our mood. There may be types of food that make us more resilient to stress. Over the last two decades, researchers have been investigating the links between the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish (eggs, dark leafy greens, etc.) and emotional health and wellbeing (Aubrey, 2014). Others have shown a strong day-today relationship between more positive mood and higher fruit and vegetable consumption (Hopf, 2013; White, Horwath, & Conner, 2013). And others have demonstrated a link between",

Theses working hours have been standardised in most Western cultures. Predominantly, this has meant that people travel to and from work at more or less the same time. However, there is now a need to allow more flexibility so that working schedules can be adjusted to specific climatic circumstances (especially to avoid the hottest time of the day), thereby cutting down on energy consumption. Traditionally working hours were directly linked to daylight hours and temperatures. In fact, in many parts of the world where it is hot, it has long been recognised that especially heavy work be undertaken before or after the hottest part of the day. Of course traditionally, some countries with hotter climates cease business hours during lunch hours to allow staff to rest and have 'siestas' (nap or rest after lunch). In addition to this practice being beneficial in conserving energy in peak periods, health science shows it also has health benefits.",

      "title": "If Body Fatness is Under Physiological Regulation, Then How Come We Have an Obesity Epidemic?",
      "abstract": "Life involves a continuous use of energy, but food intake, which supplies that energy, is episodic. Feeding is switched on and off by a complex array of predominantly gut-derived peptides (and potentially nutrients) that initiate and terminate feeding bouts. Energy is stored as glucose and glycogen to overcome the problem of the episodic nature of intake compared with the continuous demand. Intake is also adjusted to meet immediate changes in demands. Most animals also store energy as fat. In some cases, this serves the purpose of storing energy in anticipation of a known future shortfall (e.g., hibernation, migration, or reproduction). Other animals, however, store fat in the absence of such anticipated needs, and in this case the fat appears to be stored in preparation for unpredictable catastrophic shortfalls in supply. Fat storage, however, brings disadvantages as well as advantages, in particular an increased risk of predation. Hence, many animals seem to have evolved a dual intervention point system preventing them from storing too little or too much fat. The physiological basis of the lower intervention point is well established, but the upper intervention point is much less studied. Human obesity can potentially be understood in an evolutionary context as due to drift in the upper intervention point following release from predation 2 million years ago (the drifty gene hypothesis) combined with a stimulus in modern society to overconsume calories, possibly attempting to satisfy intake of a limiting micro- or macro-nutrient like protein (the protein leverage hypothesis).",

      "title": "Le choix de la cocaïne, une question de délai",
      "abstract": "L'addiction a la cocaine est un trouble comportemental qui touche plusieurs millions de personnes en Europe. L'etude des mecanismes neurobiologiques de ce trouble repose beau-coup sur l'utilisation de modeles animaux, generalement des rats ou des souris. Dans la situation experimentale standard, ces animaux ont acces a la cocaine sans autre choix possible. Dans ces conditions assez artificielles, il est difficile de savoir si leur consommation de cocaine est in-fluencee par un etat d'addiction ou plutot par l'absence d'autres recompenses disponibles. En fait, quand on offre a des rats une autre recompense pendant l'acces a la cocaine (e.g., de l'eau sucree pendant quelques secondes), la vaste majorite d'entre eux s'abstient pour l'option alter-native. Ce resultat semble difficile a reconcilier avec les predictions associees a l’hypothese dopaminergique de l’addiction. Selon cette hypothese, la liberation supranormale de dopamine (aussi bien en intensite qu’en duree) provoquee par la cocaine lui confere un pouvoir recom-pensant largement superieur a celui d'autres recompenses (y compris l'eau sucree), et devrait se traduire par un choix quasi-exclusif pour la drogue. Ce paradoxe apparent peut etre resolu si l’on prend aussi en compte les delais imposes par la pharmacocinetique de la cocaine. En effet, une fois administree, meme par une voie rapide comme la voie intraveineuse, il faut un certain temps a la cocaine pour atteindre le circuit dopaminergique de la recompense dans le cerveau, ce qui impose un certain delai a la survenue des effets recompensants de la drogue. Selon notre hypothese, si ce delai d'action etait suffisamment long, il pourrait reduire la valeur de la cocaine au moment du choix en-dessous de celle de la recompense alternative, moins recompensante mais plus immediate. Ce travail de these avait pour but general de tester cette hypothese. Nos resultats confirment que les effets de la cocaine ne surviennent qu’apres un delai de plusieurs dizaines de secondes. Par ailleurs, lorsque l’influence de ce long delai etait neutralisee au mo-ment du choix, les animaux inversaient leur preference en faveur de la cocaine, confirmant que la cocaine genere bien une quantite de recompense superieure a l’option alternative. Ce travail nous revele egalement d’importantes lacunes dans notre comprehension du delai-drogue et de son impact sur le choix. Afin d’y remedier, des etudes complementaires, aussi bien theoriques qu’experimentales, devront etre envisagees a l’avenir.",

Amazingly, the food you eat affects neurons, which are the major cells of the brain. In the brain, an unhealthy diet that is rich in fats and sugars causes inflammation of neurons and inhibits the formation of new neurons. This can affect the way the brain works and contribute to brain disorders like depression. On the other hand, a diet that contains healthy nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, is beneficial for brain health. Such a diet improves the formation of neurons and leads to improved thinking, attention, and memory. In sum, a healthy diet makes the brain happy, so we should all pay attention to what we eat.",

      "abstract": "&#x0D; O jejum é a abstenção de consumir alimentos e bebidas por um determinado tempo. Tanto os sistemas de saúde tradicionais quanto os modernos usam jejuns como forma de ajudar a gerenciar doenças crônicas não infecciosas. Durante o jejum, a atividade aumenta a lipólise do tecido adiposo (queima de gordura na gordura adiposa) enquanto aumenta a oxidação de ácidos graxos nos órgãos periféricos, o que aumenta a queima de gordura e a perda de peso. A principal coisa que esta análise estava investigando é se o treinamento de resistência realizado em jejum induz adaptações específicas no treinamento, em que o aumento da oxidação de gordura melhora os níveis de treinamento de resistência a longo prazo. Alguns dados mostram que o jejum tem uma influência mais ampla no metabolismo corporal tanto em indivíduos não treinados quanto treinados, afetando o metabolismo de proteínas e glicose. Há informações conflitantes sobre como o jejum afeta o metabolismo da glicose em atletas altamente treinados, e o impacto no desempenho também não é claro (alguns dizem que tem um impacto negativo, outros dizem que não há efeito significativo). O jejum diminui o peso corporal de indivíduos treinados e não treinados, juntamente com o teor de gordura. Há pouca evidência de que o treinamento de resistência e o jejum juntos aumentam a oxidação da gordura, pois muitos estudos têm resultados conflitantes. Embora existam diferenças nos detalhes dos experimentos, como a gravidade da restrição calórica, quanto tempo durou o experimento e quem eram os participantes. Em nossa revisão da literatura, sugerimos que os atletas não devem fazer treinamento de alta intensidade em jejum.&#x0D;",

It sounds simple; however, it is much more complex than it sounds, because when you lose weight, you usually lose a combination of fat, lean mass, and water.

This approach acknowledges the apparent parallels between substance use disorders and overeating of highly palatable, high-caloric foods. Part of this discussion includes that \"hyperpalatable\" foods may have an addictive potential because of increased potency due to certain nutrients or additives. Although this idea seems to be relatively new, research on food addiction actually encompasses several decades, a fact that often remains unrecognized. Scientific use of the term addiction in reference to chocolate even dates back to the 19th century. In the 20th century, food addiction research underwent several paradigm shifts, which include changing foci on anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, obesity, or binge eating disorder. Thus, the purpose of this review is to describe the history and state of the art of food addiction research and to demonstrate its development and refinement of definitions and methodologies.",

      "abstract": "College students with positive (FH+) and negative (FH-) family history for heavy frequent alcohol use showed no differences in age of first drink, amount consumed then, amount currently consumed, current frequency, maximum consumed, or effect of current alcohol consumed. However, there were FH background differences in the reasons identified for ending, but not for starting, drinking episodes involving intoxication. The realization of already drinking too much ended these drinking episodes more often among FH- than for FH+ subjects. In contrast, nausea and lateness of the hour were related to the end of drinking more often for FH+ subjects.",

      "title": "Drug therapy in the elderly.",
      "abstract": "The efficiency of the individual organs and the body lessens with age. For instance, renal function diminishes, enzyme induction is delayed, cell membrane composition and total body salt and water contents are altered, and lean body mass is reduced. Consequently, the elderly differ from younger people in their response to drugs, for their ability to handle drugs by absorption, detoxication, and excretion is naturally effected. Not surprisingly, therefore, iatrogenic disease related to drugs is very common. Fortunately, as a rule, absorption is less affected by age than excretion and detoxication. Hence the failure of an elderly person to respond to an effective drug is nearly always due to failure of the patient to take the drug rather than to absorb it. Large loading doses of drugs are, there fore, rarely necessary and in most cases it is preferable to start with a small dose, particularly if the drug is potentially toxic and likely to be poorly excreted. This does not mean that large doses of some drugs should not be given to the elderly if indicated?for example, antibiotics in acute infec tions or diuretics in the early stages of heart failure. Never theless, in using drugs in the elderly it is wise to observe a few simple rules: (1) Know the pharmacological action of the drug being used and in particular how it is metabolized and excreted. (2) Use the lowest dose that is effective in the individual patient. Higher blood concenitrations per dose are achieved and the half life of some drugs?for example, cortisol or digoxin?is prolonged in the elderly, and this can lead to accumulation and the need for lower and less frequent dosage. Drug dose should, therefore, be titrated with patient response. (3) Use the fewest drugs the patient needs. Memory, par ticularly short-term memory, deteriorates with age; conse quently complex drug regimens may be mismanaged. (4) Do not use drugs to treat symptoms without first discovering the cause of the symptoms. These may some times be due to a social deprivation syndrome which may be better dealt with by a trained social worker. (5) Do not withhold drugs on account of old age parti cularly when drug therapy may improve the old person's quality of life. (6) Do not use a drug if the symptoms it causes are worse than those it is supposed to relieve. Hence knowledge of a drug's side effects is important and one should remember that sometimes adverse reactions may be individual to the",

      "title": "More food for thought: preferred words",
      "abstract": "In last month's editorial, I encouraged clinicians to include one additional sentence in their standard line of questions regarding appetite, essentially “have you ever eaten more than you intended?” followed up with “did you feel like it wasn't easy to stop?”1 This was based on the observation that many people with eating disorders, especially binge eating disorder (BED), are undiagnosed, resulting in their psychiatric and non-psychiatric comorbidities remaining suboptimally managed. In this issue of the International Journal of Clinical Practice, Lydecker et al.2 have gone several steps further and researched language preferences for discussing obesity and binge eating among over 800 people in an online community sample. Preferred obesity-related terms were “weight” and “BMI.” Binge-related terms were generally ranked neutrally and preferred descriptions were “kept eating even though not physically hungry and loss of control.” It was noted that discussions about weight and binge eating are very sensitive and that “conversations about weight and binge eating might create such distress that individuals would prefer not to discuss the topics at all.” Gender differences included women's stronger aversions to some terms, possibly related to more frequent experiences of weight stigmatisation than men or to greater sensitivity to potentially pejorative terms. The authors concluded that “healthcare providers are encouraged to practice sensitivity and display empathy during discussions of weight and weightloss counselling with female patients in particular.” What words to avoid? Rated as less desireable are terms such as “fatness” and “excess fat,” as well as “large size,” “heaviness,” and “obesity.” Also to be avoided are terms such as “willpower.” Additional obstacles to a comprehensive evaluation, as identified in a study of physician–patient conversations about BED,3 included the observations that psychiatrists focused on weight-related issues, whereas patients focused on the emotional impact and triggers of binge eating episodes, and that there is often miscommunication about the severity of binge eating episodes, as well as judgment, bias and shame surrounding BED. Lydecker et al. recommend that healthcare providers use more preferred terms when discussing obesity (weight) and binge eating (kept eating/not physically hungry and loss of control). Individual patients’ preferences when discussing sensitive topics including weight and binge eating will make themselves evident when the topic is introduced. A caveat is that the loss of control in binge-eating episodes can be a complex behaviour to understand and communicate. However, not bringing the topic up at all would be doing a disservice to our patients.

Most obese subjects, however, are only slightly overweight and their mortality is not elevated. Reasons for dieting are more often psychological than somatic. 2. Reducing diets are ineffective because the obese rarely follow them. Total fasting and intestinal bypass may provide better results, but are more dangerous. 3. Atkins' diet eliminates carbohydrates from food without restricting protein and fat intake. Deprived of carbohydrates, the body uses fat for fuel. A small part of metabolized fat is eliminated in the urine as ketone bodies, and this is why such diets are called \"ketogenic\". They have been known at least since 1863. 4. Caloric loss due to ketonuria does not exceed 100 Cal/day in the non-diabetic. It is maximal during total fasting and cannot be increased by a ketogenic diet. 5. In the short run, such diets produce rapid weight loss due to polyuria. On the other hand, refeeding carbohydrates causes water retention and weight gain. 6. The diet decreases appetite: patients eat less without feeling severe hunger and without measuring their food intake. 7. Orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, and nausea are frequent, despite what Dr. ATKINS claims. 8. The diet increases plasma cholesterol and uric acid. It may be dangerous in diabetes (anorexia, acidosis) and in heart or kidney failure (hypokalemia). 9. The diet, though far from good, is better than the book. ATKINS' theories are at best half-truths, and the results he claims lack credibility. The obese subject's disappointment with traditional reducing diets and the book's hard-sell style account for ATKINS' success.",

In individuals with food allergies, the immune system mistakenly identifies certain proteins in food as harmful, triggering an allergic response. This response can range from mild symptoms, such as hives, itching, or gastrointestinal discomfort, to severe and potentially life-threatening reactions, like anaphylaxis. Food allergies affect people of all ages, though they are more common in children. Some of the most prevalent food allergens include peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat, soy, fish, and shellfish. Unlike food intolerances, which involve the digestive system, food allergies engage the immune system, making their effects more immediate and potentially dangerous. Management typically involves strict avoidance of allergenic foods, careful reading of food labels, and carrying emergency medications, such as epinephrine auto-injectors, for severe reactions. Education and awareness play a crucial role in minimizing the risks associated with food allergies and improving quality of life for those affected.",

      "title": "The mysteries of iron metabolism: magnetic attractions",
      "abstract": "Iron is a fascinating nutrient; sometimes it seems that the more we find out about it, the less we seem to know. It has long been recognised that iron is an essential nutrient with a number of functions in the body, but the details of how the body manages its iron economy continues to baffle experts in the field. For example, our ability to absorb iron shows huge variability; under various circumstances, absorption can be curtailed to a very low proportion of intake, whereas under other circumstances it can be as high as 90%. This seems to suggest that the body acknowledges that it can have too much of a good thing and, in the majority of individuals, seeks to exclude uptake from the gut when sufficient is available within body tissues to meet physiological needs. On the other hand, it can step up absorption during times, such as pregnancy, when demands are high. Worldwide, iron-deficiency anaemia is one of the major nutritional problems, the main cause being an inadequate dietary supply. The presence of anaemia is associated with fatigue, poor physical performance and immune system abnormalities, and hence, can impact considerably on economic productivity. On the other hand, iron overload is recognised as a risk for those with a genetic propensity to develop haemochromatosis, in which iron absorption ceases to be effectively regulated. This condition is relatively rare and iron storage levels can be very high, but questions have also been asked about the possibility of a more moderate level of iron storage being a risk factor in cancer and cardiovascular disease. This was one of the topics addressed in a keynote lecture by Dr Klaus Schumann at the 17th International Congress of Nutrition, held in Vienna in August 2001. He concluded that, although there is conflicting evidence with regard to heart disease, iron's ability to amplify oxidative stress and dysregulate antioxidant-oxidant balance, which may be important in a number of chronic diseases, including cancer, leads him to recommend that iron intakes should not rise above physiological requirements (Schumann 2001). However, he was quick to point out that none of the available data indicate a causal role for iron per se in heart disease or cancer, and the complex regulatory mechanisms associated with such diseases makes it particularly difficult to tease out a role for a specific dietary component. As discussed by Dr Ashwell (pp 305–308), interest in iron metabolism and the possibility of iron overload has resulted in the identification of a number of genes that may be important in iron regulation. Study of these may throw some light on these complex questions. One of the fascinating aspects about iron is that the amount consumed is not a good indication of the person's iron status. This suggests that genetic factors may be important in determining absorption and metabolism of iron. It also highlights the difficulties that exist in accurately assessing iron status. The review of the Government's Optimal Nutrition Status programme of research, conducted by BNF recently (Buttriss & Hughes 2000) revealed the lack of a definitive single biomarker for iron status. For example, the iron storage protein, ferritin, is affected by the acute phase response associated with infection and hence is a totally unreliable marker of status in subjects with infection. The transport protein, transferrin, is also influenced in a similar way. Typically, therefore, a number of biomarkers are being measured in tandem, while the search continues for a single definitive measure. Because of the prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia, iron fortification programmes have been initiated around the world. However, failure to recognise the interaction between infection and indices of iron stores may have meant, in the past, that some programmes have been to the detriment of those recipients with infection. In the face of infection, the body seems to package away the mineral, which has potent redox potential, to keep it from harm's way, resulting in a misleading reduction in serum ferritin levels; giving extra iron under such circumstances might exacerbate the problem. The knowledge we have about the ability of the body to increase or decrease iron uptake according to circumstances and growing awareness of the interactions that occur between micronutrients, begs the question of whether single-nutrient fortification regimens are of any benefit whatsoever. Delegates at the Vienna Congress heard Dr Richard Hurrell describe the interactions that occur between iron, iodine and vitamin A (Hurrell 2001), information that suggests that single-nutrient interventions are doomed to failure among many recipients, particularly in those countries where poor nutrition is rife. Worldwide, 700 million people are reported to be iron-deficient, 200 million are iodine-deficient and many are vitamin A-deficient, including 50 million children under the age of 5 years (Hurrell 2001). Many of these children go blind or die from minor diseases as a result of impaired immune function. Many individuals in poor countries of south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have two or even all three deficiencies concurrently. A study in Venezuela, where these deficiencies are commonplace, has shown that supplementation with iron alone was not as efficient in restoring blood haemoglobin concentration as cosupplementation with vitamin A. With regard to iron and iodine, Hurrell hypothesised that an adequate iron status is necessary for normal production of the iodine-containing thyroid hormones; one of the key enzymes in the process is an iron-containing protein. Again, this finding helps to explain why treatment of goitre with iodine alone results in relatively slow progress and incomplete correction of the problem in many malnourished individuals. Another nutrient now known to interact with iodine in thyroid function is selenium. More details can be found in the new BNF Briefing Paper on this subject, written by Sara Stanner (BNF 2001). Part of the BNF's remit in critically evaluating the research programme on iron, which was formerly funded by MAFF and is now under the auspices of the Food Standards Agency, was to provide suggestions for research priorities. These included the need to: critically evaluate the relative risks of iron-deficiency and iron overload; gain further insight into the mechanisms by which iron uptake is regulated, in particular the proteins involved at the level of the gut mucosa and the role of iron-binding proteins and ligands in the movement of iron from the mucosal cell into the circulation and beyond, and the impact on this of genetic inheritance; investigate the efficiency of downregulation of iron uptake with increasing iron stores in healthy subjects; investigate interactions with other dietary components and gain insight into the effects of unabsorbed iron on colon health; identify functional outcomes that are related to markers of iron status, such as markers for psychomotor or cognitive development in children; reach a consensus on the best methods available by which iron status can be determined; standardise the methodology for measuring such markers, e.g. serum transferrin receptors; and produce international standards for this methodology. Such developments will enable dose–response studies to be conducted in human subjects and interindividual variations in iron status to be investigated. It should come as no surprise that the Government's recently appointed Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) has listed iron as one of its priority topics for its consideration. Details of the plans can be found on the Food Standards Agency's website (http://www.foodstandards.gov.uk). Several papers within this issue of the Nutrition Bulletin consider iron. A review by Dr Frankie Robinson considers the nutritional contribution of meat to the British diet, meat being the major source of haem, the more bioavailable form of iron. A paper by Dr Margaret Ashwell summarises the work currently underway, funded by the UK government, on this fascinating transition metal.",

Excessive fat is deposited because more calories are ingested than are required. Caloric homeostasis is thought to be disrupted primarily as a psychosomatic disorder, wherein food intake is geared to emotional needs rather than metabolic requirements. However, psychotherapy, diet, anorexigenic pills, et cetera, achieve poor long-term results.The problem needs to be re-examined. In recent years, considerable information has accumulated concerning: (a) the factors controlling feeding behavior in animals, and (b) the metabolic activity of adipose tissue.

In this study we investigated postwar binge eating in 67 World War II combat veterans and 198 former prisoners of war. As predicted, binge eating was relatively rare in combat veterans but was significantly more prevalent in veterans who, as prisoners in German prisoner of war camps, lost significant amounts of weight during their captivity. Our data thus support the contention that starvation or dieting seems to precede binge eating.",

People with eating disorders often report following a vegetarian or vegan diet, but there is a lack of evidence to show that vegetarian/vegan diets increase the risk of developing an eating disorder. The chapter considers the relevance of plant-based diets under the context of climate change while mentioning how nutrients in those diets might be lacking.

      "abstract": "Das Durstempfinden des Menschen ist ein verlässlicher Sinn, der effektiv vor Dehydratation schützt. Trinken über den Durst hinaus ist physiologisch nicht notwendig. Um den Grundbedarf zu decken, sollten Erwachsene pro Tag 2 – 2,5 l Wasser aufnehmen, davon stammen rund 1,5 l aus Getränken. Der Zusatzbedarf und damit die optimale Trinkmenge richten sich nach der Schweißproduktion. Intensive sportliche Aktivität kann einen Wasserverlust von 4 – 10 l bewirken, der ersetzt werden muss. Im Leistungssport ist darüber hinaus der Ersatz von Kohlenhydraten und Elektrolyten erforderlich. Trinkempfehlungen für Sportler zielen immer auf eine ausgeglichene Wasserbilanz. Gute Sportgetränke sorgen für eine schnelle Verfügbarkeit von Wasser, indem sie rasch aus dem Magen entleert und im Dünndarm absorbiert werden. Darüber hinaus liefern sie schnell verfügbare Zucker und Natrium. Isotone oder leicht hypotone Getränke mit 30 – 80 g Kohlenhydraten und 400 – 1100 mg Natrium pro Liter erfüllen diese Kriterien am besten. Hypertone Getränke wie Fruchtsäfte, Energydrinks oder Limonaden eignen sich nicht als Sportgetränke, da sie die Dehydratation kurzfristig verstärken. Auch natriumarmes Wasser führt zu einer Nettosekretion von Elektrolyten in das Darmlumen. Für die Anreicherung von Sportgetränken mit Vitaminen oder potenziell leistungsfördernden Substraten gibt es keine wissenschaftliche Basis.",

The majority of episodes are acute and self-limiting and are usually caused by commonly occurring bacteria or viruses. The symptoms are produced by toxins secreted by the micro-organisms, either on to food before ingestion or once inside the gut. Other, non- infective causes may also be responsible including stress, alcohol and hot, spicy food. Many drugs can cause diarrhoea as a side-effect including antibiotics, some antacids, iron, diuretics, and toxic levels of digoxin. Laxative abuse, both unwitting and deliberate, may also be responsible.",

      "title": "Embarrassing diabetes",
      "abstract": "Embarrassed and hypoglycaemic: ‘I was acting soooo very strange and weird in front of all customers shopping and the check-out girls were gawping away at me too … Security guy was pacing up and down in front of me – watching me sweating and talking oddly too. Slurring my words dreadfully, trying to get help and unable to explain my weird behaviour to all observing me. It was “awful” – I was trying so hard yet getting absolutely nowhere at the same time.’1 Publicity about obesity causing diabetes has led to a widespread assumption that people with diabetes are to blame for their condition. ‘I call it the blame and shame disease.’ ‘I think the stigma is that it's a lifestyle disease. That somehow you've been lazy and you've allowed this to happen to yourself.’ People with diabetes may also feel that they are negatively stereotyped, discriminated against, and have restricted opportunities.2 The social stigma of diabetes is more likely in some communities than others, for example among South Asian patients: ‘Yes, it is a bit bad … I mean you try and hide your illness; no-one should know that you have any illness.’3 And no-one, of any age, wants to stand out negatively from their peers. ‘It is hard to describe how enervating it was to get up six or seven times a night to pee … I became nervous of going to plays or concerts in case I could not last until the interval without a pee. It was embarrassing to go out with someone attractive and keep disappearing into the ladies.’4 The polyuria of hyperglycaemia can also cause urinary incontinence. Children may start bedwetting. The intense itching of candidal vulvovaginitis or balanitis leads to a desperate desire to scratch. Intercourse may be unattractive or painful and may infect the partner. Other genital or urinary infections are also common in diabetes, causing urinary frequency and an unpleasant smell. Erectile dysfunction is one of the most embarrassing experiences for a man and affects many men with diabetes. It is also embarrassing seeking help, so many suffer in silence (even when asked directly), with adverse psychological consequences. People with diabetes are more likely than non-diabetic people to report gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, particularly if they have poor glucose control. In addition to dehydration and neuropathy, medication often causes GI symptoms. An Australian study compared people with diabetes vs controls. The odds ratio for any bowel symptoms was 1.84.5 A Swedish study found GI symptoms in 87% of diabetic patients. These included difficulty swallowing (19%), nausea (26%), vomiting (2%), abdominal fullness (29%), bloating (49%), regurgitation (34%), constipation (19%), diarrhoea (16%), motion incontinence (4%), symptomatic postprandial hypoglycaemia (16%) and postprandial perspiration (11%). Abnormal oesophageal motility was found in 63% of patients, and 13% had delayed gastric emptying.6 Diarrhoea and constipation often alternate making treatment difficult. Diabetic diarrhoea is particularly distressing. The diarrhoea may be sudden with urgency and faecal incontinence. It is usually nocturnal or early morning and occurs in bouts lasting days or weeks. Patients may feel unable to go out. They plan outings around public toilet availability. Most people with diabetes do not have body odours. Periodontal disease and gingivitis are frequent in people with diabetes, as is oral candidiasis and other intraoral problems. These can cause bad breath. Diabetic foot or leg ulcers and other infections, especially those with anaerobes, can smell very unpleasant. Charcoal wound dressings sometimes help, although the key is treating the infection. Eructation may smell unpleasant if the patient has gastric retention. Flatulence can also be problematic: ‘I need your help to solve a horrible problem I have developed since being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes several months ago. My doctor prescribed medicine to help control my blood sugar. I've been watching my diet … My problem is TERRIBLE gas. I cannot control it. This never happened before. I can hardly move, let alone walk or bend without outbursts that are both loud and long, just like a motorboat.’7 Flatulence is often due to dietary change – for example, more soluble fibre – or a side effect of medication particularly acarbose (worsened by not cutting sucrose), and sometimes metformin. Most people with diabetes have no visible evidence of the disease. But some suffer significant changes, e.g. loss of toes or leg, skin problems, weight gain on medication. Amputation has huge emotional and physical effects – including embarrassment: ‘Since my amputation of my [leg] above the knee I often feel shame, embarrassment and very self-conscious. I hate not having my leg.’8 Any disability can cause self-consciousness, e.g. ‘abnormal’ appearance or behaviour, wheelchair dependence, seeking ‘disabled toilets’, having to rely on others for help, being ignored. Health care professionals and helpers should be sensitive to this, and to the need to communicate with the patient rather than the carer – not ‘he doesn't take sugar, does he?’ No-one likes skin problems, such as pustules, diabetic dermopathy, and blisters. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, although uncommon, is unsightly and distressing, especially for women. Concealment is difficult. Insulin hypertrophy or atrophy stops patients wearing shorts or swimming costumes, or participating in sport or swimming. Large, festering ulcers are even worse. Visual loss is devastating and impacts on most aspects of life. It is embarrassing to be unable to read letters (why don't all hospitals send large-print letters to visually-impaired patients?), signs, official forms, information leaflets, equipment instructions, credit card terminals, mobile phones etc. The Royal National Institute for Blind People can help.9 Deafness is more common among people with diabetes than those without. So patients cannot hear what staff say and don't seek repetition – they don't want to appear stupid or to delay the busy doctor. People with diabetes may have impaired smell and taste, which can cause both distress and embarrassment, e.g. over-flavouring cooking. Diabetic sensory neuropathy and other neurological damage can lead to difficulty walking, e.g. stumbling, and impaired hand sensation or function. It is humiliating to fall over things, stagger as if drunk, or to drop your tea cup, for example. Diabetes treatment causes much embarrassment. Everyone with diabetes is encouraged to reduce sugar intake and eat a healthy diet. Food is a major part of social and family life. ‘If we refuse to eat some food items people think that we are too hard to please. Many times they will say “Oh, it's not going to harm you if you have this bit here” and if you do not eat it when they offer, it is a really bad thing.’3 Medication can cause problems, e.g. taking it visibly, or side effects. Insulin injections cause most concern: ‘A female waiter saw me giving insulin in a restaurant. They sent a male waiter to deliver our meals. My friend excused herself to go to the bathroom. She heard the male waiter talk to the female waiter. He said…, “She's not shooting up… She's diabetic… She's just taking her insulin!”…’10 Hypoglycaemia is the most feared glucose problem. No-one wants to lose control or become confused. Some people become aggressive or even dangerous when hypoglycaemic. It is worse than embarrassing if your family is afraid of you, or if you are arrested. This is just one reason to ensure that glucose-lowering treatment is carefully tailored to individual patients. ‘Almost collapsed due to a hypo in Tesco. I started leaning on the products unintentionally and they thought I was trying to steal something. They took me into an “office” and had to plead my case.’11 Tests upset some patients. Many hate blood glucose testing and avoid doing it in public. Take steps to reduce the embarrassment of providing urine samples. For some people, any medical encounter is embarrassing. The vast majority of health care professionals are kind and courteous. Even so, well-meaning staff may compound patient embarrassment. ‘Your sugar's high – did you take your insulin?’ ‘You've put on weight – you haven't been a good girl, have you?’ ‘You really must try and do better.’ One 60-year-old business man with newly-diagnosed diabetes was handed a leaflet about Mr Insulin and Mrs Sugar! Most of these problems can be prevented or improved. We know how to reduce the risk of complications and how to limit existing tissue damage. There is ample evidence-based guidance on good diabetes care. Some patients receive this, while many do not. In 2011–12, 60.5% (59.4% in 2009–10) of people with diabetes had all eight care processes essential to identifying those requiring intervention (the ninth process is retinopathy screening, recorded elsewhere) – with good risk factor control in 20.8% (19.3% in 2009–10).12 Targets may not be appropriate for some patients. In 2010, 44.5% of diabetic inpatients had at least one error in their glucose-lowering medication. This fell to 37.0% in 2013.13 Diabetes care has improved but it remains highly embarrassing, both for health care professionals and for those responsible for health care commissioning and provision, that so many patients still fail to receive optimal management. ‘Here I am sitting at a desk with a pen in my hand, my body covered with needle marks and bruises, my blood full of sugar, my toes numb, my fingertips white. I feel tired and heavy. There are flowers on the desk in front of me and there is the beast behind me. I am diabetic and I am sitting here trying to work out what difference that makes. I will never know, and would never really want to know. Diabetes has not stopped me being blessed with life. Of that I feel certain.’4",

      "title": "Aging With or Aging Out of Drug Use? Older Adults’ Experiences of Aging with Long-Term Drug Use",
      "abstract": "Older adults with long-term drug use have long been overlooked in both drug research and aging research. More knowledge is needed about their experiences and needs. Drug use is often seen as a youth phenomenon and as something that with time leads to destructiveness and compulsion. A more nuanced picture of who uses drugs and what the use may look like over time is necessary. There is limited insight into what it means to age with drug use, based on individuals’ own stories and experiences. We conducted 27 semistructured interviews in Sweden with individuals aged 55 or older who reported current and long-term drug use. In this article, we demonstrate how the relationship with drugs evolves over time and how the interviewees contemplate stopping or continuing their use. Three themes were identified: (1) Aging out of drug use: Thoughts on drug cessation. Some expressed a desire to end their drug use. The reasons behind this varied, but there was a clear pattern related to older age. (2) Aging with drug use: Thoughts on continued use. Some had a desire to continue using drugs and expressed concern about how everyday life would be without them. (3) Age adapted drug use: A change in drug use. Several participants stated that their drug consumption had changed over time and with age. Drugs no longer dominated their lives as before but still served essential functions. The themes should not be seen as rigid categories, but as fluid narratives. Understanding this variation provides a deeper insight into people's often complex relationship with drugs.",

      "title": "Call for an urgent rethink of the ‘health at every size’ concept",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Amanda Sainsbury[sup.1] and Phillipa Hay[sup.2,3] The argument for an urgent rethink When I (AS) was a child, my grandmother used to say Don't pull an ugly face, because if the wind changes, your face will become stuck like that. I don't know what evidence my grandmother had for this advice, but as a neuroscientist who studies the effects of diet on the hypothalamic control of appetite and body weight, I say Don't eat an ugly diet or let yourself stay fat, because if the wind changes you may become stuck with permanent obesity. The long-term effects of excess calories and adiposity on body weight regulation appear to have been overlooked in the fat acceptance movement that has emerged in parallel with the obesity epidemic. In this commentary I outline the possibility that excess body fat and its underlying contributors lead to permanent changes in the brain pathways that control body weight, and call for urgent reconsideration of the 'health at every size' concept. While I certainly agree that it is possible to have healthy behaviours that provide health benefits at a wide variety of body sizes, I disagree that it is possible to be - or to stay - truly healthy at every size. The World Health Organisation decrees that a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m[sup.2] is generally optimum for health, at least for Caucasians between the ages of 18 and 65 [1]. However, there are many people who are healthy who have a BMI outside this range. For instance, some people self-impose long-term calorie restriction and generally have a low BMI and exhibit metabolic benefits, in keeping with animal studies which show that long-term calorie restriction prolongs life [2]. There are also people with a BMI in the overweight ([greater than or equai to] 25 kg/m[sup.2]) or obese ([greater than or equai to] 30 kg/m[sup.2]) range that exhibit no signs of eminent metabolic disease whatsoever, and these are not limited to people who are body builders or elite athletes [3]. Moreover, overweight or obese people who lose as little as 5-10% of their body weight exhibit significant health gains, even if their BMI remains in the overweight or obese range. Examples include improved fertility and pregnancy outcomes [4], moderate to large clinical improvements in osteoarthritic joint pain [5], and a markedly reduced likelihood of progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus [6]. Indeed, without losing any weight at all, substantial health gains can be achieved through better diet and exercise in overweight or obese people [7]. Despite the above evidence that it certainly is possible to be healthy - or to gain health benefits - at a wide variety of BMIs, there is a large body of evidence that having a BMI outside certain limits increase the risk of health problems, hence the WHO recommendations. In general, a low BMI - an indicator of malnutrition - is associated with poor health outcomes. While the exact proportion of obese people who are metabolically healthy varies depending on what criteria are used to define both obesity and health, it is smaller than the proportion of obese people who are not metabolically healthy [3]. As it is currently not possible to predict which people will remain metabolically healthy despite excessive weight gain, it may be dangerous to make blanket community statements that people can have health at every size. Moreover, recent research suggests that even for obese people who are metabolically healthy, it is only a question of time before a variety of issues raise their heads, contributing to significantly greater mortality from cardiovascular disease and all other causes [8]. Whether or not a person with excess weight develops metabolic diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, sooner or later the mechanical effects of excess weight and the resultant gait abnormalities, combined with systemic inflammation, are likely to take a toll. As one example, adults who are overweight have a 2. …",

Megatons of forest products have been consumed in examining and reexamining the possible associations between children's behavior and consumption of sugar, artificial sweeteners, food additives and colorings, and assorted specific foods. Generally speaking, conviction has taken precedence over scientific evidence. A review of publications on the subject yields a conglomeration of positive, negative, and inconclusive results (mostly the latter two). Evaluation of such studies is complicated by pervasive methodologic design errors, the major ones being lack of double-blinding in test situations and the assumption of guilt (ie, causality) by statistical association. Beliefs Both physician and parental belief in a linkage between food and behavior begins during the child's early infancy. Excessive crying (\"colic\") is the most common problem leading to formula change, which leads many parents and doctors to believe that the infant is allergic to cow milk, especially if the crying seems to decrease following the change, although such allergy rarely is proven. As Forsythe and colleagues 1 have noted, changing an infant's formula may not be an innocuous practice, especially if it leads to an erroneous belief that the infant has some intrinsic abnormality, thereby altering the parent's perceptions of the child's vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "understand the effects of tenure, it is useful to consider the effects of alcohol: The first draught is usually medicinal. The elixir is a shield against unbearable pain. It is administered, perhaps, as an antidote to stress or to cope with trauma. But what begins as a means to succor from physical and psychological suffering imperceptibly but inevitably becomes an end in itself. Without recognizing it, one grows dependent on the drug. It gradually begins to distort one's sense of reality and leads to saying and doing things one would not have done in a nonaddicted state. Often, it leads to a kind of languor and to neglect of important tasks. The alcoholic's once bright potential slips away in a haze of paranoia, hostility, irresponsibility, and self -disrespect. But, significantly, the alcoholic will not, cannot, admit to the addiction. The alcoholic invents all sorts of reasons why he or she cannot live without drink. The alcoholic is consumed by fear of life without a support line. And try as he might to avoid it, there is an inescapable and terrible fact that the alcoholic must ultimately face: There is only one sure cure for alcoholism-abstinence . Like alcohol to alcoholics, tenure is too important to the American professoriat. Among a sample of humanities professors, tenure was ranked as the most significant factor to be considered when seeking a job, and a cross-section of the general professorial population ranked it a close second to money. Moreover, where tenure was once a means to the noble end of unfettered pursuit of knowledge, it has now become an end in itself. The evidence of this can be seen in the transformation of the American Association of University Professors from a professional JAMES OTOOLE, a social anthropologist, is director of the Twenty Year Forecast project at the University of Southern California, where he is an associate professor of management in the Graduate School of Business.

      "abstract": "We hear so often that we should avoid sugar as much as possible because it is not good for our health. It is important to understand the reasons WHY and HOW it is detrimental to our health. To begin with a definition of what sugar is, it is a carbohydrate that provides energy for our body, and is found naturally in most plants, but especially in sugar cane and sugar beets. Before sugar (sucrose) enters the bloodstream from the digestive tract, it is broken down into two simple sugars called glucose and fructose. Glucose is in every living cell, and if we don't get it from our diet, our bodies produce it [2]. Fructose is different because our bodies do not produce it in any significant amount, and there is no physiological need for it [2]. Fructose can only be metabolized by the liver in large amounts, which is usually not a problem if it is eaten in moderate amounts [2]. It will be turned into glycogen and stored in the liver until it is needed [2]. However, if the liver is overloaded with glycogen, then consuming more fructose will turn it into fat [2]. For people who are inactive and eat a Western diet, large amounts of fructose from added sugars get turned into fat in the liver [2]. When sugar is transported into the body, it stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin. Some “good” sugars are found naturally in foods like fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, and whole grains, while others “bad sugars” are added and used during processing and cooking (added sugars).",

The aim of the work is to prove the use of nutritional supplements in the training of athletes, especially weightlifters, is quite effective and necessary for high athletic performance. Nutrition plays a huge role in achieving maximum results in fitness, bodybuilding and sports in general. When creating a training strategy, the basis of the nutrition program should be the use of certain types of products. Nutritional supplements, as it follows from this term, are only a supplement, a kind of support for proper nutrition and intensive training (especially with weights). Nutritional supplements are not a panacea, they can in no way replace proper nutrition and proper training. Nutritional supplements are substances that are a building material, protect and increase the function of cells in the body, and do not have a negative impact on human health.&#x0D; Maintaining excellent health is achieved through the use of sports supplements because the need for these drugs in athletes is very high. Athletes due to heavy physical activity spend a lot of energy, nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids.

      "title": "Behavioral and cognitive effects of smoking: Relationship to nicotine addiction",
      "abstract": "Nicotine addiction is an extremely complex process that involves biological, psychological, behavioral, and cultural factors. Three factors that influence smoking and that are influenced by smoking are performance, stress, and body weight. We know that if nicotine-addicted smokers are deprived of nicotine, attentional and cognitive abilities can be impaired, and such deficits can be reversed if the person smokes or is given nicotine. In nonsmokers and nondeprived smokers, nicotine enhances finger tapping, focused and sustained attention, recognition memory, and reasoning. Stress results in increased smoking, but there is little empirical evidence that smoking reduces stress. Stress reduction from smoking is likely the relief of withdrawal-induced negative mood that is experienced between cigarettes. Smokers weigh on average 3-4 kg less than nonsmokers, and the weight-gain seen after quitting smoking also averages 3-4 kg. Changes in eating and energy expenditure are responsible for the body weight changes seen during smoking cessation and relapse. We need to know the full range of conditions under which nicotine affects behavior. The mechanisms by which stress functions to maintain nicotine addiction are not well understood. We do not know what interventions are effective in addressing the stress experienced during smoking cessation. Because no effective interventions have been developed to prevent weight-gain after quitting, research should focus on the concern or perception of weight-gain. We need to understand how and why body weight concerns vary across gender, age, and ethnicity because of the implications for designing effective smoking-cessation programs.",

Pregnant women should be screened routinely for substance abuse. Because self-report may be unreliable, toxicology screens can be useful, especially if multiple drugs are being abused. Each individual drug has unique maternal and fetal effects. Licit substances such as alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine are more frequently abused. Complete cessation of alcohol should be encouraged to avoid the development of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and long-term neurobehavioral effects. Marijuana is the most commonly abused illicit drug. Opioid maintenance programs can be utilized in opioid addicted patients (including heroin and cocaine) to avoid relapses. Neonatal abstinence syndrome should be expected in these infants and managed appropriately.",

Pada sejumlah kasus, konsumsi mie instan berlebihan juga dapat menyebabkan kegemukan atau obesitas.Apabila Anda biasanya mengkonsumsi mie instan setiap hari, mulailah untuk menguranginya dengan tenggang waktu 2hingga 3 hari dan lakukan sampai Anda terbebas dari mie instan sama sekali.Menurut penelitian ternyata di dalam mie instan terdapat kandungan lilin yang berbahaya kesehatan. Kandungan lilin dalam mie instan berguna untuk membuat mie tidak lengket satu dengan lainnya. Dengan seringnya kita mengkonsumsi mie instan berarti kita juga telah memasukkan banyak kandungan lilin ke dalam tubuh kita. Kandungan lilin tersebut akan merusak sistem kerja pencernaan dalam tubuh karena baru bisa dicerna oleh tubuh dalam waktuminimal 2 hari.Selain kandungan lilin, di dalam mie instan juga terdapat natrium yang dapat menyebabkan penyakit tekanan darah tinggi (hipertensi) dan maag. Jika dikonsumsi berlebihan dalam waktu yang cukup lama, kandungan natrium ini tentu secara signifikan dapat menimbulkan penyakit di atas. Hal ini didasari oleh karena kandungan natrium yang bersifat menetralkan lambung, sehingga mengakibatkan lambung Anda akan mensekreasi asam dalam jumlah yang banyak agar dapat mencerna makanan. Mie instan ternyata juga mempunyai kandungan zat-zat lain yang dapat membahayakan kesehatan tubuh kita, seperti MSG dan penambah rasa. Jika Anda masih ingin mengkonsumsi mie instan tetapi ingin tetap sehat Anda harus melakukannya sesuai saran penyajian, dan jangan memasak bumbu mie instan secara bersamaan mienya, karena jika bumbu mie instan dimasak di atas suhu120 oC bisa memicu terjadinya sel kanker.",

      "title": "Dietary Strategies for Weight Management",
      "abstract": "In an 'obesogenic' environment, getting people to eat appropriate amounts is challenging. Several food-based strategies have the potential to promote satiety and moderate energy intake. Components of foods such as macronutrients and functional ingredients can affect satiety; however, for weight management a more comprehensive approach is needed that emphasizes behavioral strategies to improve the overall diet. Research shows that large portions of energy-dense foods facilitate overconsumption and that reductions in portion size and energy density are associated with reduced energy intake. While this suggests that people should eat smaller portions, recent data show that if people lower the energy density of their diet, they can continue to eat their usual amount of food while limiting calories. Furthermore, serving larger portions of low-energy-dense foods can be used strategically to encourage their consumption and reduce dietary energy density, and this has been shown to be associated with decreased energy intake while maintaining satiety. This new understanding of how portion size can be used positively to manage energy intake has the potential to help people achieve sustainable improvements in their energy intake and bodyweight. Science-based strategies that increase the availability of affordable nutrient-rich, lower energy-dense foods are urgently needed.",

      "abstract": "A poor start in life owing to a restricted diet can have readily detectable detrimental consequences for many adult life-history traits. However, some costs such as smaller adult body size are potentially eliminated when individuals modify their development. For example, male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) that have reduced early food intake undergo compensatory growth and delay maturation so that they eventually mature at the same size as males that develop normally. But do subtle effects of a poor start persist? Specifically, does a male's developmental history affect his subsequent attractiveness to females? Females prefer to associate with larger males but, controlling for body length, we show that females spent less time in association with males that underwent compensatory growth than with males that developed normally.",

This stage is an important time for physicians to monitor growth using growth charts and body mass index and to make recommendations for healthy eating. Fat and cholesterol restriction should be avoided in children younger than two years. After two years of age, fat should account for 30 percent of total daily calories, with an emphasis on polyunsaturated fats. Toddlers should consume milk or other dairy products two or three times daily, and sweetened beverages should be limited to 4 to 6 ounces of 100 percent juice daily. Vitamin D, calcium, and iron should be supplemented in select toddlers, but the routine use of multivitamins is unnecessary. Food from two of the four food groups should be offered for snacks, and meals should be made up of three of the four groups. Parental modeling is important in developing good dietary habits. No evidence exists that early childhood obesity leads to adult obesity, but physicians should monitor body mass index and make recommendations for healthy eating. The fear of obesity must be carefully balanced with the potential for undernutrition in toddlers.",

An examination of the research literature on the results of drinking during pregnancy does not provide any evidence that light drinking is harmful to the foetus. The chief defects in the research that make conclusions about the effects of ‘moderate’ or light' drinking invalid are the ways in which drinking patterns are categorized: a) usually the categories used are ‘average per day’, the different effects of bingeing and light drinking being thus confused; b) often the heaviest drinking category is described as ‘two or more drinks a day’, sometimes even ‘one or more’. Obviously, one cannot tell whether any instances of foetal damage occurring in that group came from women who drank only two drinks each day, which would be light drinking, or from those who drank ten drinks each day since “ten drinks a day” is part of the category “two or more”.",

      "title": "Moderate Alcohol Consumption in Later Life: Time for a Trial?",
      "abstract": "“Antonio Todde, the world's oldest man, has died just short of his 113th birthday. … Relatives said Todde attributed his longevity to a glass of red wine every day.” (BBC News, January 5, 2002) “The world's oldest man celebrated his 113th birthday on Thursday … Tanabe … believes the key to longevity is not drinking alcohol.” (http://Reuters.com, September 18, 2008) In this edition of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, Lee et al.1 report a survival advantage associated with moderate alcohol consumption in later life and show that this effect is still present after adjustment for socioeconomic status and number of functional limitations. Their study is the latest piece of research to investigate the possibility that consuming alcohol at “moderate” levels—typically defined as one or two drinks per day—in later life is associated with better health outcomes than abstention. It seems clear that heavy regular or occasional (binge) drinking is harmful at all ages, and there is little controversy over the need to avoid alcohol in combination with certain medications or when operating a vehicle. A systematic review published in 2002 found insufficient evidence to specify the magnitude of risk posed by alcohol use for falls and fall injuries, functional disability, cognitive impairment, and all-cause mortality in older people2 and identified a need for more longitudinal studies. Since then, a number of longitudinal analyses have investigated relationships between moderate alcohol consumption and outcomes, including physical function,3, 4 falls (e.g.,5, 6), and cognitive function.7, 8 Most (although not all) of these studies have affirmed the presence of a protective effect on health associated with moderate alcohol consumption in later life. Furthermore, the recently published Second Expert Report of the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) stated that, although the evidence on cancer alone would justify a recommendation to avoid alcohol consumption altogether, the apparent reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease suggested an overall beneficial effect of moderate alcohol consumption.9 In general, the observational evidence of a J-shaped curve with alcohol consumption, with abstainers and heavier drinkers being at higher risk of adverse outcomes than moderate drinkers, is fairly consistent, and the advantage of moderate drinking is not trivial. Lee et al. estimate an odds ratio of moderate drinking, compared with no drinking, of 0.72 (95% confidence interval=0.57–0.91), even after adjustment for functional status and socioeconomic status. So why does uncertainty still appear to surround this potential benefit? Why, for example, does the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) recommend that people aged 65 and older limit themselves to one alcoholic drink per day, half the recommended limit for adult men younger than 65? Much of this uncertainty relates to the limitations of observational research. The difficulty of managing subtle forms of bias and confounding has led to concerns about the value of observational epidemiology in assessing small-effect lifestyle-related risks of adverse outcomes.10 This certainly applies to studies of alcohol consumption, which are particularly susceptible to bias and confounding because they rely on self-reported levels that tend to be inaccurate and are probably underestimated; at the same time, heavy or problem drinkers are less likely to participate in studies. Perhaps most significant is the suspicion that moderate drinkers differ from abstainers in ways that are difficult to account for in epidemiological modelling. For example, researchers in Australia found moderate drinking to be associated with better cognitive function throughout adult life,11 suggesting that the effect seen in old age may be due to lifelong differences between abstainers and moderate drinkers.12 Although inaccuracy in measurement (misclassification) in exposures or outcomes generally results in attenuated associations, inaccuracies in accounting for confounders can result in inflated residual effects in statistical modelling. A powerful way to deal with these problems would be to do as Lee et al. propose and conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of alcohol consumption on clinical endpoints. There are at least two important pragmatic questions that a trial could address: Should middle-aged moderate drinkers be recommended to reduce their consumption to one drink per day once they pass the age of 65, consistent with current NIAAA recommendations? Should abstainers (with no specific contraindications to alcohol consumption) be recommended to drink moderate amounts of alcohol to reap the potential health benefits? As Lee et al. point out, limited trials of the effects of alcohol consumption on health have already been conducted. A more-extensive trial could provide valuable insights into how a set dose of alcohol is related to health outcomes. Optimum levels of alcohol consumption could be identified, and specific biomarker outcomes could be used to identify likely mechanisms of effect. A trial could also help determine the health effects of different forms of alcohol identified by some13 but by no means all14 observational studies. Recent studies report a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease morbidity15 and all-cause mortality16 in those who newly begin consuming alcohol in later life, and a trial of alcohol consumption in older people would allow these findings to be verified. However, a trial would tell less about how alcohol consumption in everyday life influences health and well-being. It would not indicate, for example, what happens when people drink when they should not because they are taking prescription drugs that interact with alcohol;17 what happens when people drink in binges rather than in regular small doses, a pattern of consumption identified as harmful;18 or to what extent the social context of alcohol consumption contributes to health outcomes.19 A further challenge would be to ensure that encouraging moderate drinking did not result in heavier drinking, thus doing more harm than good overall. There are other possible approaches to this issue. Genetic variations in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (which is involved in the metabolic breakdown of alcohol) are associated with abstinence, without changes to other health behaviors. Data exploiting this “natural” or “Mendelian” randomization support the hypothesis that higher alcohol consumption results in higher blood pressure and risk of hypertension.20 Although not conclusive by itself, such an approach sidesteps some of the difficulties facing observational studies and clinical trials. A study of health outcomes in older populations with and without this mutation would go a long way toward clarifying the issue. A final question to be answered is what is meant by “moderate.” The Oxford English Dictionary defines moderate as “of medium or middling quality, size, or extent; average in intensity, difficulty, or degree.” What is probably meant, in relation to alcohol consumption, is “not excessive,”“some, but not too much”—with the implication that there is a point at which one is consuming too much. In fact the point at which “some” becomes “too much” is likely to differ depending on the outcome of interest, as the comments of the WCRF/AICR suggest. Moreover, this point will tend to shift with age, as the body undergoes age-related physiological change and as the likelihood of various types of outcome shifts—making the job of the epidemiologist trying to define safe levels all the harder. This epidemiological uncertainty is surely troublesome for clinicians who want straightforward answers to the straightforward questions posed above: “Should I encourage or discourage moderate alcohol consumption in my older patients who have no specific contraindications to alcohol consumption?” and “How much is ‘moderate’ in older people?” There is little doubt that an effective randomized controlled trial that was able to address these questions would be valuable and could have major implications for practice. If the observational effect was borne out experimentally, this might provide a useful way of improving functioning and survival in old age. In the absence of such a study, there is insufficient evidence to recommend that older adults who drink at moderate levels should cut down their consumption (if there are no specific contraindications) and insufficient evidence to recommend that abstainers should take up drinking.

Certainly, a gluten-free diet for some people is a necessity in case of illness, but very often it is a product of striving for a healthier and different way of life carried out through nutrition. This way of eating is often represented by professional athletes, who have to compensate for their increased need for carbohydrates in a different way, when the regime of training and activities is completely adapted to a gluten-free diet. In this way, eliminating gluten quickly becomes a way of life after a short period of time. It is essential to note that a gluten-free diet is not necessary for a \"healthy\" diet -there is a much more efficient way to achieve such a style of eating, but still, you should know that some people must avoid gluten if they have celiac disease or an intolerance ie. gluten sensitivity. How and in what way a gluten-free diet affects sports activities, as well as what training method is recommended with such a diet, through a research review of the literature and previous research, the work follows the general indicators of what gluten is and how its exclusion from the diet manifests itself in sports activities.",

      "title": "Role of physical activity in regulating appetite and body fat",
      "abstract": "Abstract Recent articles in the press have questioned the role of physical activity in regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight. These articles can be confusing and misleading for the public. Yet this is a complex area and there is disagreement about the importance of physical activity even among academics. Uncertainty and misunderstanding in this area may be related to the heterogeneity of the term ‘physical activity’, which encompasses sporting pursuits with extremely high levels of energy expenditure over prolonged periods of time, as well as everyday tasks involving much lower levels of energy expenditure on an intermittent basis. This latter form of physical activity includes what has been termed ‘non‐exercise activity thermogenesis’. In the right circumstances, physical activity can make a major contribution to the maintenance of a healthy weight even in the absence of dietary control although a combination of the two is almost certain to be more effective. In the long‐term, evidence suggests that for most people exercise is likely to lead to only modest weight loss. This may be due to an insufficient amount of physical activity being performed together with compensatory changes in eating and exercise behaviours. This is hard to prove because energy intake and energy expenditure are difficult to quantify in free‐living situations. Individual differences in the way people respond to exercise due to both environmental ( e.g . social class, education level, income, eating and exercise behaviours of family and peers, weather) and genetic factors also contribute to uncertainty about the effectiveness of physical activity for weight control. Nevertheless, physical activity remains a vital component of a healthy lifestyle due to its positive influence on energy balance as well as its potential to reduce the risk of lifestyle‐related diseases.",

Some vegetarians, called vegans, avoid dairy products and eggs as well as meat, fish, and poultry. Vegan diets can also be healthful and nutritionally adequate for pregnancy. Vegetarian diets can provide numerous long-term health benefits including a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, some forms of cancer, and hypertension. Key nutrients for vegetarian pregnancy include protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, iodine, and omega-3 fatty acids. Vegetarian women should also be counseled to follow standard weight gain recommendations. A vegetarian or vegan diet can meet requirements for all of these nutrients although in some instances, fortified foods or supplements can be especially useful in meeting recommendations. The nutrient content of supplements targeted to pregnant vegetarians should be evaluated to make sure nutrient needs are being met. Dietetics professionals play important roles in counseling pregnant vegetarians and may be called upon to address a variety of issues including family concerns and pressure, making the change to a vegetarian diet during pregnancy, foods and food preparation, meal planning, and coping with common concerns of pregnancy such as nausea and constipation.

      "abstract": "This chapter dispels at least one major myth about human obesity: the idea that obesity comes about largely, if not entirely, by optional overeating, that is, a personal decision to savor the good tastes of food. It persuades the reader that the Erewhon approach to obesity is neither helpful nor correct. The chapter argues, however, that obesity can occur only on a certain biological template, the creation of which has preceded the abundance of food or food-related behaviors. The central issue of obesity is why some individuals maintain a storage of fat that is fixed at a level higher than normal. Certain considerations lead one to believe that this condition must occur as a result of faulty operation of a normal regulation of stored fat. The existence of genetic obesity in experimental animals is perhaps the single most startling experimental observation that suggests that more than just human craving for pleasure is involved in the causation of human obesity.",

Smoking is associated with a general increase of costs involved with increased morbidity, lowering of the social product and excess mortality. 2. The main prolem in weaning from smoking is related to the origin of smoking which is in large measure unknown. Smoking habits should not be analyzed on an individual basis only. It represents a \"minor addiction\" with the origin within the society. This is the result of an analysis of motives leading to smoking. Social habits, examples, deprivation of senses, dullness, anxiety, stress, and smoking as a symbol of status play a major role. 3. Stress carries a dual risk, it encourages to smoking and it exerts direct effects an organ function. 4. Smoking is enhanced by its somatic effects which activate in turn again smoking. Weaning from smoking does not affect the origin of the addiction thereby remaining symptomatic treatment. 5. There is a constant replacement of old smokers with smokers originating in the young generation. Smoking habits have the tendency to spread out of the smoking population over the non-smokers. A combat against this infiltration can only be successful by creating new values and by producing a new habit of non-smoking.",

Some of the large iceberg of symptoms among the elderly might respond to a modification of their current drug regimens. Assessments of medicine taking patterns among the elderly revealed various inadequacies in supervision and a substantial proportion of questionable prescribing. General practitioners were often unaware that elderly patients lived alone, or that they drank alcohol or drove—even when they were taking prescribed medicines for which drinking or driving were contraindicated. Just over a third of elderly people were taking prescribed medicines of which their general practitioners were apparently unaware. The way doctors prescribe for their elderly patients and supervise this prescribing is suggested as a suitable field for audit. The completeness of their records in relation to prescriptions, drinking, driving, and living alone is another possible area for study. So too is the home visiting of the very elderly, particularly those living alone.",

      "abstract": "Foods currently eaten by Americans have abundant amounts of essential omega-6 (n-6) nutrients and relatively few omega-3 (n-3) nutrients. The average omega 3 - 6 balance score of typical US foods is about –6. This imbalance causes the average American to accumulate tissue proportions of n-3 and n-6 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) with about 77% n-6 in HUFA. This HUFA balance links to many chronic health conditions that are made worse by overabundant actions of food-based omega-6 HUFA. Americans currently spend more on treating food-based health conditions than they spend on food. Less medication is needed to treat signs and symptoms when a key dietary cause of the signs and symptoms is prevented. Informed food producers can readily prepare and market new food products with more n-3 and less n-6 nutrients to reverse the current national nutrient imbalance and help people attain and maintain a healthy HUFA balance. New functional foods and nutraceuticals will help consumers shift their financial resources from treating signs and symptoms caused by HUFA imbalance to preventing the nutrient imbalance that causes the need to treat.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a contemporary important public health problem. The prevalence of overweight and obesity continues to increase worldwide. Individuals can become overweight at any age, but it is more common in certain age groups. Several studies indicate that one third of overweight adults become overweight before the age 20 years and two thirds do so after that age. There is convincing evidence that high intake of energy-dense foods promotes weight gain. Energy-dense foods tend to be high in fat and low in water content. Variations in water and fat contents between foods have the biggest impact on energy density. In the case of water, this is because water has zero energy content and the proportion of water varies substantially among commonly consumed foods. Fat also has a major impact on energy density because fat is more than twice as energy dense as either carbohydrate or protein, and fat content varies substantially between individual foods. The relatively small impact on energy density has dietary fiber. The fat and water content of foods are the main determinants of the energy density of the diet. A lower consumption of energy dense foods and energy dense drinks contributes to a reduction in total energy intake and improvement of nutritional status.",

      "abstract": "The need has never been greater to support healthy eating and physical activity in children and youth; the numbers of overweight and obese children have doubled and tripled, respectively, over the past 3 decades. Poor eating habits, including inadequate intake of vegetables, fruit, and milk, and eating too many high-calorie snacks, play a role in childhood obesity. Grain products provide the highest percentage (31%) of daily calories, followed by \"other foods,\" which have limited nutritional value (22% of daily calories). Snacks account for 27% of total daily calories, which is more than the calories consumed at breakfast (18%) and lunch (24%), but not dinner (31%). For Canadians older than 4 years of age, more than 41% of daily snack calories come from other foods, such as chips, chocolate bars, soft drinks, fruit drinks, sugars, syrup, preserves, fats, and oils. Habits that protect against childhood obesity include eating more vegetables and fruit, eating meals with family, and being physically active. Children's food habits and choices are influenced by family, caregivers, friends, schools, marketing, and the media. Successful interventions for preventing childhood obesity combine family- and school-based programs, nutrition education, dietary change, physical activity, family participation, and counseling.",

      "abstract": "Very few of the man in the survey helped with the housework, shopping or cooking while most of the women did all their own work. Only 20 % of both men and women were helped by family or friends and very few of the subjects had home-helps or 'meals on wheels' or attended lunch clubs, day centres etc. More men than women go out nearly every day and men have more outside hobbies than women. Less than half the old people attended any clubs but the women were more likely to join clubs than men. A wide range of hobbies was given. Energy expenditure was calculated from activity diaries and values taken from Durnγn and Passmore. The average daily energy expenditure for all men (average age 70 years, mean height 167.2 cm, mean weight 68.2 kg) was 2,329 kcal and the average daily energy intake was 2,399 kcal. Energy expenditure decreased with age as did energy intake except for the over 80-year group who had a slightly higher calorie intake than the 70- to 79-year group. The average daily energy expenditure for all women (mean age 71 years, mean height 154.2 cm and mean weight 61.4 kg) was 1,943 kcal and the average daily energy intake was 1,733 kcal. It is thought that energy expenditure results may include an overestimation of energy expended at housework. Energy expenditure and energy intake decreased with age. The standard deviations for all results were large showing that there was a wide range of energy intake and energy expenditure in the survey. 4.107 men (average age 66.5 years) and 46 women (average age 65 years) were stillworking (on average 34 h/week for the men and 23 h/week for the women). Most of thewomen had part-time, sedentary or domestic jobs but a wide variety of occupations(mostly in the lower social groups) was found for the men. This made it difficult to assessenergy expenditure as it was not always possible to observe the subjects at work. However, it was estimated that the men expended on average 1,000 kcal/day at work while the womenexpended only 552 kcal/day.",

It is often possible to manipulate the environment and so avoid recourse to drugs which are, however, better than physical restraint. Drugs may be used as a temporary measure in a crisis or to initiate a change in the organisation of the child' life. Of the tranquillizers, prochlorperazine and trifluoperazine may be useful; in patients who fail to respond, other preparations such as thioridazine may be used. Dosage and choice of preparation vary for different children. Long‐continued administration should not be permitted without testing the effect of gradual withdrawal. RÉSUMÉ Tranquillisants pour enfants hyperactifs L'enfant hyperactif peut L'être pour diverses raisons. Cet état ne constitue pas un syndrome. II est souvent possible d'agir sur le milieu ambiant et d'éviter ainsi de recourir á des substances médicamenteuses cependant meilleures que la contrainte physique. Les substances médicamenteuses peuvent etre employées comme mesure temporaire au cours d'une crise ou pour introduire un changement dans la vie de L'enfant. Parmi les tranquillisants, la prochlorpérazine et la trifluopérazine peuvent être utiles. Pour les malades qui ne réagiraient pas, d'autres préparations telles que la thioridazine peuvent être utilisées. La posologie et le choix de la préparation diffèrent selon les enfants.

Unter den ataraktischen Mitteln können Prochlorperazin und Trifluoperazin nützlich sein; bei Patienten die nicht reagieren, können andere Praparate, wie Thioridazin verwendet werden.

      "abstract": "Engelliler çeşitli nedenlerle hareket kısıtlaması veya bozukluğu yaşayan bireylerdir. Engelli bireylerin sosyal hayata katılımlarının sağlanabilmesi için hareket kısıtlamalarını bertaraf edecek çeşitli düzenlemelere ihtiyaç duyulmaktadır. Bu düzenlemeler toplumun gelişmişliğini gösteren unsurlardan biridir. Türkiye’de söz konusu düzenlemeler için çeşitli yasalar mevcuttur. Fakat işletmelerin bu yasal sorumlulukları ne derece hayata geçirdiklerinin sorgulanması gerekmektedir. Bu maksatla gerçekleştirilen bu çalışma ile Isparta’da yaşayan engelli bireylerin restoranların sunmakta oldukları hizmetlere erişim engellerinin ortaya çıkarılması hedeflenmiştir. Çalışmada nitel araştırma yöntemlerinden biri olan yarı yapılandırılmış görüşme tekniği uygulanmıştır. Elde edilen bulgularda, engellilerin gittikleri restoranlarda genellikle otopark alanlarında ve restoranların teçhizat ve donanımları hususunda erişim engelleri yaşamakta oldukları tespit edilirken, Isparta’daki restoranların genellikle sağlıklı bireyler tarafından kullanıldığı belirlenmiştir. Ortopedik engelliler için restoranlarda, dik merdivenlerin varlığının erişim engeli yarattığı, rampaların olmadığı, zihinsel engellilerin ise fiziksel engellere göre daha çok olumsuz tutum ve davranışlardan etkilenmekte oldukları tespit edilmiştir.",

College students are often overwhelmed by the chaos of homework and other obligations, causing them to spend little time reflecting on their health and well-being.

      "abstract": "Nowadays, everyone is conscious of body fitness and bodybuilding. People experiment with their body by exercising in the gym with heavy workout and with different diet plans. These experiments result in an adverse effect. In this case study, a 27-year-old male patient, lean built since childhood, with low body mass index (BMI), wanted to increase his weight. We took a detailed history to find out the exact cause. The patient was taking an extra amount of food for weight gaining, but because of the slow digestive fire, there was no positive effect of food seen; rather, the patient suffered adverse effects such as sour belching, anorexia, and indigestion. The cause of slow digestion cured with the help of Vaman Dhauti (Yogic therapeutic self-induced emesis) that helped in body detoxification. Drug therapy with do’s and don’ts were advised for 30 days, which subsided Pitta vitiation and increased appetite by increasing digestive fire. After that, the patient needs to take more quantity of food but should be balanced, so a diet plan, Yoga , and Pranayama were explained for the next 60 days. The result was a remarkable improvement in subjective symptoms as well as the weight of the patient increased from 50 kg to 58 kg and the BMI increased from 17.7 (underweight) to 20.5 (normal). With the help of traditional knowledge, we can achieve our targets to live happily and confidently. The combination of Yogic procedures (an easier method for the cleansing body) with Ayurveda principles results in remarkable improvement without adverse effects. This study has a unique intervention; lean patients also need to detoxify their body first for a better relief, then the medication will work out, which needs to be studied on a large scale.",

      "abstract": "We are what we eat Our physical and mental well-being are directly linked to what we eat and drink. The nutritional content of what we eat determines the composition of our cell membranes, bone marrow, blood, hormones, tissues, organs, skin, and hair. Lifestyle and nutrition of the humankind has undergone substantial changes during the last century. Additives and processed food have become the basis of our nutrition. Ingredients such as salt, sugar and fat are sometimes added to processed foods to make their flavour more appealing and to extend their shelf life. When the processed food industry discovered that these ingredients could be formulated to produce a state of satiety, pleasure, and sensory hedonia in those who consumed them, it extended their use to the “bliss point”, the point where the levels of saltiness, sweetness, and richness were perceived by the consumer as just right. Such modified foods can dysregulate the brain’s food reward system by increasing dopamine production, thus making the foods addictive. It is not easy to avoid these foods: the only way is to eat mainly fresh or only lightly processed foods (such as canned tomatoes and frozen vegetables). It is helpful to know which foods are healthy and what you can do to ensure you eat the healthiest diet you can. Combining a variety of foods, eating regular meals, including wholegrains, fibres, fruit, vegetables and “healthy fats”, and limiting the amount of sugar, salt and fat you eat are all recommended for good nutrition.",

However, some individuals think that eating an egg or a banana in the morning, while travelling, or right before an exam brings ill luck. However, most individuals are unaware of the reasons why a banana is bad for your health in the morning. Some individuals think that if they view it first thing in the morning, their entire day would be terrible or wasted. All this prejudice and preconception directly related to malnutrition. This review paper shows that food prejudice and preconceptions often lead to malnutrition and malnutrition associated disorders.

Ha sido coordinado por el Colegio Oficial de Farmaceuticos de Madrid (Vocalia de Alimentacion y Nutricion). Es bien sabido que nuestras emociones tienen un efecto poderoso sobre nuestra eleccion de alimentos y sobre los habitos alimentarios. Se ha encontrado evidencia empirica de que la influencia de las emociones sobre la conducta alimentaria es mas fuerte en las personas obesas que en las no obesas y en personas que hacen dieta en relacion a las personas que no hacen dieta. Tambien se ha sugerido que la emocion en si misma no puede ser responsable de excesiva ingesta sino mas bien, la verdadera causante del sobrepeso, es la forma en que la emocion es afrontada por la persona. Solamente conociendo los factores emocionales podremos reforzar los habitos saludables que nos permitan controlar el peso. Por todo ello en los comedores emocionales para controlar el sobrepeso y la obesidad se recomienda seguir una terapia cognitiva para controlar mejor las emociones, una dieta sana y practicar de ejercicio regularmente. El objetivo de este trabajo ha sido estudiar y comparar la influencia de las emociones en la ingesta de personas sedentarias y de personas fisicamente activas. Estudiar las estrategias de control de peso que suelen utilizar dichas personas. Estudio longitudinal, con adultos sedentarios que piden ayuda en oficina de farmacia (OF) para perder peso. Intervencion nutricional durante 6 meses. Para comparar se ha incluido grupo de cicloturistas de Campus de ciclismo Calpe2012. (www.echozas.com).

We considered a calorie restricted diet successful if the weight loss was ≥ 5% after at least 3 years follow up. From published data, calculating a definitive percentage of successful cases is difficult because of the way data are presented and because loss to follow-up is not corrected for in many studies. Judging by the best data available, the success rate is very low. Most individuals will regain weight and sometimes even more than they lost in the first place. The mechanisms driving this weight increase are a decrease in energy expenditure and an increased appetite which is mediated by factors such as leptin. If the first attempt to lose weight fails, the advice to go on a diet should not be endlessly repeated; stabilizing the individual's weight would probably be a more realistic goal.",

Unlike many infectious diseases, lifestyle disorders are mostly preventable through modifications in lifestyle behaviors. Amlapitta, is often considered a lifestyle disorder were lifestyle choices play a significant role in its development and exacerbation. Amlapitta is the commonest Vyadhi of Annavaha Strotas, caused by vitiated Agni where Amlaguna of Pachak Pitta increases due to Samata manifesting symptoms such as Avipaka (indigestion), Amlotkalesh or Tikta Amlodgara (sour or bitter belching), Hridkantha Daha heart throat burning sensation) and Aruchi (anorexia) affecting more people in India. Main causes for the disease are improper diet, habits, stress, not following Ahara Vidhi Visheshayatana, Viruddhahara, Asatmya Ahara, stale food, spicy irritant food, oily foods, bakery products, some fast foods, excess consumption of tea and coffee, excess food intake, drinking excess water after meals, freeze products, wine, cigarette smoking during meal etc., Amlapitta can be correlated with Acid Peptic Disorders which comprises of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, Gastritis, Functional Dyspepsia described in modern science. By promoting healthier lifestyles, individuals can reduce the incidence and severity of Amlapitta symptoms, improving their overall quality of life and well-being. Hence it is important to understand the causes and triggers of Amlapitta. This article’s focus will be on comprehending the factors responsible for development and exacerbation of Amlapitta in the contemporary period.",

      "title": "Zinkbedarf und Risiko und Nutzen einer Zinksupplementierung",
      "abstract": "Der Körper eines erwachsenen Menschen enthält 2 – 3 g Zink, von denen pro Tag etwa 0,1% ersetzt werden. Auf dieser Basis und gestützt auf Schätzungen bezüglich der Bioverfügbarkeit von Zink werden Ernährungsempfehlungen für augenscheinlich gesunde Personen gegeben. Das Fehlen chemischer, funktioneller und/oder körperlicher Anzeichen eines Zinkmangels gilt dabei als Hinweis auf eine adäquate Versorgung. Spezifischere Daten sind jedoch nur selten vorhanden. Veränderungen hinsichtlich der Auswahl und Verfügbarkeit von Nahrungsmitteln sowie neue Methoden der Zubereitung, Konservierung und Aufbereitung machen u. U. die Neubewertung älterer Daten erforderlich. Konservative Schätzungen legen nahe, dass bei ≥ 25% der Weltbevölkerung das Risiko für einen Zinkmangel besteht. Die meisten Betroffenen sind arm und konsumieren nur selten Nahrungsmittel, die reich an gut bioverfügbarem Zink sind, sondern eher solche, die einen hohen Gehalt an Inhibitoren der Zinkabsorption aufweisen und/oder kaum bioverfügbares Zink enthalten. Im Gegensatz dazu hat bei vergleichsweise Wohlhabenden die Auswahl der Nahrungsmittel entscheidenden Einfluss auf das Risiko für einen Zinkmangel. Ein weiteres Problem, ebenfalls speziell bei vergleichsweise Wohlhabenden, ist das Risiko einer chronischen Zinkintoxikation durch übermäßige Einnahme von Zinksupplementen. Insbesondere kann eine hohe Aufnahme von Zink verglichen mit Kupfer zu Kupfermangel führen. Eine bedeutende Herausforderung, die im Hinblick auf den maximalen Nutzen für die Gesundheit bisher noch nicht gemeistert worden ist, besteht darin, dass die empfohlene Tagesdosis (recommended dietary allowance, RDA) und die Referenzdosis (RfD) für eine sichere Aufnahme von Zink sehr nahe beieinander liegen. Aktuelle Empfehlungen berücksichtigen weder die zahlreichen Nahrungsmittelbestandteile, die die Bioverfügbarkeit von Zink und Kupfer beeinflussen, noch die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Vergiftung durch Zinksupplemente. Daher ist der Dosisbereich, der für die Aufnahme von Zink derzeit als sicher angenommen wird, vergleichsweise eng. Gegenwärtig ist die Beurteilung der Zinkversorgung aufwendig und umfasst eine Reihe chemischer und funktioneller Messungen, deren Sensitivität und Spezifität eingeschränkt sind. Hier sind Verbesserungen erforderlich, so dass Zinkmangel oder -überschuss frühzeitig erkannt werden können. Eine wachsende Anzahl von Beispielen für eine Assoziation zwischen Krankheiten und Zinkstatus sowie für anscheinend normale Gesundheitszustände, bei denen eine erhöhte Zinkzufuhr jedoch bestimmten Erkrankungen vorbeugen könnte, lassen die Pharmakologie der Zinkverbindungen als aussichtsreiches Gebiet für weitere Forschungsaktivitäten erscheinen. Dies gilt insbesondere für den Zusammenhang zwischen Zink und Diabetes mellitus. Unserer Ansicht nach wird in diesem viel versprechenden Bereich ein multidisziplinärer Ansatz am ehesten zu Erfolgen für die translationale Forschung führen.",

Different fruits have different scores (Orange: 1, banana: 2, apple: 3). When they eat a hamburger, the character loses one heart (three in all). When the number of heart is zero, the game is over. All in all, try not to meet the hamburger at the same time eat more fruit to get higher scores!

The condition denotes widely different things to different people, but by definition, complaints of dyspepsia must bear some relation to food or drink. (The term \"dyspepsia\" derives from dys, meaning \"bad,\" and pepsis, meaning \"digestion.\") A physician writing in the Lancet more than a hundred years ago referred to dyspepsia as \"the remorse of a guilty stomach.\" Unfortunately, the problem often turns out to be more serious than the transient pangs emanating from overindulgence. \"Dyspepsy,\" De Quincey wrote in 1823, \"is the ruin of most things: empires, expeditions, and everything else.\" That may be an overstatement. Still, dyspepsia can certainly be the harbinger of disastrous illness, as the following case illustrates.",

Consider the children in the study reported by Klesges et al1 elsewhere in this journal (pages 126-130). At about 4½ years of age, these children were estimated (by diet history) to have been ingesting about 2000 kcal per day.

      "title": "Nutrition on match day",
      "abstract": "Abstract What players should eat on match day is a frequently asked question in sports nutrition. The recommendation from the available evidence is that players should eat a high-carbohydrate meal about 3 h before the match. This may be breakfast when the matches are played around midday, lunch for late afternoon matches, and an early dinner when matches are played late in the evening. The combination of a high-carbohydrate pre-match meal and a sports drink, ingested during the match, results in a greater exercise capacity than a high-carbohydrate meal alone. There is evidence to suggest that there are benefits to a pre-match meal that is composed of low-glycaemic index (GI) carbohydrate foods rather than high-GI foods. A low-GI pre-match meal results in feelings of satiety for longer and produces a more stable blood glucose concentration than after a high-GI meal. There are also some reports of improved endurance capacity after low-GI carbohydrate pre-exercise meals. The physical demands of soccer training and match-play draw heavily on players' carbohydrate stores and so the benefits of good nutritional practices for performance and health should be an essential part of the education of players, coaches, and in particular the parents of young players.",

      "abstract": "The main determinants of an athlete's protein needs are their training regime and habitual nutrient intake. Most athletes ingest sufficient protein in their habitual diet. Additional protein will confer only a minimal, albeit arguably important, additional advantage. Given sufficient energy intake, lean body mass can be maintained within a wide range of protein intakes. Since there is limited evidence for harmful effects of a high protein intake and there is a metabolic rationale for the efficacy of an increase in protein, if muscle hypertrophy is the goal, a higher protein intake within the context of an athlete's overall dietary requirements may be beneficial. However, there are few convincing outcome data to indicate that the ingestion of a high amount of protein (2-3 g x kg(-1) BW x day(-1), where BW = body weight) is necessary. Current literature suggests that it may be too simplistic to rely on recommendations of a particular amount of protein per day. Acute studies suggest that for any given amount of protein, the metabolic response is dependent on other factors, including the timing of ingestion in relation to exercise and/or other nutrients, the composition of ingested amino acids and the type of protein.",

      "title": "Gangs, Drug Use, and Drug Selling in the United States",
      "abstract": "Gangs and drugs are two major criminological issues that come together in the United States. On the one hand, gang members use more drugs than non-gang youth, so much so that gang membership itself is an indicator that an individual will have a significant drug use profile. Compared with non-gang youth, gang members also begin to use drugs at earlier ages, use a greater variety of drugs, use them with greater frequency, and participate in other risk behaviors (e.g., violence, unsafe sexual behaviors) while intoxicated. Alcohol and marijuana feature prominently within the drug use repertoires of gang members, and the latter is considered normalized within gang cultures. Gang members also use other “hard” drugs, such as crystal methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and heroin, despite the fact that the use of such drugs is stigmatized among them. Gang membership is also characterized by polysubstance use—the simultaneous or sequential use of a variety of drugs, as well as nonmedical prescription drug misuse. As a result, gang members are at great risk of many negative social and health consequences related to drug use. On the other hand, gang members sell drugs. A wealth of academic data contradicts the legal and public perceptions about this relationship. First, a commonly held view is that gangs control a majority of the sales of illegal drugs within any one area. However, this clashes with research specifically on gangs, which reveals that few members within any one gang sell drugs and that few gangs are specifically focused on selling drugs. Another area where academic research conflicts with widely held perceptions is the idea that drug selling is a lucrative endeavor for gang members. While the public and law enforcement agencies may believe gang members are making significant amounts of money selling drugs, research indicates that the majority of gang members who do sell drugs do not appear to earn significantly more money than they could earn working the same number of hours at a job paying minimum wage. Such findings further argue that such amounts hardly seem worth the risk given the large numbers of gang members killed or imprisoned in relation to selling drugs.",

      "abstract": "Object : This paper is designed to inquire into the influence of eating habits on the emotion of modem people. Method : The methodology is used that searches for materials such as books and treatises on the relationship between eating habits and emotion. Result : Meat used for fast food comes from cows that are fed the feed containing growth hormone and antibiotic. Growth hormone extremely supplements fire or yang within the body while antibiotics undermines the process of yin, leading to an accumulation of damp-heat and inflammation of ministerial fire. Additives contained in instant foods also impinge on the process of yin, leading to poor digestion, damp-heat toxins and ministerial fire. Excessive consumption of meat results in incomplete combustion of fat and hinders the formation of essence. Subsequently, ministerial fire becomes hyperactive as a result of the lack of yin energy. Increased meat consumption in the human diet is coupled with unhealthy eating pattern in which people eat too much for dinner and too quickly. Eating too much disturbs digestion, making it slow and incomplete, leading to excess damp-heat conditions, insufficient amount of vital essence and eventually hyperactive ministerial fire. Milk is considered a catalyst of faster growth, making it suitable for calves. Milk intake rapidly increases the balance of yang and eventually cause hyperactivity of ministerial fire. Conclusion : It is estimated that the eating habits of modern people cause the process of yang, making them feel restless, impatient and aggressive.",

      "abstract": "Extract it's often unclear what we ought to do. Much of the time this is because it's unclear what matters. Suppose, for instance, that we're poultry farmers wondering whether we ought to put our chickens in cages or let them roam free. We know that we'll make more money if we put them in cages but also that they'll suffer more if we do. Still, if we want to know what we ought to do, we need to know whether their suffering matters, and, if so, how much it matters as compared to our profits. Sometimes, though, we know exactly what matters and by how much, and it's still unclear what we ought to do. To illustrate, suppose that what matters is my health and that what would be best for my health is my quitting smoking and eating less (Jackson & Pargetter 1986). Assume, though, that if I were to quit smoking, I would eat more, not less. It's not that I couldn't quit smoking and eat less; it's just that I wouldn't. And assume that my weight is such a concern that I would be better off maintaining the status quo than quitting smoking and eating more. So, should I quit smoking? On the one hand, I must quit smoking to do what's best, which is to quit smoking and eat less. On the other hand, my quitting smoking would result in my eating more, which is worse than the status quo. So, figuring out what I ought to do can require knowing more than just what matters. I must also know how what matters determines what I ought to do. Should I, for instance, do what's entailed by my doing what's best in terms of what matters even if this would, as it happens, result in something worse than the status quo?",

      "abstract": "Einhergehend mit einem steigenden Konsum wurden in den letzten Jahren in Deutschland zunehmend teils schwere allergische Reaktionen auf Sojaprodukte, insbesondere auf Sojagetränke, beobachtet. Birkenpollenallergiker haben ein besonderes Risiko, eine solche Reaktion zu erleiden, denn das Hauptallergen der Birke Bet v 1 zeigt eine hohe Homologie mit dem Soja-Allergen Gly m 4. Hierdurch kann es bei entsprechend Sensibilisierten zu einer immunologischen Kreuzreaktion im Sinne einer Pollen assoziierten Nahrungsmittelallergie kommen. Genaue Daten zur Prävalenz dieses Krankheitsbildes sind nicht bekannt. In Deutschland könnten allerdings bei geschätzten 5 – 10 % (4 – 8 Mio.) Birkenpollenallergikern bis zu 2,9 Mio. Menschen von einer Kreuzsensibilisierung auf Soja betroffen sein. Eine sichere Allergenmeidung ist schwierig, da Soja vielfach versteckt in Nahrungsmitteln enthalten sein kann. Besondere Hinweise für Birkenpollenallergiker, die insbesondere vor dem Verzehr proteinreicher, nicht-fermentierter Sojaprodukte (z. B. Drinks) gewarnt werden sollten, scheinen gerechtfertigt. Inwieweit auch durch eine spezifische Immuntherapie gegen Bet v 1 die Birken assoziierte Sojaallergie beeinflusst werden kann, ist nicht bekannt.",

      "title": "Eat More Fruit",
      "abstract": "Experience of the human diet in all countries and ages shows that our food consumption is primarily controlled by circumstances. The popular lendency is to consider food merely as a means of supplying the necessary bulk for the body to function normally. Earlier work in nutritional and medical research indicated that the food we consume must supply suffici- ent energy. The unit of food energy is termed as the calorie. Till recently very great emphasis was laid on the supply of the requisite amount of calo- ries for people of different ages and in different avocations of life. Thus, it was believed that a fairly active man of medium height and weight could maintain his weight by eating food containing 2,500 to 2,600 calories. The rations for the fighting forces were for a long time fixed on the basis of calorie standard, the daily requirements of the army being generally deemed to be over 4,000 calories per man. This notion was subsequently replaced by later discoveries in nutritional science which proved that besides energy, the human body requires protective foods largely made up of dairy pro- ducts, vegetables and fruits. All these foods provide certain essential health-promoting substances called vitamins, the absence or inadequacy of which results in mal-nutrition, a host of diseases, poor growth and low efficiency of the body.",

This is the scenario, despite the fact, people having more money, more knowledge, more possessions and more power and recognition in the society. We need to, therefore, think how to make this life more blissful not only for ourselves but also for the people attached to us. Yoga and healthy lifestyle are the only solution to this problem. They are not an ‘either-or’ solution but a package. On the one hand, yoga enlightens one and makes her aware of the inner self, thereby bestowing emotional health to an individual. On the other hand, healthy lifestyle enables one to lead a disease-free and longer life by adopting modifications in the eating habits and increasing physical activity. Acceptance of such changes in the lifestyle pattern can be possible only when there is control over the self. Yoga helps in having this self-control. The factual data reveals that world over there is a growing consciousness among people towards adopting yoga and healthy lifestyle habits viz. replacing processed food for fresh and natural food, spending time in gym or indulging in brisk walking. Moreover such people are also willing to pay premium for these products. Survey results also reveals that it is not only the adults and the oldies that are increasingly practicing yoga and adopting healthy lifestyle, the trend is gaining more popularity among young millennial.",

For long walks or if walking at a time when they would normally be sedentary, or just before a meal they may need to eat a snack. Expeditions on foot, especially when carrying a rucksack, require huge amounts of carbohydrate to fuel them, especially if the person is taking insulin. The insulin dose covering the period of the expedition and twelve hours afterwards should be reduced by 20 to 50 per cent. The person will need three large meals each day, and it is sensible to eat hourly in between.",

      "abstract": "Meal planning is cited in the latest version of Canada’s Dietary Guidelines as one of four important food skills that help individuals choose, purchase and prepare healthy snacks and foods on a regular basis for themselves and members of their household. While meal planning is often mentioned as a strategy to overcome the main barrier to healthy eating, lack of time, it may also assist individuals reduce stress related to mealtimes and increase frequency of family meals. Although, there is relatively sparse literature that meal planning confers benefits to the diet, there is a history of evidence indicating that it helps manage dietary restrictions related to specific diseases (e.g., diabetes), which can translate into helping the general public consume more fruits and vegetables, while consuming fewer processed foods. In 2013 Health Canada implemented a one-year communication campaign to promote meal planning to Canadian parents as a strategy to increase home-based food preparation and family meals. The campaign evaluation found that awareness was associated with greater odds of having more positive attitudes towards meal planning. However, more than half of parents also reported that lack of time was a major barrier for meal planning. Dietitians can recommend meal planning as a viable strategy to help the public and patients overcome barriers to healthy eating. However, they will likely also need to provide guidance through education and tools to overcome barriers related to meal planning.",

The more money families have, the better the goods they can buy.\nPsychosocial: Managing on a low income is stressful. Comparing oneself to others and feeling at the bottom of the social ladder can be distressing, which can lead to biochemical changes in the body, eventually causing ill health.\nBehavioural: For various reasons, people on low incomes are more likely to adopt unhealthy behaviours – smoking and drinking, for example – while those on higher incomes are more able to afford healthier lifestyles.\nReverse causation (poor health leads to low income): Health may affect income by preventing people from taking paid employment. Childhood health may also affect educational outcomes, limiting job opportunities and potential earnings.",

However, it actually increases energy expenditure and has other actions not in line with protection from hypoglycemia. Furthermore, it is often found to be elevated when glucose is also raised, for example in circumstances of psychological and metabolic stress. These findings seem more in keeping with glucagon having some role as a hormone enhancing the response to stress.",

DR can be achieved by controlling how much and/or when food is provided, as well as by adjusting nutritional composition.

Several drugs have been utilized that target nutrient-sensing gene pathways, many of which change expression throughout the day, suggesting that the timing of drug administration is critical.

These components have the additional benefit of delaying glucose absorption and limiting the postprandial peak of hyperglycemia and the subsequent hyperinsulinism, which would induce hunger and further food consumption. A decrease in physical activity means a decrease in energy requirements and usually a decrease in appetite, resulting in a reduction in food intake. The best way to decrease sodium intake is to rely on foods with naturally low salt contents and obviously to avoid foods such as cured meat, salted fish, and more generally all types of preserved foods. Depending on age and sex, protein intake should be between 45 and 80 g/day and fat should not represent more than 25% of the available energy consisting of one third monounsaturated and one third polyunsaturated fatty acids.",

(2011) podemos distinguir dos tipos de dieta.La \"dieta terapéutica/medicinal\" se hace para curar los problemas físicos, energéticos y emocionales.Según Hagens y Lansky (2012) permite recibir enseñanzas de las plantas que se toman durante este proceso.Otro tipo de dieta es la \"dieta chamánica, un proceso largo que forma parte de la preparación para ser curandero (Jauregui et al., 2011).El principiante aprende las artes de la curación tomando plantas maestras, de manera que sepa sus formas de administración y cómo manejar sus efectos.Son las más complejas (López-Pavillard, 2018).En la Amazonía hay muchos lugares donde se realizan dietas (Jauregui et al., 2011;Sanz-Biset & Cañigueral, 2011).Sin embargo, también se realizan en Europa (Tresca, 2018).La investigación presentada en este capítulo fue realizada en el Centro Takiwasi, ubicado en la ciudad de Tarapoto, Departamento de San Martín, Perú.Takiwasi es una organización civil sin fines de lucro fundada en 1992 (Giove, 2002).Su objetivo principal es el tratamiento de los trastornos por consumo de sustancias (TCS), en el cual se combina la MTA con psicoterapia en el contexto de una comunidad terapéutica (Mabit, 2007).Las dietas representan una parte esencial de este modelo terapéutico (Horák, 2020).Takiwasi ofrece dietas también para personas sin TCS [i.e.pacientes ambulatorios] en un retiro de ocho días.Desde 1996 más de 1900 personas de diferentes países del mundo (por ej.Francia, Perú, Argentina, Chile) han participado en ellas.El proceso de la dieta empieza con la toma de una planta purgativa.El propósito de la purga es la desintoxicación (Kavenská, 2013).Al día siguiente se organiza una ceremonia de ayahuasca (Politi et al., 2018).La ayahuasca es el elemento central de la MTA (Mabit et al., 1992).Está compuesta por, al menos, dos plantas, la liana ayahuasca (Banisteriopsis caapi) y la chacruna (Psychotria viridis) (Giove, 2002).Su efecto es doble.Sin que acontezca de una forma secuencial cronológicamente, encontramos el efecto emético y el estado expandido de conciencia (Metzner, 2014).",

Al-A'raf verse 31 and al-bithnah, eat and drink more than what is needed. The conducting of this study is using thematic interpretation of verses about diet in Islam, the result of this study explains the concept of diet: not eating and drinking excessively, eating halal and good food, balancing types of food, avoiding haram food, eating and drinking choices.

Not every drug user develops an addiction: addicts’ lives revolve around compulsive drug-seeking and use; they lose control over their own decision-making and end up relapsing. This occurs because addiction is a brain disease that can modify its structure and functioning, affecting the areas of the brain responsible for controlling our behaviour. Addiction is a public health problem affecting a high percentage of the population and leads to health, family, and work-related problems.",

      "title": "Tips for Parents of Adolescents: Common Concerns",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is the time between childhood and adulthood that children go through many physical and emotional changes. Here is information from the American Academy of Pediatrics about common concerns during adolescence. Teen is used in this publication to refer to adolescents, teenagers, preteens, and tweens. Many teens try extreme diets or exercise programs because they want their bodies to look like those of the models, singers, actors, or athletes they see in the media, or they have a misguided understanding of what is “healthy.” Be aware of any diet or exercise program your teen is following. Many diets are unhealthy for teens because they do not have the nutritional value that bodies need during puberty. If you have questions about your teen’s nutritional needs, ask their doctor. If you are concerned about rapid weight loss or suspect your teen has an eating disorder, contact your teen’s doctor right away. Eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa can be very dangerous, and treating them promptly is critical for recovery. If your teen wants to train with weights, they should check with their doctor, as well as a trainer, coach, or physical education teacher. Also, help create a positive self-image by praising teens for their strengths and not focusing on their appearance. Set a good example by making eating right and exercising a part of your daily routine. Avoid negative self-talk or dieting. At home, stock up on healthy snacks like fruit, raw vegetables, whole-grain crackers, and yogurt, and limit unhealthy snacks like candy, cookies, chips, and soda pop. Teens are naturally curious about sex. This is completely normal and healthy. However, teens may be pressured into having sex too soon by their peers or the media. Talk with your teen to understand their feelings and views about sex. Start early, and provide them with access to accurate and appropriate information. Making healthy decisions about sex is important. Before your teen becomes sexually active, make sure you discuss Teens may try or use tobacco like vaping devices, e-cigarettes, or chewing tobacco, and alcohol, or other drugs, out of curiosity or to deal with peer pressure. Help build self-confidence or self-esteem in your teen. Ask your teen about any concerns and problems they are facing, and help them learn how to deal with strong emotions and cope with stress in healthy ways. If you suspect your teen is using drugs, talk with your teen’s doctor. Note: If you or someone else in the household smokes, now is a good time to quit. Watching a parent struggle through quitting can be a powerful message for a teen who is thinking about starting. It also shows you care about your health as well as your teen’s. Alcohol is not only the most socially accepted drug in our society but also one of the most abused and destructive. Even small amounts of alcohol can impair judgment, provoke risky and violent behavior, and slow down reaction time. An intoxicated teen (or anyone else) behind the wheel of a car makes it a lethal weapon. Alcohol-related car crashes are the leading cause of death for teens and young adults aged 15 to 24 years. Although it’s illegal for people younger than 21 years to drink, we all know most teens are not strangers to alcohol. Many of them witness alcohol use throughout their childhood, and many begin alcohol use as teens. If you choose to use alcohol in your home, be aware of the example you are setting. Well-child visits (annual health supervision visits) are especially important during adolescence. Your teen’s doctor will make sure your teen is on a healthy track and suggest necessary changes to get on track and how to stay on track. American Academy of Pediatrics www.aap.org and www.HealthyChildren.orgThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is an organization of 67,000 primary care pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, and pediatric surgical specialists dedicated to the health, safety, and well-being of all infants, children, adolescents, and young adults.

Less well known is the tendency to attempt to get things done as soon as possible, even if that involves extra effort (precrastination). Since its discovery in 2014, precrastination has been demonstrated in humans and animals and has recently been revealed in an analogous tendency called the mere-urgency effect. Trying to get things done as soon as one can may reflect optimal foraging, but another less obvious factor may also contribute—reducing cognitive demands associated with having to remember what to do when. Individual differences may also play a role. Understanding precrastination will have important implications for explaining why hurrying happens as often as it does and may help reduce the chance that haste makes waste.",

      "abstract": "El ser humano tiene mayor riesgo de volverse obeso cuando la poblacion dispone de gran variedad de alimentos, incluyendo los de proceso industrial, y la vida se hace mas facil, mecanizada y ociosa. Estos cambios en los estilos de vida propician el sedentarismo y, a su vez, el desequilibrio entre la energia que se ingiere y el gasto calorico necesario para satisfacer las necesidades metabolicas, termogenicas y de actividad fisica. Un desequilibrio calorico excesivo y sostenido ocasiona incremento exagerado de peso y deposito de grasa y como consecuencia la obesidad, que es uno de los factores mas importantes de riesgo para la salud, tanto en la poblacion de paises industrializados como en el mundo en desarrollo. Palabras clave : Obesidad, desequilibrio, salud, sedentarismo, psicologicos. SUMMARY The human being has bigger risk of becoming obese when the population has greatvariety of foods, including those of industrial process, and the life becomes more easy, automated and idler. These changes in the lifestyles propitiate the physical inactivity and, in turn, the imbalance among the energy that is ingested and the necessary caloric expense to satisfy the meta bo|ic necessities, corporal heat and of physical activity. An excessive and sustained caloric imbalance causes exaggerated increment of weight and deposit of fat and I eat consequence so much the obesity that is one of the most important factors in risk for the health, in the population of countries industrialized as in the world in development.

      "abstract": "Actualmente, los competidores jóvenes emprenden programas de entrenamiento que se basan en un nivel elevado de actividad física desde una temprana edad. Este entrenamiento intensivo (volumen e intensidad) aumenta el gasto de energía, que tiene que ser compensado por una mayor ingesta nutricional. Los bailarines de ballet, los patinadores artísticos, los gimnastas o los gimnastas rítmicos comienzan a entrenar a los 5 o 6 años de edad, y la mayoría practica durante más de 20 a 30 horas por semana. En estas actividades, así como en los deportes clasificados por peso (luchadores, jinetes y atletas practicantes de judo o boxeo), los jóvenes atletas de elite adoptan decisiones conscientes para reducir su ingesta alimentaria con objeto de mantener la esbeltez, el físico prepuberal o para ‘dar el peso’. El consumo adecuado de energía y micronutrientes es esencial para los niños en fase de crecimiento, y las restricciones calóricas y de líquidos durante el entrenamiento físico en la infancia o durante la adolescencia podrían perturbar las regulaciones metabólicas y hormonales que influyen sobre el crecimiento, la maduración, la composición corporal, el ciclo menstrual y la capacidad reproductora, lo que puede incrementar el riesgo de traumatismos como fracturas por sobrecarga. Además, estas estrategias pueden generar trastornos del comer (anorexia y/o bulimia nerviosa), especialmente durante la adolescencia femenina, afectando a la imagen corporal, a la imagen de uno mismo y ocasionando inadaptaciones sociales y emocionales.",

The importance of carefully selecting the articles of food for certain cases is very generally urged, but not as commonly practiced. Although it would seem to be a subject of equal importance, but little stress is ever laid on the necessity of regulating the amount of food to fit the exact known demands of a particular individual. That the demands and hence the supply of food should vary with the weight, shape of the body, age and condition of activity has been too well proved to permit of question. We can only account for the prevalent neglect of this factor in dietetic ordering by supposing that the matter has never been presented in practicable form.

Developing a problem with eating as a child may lead to a lifetime of worry and depression. Going on a diet ultimately means having to deny yourself foods that you want to eat. This can make those foods seem even more tempting and, in the end, when people break their diet, they eat even more than they would have done before. So limit your child's food in subtle ways by being a good role model, changing what food you buy, and cooking and planning meals so that they can learn to live with their hunger. Being a good role model involves saying the right things to give your child some healthy scripts in their head for the future.",

Les recommandations internationales préconisent d’instaurer la nutrition le plus précocement possible après l’admission et, en l’absence de contre-indication digestive formelle, de privilégier la voie entérale. Cependant, de nombreux facteurs concourent à entraver sa bonne administration. Parmi ceux-ci, l’intolérance digestive à la nutrition et la prévention de ses conséquences potentielles apparaissent régulièrement comme des obstacles fréquents. Cependant, la définition même et l’approche de l’intolérance digestive à la nutrition entérale doivent être reconsidérées. Les régurgitations et les vomissements ne semblent pas constituer un facteur source de complications significatives, notamment de pneumopathie acquise sous ventilation mécanique. Leur prévention et leur gestion ne doivent pas entraver à l’excès l’atteinte des objectifs nutritionnels. La surveillance du volume gastrique résiduel ne doit plus être réalisée en routine. En cas d’intolérance, l’administration d’un prokinétique gastrique doit précéder la diminution de la nutrition entérale qui ne doit être interrompue qu’en dernier recours, sauf signes de gravité ou orientant vers une cause organique qui nécessitera un traitement approprié et éventuellement de préférer la voie parentérale. L’utilisation d’un protocole prédéterminé, synthétisant les connaissances dans le domaine, adapté aux caractéristiques des patients accueillis dans l’unité et connu de tous les membres de l’équipe est un facteur favorisant l’atteinte des objectifs nutritionnels. Des travaux de recherche clinique en cours ou à venir devraient permettre de mieux étayer les futures recommandations dans le domaine de la nutrition artificielle du patient ventilé.",

In the latter case, overuse destroys the user, but in the case of alcohol it destroys those around him as well. Over indulgence in alcohol is a euphemism—alcohol poisoning is more descriptive. Before one considers alcoholism one must first consider alcohol, because in all probability it has the broadest ramifications of any drug. For example, one aspect is political. The huge excise taxes collected by the government are a consideration of profound influence should a question of control come up—assuming that control is desired. Another ramification is societal—alcohol is a sort of \"pot\" or marijuana of which society heartily approves. This virtually encourages alcoholism.

      "abstract": "Food is wasted at various points in the US food system, but the greatest amount of food waste occurs at the consumer level. Emerging research now shows a connection between consumer food waste, healthy diets, and environmental impacts, with implications for food security and hunger. In the United States, the average consumer wastes nearly 1 lb of food every day—approximately one-quarter of edible food purchased. Those who consume healthier diets waste more food than people who consume diets that are less healthy. This food waste accounts for vast amounts of wasted cropland, irrigation water, fertilizers, pesticides, and energy, as well as greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts. These inefficiencies can reduce agricultural productivity and undermine efforts to feed an expanding global population and reduce food insecurity in the United States and globally. Nutrition professionals can help move consumers toward healthier diets and reduce food waste simultaneously.",

      "abstract": "Blood pressure is determined both by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure. You can have high blood pressure (hypertension) for years without any symptoms. Even without symptoms, damage to blood vessels and your heart continues and can be detected. Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases your risk of serious health problems, including heart attack and stroke. High blood pressure generally develops over many years, and it affects nearly everyone eventually. Fortunately, high blood pressure can be easily detected. And once you know you have high blood pressure, you can work with your doctor to control it. One tablespoon of flaxseed (ground) has about 40 calories, 3 grams of fat (more than half of which is ALA), almost 2 grams of protein, and more than 2 grams of fiber. It's better to consume the seeds ground, since the whole seeds pass through the body mostly undigested. You can buy flaxseeds already milled or, better yet, buy them whole and grind them yourself (a coffee bean grinder works well) just before using, as this will slow rancidity (the oils in flaxseed are highly unsaturated, so they are more susceptible to oxidation). Store the seeds, ground or whole, in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer to keep them fresh longer. Flaxseed has a nutty flavor, though some people describe it as unpleasantly fishy. It can be added to yogurt, cereals, and smoothies, sprinkled over salads and cooked vegetables, and used in baking. Milled flax can replace the oil or shortening in recipes (substitute it in a 3: 1 ratio, the Flaxseed Council of Canada recommends).",

      "title": "Vegetarianism",
      "abstract": "Human populations often have been obliged to subsist on an all-vegetable diet because of a poverty or scarcity of animal foods. The term “vegetarianism,” nevertheless, is usually reserved for the practice of voluntary abstention from flesh on the basis of religious, spiritual, ethical, hygienic, or environmental considerations. These in turn have led to still finer distinctions regarding exactly what nonmeat articles of diet are permissible, resulting in the fragmentation of vegetarians into several groups. The great majority of adherents are “lacto-ovo” vegetarians, who reject flesh but find dairy products and eggs acceptable. Smaller groups include “vegans,” who admit no animal products whatsoever into their diet; “lacto-vegetarians,” who consume milk but not eggs; “ovo-vegetarians,” who allow eggs but not milk; “fruitarians,” who eat only fruits and nuts; “raw foodists”; and “natural hygienists,” who scorn even vegetable foods if these have been processed or refined. And because – for all those classes – vegetarianism implies a concern to persuade others to adopt meatless diets, the history of vegetarianism is, at core, the history of the development of arguments used to justify and to proselytize for a vegetable diet.",

      "abstract": "Back to table of contents Previous article Next article Clinical & Research NewsFull AccessAntidepressants, CBT Help Night Eating SyndromeLynne LambergLynne LambergPublished Online:6 Jan 2006https://doi.org/10.1176/pn.41.1.0030Chips, dips, cookies, chocolates, eggnog: These are among the temptations posed by the highly palatable, high-calorie snacks commonly served at winter evening social events that intensify the struggle people with night eating syndrome (NES) face year round.People with NES overeat in the evening and even awaken from sleep to eat one to two times a night on average, according to Kelly Allison, Ph.D. They consume one-quarter or more of their daily food intake after their evening meal, said Allison, a research assistant professor of psychology in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and director of a NES-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) study.People with NES typically lack appetite in the morning. Some curb their daytime food intake, knowing they will graze after dark.NES was first described in 1955 by Albert Stunkard, M.D., a professor of psychiatry, director emeritus of the University of Pennsylvania's weight and eating disorders program, and still an active investigator in the field.While holiday-related stress boosts NES in some people, whether reduced winter daylight exposure also contributes to the disorder is still being explored. Allison, Stunkard, and colleagues are tracking people with NES and control subjects in Philadelphia and Stockholm, Sweden, in winter and summer to see if eating behavior varies by season.Eating Disorder UnderrecognizedOccurring in about 1.5 percent of the general population, NES is more common than anorexia nervosa, which affects less than 1 percent of the population, mainly young women, Stunkard said. People with NES rarely binge and purge.About 7.6 percent of obesity clinic patients report symptoms of NES, as do 12 percent of those visiting outpatient psychiatric clinics for any disorder. Among people awaiting bariatric surgery, 10 percent to 27 percent have NES, two studies have suggested. DSM-IV-TR classifies NES as an eating disorder not otherwise specified.Not all people with NES are obese. Some maintain normal weight via daytime food restriction or intensive exercise. These individuals typically are younger by about a decade than obese people with NES, suggesting NES may serve as a pathway to obesity, Stunkard noted.Many people with NES keep a small refrigerator next to the bed, favoring peanut butter, popsicles, candy bars, nuts, and sometimes fruit as handy middle-of-the-night snacks. They rely on food as an aid to returning to sleep, probably a conditioned response, Allison reported.People with NES remember what they eat in the night, unlike people with sleep-related eating disorder (SRED), a rare parasomnia. Those with SRED often have only partial recall of having consumed frequently unpalatable items, such as buttered cigarettes, raw bacon, or cat food.Allison, Stunkard, and colleagues assessed 25-hour profiles of circulating glucose and seven hormones in relation to food intake, sleep, and stress in 15 women with NES and 14 matched controls, reporting results in the November 2005 Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.Participants spent three nights in a general clinical research center at Penn. They received three meals a day and had ad libitum access to snacks, including foods brought from home, placed on a bedside table at night.Both groups had a similar total daily caloric intake, averaging about 2,900 kcal. NES subjects ate far more at night, consuming four times more fat and twice the amount of carbohydrates and protein between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. than control subjects. All NES subjects awakened to eat at least two of their three nights in the hospital, compared with only one control subject.\"We found no evidence of an endocrine etiology for night eating in this very careful study,\" Stunkard said. This work, he added, corrects findings from an earlier, smaller study suggesting NES might involve a disturbance of appetite-regulating hormones.\"We think NES represents a dysregulation of circadian patterns of food intake, but without disruption of the circadian sleep pattern,\" he explained. \"NES is primarily an eating disorder, and only secondarily a sleep disorder.\" While appetite normally shuts down in sleep, NES appears to be a rare clinical example of an uncoupling of eating and the sleep/wake cycle. Its cause has not been determined.Effective Treatment AvailableJohn O'Reardon, M.D., an assistant professor of psychiatry at Penn, working with Allison, Stunkard, and others, randomly assigned 17 outpatients with NES to receive sertraline and another 17 to receive placebo in an eight-week, double-blind, flexible-dose (50 mg to 200 mg a day) study. They found 12 subjects in the sertraline group, but only three in the placebo group, much improved or very much improved, according to the Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale. Overweight and obese subjects in the sertraline group lost more weight by week 8 than those on placebo. The researchers' report is in press with the American Journal of Psychiatry.In a novel long distance study, perhaps the first of its kind, according to Stunkard, the Penn team recruited 50 patients who described symptoms consistent with NES on a website questionnaire, and whose physicians agreed to provide treatment with sertraline for eight weeks at dosages suggested by the Penn investigators. Patients completed survey forms every two weeks. Success rates were comparable to those in the single-and double-blind trials. A report is in preparation.Allsion, meanwhile, enrolled 16 adults with NES in a 10-session, 12-week trial of NES-focused CBT, the first study of CBT for the disorder.Since many people with NES eat chaotically in the daytime, Allison encouraged them to keep food diaries, eat more systematically, and choose snacks smaller and lower in calories. She also advised them to get food out of the bedroom. \"Once they do that,\" she said, \"they have less reason to wake up, so they awaken less often.\"Nine subjects completed the study, cutting their middle-of-the-night snacking from six to 0.3 times per week. Completers also lost a significant amount of weight by the study's end, she reported at Obesity Society meetings in Vancouver, British Columbia, in October 2005.\"While people with NES who stay on sertraline continue to do well,\" Allison notes, \"learning CBT strategies may give them a better long term prognosis.\"Resources for patients about night eating syndrome include Overcoming Night Eating Syndrome: A Step-By-Step Guide to Breaking the Cycle by Kelly Allison, Ph.D., Albert Strunkard, M.D., and Sara Their (New Harbinger Publications, 2004) and the University of Pennsylvania Web site at<www.med.upenn.edu/weight/nighteating.shtml>.▪ ISSUES NewArchived",

      "abstract": "In contrast to prevailing beliefs, recent research suggests that trait self-control promotes health behavior not because those high in self-control are more successful at resisting single temptations, but rather because they develop adaptive habits. The present paper presents a first empirical test of this novel suggestion by investigating the mediating role of habit in explaining the relation between self-control and unhealthy snacking behavior. Results showed that self-control was negatively associated with unhealthy snack consumption and unhealthy snacking habits. As hypothesized, the relation between self-control and unhealthy snack intake was mediated by habit strength. Self-control was not associated with fruit consumption or fruit consumption habits. These results provide the first evidence for the notion that high self-control may influence the formation of habits and in turn affect behavior. Moreover, results imply that self-control may be particularly influential in case of inhibiting unhealthy food intake rather than promoting healthy food intake.",

Peripheral biomarkers associated with meal termination include physicochemical measures related to stomach distension and responses of several hormones, including cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide 1. It has been proposed that slower rates of ingestion allow more time for these processes to take place, lengthen satiety’s time course, and reduce total energy intake.

Ademais, esse público pode ter uma maior tendência ao sedentarismo. Neste sentido, este estudo teve como objetivo refletir sobre o autismo e suas particularidades no estilo de vida, englobando hábitos alimentares, composição corporal e atividade física. Trata-se de um estudo do tipo ensaio reflexivo. Por se tratar de um artigo reflexivo e não de uma revisão de literatura, não foram definidos critérios específicos de exclusão e inclusão para a seleção do material bibliográfico. Observou-se que a capacidade sensorial dessas crianças é afetada, tornando difícil a aceitação de novas texturas, sabores e até mesmo cores nos alimentos. Devido a essa seletividade, crianças autistas podem ter deficiência de nutrientes necessários para sua faixa etária. Assim, o sedentarismo, a tendência a ser seletivo e a preferência por alimentos que contêm carboidratos simples, quando combinados com o uso de medicamentos, podem aumentar o risco de sobrepeso e obesidade. Os resultados destacam a importância de uma abordagem holística na gestão da saúde de pessoas com autismo. A promoção de intervenções individualizadas e inclusivas que considerem as necessidades específicas desse público é fundamental.",

A intolerância alimentar ocorre por diversos meios, dentre eles as principais são por meio de deficiências enzimáticas e intolerância às aminas, e ambas podem interferir em algum momento na absorção do triptofano (precursor da serotonina) pelo intestino. Mais estudos devem ser realizados para a comprovação da conjugação dos açúcares em pacientes intolerantes com exames dos níveis séricos de triptofano após a ingesta de certos alimentos. Se comprovada a existência da conjugação, podem ser possíveis a instauração de métodos para evitar a depressão neste público, como a administração de medicamentos inibidores de monoaminoxidases (MAO).",

      "abstract": "There are numerous methods for reducing obesity; however, often none of these methods prove effective for specific individuals. For individuals who have failed on specific diets and other weight loss programs, finding a good match between their needs and an effective method is often difficult. The authors collaboratively developed a multicomponent mindfulness-based health wellness program with an individual who was morbidly obese and wanted a lifestyle change. The components included physical exercise, a food awareness program, mindful eating to manage rapid eating, visualizing and labeling hunger, and a mindfulness procedure as a self-control strategy. The individual reduced his weight from 315 pounds to 171 pounds, increased his physical activity, ate healthy foods, stopped eating rapidly, substantially reduced serious medical risk factors, eliminated physical discomfort and mobility problems due to his weight, and enhanced his lifestyle over almost a 5-year period. He maintained his health wellness during 12 months of follow-up.",

Las personas deprimidas experimentan dificultades al dejar de fumar y en el mantenimiento de la abstinencia. En España, la investigación se ha centrado en el estudio de la relación entre fumar y síntomas depresivos. Los fumadores informan niveles más altos de sintomatología depresiva que los que no fuman. Los porcentajes de recaída son más elevados entre los que muestran más síntomas depresivos. Estos síntomas influyen en la eficacia al final del tratamiento y a los 12 meses de seguimiento. También se ha encontrado que una reducción brusca en el consumo de cigarrillos podría causar depresión mayor. Los hallazgos sugieren que los fumadores actuales pueden estar experimentando otros trastornos psiquiátricos distintos a los relacionados con la nicotina.",

In short, the problem is that the arguments against meat-consumption generalize, which is to say that they don’t merely cast a shadow on meat-eating, but on countless activities that are part and parcel of living in a modern consumer society: that is, spending money in ways that support exploitative labor practices or investing energies in hobbies instead of the homeless shelter. But since it would be unreasonable to demand that people make each and every one of these changes (and one shouldn’t blame people for acting in ways that it wouldn’t be reasonable to demand that they act), one has to reflect on which changes, if any, one can insist upon. When one does, one finds that meat-eating doesn’t make the cut.",

[1] reported that a four-year experiment on hundreds of mice showed that eating only during active hours of the day contributes to an increase in life expectancy.The researchers examined these mice by dividing them into six groups and used an automatic feeder to control the amount of food and meal times.One group allowed them to eat as much as they wanted, while the other five groups were given 30%-40%",

Atualmente, tem sido, cada vez mais frequente a pratica de dietas e regimes alimentares entre as pessoas que estao extremamente preocupadas com a imagem corporal e com as normas de um comportamento alimentar saudavel. Em busca de um padrao idealizado de corpo, alguns chegam a situacoes extremas, que, por vezes, culminam em transtornos alimentares nos quais o comportamento em relacao a alimentacao se torna seriamente comprometido. Entre os principais transtornos alimentares estao a anorexia nervosa e a bulimia nervosa, quadros psiquiatricos considerados dificeis de serem clinicamente tratados e revertidos, que afetam principalmente adolescentes e adultos jovens do sexo feminino, podendo levar a grandes prejuizos biologicos e psicologicos e aumento da morbidade e da mortalidade. Considerando a relevância da discussao a respeito de anorexia nervosa e bulimia nervosa, especialmente na adolescencia, periodo no qual o individuo comeca a exercer com mais autonomia as suas escolhas alimentares, este trabalho apresenta algumas consideracoes a respeito desses transtornos alimentares.

The popular press seems to publish articles daily about the Mediterranean diet. This eating pattern has been shown to reduce the risk of many of our most formidable health problems, including diabetes, hypertension, cancer, heart disease, and even depression.

We hypothesized that among females, dieters, compared to nondieters, would report more weight gain after smoking cessation and would tend to smoke more for weight control purpose.Undergraduate college students were surveyed to assess their smoking status, dieting status, postcessation weight gain, and their motivations to smoke.Among former smokers, dieters reported considerably more weight gain than nondieters. Dieters were more likely to have started, and to have continued smoking in order to control their weight, and among current smokers, dieters reported having had shorter quit attempts.The dieters/former smokers' comparatively high weight gain after smoking cessation is discussed in terms of possible changes in dietary intake, metabolic rate, and physical activity.",

      "title": "Hypothalamic Fatty Acid Sensing in the Normal and Disease States",
      "abstract": "Despite the undeniable influence of genetic and environmental factors, obesity is ultimately a resultant of, and perpetuated by, a disruption in energy homeostasis, whereby energy (food) intake exceeds energy expenditure. Normally, there is a series of concerted physiological and biochemical checks and balances initiated to handle acute, day-to-day fluctuations in energy balance: for example, an elevation in adiposity resulting from increased energy intake leads to counter-regulation via an increase in adipose-derived hormones, such as lesptin (Friedman, 2003), and an increase in energy expenditure (Lopez et al., 2007). Conversely, the fasting state shifts the energy balance such that energy stores are maintained while an increased propensity for food intake results (Lelliott and Vidal-Puig, 2004). As a result of these feedback signals that relay changes in energy status, the caloric storage/body weight is generally stable for most humans over long periods of time despite the wide variations in day-to-day food intake that occur. These above homeostatic responses are poised to handle subthreshold fluctuations in food intake, but clearly, chronic hyper-caloric excess combined with reduced energy mobilization (i.e., exercise) limits their effectiveness (Lopez et al., 2007), and leads to increased adiposity. In addition, this physiological cross-regulation also provides a reason for the inherent difficulty in losing large amounts of weight and sustaining that weight loss, as massive weight loss is capable of triggering rebound hunger (Friedman, 2003). Further impacting the effectiveness of the energy balance mechanism is the influence of the inherent sensory circuitry that mediates the pleasure and reward on feeding (Flier, 2004). Thus, identifying the nature of the satiety and hunger signals generated in the body that are involved in the regulation of feeding behavior has historically been a necessary preoccupation in obesity research.By the mid-twentieth century, the glucostatic (Mayer, 1953) and lipostatic (Kennedy, 1953) hypotheses, which proposed that circulating nutrients (glucose and lipids, respectively) generated in amounts proportional to peripheral storage depots serve as signals to the brain in order to mediate alterations in energy intake and expenditure, were in place. As a result, research then shifted to focus on the primary energy storage sites in the periphery, including the adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver, and their potential ability to sense energy and mediate the control of energy intake. The liver, given that it is exposed to the postabsorption nutrient flow (Langhans, 1996) and that hepatocytes are essentially able to metabolize all fuels (Seifter and Englard, 1988), was a natural target that in particular was quite convincingly demonstrated as a possible mediator of the hunger/satiety signal (Langhans, 1996).However, the hypothalamus in particular has long been championed as a key mediator of whole body energy homeostasis. Presently, it is generally accepted that it is involved in the day-to-day regulation of a number of factors including body temperature, blood pressure, thirst, and hunger, and is a vital structure for the integration of the nervous and endocrine systems. The first demonstrations of the hypothalamus serving as a satiety centre were conducted several decades ago, wherein hyperphagia and obesity resulted after the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was subjected to bilateral lesions (Hetherington and Ranson, 1942). Furthermore, the observed hyperphagia following the administration of the classical 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) antime-tabolite into the third ventricle of the brain (Miselis and Epstein, 1975) demonstrated a central fuel-sensing component to the regulation of energy homeostasis.Numerous landmark studies—the vast majority of which were conducted in the past decade—have demonstrated that the latter possibility holds much promise. The central nervous system (CNS) has been shown to sense hormones and nutrients in order to regulate not only food intake (Cota et al., 2006; Lam et al., 2008; Luheshi et al., 1999; Morton et al., 2006; Turton et al., 1996; Wolfgang and Lane, 2006) but also glucose homeostasis (Bence et al., 2006; Coppari et al., 2005; Gelling et al., 2006; Inoue et al., 2006; Kievit et al., 2006; Lam et al., 2005a,b,c; Obici et al., 2002a,b 2003). Of particular interest and relevance, changes in hypothalamic fatty acid levels and metabolism have been shown to regulate both food intake (Loftus et al., 2000) and glucose homeostasis (Obici et al., 2002a, 2003). As obesity and diabetes are characterized by hyperphagia and hyperglycemia, the characterization of defects in the hormone- and nutrient-sensing pathways in the hypothalamus that regulate energy and glucose homeostasis will shed light on the central component that initiates and perpetuates these metabolic diseases.",

With aging, there is an alteration in the neurotransmitters whereby dopaminergic and catecholaminergic systems are relatively depleted of monoamines while acetylcholine is largely unaffected. Pharmacotherapy in the elderly requires an understanding of the physiologic effects of medications. Dosage generally should be lower for the elderly patient on the basis of a milligram per kilogram of body weight, but determining the appropriate dosage required more than allowing for \"smaller body mass\" or \"less body water.\" Because of lengthened half-life and slowed distribution of medications, it is necessary to start with very low dosages and observe the patient for relatively longer periods of time before giving another dose, increasing the medication, or adding another drug.",

Biasanya orang vegetarian sering mengalami defisiensi protein, zat besi, dan vitamin B12. Ketiga zat tersebut sebagian besar terdapat pada bahan makanan hewani. Selain itu orang vegetarian juga lebih rentan terkena anemia karena rendahnya kadar zat besi dan vitamin B12 dalam tubuh mereka. Porsi dan kualitas bahan makanan nabati juga ikut mempengaruhi kesehatan seorang vegetarian.

O Brasil está com um grave problema em questão da obesidade, principalmente com crianças por razões simples que podem ser resolvidas a partir da “moderação” e através de exercícios físicos diários. Além dos maus hábitos alimentares, do sedentarismo, da predisposição genética e de outros mecanismos neurobiológicos relacionados à doença, a obesidade infantil também conta com outro grande aliado: a negligência e o mau exemplo por parte dos pais. Há pouco esclarecimento às famílias sobre as consequências da doença a longo prazo e pouco interesse do Estado no sentido de enfrentar o problema. As crianças passam muitas horas sentadas diante da TV ou do computador, quase sempre comendo produtos alimentícios ultraprocessados como por exemplo: pacotes de biscoitos ou de salgadinhos feitos com muita gordura e muito sódio, e geralmente regados à refrigerantes ou bebidas extremamente açucaradas.",

However, some people experience difficulties with swallowing, also called dysphagia, which can include trouble swallowing specific kinds of foods or drinks, or even not being able to swallow at all. It can be common for dysphagic people to cough up anything they eat or drink, to choke, or to feel as if food is stuck in the throat or chest. The inability to eat or drink properly can take away from fun social events like parties and outings. Since dysphagia can cause many problems both physically and emotionally, it is important to identify warning signs and seek treatment. Dysphagia can be managed and treated by speech-language pathologists, who make recommendations for types of foods to eat, assign exercises to strengthen swallowing muscles, and offer other ways to make living with dysphagia a lot easier.",

Respecto a los padres, se aconseja realizar las principales comidas,al menos una, con sus hijos;  comer todos lo mismo, que los ninos vean como sus padres se sirven la comida y comen de todo sin dejar nada en el plato; dar al desayuno el valor que tiene: la comida mas importante del dia; evitar premiar utilizando para ello unos u otros productos alimenticios, no comer viendo la television, promover juegos familiares que requieran actividad fisica asi como fomentar habitos deportivos que disminuyan el tiempo de ocio sedentario –videoconsolas, ordenadores, moviles- que ademas de influir en el sobrepeso alteran el sueno infantil.

Large brains are energetically expensive, and humans expend a larger proportion of their energy budget on brain metabolism than other primates. The high costs of large human brains are supported, in part, by our energy- and nutrient-rich diets. Among primates, relative brain size is positively correlated with dietary quality, and humans fall at the positive end of this relationship. Consistent with an adaptation to a high-quality diet, humans have relatively small gastrointestinal tracts. In addition, humans are relatively \"undermuscled\" and \"over fat\" compared with other primates, features that help to offset the high energy demands of our brains. Paleontological evidence indicates that rapid brain evolution occurred with the emergence of Homo erectus 1.8 million years ago and was associated with important changes in diet, body size, and foraging behavior.",

A relação do stress com o comportamento alimentar é bidirecional, pois tanto o stress pode levar a alterações no comportamento alimentar como uma má alimentação também pode aumentar os níveis de stress. São necessários mais estudos experimentais que possam inferir casualidade entre o stress e o comportamento alimentar e que averiguem a efetividade de estratégias concretas na prevenção dos episódios de desregulação do comportamento alimentar induzidas pelo stress por forma a fornecer mais e melhores ferramentas aos profissionais de saúde e nutrição que trabalham com esta temática a nível individual ou coletivo.",

      "abstract": "The weight increase which immediately follows the cessation of smoking is often dissuasive. All things being equal otherwise, the weight and adiposity of smokers are lower than those of non-smokers. The calorie intake of smokers is equal to that of non-smokers, but the nicotine absorbed with each cigarette smoked temporarily increases the basal metabolism and in particular the energy expended in all physical activities. The lack of compensatory increase of food intake in response to the increase of energy expenditure explains why smokers are underweight. Food consumption might be reduced by an increase of circulating fatty acids and by a nicotine-induced inhibition of insulin secretion. The weight increase observed after tobacco withdrawal is caused by the normalization of expenditures and by release of the brake on food consumption. Weight increase is usually important in heavy smokers, women and subjects with low physical activity. Fifty per cent of smokers who have given up smoking put on less than 3 kg. The effort required to mitigate this disadvantage is modest and it can be delayed and separated from the acute weaning period with a medicinal treatment.",

Dieses intensive Training (Volumen und Intensität) hat einen gesteigerten Energieverbrauch zur Folge, den es durch eine höhere Nahrungsaufnahme auszugleichen gilt. Balletttänzer(innen), Eiskunstläufer(innen), Turner(innen) und rhythmische Sportgymnastinnen trainieren ab einem Alter von 5–6 Jahren, und zwar meist mehr als 20–30 Stunden pro Woche. In diesen Sportdisziplinen sowie in Sportarten mit Gewichtsklassen (Ringen, Judo, Boxen bzw. bei Jockeys) entscheiden sich die jungen Spitzensportler bewusst für eine Beschränkung der Nahrungsaufnahme, um sich ihren schlanken, vorpubertären Körperbau zu erhalten bzw. zum sogenannten «Gewichtmachen». Kinder im Wachstum müssen unbedingt ausreichend Energie und Mikronährstoffe aufnehmen, und eine Beschränkung der Kalorien- und Flüssigkeitszufuhr könnte bei trainierenden Kindern und Jugendlichen die Regulierung des Stoffwechsels und des Hormonhaushalts stören und sich somit auf das Wachstum, die Entwicklung und Körperzusammensetzung, den Menstruationszyklus und die Reproduktionsfähigkeit auswirken und das Risiko für Verletzungen, wie z.B. Ermüdungsbrüche, erhöhen. Ferner können diese Strategien, insbesondere bei heranwachsenden Mädchen, Essstörungen (z.B. Anorexie bzw.

      "abstract": "Breast-feeding is currently recommended as the optimal source of nutrition for infants; however, it is known that some individuals can excrete enough food antigens in breast milk to result in allergic reactions in infants, especially those already highly sensitized. These reactions can include non‐immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated reactions, such as atopic dermatitis or gastrointestinal symptoms, and IgE-mediated reactions, such as anaphylaxis, although rare. Food reactions in infants who are breast-fed is a unique challenge because identifying the culprit foods may be more difficult and special consideration must be taken in ensuring proper nutrition during periods of food avoidance for both the infant and mother. This article reviews what is currently known about food allergy in infants who are breast-fed as well as offers insights into a proposed evaluation.",

Any caloric deficit implies weight loss which will occur at the rate decreed by the caloric value (3,500 calories) of a pound of body fat. Whenever this caloric deficit is reached, the body will be one pound lighter, with respect to body fat. When these concepts are used, weight loss becomes predictable. Such predictability offers multiple advantages to the clinician who is preparing a weight reduction program for his obese patient.",

      "abstract": "Background: Overweight is a physical condition caused by excessive accumulation of fat in the body due to an imbalance between food intake consumed and energy expended during bodily activities. Low physical activity has the potential to lead to obesity, especially when it starts as a child. The activities of children and adolescents are currently more playing gadgets and watching TV so that they have the potential to cause obesity. Overweight is a serious problem in Indonesia. This is because obesity will increase the risk of cardiovascular disease such as enlarged blood vessels, heart failure, stroke, fatty liver and hardening of the liver. Complications that can occur in overweight are heart attack, type II diabetes, stroke, hypertension, sleep apnea and breathing problems. To overcome the problematic consequences of being overweight are yin yoga and plank exercises. Yin yoga is currently one of the exercises that can reduce levels of fat in the body (burn bad calories in the body), relax the mind, and control breathing. Meanwhile, plank exercise is used to increase muscle strength. Plank movements help strengthen the muscles of the arms, shoulders, abdomen, legs, can also increase stability, and can burn up to 12 kcal of calories per round (healthy). This activity was carried out by physiotherapy students at the Lubuk Pakam Medistra Health Institute in the 2023 program with the aim of introducing the benefits of Yin yoga and plank exercises in overcoming and preventing the incidence of overweight among Physiotherapy students at the Lubuk Pakam Medistra Health Institute in 2023.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Few products are as pervasive and essential to our everyday lives as food: food fuels and satisfies our body, but also excites, disgusts, arouses, stimulates, and tantalizes all of our senses. It is functional and utilitarian, yet also hedonistic. Food consumption is also often a social act and our environment strongly influences what we consume. Yet, despite its obvious importance to us and our well‐being, it appears that as a society the consumption of food has led to a variety of difficult challenges that require some level of behavior change by consumers. Though several decades of research have sought to find answers to the many food consumption challenges that exist, it appears that excessive consumption of the “wrong” foods and its consequences (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, etc.) have begun to override prior concerns about food consumption deficit. Levels of obesity seem to be rising globally and apparently “no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years” (Ng et al., 2014, p. 766).",

More specifically, people frequently consume alcohol to enhance positive feelings (e.g., happiness) and reduce negative feelings (e.g., stress, tension). The results of two field studies and one laboratory study showed that holding the volume of alcohol consumed constant and varying the haptic (i.e., weight) sensations individuals experience during consumption can influence these emotional responses and also perceived intoxication. Specifically, we manipulated haptic weight sensations by varying the weight of the cup/container (e.g., champagne flute) alcohol was consumed from and showed that consuming champagne from lighter (vs. heavier) flutes leads to enhanced positive feelings, reduced negative feelings, and increased perceived intoxication.",

      "abstract": "In daily life, people are often exposed to food temptations, such as ads for chocolate or friends offering cookies. This article examines how consumers respond to such food temptations. We investigate whether food temptations, differing in strength (weak vs. strong), lead consumers to eat more or rather help them in exerting self-control. The results of three experiments suggest that weak food temptations activate food-related thoughts, and lead to overconsumption. Strong food temptations, on the other hand, inhibit this desire to eat, and help consumers to control their food-intake.",

Kebanyakan seseorang tidak bisa mengontrol dirinya sendiri mengenai apa yang masuk dalam dirinya tanpa memilahnya terlebih dahulu, terutama terjadi kepada remaja yang sulit mengontrol dirinya sendiri. Salah satunya permasalahan yaitu tentang mengonsumsi alkohol atau minuman keras, yang sudah berkembang pesat di lingkungan para remaja hingga setiap tahun selalu meningkat. Mereka kebanyakan tidak tahu dampak panjang apa yang terjadi setelah meminumnya, salah satunya yaitu gangguan mental ataupun gangguan berfikir hinggakerusakan sel-sel saraf pusat. Dan jika seseorang sudah mengonsumsinya ecara terus-menerus maka akan susah untuk memberhentikannya, dan bagi para remaja yang mulai mencobanya segeralah berhenti mengonsumsinya sebelum dampak dari minuman itu sendiri yang akan merusak hidup anda.

More than 50% of children and adolescents in the United States participate in competitive athletics in either school- or community-based programs. Most children do not possess the neuromuscular skills to train in sports until about 5 years of age. Children, in general, possess a rudimentary understanding of nutrition. Children, parents, and coaches should be taught both the principles of good nutrition and the specific nutritional demands of high levels of activity. Child athletes should be encouraged to consume three meals a day plus nutrient-dense snacks. Tissue glycogen stores will optimally meet the energy demands of training and competition only if replenished by regular, periodic food intakes. Adequate hydration is critical for temperature regulation and performance for athletes of all ages. In hot or especially humid environments, an athlete can lose several pounds of water with a single practice.",

Hal ini dapat memengaruhi pola makan, dengan remaja cenderung makan berlebihan sebagai cara untuk mengatasi stres atau kehilangan nafsu makan karena kecemasan. Remaja yang mengalami stres biasanya mengonsumsi makanan yang kaya kalori dan gula, sementara kecemasan bisa mengurangi nafsu makan, yang mengarah pada kurangnya asupan gizi yang tepat. Beberapa faktor yang memicu kondisi ini antara lain tekanan akademik, konflik sosial, serta pengaruh dari media sosial, yang dapat meningkatkan risiko gangguan gizi seperti obesitas atau kekurangan gizi. Berdasarkan berbagai penelitian, intervensi yang melibatkan pendidikan pola makan yang sehat, aktivitas fisik rutin, pembatasan penggunaan gadget, dan dukungan dari keluarga serta sekolah dapat membantu remaja mengelola stres dan kecemasan dengan lebih baik. Pendekatan yang komprehensif diperlukan untuk memperbaiki kebiasaan makan remaja, agar dapat mencegah dampak jangka panjang terhadap kesehatan fisik dan mental mereka.",

These diets are more easily tolerated than the more general elimination diets, so patients compliance is improved.

Home-made meat-based formulas are very well accepted by infants and parents. They are also useful oligoantigenic diet for the diagnosis of food allergy, allowing the introduction of other nutrients such as saccharose, wheat, etc. We use with good results and infant's compliance a home-made meat-based diet prepared as suggested by Rezza in 1973. A major advantage of this diet is that it can be tailored to the individual patient, that is vegetables, other types of fruit and meat, wheat flour and other nutrients can be added to the diet according to the age and weight of the child and the physician's judgement.",

      "abstract": "Da un punto di vista cronopsicologico si distinguono tre categorie di individui che fra loro presentano pattern di attivazione diversi nel corso della giornata: mattutini, intermedi e serotini. Precedenti ricerche hanno mostrato che i tipi serotini sono quelli che tendono ad utilizzare con piu frequenza sostanze psicoattive. Allo scopo di replicare tali evidenze in un campione di individui italiani, e di valutare se l’utilizzo di tali sostanze risulti differenziato nei diversi cronotipi in funzione del proprio livello circadiano di attivazione, ad un campione di 205 studenti universitari e stato somministrato un questionario sugli stili di vita. I risultati confermano che i soggetti serotini tendono ad utilizzare con piu frequenza alcune sostanze psicoattive, in particolare nicotina e alcool. L’ipotesi secondo la quale l’assunzione di sostanze psicoattive avviene in modo differenziato nelle due tipologie in relazione all’effetto, di attivazione o relax, che si vuole ottenere nei diversi momenti della giornata non sembra essere confermata dai dati di questa ricerca. Emerge comunque chiaramente che gli studenti serotini tendono piu dei loro colleghi mattutini a fare un maggiore uso di sostanze psicoattive, esponendosi con piu frequenza a comportamenti a rischio, potenzialmente dannosi per il loro benessere. Questo ultimo risultato viene discusso in relazione a dati recenti della letteratura scientifica, secondo i quali la tipologia serotina sembra essere un fattore di rischio in relazione al consumo di sostanze psicoattive.",

While sometimes it is OK to have chips or ice cream, if you eat junk food all the time it is pretty obvious you will begin to gain weight. What might not be obvious is that a poor diet can also change your brain! Even before a baby is born, what the parents eat can affect how the baby’s brain develops. Here, we tested what happens to the brain if we begin to eat healthier as we grow, after eating poorly early on in life. We found that eating poorly when the brain is developing changes our decisions about food. However, we can fix some of this damage with a good diet. Excellent news for kids and adults who have health problems from eating a poor diet early in life.",

Simple caloric restriction is extremely difficult for the obese compulsive eater. I have employed a simple method which has been effective. The patient follows a low caloric diet, but in order to satisfy the need for snacks and high caloric foods, the following program is recommended.

Mūsų tyrimo tikslas - įvertinti oniomanijos epizodo paplitimo sociodegrafines charakteristikas ir jų sąsajas su gyvenimo kokybe tarp Kauno kolegijos studentų. Tyrimui buvo taikomas anoniminis sociodemografinis anketavimo metodas (lytis, amžius, gyvenamoji vieta, seimyninė padėtis, pajamos, oniomanijos pasireiskimo dažnis per gyvenimą, ar oniomanijos epizodas trukdė gyvenimo kokybei). Tyrime dalyvavo 148 respondentai (59,5 proc. moterų, tiriamųjų amžiaus vidurkis – 22,7 m., vyrų ir moterų grupės pagal amžiaus vidurkį buvo vienalytės). Nustatyta, kad daugiau nei trecdaliui respondentų bent vieną kartą gyvenime yra pasireiskes kompulsyvaus potraukio pirkti epizodas. Nei vienas respondentas nenurodė, kad oniomanijos epizodas jam pasireiskia siuo metu. Isvados: oniomanijos epizodo pasireiskimas buvo susijes su moteriska lytimi, jaunesniu amžiumi, vienisumu, gyvenimu mieste ir didesnėmis pajamomis. Jis reiksmingai dažniau trukdė vyresnių, turincių seimą, mieste gyvenancių ir didesnes pajamas gaunancių vyrų gyvenimo kokybe. doi:10.5200/sm-hs.2012.025",

Weight is, therefore, a prevailing theme regardless of the gymnastics discipline. In both men's and women's artistic gymnastics and in rhythmic gymnastics, it is commonly suggested that energy intake should be reduced to achieve lower weight, and that this is an appropriate and desired act if a gymnast is to achieve success. Elite gymnasts often demonstrate an inadequate intake of energy and several nutrients, primarily iron and calcium. This triad of disorders represents eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, anorexia athletica, bulimia, and other restrictive eating behaviors), amenorrhea (both primary and secondary), and early development of osteoporosis.",

Evidently, a limiting factor of endurance is how much glycogen a muscle can bind to itself. Thus, any method that can bind the most glycogen on the muscle should enhance endurance. A few years ago, the noted physiologist Astrand set out to find how he could bind the most glycogen to muscle. He found that by depleting leg muscles and then ingesting a heavy carbohydrate diet, a runner could markedly enhance his endurance. Astrand confirmed these studies by a biopsy assay for glycogen content. <h3>Procedure.—</h3> Seven days before the race of the year, the runner depletes his leg muscles by taking a long run, such as 15.5 km. The next three days he avoids carbohydrates, eating mostly protein. On pre-race days four, three, and two a normal diet is supplemented",

      "abstract": "The proximate cause of obesity is an imbalance in the energy input and energy expenditure. It was believed that the sedentary life style of Western Societies which resulted in grossly reduced energy expenditure was the main cause of the imbalance. Studies carried out in recent years have challenged this belief, and have shown that the energy expenditure even in a sedentary life style is not grossly reduced. Although obesity has a genetic basis, it cannot be attributed to a signal gene or even to a few genes. Even though fat storage has an advantage in the animal kingdom, it appears to pose a greater risk for many metabolic diseases in humans. Epigenetic effects particularly fetal and infant nutrition also play a significant role in adult obesity. Over nutrition appears to be the major cause for the current epidemic of obesity. Fast food and soft drinks, coupled with aggressive marketing by food marketers have contributed to over eating. Consequently the energy balance is tilted in favor of excess energy storage.",

Peygamber’in hadislerinde bereketlenmeye vesile olarak zikrettiği bazı davranışların bu iki hastalığı önleyen tedbirler olarak algılanması ile ilgili teklifler sunmaktır. Dünyamızda insanların bir kısmı çok yemekten ve bu sebeple ortaya çıkan hastalıklardan mustarip iken diğer bir kısmı açlıkla ve açlıktan doğan hastalıklarla mücadele etmektedir. Üstelik böyle bir dengesizliğin farkında bile olmayan binlerce insan vardır. Hz. Peygamber yeme-içme davranışları ile ilgili bazı tavsiyelerinin berekete vesile olacağını söylemiştir. Yeme-içmeyi bir ibadete dönüştüren bu tavsiyelerin kişinin manevi beslenmesi ile ilgili olduğunun anlaşılması, önemli davranış bozukluklarından olan çok yemenin ve israfın önünü almaya yardımcı olabilir. Kişinin sadece bedenini değil ruhunu doyurmaya da ihtiyacı vardır. Bu manevi doygunluğun sağlanması, günümüz insanının şikayetçi olduğu psikososyal sorunları aşmaya ve yeme işini olması gereken miktar ve sınıra çekmeye katkı sağlayacaktır. Mümin kişinin bir, kafir kişinin ise yedi mide ile yediği ifade edilen hadiste mümin kişilerin daha az yedikleri halde daha kolay ve çabuk doydukları haber verilmektedir. Çoğu hadis ulemasının mecaza hamlettiği bu haber, kişinin manevi durumunun yeme alışkanlıkları ile ilişkili olduğuna bir işarettir.",

      "title": "Is sweetness addictive?",
      "abstract": "Summary The notion that sweetness is ‘addictive’ endures in the scientific literature and in the popular press. The most common targets of food cravings and addictions are energy‐dense foods that are sweet, high in fat, or both. In clinical studies, the consumption of sweet and high‐fat foods has been selectively reduced by opiate antagonists, suggesting a link between hedonic pleasure response and the brain systems of reward. Recent brain imaging studies have further implicated the dopamine system in mediating the pleasure response to food as well as a range of addictive behaviours. However, suggestions that sugar and fat have a permanent impact on the neurobiology of food preference are in sharp contrast with the view that the vast majority of food addictions are simply a matter of misattribution. Dietary restraint, coupled with ambiguous attitudes towards good‐tasting but energy‐dense foods, may lead consumers to claim that some aspects of eating behaviour are beyond their control. This distinction between addiction and attribution has implications for obesity‐related lawsuits. The chief attraction of addiction theory for the plaintiff’s counsel lies in the claim of diminished personal responsibility and abrogation of free choice. However, sugar and sweets do not appear to meet the current criteria for substance dependence as formulated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fourth Edition. Examining scientific literature on sweet food ‘addictions’ and their putative links to the obesity epidemic is the topic of this review.",

In some instances, fortified foods or supplements may be needed to ensure adequacy. Nutritionally adequate vegetarian diets support recommended weight gain in pregnancy, result in infant birth weight within normal limits, and support appropriate growth of infants and children. During the first year after birth, breast milk is the ideal primary beverage, with a commercial infant formula the only recommended alternative.

Overgewicht kan op jonge leeftijd al tot hoge bloeddruk leiden, het belast de gewrichten en kinderen kunnen zich ongelukkig voelen omdat ze dik zijn. Het kan ook zorgen voor meer ziekte later in het leven. Overgewicht ontstaat doordat een kind meer eet dan het nodig heeft. In ons literatuuronderzoek vinden we dat minder bewegen samenhangt met overgewicht, maar alleen als overgewicht wordt gemeten als vetmassa.. Om goed in te schatten hoeveel energie kinderen nodig hebben moet je goed kunnen meten hoeveel kinderen nodig hebben om te kunnen eten, slapen, groeien en bewegen. Met een bewegingsmeter, de TracmorD, een klein apparaatje dat aan de broekriem gedragen wordt, kon de hoeveelheid energie die 3- en 4-jarige kinderen besteden aan bewegen goed ingeschat worden. De bestaande formules om te kijken hoeveel kinderen nodig hebben voor eten, slapen en groeien bleken te hoge waarden te geven, met name voor de kleinere kinderen. Dit kan leiden tot een verkeerd voedingsadvies. Tot slot is er gekeken naar factoren die samenhangen met overgewicht. Een gezonde thuissituatie lijkt bij peuters belangrijker te zijn dan ‘het goede voorbeeld’ bijvoorbeeld door ouders die veel aan sport doen. Een gezonde thuissituatie bevat mogelijkheden voor baby’s en peuters om veel vrij te bewegen, ouders die samen met hun kinderen actief zijn bijvoorbeeld door samen naar school te fietsen of lopen, samen gezond eten en voldoende slapen. Meer TV kijken was wel gerelateerd aan overgewicht, maar buiten spelen speelde geen belangrijke rol.",

      "title": "Menu Labeling: The Unintended Consequences to the Consumer",
      "abstract": "Why are Americans, along with the rest of the most populous nations, more overweight than twenty or thirty years ago? Most nutritionists and scientists agree that the answer is complex and multifaceted, with genetics, exercise, and diet all playing at least a partial role. Americans, for the last thirty years, have been reportedly eating out at restaurants more frequently than they have been eating at home; as a result, the restaurant industry has been blamed, in part, for the rise in obesity, based upon the presumption that more calories are consumed at restaurants than at home. Yet determining the underlying causes of obesity is not simple; thus, the proposed solutions to combat the obesity problem have been numerous and wide-ranging. Indeed, how to tackle the obesity crisis has become a national debate, with proposed solutions originating from both public and private entities. One proposed government solution that has emerged from the obesity debate is menu labeling, which requires certain eating places to post nutrition information on their menus. \r\nThe theory behind menu labeling presupposes that consumers lack information about the nutritional content of the food they consume when eating away from home, and that those consumers desire more information about their food when visiting a restaurant. Thus, with menu labeling, consumers become armed with knowledge of the nutritional content of their food, and with this knowledge consumers will choose healthier food options over less healthy options. As consumers choose these healthier options, they will maintain a more appropriate body weight, thereby lowering the country's obesity rate. Another notion is that restaurants, knowing they must post the nutritional content on their menus, will seek to develop healthier food options and seek to satisfy consumers' desires for healthier food options. Thus, in theory, menu labeling appears to be one tool in the tool belt to help the nation make healthier choices. \r\nAlthough the premise behind menu labeling is laudable, it may not fully consider how and why consumers make particular food choices and whether the menu labeling requirement will be effective at changing consumer behavior to ultimately lower the nation's obesity rate. If menu labeling is not effective, consumers may be faced with negative unintended consequences, such as higher food prices, with no correlative health benefit. This article seeks to fully examine the menu labeling law, its impact on consumer decisions, and the potential negative consequences that may result from the law. Part II of this article reviews the background of menu labeling, focusing on the requirements of the new menu labeling provision under the Affordable Care Act. Part III considers those municipalities with menu labeling laws and the studies that have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of their respective menu labeling requirements. Part IV analyzes the complexity of consumer behavior, with particular focus on how this behavior presents a significant hurdle to the impact of menu labeling. Part V contemplates the unintended consequences of the menu labeling law.",

Atualmente, a supervalorização de um corpo magro, por grande parte da população, é vista como sinal de saúde, podendo criar, assim, uma situação de frustração, baixa autoestima e discriminação entre aqueles que não se enquadram nessa regra. Perante tais fatos, surge a problemática dos transtornos alimentares, que são distúrbios psiquiátricos de etiologia multifatorial, caracterizados por consumo, padrões e atitudes alimentares extremamente distorcidos e de preocupação exagerada com o peso e a forma corporal, em que investigações multidisciplinares realizadas em diferentes contextos, mostram que parte de sua etiologia permanece desconhecida. os transtornos alimentares podem ser caracterizados por perturbações comportamentais relacionadas aos hábitos alimentares. Geralmente, envolvem uma preocupação excessiva com a imagem corporal, gerando comportamentos como a ingestão reduzida de alimentos, uso de laxantes e diuréticos, ou a provocação de vômitos logo após o consumo de alimentos. Segundo o Manual Diagnóstico e Estatístico dos Transtornos Mentais (DSM-5), fazem parte do grupo de transtornos alimentares: a Pica, o Transtorno de Ruminação, o Transtorno Alimentar Restritivo/Evitativo, a Anorexia Nervosa, a Bulimia Nervosa e o Transtorno de Compulsão Alimentar.",

      "abstract": "Objectives ： It has long been advocated that abstinence is the only way to realistically and effectively cope with alcoholism. In opposition to controlled drinking (moderation), the valid reasons for abstinence were reviewed. Methods ： A search was conducted through PubMed using the keywords abstinence and/or moderation. And related books were also sought. Results ：Alcoholics should not practice moderation but abstinence instead for the following reasons. 1) The core concept of the definition of addiction is ‘loss of control.’ 2) Disruption of orbitofronto-striatal functional connectivity underlying perseveration in alcoholics makes them rigid and incapable of controlling drinking. 3) To prevent brain damage caused by repeated excitotoxicity. 4) Long-term follow up studies on alcoholics’ drinking have revealed the inevitable failure of moderation. 5) Due to the reinstatement phenomenon. 6) Moderation is a step towards another relapse. 7) As addicts attach to alcohol, detachment from alcohol makes them form a healthy attachment. 8) For the sake of their loved ones. 9) Abstinence is safer and simpler than moderation. 10) Moderate drinkers do not stand for alcoholics. Conclusion : Moderation is a fit for a few addicts but abstinence is a better fit for the majority of addicts. Although abstinence should be an imperative goal of alcoholics, it should not be forced but instead chosen.",

      "abstract": "ANTECEDENTES El test de Fagerstrom para la dependencia a la nicotina (FTND) ha recibido multiples traducciones del ingles al castellano, y es frecuente ver como una misma pregunta del test es formulada de diferente forma en los distintos formatos que existen de este test universal. Esto ha condicionado que, a veces, no se haya respetado el autentico sentido que esas preguntas tenian en el original, y, de esta forma, las respuestas que se obtengan no sean las mas adecuadas. Las preguntas reformuladas han sido la 3 (?Que cigarrillo le desagrada mas dejar de fumar? que pasa a formularse en el Test de Fagerstrom Modificado (FTM): ?De todos los cigarrillos que consume a lo largo del dia, ?cual es el que mas necesita??) y la 5 (?Fuma con mas frecuencia durante las primeras horas despues de levantarse que durante el resto del dia? que pasa a formularse en el FTM: Despues de consumir el primer cigarrillo del dia, ?fuma rapidamente algunos mas??)\nOBJETIVO Evaluar los cambios en las propiedades psicometricas, fiabilidad y validez, del test de Fagerstrom (FTND) respecto a una version modificada con dos preguntas reformuladas (FTM) en una muestra de fumadores usuarios de varios centros de salud de Atencion Primaria.\nMETODOLOGIA Se trata de un estudio descriptivo transversal de evaluacion de pruebas diagnosticas. La muestra se selecciono mediante muestreo no probabilistica consecutivo. Se realizo un analisis descriptivo de las diferentes variables segun la naturaleza cuantitativa o cualitativa de las mismas y un analisis de las propiedades psicometricas: analisis factorial, consistencia interna, fiabilidad interobservador y analisis de la validez (se valoro de forma concurrente enfrentandolo a otras escalas de dependencia, como el test de dependencia del DSM-IV (prueba de referencia), el test de Glover Nilsson, medidas de autopercepcion y medidas biologicas (CO y cotinina en orina).\nRESULTADOS Se analizaron a 159 fumadores (55,3% mujeres) con una edad media de 46,7 anos (DE: 12). Media de cigarrillos fumados/dia: 19,4 (1 a 60). Puntuacion de 4,9 (DE: 2,6) en el FTND y 4,88 (DE: 2,7) en el FTM. Niveles obtenidos de CO y cotinina en orina fue 26,6 ppm y 2568 ng/mL respectivamente. Fiabilidad interobservador: concordancia para las puntuaciones 0,96 con FTND y 0,97 con FTM y categorizaciones efectuadas (con punto de corte ?6: 0,88 con FTND y 0,83 con FTM; con punto de corte ?7: 0,87 con FTND y 0,91 con FTM). Consistencia interna, hemos conseguido una valor mas elevado con el FTM (0,74) respecto al FTND (0,69). Analisis factorial: el FTM mide dos factores que explican en un porcentaje superior (63%) de la varianza obtenida que con el FTND (59,1%) y tambien resulta superior cuando lo comparamos con estudios previos. En cuanto a la validez y correlacion del FTM con otras medidas de la dependencia a la nicotina, hemos obtenido que todas las escalas utilizadas en nuestro estudio se correlacionan poco o moderadamente, siendo en todos los casos esta correlacion positiva y significativa. Las correlaciones entre la puntuacion FTM y marcadores biologicos (CO y cotinina en orina) varia de baja a moderada. \nCONCLUSIONES: El Test de Fagerstrom modificado (FTM) mejora algunas de las propiedades psicometrica del Test de Fagerstrom para la dependencia a la nicotina (FTND), en concreto la consistencia interna y en el analisis factorial, los dos factores encontrados en el FTM explican un porcentaje superior de la varianza obtenida que con el FTND y tambien resulta superior cuando lo comparamos con estudios previos. Tanto el FTM como el FTND tienen una fiabilidad interobservador casi perfecta que junto a los antecedentes ya conocidos cuando se ha evaluado la fiabilidad intraobservador, concluimos que el test de Fagerstrom es un test poco observador dependiente.",

Participants were asked to eat a piece of chocolate during two lab sessions, held 1week apart. During the intervening week, we randomly assigned them to abstain from chocolate or to eat as much of it as possible, while a control group received no special instructions related to their chocolate consumption. At the second lab session, participants who had temporarily given up chocolate savored it significantly more and experienced more positive moods after eating it, compared to those in either of the other two conditions.

Several comorbidities have been associated with the pathology and, among those, cardiac myopathy and neutropenia are the most life threatening. The appropriate nutritive support is important to sustain the everyday life of Barth syndrome patients given the chronic fatigue they experience. Since they often prefer salty and fried food, and avoid vegetables and fruits, their eating habit and food preferences do not always provide the proper amount of vitamins and amino acids. It has been indeed reported that Barth syndrome patients have altered taste sensitivity. As olfaction also contributes to food consumption and flavor perception, we decided to investigate their olfactory abilities using the \"Sniffin' sticks' extended test\". We found no significant difference in any of the tested olfactory abilities between the group of Barth syndrome patients and the healthy controls. In summary, altered food preference of Barth boys could not be easily explained with an altered olfactory perception.",

      "abstract": "Objective. The objective of this narrative review is to consider possible factors limiting the efficacy of regular physical activity as a means of preventing the development of obesity and/or treating established accumulations of body fat. Methods. Information obtained from Ovid/Medline and Google Scholar through to December 2018 was supplemented by a search of the author's extensive personal files. Results. In the early years of human history, humans probably evolved mechanisms to reduce energy expenditures during periods of severe food shortage. Adaptations could have included a decrease in resting energy expenditures and/or the temporary elimination of all except essential physical activities. However, it is less certain that such mechanisms operate when a person who has an excess of body fat conforms to rigid dietary restrictions and/or undertakes a rigorous exercise programme. Severe dieting may indeed lead to some reduction of resting metabolism, but such effects are commonly attenuated if not fully reversed by the inclusion of an exercise programmes that conserve lean tissue mass. There is also little evidence that exercise programmes stimulate appetite or reduce spontaneous leisure activity. Conclusions. An excess of adipose tissue is usually accumulated over several years. If one views the prevention and/or correction of obesity by an increase of physical activity as a similar long-term project, the required exercise is within the capacity of those who are overweight. There is no good reason why a well-designed exercise programme cannot optimize body composition, as well as offering other important health benefits; however, as with rigorous dieting, the challenge to health professionals is to sustain enthusiasm until this has been accomplished.",

      "abstract": "Wat hun voedingspatroon betreft zijn ouderen vergelijkbaar met de rest van de Nederlandse bevolking. Ook zij eten meer ongezonde vetzuren en zout en minder volkorenproducten, fruit en vis dan aanbevolen en te weinig vezels. De meest kwetsbare ouderen hebben een grotere kans op ondervoeding en nutrientendeficienties. Met het ouder worden treden er fysiologische veranderingen op die van invloed zijn op de behoefte aan voedingsstoffen. Door deze veranderingen in lichaamssamenstelling daalt de ruststofwisseling, wat samen met de verminderde lichaamsinspanning de belangrijkste oorzaak is voor – gemiddeld genomen – een afnemende energiebehoefte met het stijgen der jaren. Door een verminderde nierfunctie, een afgenomen dorstgevoel en een verhoogde doorlaatbaarheid van de huid wordt de oudere mens gevoeliger voor dehydratie. Naast de energie- en eiwitinname vormen de vitamine D-voorziening en de vitamine B12-status specifieke aandachtspunten binnen de voeding van de ogenschijnlijk gezonde ouderen. Specifieke nutrienttekorten, zoals van vitamine D of vitamine B12, kunnen gericht met een supplement worden behandeld. Het eten van een voldoende en gevarieerde voeding verkleint de kans op voedingsproblemen op latere leeftijd. Daar ligt dus ook de belangrijkste uitdaging voor alle zorgverleners.",

      "title": "Alcohol in the body",
      "abstract": "Alcohol (ethanol) is a drug, and health professionals should know something of its physiological and pathological effects and its handling by the body. It is a small, water soluble molecule that is relatively slowly absorbed from the stomach, more rapidly absorbed from the small intestine, and freely distributed throughout the body. Alcoholic drinks are a major source of energy—for example, six pints of beer contain about 500 kcal and half a litre of whisky contains 1650 kcal. The daily energy requirement for a moderately active man is 3000 kcal and for a woman 2200 kcal. Rate of absorption of alcohol depends on several factors. It is quickest, for example, when alcohol is drunk on an empty stomach and the concentration of alcohol is 20-30%. Thus, sherry, with an alcohol concentration of about 20% increases the levels of alcohol in blood more rapidly than beer (3-8%), while spirits (40%) delay gastric emptying and inhibit absorption. Drinks aerated with carbon dioxide—for example, whisky and soda, and champagne—get into the system quicker. Food, and particularly carbohydrate, retards absorption: blood concentrations may not reach a quarter of those achieved on an empty stomach. The pleasurable effects of alcohol are best achieved with a meal or when alcohol is drunk diluted, in the case of spirits. ![][1]</img> Alcohol is distributed throughout the water in the body, so that most tissues—such as the heart, brain, and muscles—are exposed to the same concentration of alcohol as the blood. The exception is the liver, where exposure is greater because blood is received direct from the stomach and small bowel via the portal vein. Alcohol diffuses rather slowly, except into organs with a rich blood supply such as … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "title": "The Dangers of Running on Empty",
      "abstract": "Abstract If only I had tracked the numbers during my competitive running days, I may have realized my “tank” was nearly empty. My complaints as an elite athlete were similar to that of a patient with a chronic illness: fatigue, depression, and muscle pain. Looking at the records would have quickly identifled the caloric deficit I was building. I was consuming about 1600 calories a day, but expending close to 1000. In other words, I was relying on 600 calories to provide me with the energy my body needed to function throughout the rest of the day when I was not running. In short, I was “running on empty.” Most multiple sclerosis (MS) patients report similar symptoms of fatigue. The question is whether the fatigue is a symptom of the disease, poor nutrition, or a result of some other unrelated illness. Fatigue certainly can be related to “running on empty.” When the body is denied calories and is underfed, metabolism naturally slows down to protect energy stores. So instead of burning an average of 10–15 calories per pound of bodyweight, you may be burning 8–10 calories per pound. This results in you needing fewer calories to maintain current bodyweight. This then translates into eating less and compromising nutrition.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The addictions model of obesity claims that individuals gain excess weight due to their dependence on and inability to control the intake of certain food substances. The dependence and lack of control over these food substances is undergirded by, according to the addictions model, the psychoactive properties of foods. The article reviews the literature on the purported psychoactive effects of foods and concludes that although, under certain circumstances, some food substances may have subtle effects on mood and behavior, the effects of food are quite different from that of psychoactive drugs such as nicotine and alcohol. Therefore, the food addictions model is unlikely to provide a fruitful paradigm for understanding the complex problem of obesity.",

Starving people continue to use foods that they are familiar with or that other sections of the population are familiar with. The very poor sections of the population may well use fodder food, which nevertheless they are familiar with and which in most cases was also used by some of their members even in ‘normal’ times.",

These guidelines aim to prevent obesity, car-diovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis. The mes-sages to the public were based on two presumptions: to get back tradi-tional Brazilian healthy dietary patterns and to stimulate the consumptionof these foods more than to formulate prohibitions. The main messagesare: eat at least four meals a day, and do not skip meals; maintain ahealthy weight; increase daily physical activity and exercise; eat riceand beans with vegetables everyday; eat four to five portions of fruitseveryday; reduce sugar, sweets and sodas; choose a fruit instead ofdeep fried foods or sweets for snacks; use salt only in moderation; use oilor olive oil instead of other fats; drink or eat low fat dairy products at leastthree times a day.

      "title": "The Role of Cheat Meals in Dieting: A Scoping Review of Physiological and Psychological Responses",
      "abstract": "Abstract “Cheat” meals are characterized as a pause from energy restriction to allow relaxed ad libitum energy intake in a short period of time, usually as a single meal, a single day, or meals that spread across multiple days, such as over the weekend. Incorporating cheat meals has become a popular strategy in the diet and fitness communities, with individuals often indulging in large meals containing energy-dense foods. Proponents of this strategy typically suggest that intermittent periods of pauses in prolonged dieting might serve as a “mental break,” “boost metabolism,” or enhance exercise performance. This review aims to examine existing literature on cheat meals, exploring both physiological and psychological responses. A systematic search was conducted in 5 databases using all available records until October 2, 2024. A total of 8 articles were selected for detailed analysis. Currently, the available data provided some evidence regarding the ability of short, intermittent bouts of ad libitum dietary intake to facilitate effective weight reduction; however, the evidence on the retention of lean mass, the attenuation of metabolic adaptation, or the improvement in exercise performance during weight reduction was mixed. When framed as a goal-directed behavior, positive influences of ad libitum intake on eating behaviors, such as reducing feelings of hunger and enhancing satisfaction, were notable. However, the analysis revealed that framing cheat meals as contradictory to one’s goals or normalizing cheat meals as a form of reward for committing to a strict dietary regimen could be associated with the manifestation of eating disorder behaviors. Therefore, while cheat meals might offer physiological and/or psychological benefits in some circumstances or applications, they also pose risks of fostering unhealthy eating patterns. Considering the rising prevalence of cheat meals, future research is strongly warranted to unravel the complex physiological and psychological ramifications of cheat meals, to equip healthcare and fitness professionals in devising a safe and effective diet strategy for sustainable weight loss.",

Even if families know the healthy food choices, it might be difficult for them to make those choices. For example, if we tell families to increase their fruit and vegetable intake but their neighborhoods have no full-service grocery stores, a limited availability of fruits and vegetables, and a high density of fast food restaurants, finding fruits and vegetables becomes a challenge. Similarly, if we recommend more physical activity but their neighborhood has parks overtaken by the homeless or gangs, or there is a lack of safe walking or biking paths, getting more physical activity becomes difficult.",

Coercion is not bad when it keeps people from making choices that would promote obesity and heart disease, since most people value health more than they value the availability of large portions of junk food. Paternalists recognize that people also value things other than health, such as social outings involving food and celebrations of culture that feature traditional meals. The chapter argues that eating habits have always evolved, however, and an evolution that reflects healthier options in particular is no more destructive of shared social gatherings or cultural traditions than any other change.",

Some strategies aiming to limit appetite can also be suggested. From a practical point of view, various approaches are possible, including modulation of meal frequency, high-protein diets, increasing glycogen storage, high-intensity intermittent exercises, etc.Body weight changes must be progressive, implemented exclusively during training periods, and should not involve significant energy restriction or high-risk behaviour. On average, the weight-loss aimed for should be around 0.5 to 0.9 kg/week, but should never exceed 1.5 kg of body weight per week. Indeed, most of the time significant weight reduction reflects dehydration, nutritional deficiencies and sometimes proteolysis; all of which have negative effects on physiology, nutritional status and performance.Psychological pressures exerted by the athletes' entourage can induce significant behavioural disorders, including eating disorders. Educational programmes for coaches and athletes could help to limit some dangerous practices which are still observed (mainly in \"aesthetic\" sports or in weight-category sports).",

      "title": "Benin: nutritional considerations on trace elements in the diet.",
      "abstract": "The increasing use of the atomic absorption technique makes it possible to study man's trace-element requirements with a very accurate methodology. Some of these elements are present in the daily diet in minute quantities of micrograms which are, however, indispensable for the proper functioning of the body. But apart from such trace quantities present in conditions which are not affected by abnormal environmental concentration, there may be situations in which trace-element levels in foods and diets reach very high values. If very high, the levels may expose a population to the risk of toxicity; on the other hand, they may lead to wrong interpretations of trace-element requirements because they may lead the nutritionist to regard some high values as normal levels and therefore appropriate for meeting man's requirements. Inversely, they may also induce the nutritionist to regard lower values as unsatisfactory. Therefore, since these environmental factors, which are not always identifiable, can induce erroneous judgements due to overestimation of the requirements, it would seem appropriate, if figures on the total supplies of the diet are to be used, to refer to the tabled values of the individual foods of the diet, rather than to analyses of the whole diet ready for consumption. In fact, an abnormally high or low value of a trace element of any single food of a food composition table would have little influence on the calculation of the total supply of the diet, whereas the use of values obtained from meals which have been exposed to contamination during technological processes(e.g., through the cooking water of foods or cooking utensils) may result in overestimation. However, the analysis of global diets seems to be the method of choice in toxicological research, because in this type of investigations the basic elements of an evaluation often derive indeed from abnormal conditions identified at consumer level. Regarding the importance of copper and iron in haematopoiesis, the following hypotheses can be put forward: (a) In the haematopoietic phenomena occurring in intrauterine life, copper seems to play a role equal to that of iron, and perhaps even more important. (b) This role does not seem to be an autonomous one, but is mediated by availability of serum globulin to the child. In other words, this hypothesis relates the problem more generally to the protein nutrition of mother and foetus...",

      "abstract": "Rats given a choice between a 5% alcohol solution and water will dramatically increase alcohol preference on the days following experience with inescapable electric footshocks, compared with unshocked animals. Although, total alcohol preference did not differ during shock days, an interaction occurred between shock stress and alcohol preference. Rats that initially preferred alcohol decreased alcohol preference during shock days, whereas, rats that initially avoided alcohol increased alcohol preference during shock days. Therefore, the stress of inescapable electric footshock has bidirectional effects on alcohol preference. These bidirectional effects depend on the temporal dynamics of alcohol consumption in relation to the shock experience and the initial alcohol preference.",

The energy potential of food depends not only on its energy content but also on its satiating capacity. In removing fibre from carbohydrate foods man creates foods which are artificially low in satiety. This has been demonstrated by compariso ns of equivalent meals of apple juice and whole apples and of white and wholemeal bread. Simply disruptit1g fibre by turning apples into a purée also reduces their satiety potential. Insulin is a hormone which favours the synthesis and deposition of fat. Fibre-depleted apple juice evokes a greater insulin response than whole apples, while purée has an intermediate effect. Refined carbohydrate probably causes hyperinsulinism by being readily and rapidly absorbed. This provides a further link between such foods and obesity, as well as a possible mechanism for the causation of diabetes and atherosclerosis.",

      "title": "How to Lose Weight Fast",
      "abstract": "Pick up any diet book and it will claim to hold all the answers to successfully losing all the weight you want—and keeping it off. Some claim the key is to eat less and exercise more, others that low fat is the only way to go, while others prescribe cutting out carbs. So, what should you believe? The truth is there is no “one size fits all” solution to permanent healthy weight loss. What works for one person may not work for you, since our bodies respond differently to different foods, depending on genetics and other health factors. To find the method of weight loss that’s right for you will likely take time and require patience, commitment, and some experimentation with different foods and diets. While some people respond well to counting calories or similar restrictive methods, others respond better to having more freedom in planning their weight-loss programs. Being free to simply avoid fried foods or cut back on refined carbs can set them up for success. So, don’t get too discouraged if a diet that worked for somebody else doesn’t work for you. And don’t beat yourself up if a diet proves too restrictive for you to stick with. Ultimately, a diet is only right for you if it’s one you can stick with over time. It’s natural for anyone trying to lose weight to want to lose it very quickly. But evidence shows that people who lose weight gradually and steadily (about 1 to 2 pounds per week) are more successful at keeping weight off. Healthy weight loss isn’t just about a “diet” or “program”. It’s about an ongoing lifestyle that includes long-term changes in daily eating and exercise habits. Once you’ve achieved a healthy weight, by relying on healthful eating and physical activity most days of the week (about 60—90 minutes, moderate intensity), you are more likely to be successful at keeping the weight off over the long term. Losing weight is not easy, and it takes commitment. But if you’re ready to get started, we’ve got a step-by-step guide to help get you on the road to weight loss and better health. Google search the question ‘how to lose weight fast’ and the advice you're likely to receive ranges from strange – ‘breathe deeply constantly to work your abs’ is a genuine suggestion we stumbled across – to downright damaging, like the suggestion that diet pills are ever a good idea. Sure, you know that those suggestions won’t work, but in the age of information, how do you go about sorting weight loss fact from weight loss fiction? The answer, as ever, is science. Reliable, proven, credible science. For instance, did you know that by chewing gum you'll consume 36 fewer calories every time you reach for a snack because your've already satisfied your appetite? Or where you aware that getting in an early morning bodyweight session can burn 20 per cent more fat than if you were to do the same thing after lunch? We thought not, so we've collected 20 of our best product on how to lose weight quickly and safely, backed by peer-reviewed studies, so you can be sure of their efficacy.

      "title": "Analyse d’un cas clinique : utilisation de la natriurèse comme marqueur du suivi des régimes hypocaloriques",
      "abstract": "L’observance des consignes nutritionnelles est le principal sujet de préoccupation dans la prise en charge de l’obésité. Tous les traitements conventionnels basés sur une restriction plus ou moins prononcée des apports caloriques sont souvent voués à l’échec sur le moyen et long terme. De surcroît, il convient de noter que même dans le temps court, les résultats observés et prédits sont divergents. L’évaluation de la natriurèse des 24 heures peut être utile pour aider les patients obèses à mieux comprendre pourquoi ils ne maigrissent pas, mais surtout pour leur permettre de rétablir un profil alimentaire de restriction calorique. L’utilisation de la natriurèse en tant que marqueur qualitatif et quantitatif des apports caloriques est basée sur le fait que la plupart des régimes hypocaloriques sont également hyposodés, car la haute densité énergétique et la richesse en sel est le dénominateur commun de nombreux aliments. De ce fait, la persistance d’une natriurèse élevée est le reflet d’un mauvais suivi du régime. Pour illustrer l’utilité de la mesure de la natriurèse en tant que marqueur d’observance d’un régime hypocalorique, nous rapportons le cas d’un sujet obèse chez lequel la natriurèse des 24 heures a été utilisée pour détecter et corriger les dérives nutritionnelles. Compliance to dietary advice is the main burden encountered in the management of obese people. All conventional treatments consisting to prescribe more or less pronounced restriction in calorie intake often fail to achieve significant weight losses on intermediate and long-term perspectives. It should be added that even on the short-term discordances occur between the observed and predicted outcomes. Assessments of 24-h urinary excretion rates of sodium in obese patients can be useful for better understanding why they are not losing weight and how they have to reset a restricted calorie-eating pattern. The use of the natriuresis as marker of the quality and quantity of food intakes is based on the fact that most low-calorie diets are characterized by a reduction in the consumption of salt because high-energy and salty foods usually belong to the same groups. Consequently, the persistence of elevated sodium excretion in the urine reflects a poor compliance to dieting. To illustrate the usefulness of the natriuresis measurement throughout the periods of expected compliance to calorie-restricted diets, we report the case of an obese individual in whom the 24-h urinary excretion rate of sodium was used for detecting and correcting the dietary drifts.",

Generally defined as weight loss of 10 percent, it is now being redefined as an unintended weight loss accompanied by fever, weakness or diarrhea lasting more than 30 days. This definition is important because wasting is invisible in its early stages. Patients may gain fat while losing muscle, giving them a stable appearance. However, muscle tissue is where most metabolic processes take place. Wasting can be detected early through a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) test. A checklist is included to determine the level of nutritional risk, and safety tips for shopping and preparing foods are provided. Patients are cautioned to never eat foods containing raw meat, fish, or poultry, and to avoid foods with raw eggs.",

The client is unlikely to achieve an maintain a healthy body weight unless they find a diet and forms of exercise that they enjoy. Health professionals can help by providing evidence-based advice tailored to the individual client's preferences. For example, clients can eat more of the fruits and vegetables they like, and sugar need not be excluded from the carbohydrate components of the diet and may be beneficial in making the diet more palatable. Slow, steady weight loss should be the aim leading to maintaining a healthy body weight in the long-term. Small acceptable changes to the diet, which can be maintained lifelong, should be encouraged.

      "abstract": ". . . the zenith of America's long obsessive coupling of food with moral rectitude came with a Seventh-Day Adventist doctor named John Harvey Kellogg who in 1876 introduced a regime of treatments that was as bizarre as it was popular. Possibly the two were not unconnected. Patients who were underweight were confined to their beds with sandbags on their abdomens and forced to eat up to twenty-six meals a day. They were not permitted any physical exertion. Even their teeth were brushed by an attendant lest they needlessly expend a calorie. The hypertensive were required to eat grapes and nothing else—up to fourteen pounds of them daily. Others with less easily discernible maladies were confined to wheelchairs for months on end and fed experimental foods such as gluten wafers and \"a Bulgarian milk preparation known as yogurt.\" Kellogg himself was singular in his habits. It was his practice to dictate long tracts on the evils of meat-eating and masturbation (the one evidently led to the other) while seated on the toilet or while riding his bicycle in circles around the lawn. Despite—or very possibly because of—these peculiarities, Kellogg's \"Temple of Health\" thrived and grew into a substantial complex with such classy amenities as elevators, room service, and a palm house with its own orchestra. Among its devoted and well-heeled patrons were Teddy Roosevelt and John D. Rockefeller.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to find out and learn about \"Dopamine Detox\" from the \"1 Day of Success\" youtube channel entitled \"Control Yourself From All Addictions\". In this study, a qualitative descriptive method was used, namely a method carried out by observing and noting techniques because the source of information was taken by listening to oral narratives. Dopamine detox can be a way to reduce or limit activities that are considered enjoyable but can have bad effects if done excessively. For example using gadgets, playing video games, or even eating snacks. The goal of a dopamine detox is to reduce addiction by changing bad habits to be more productive. Basically, dopamine cannot be eliminated from the body, but we can control dopamine levels by temporarily eliminating unhealthy entertainment and having high levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels that are too high can reduce concentration so that we lose focus. People who need a dopamine detox are people who are addicted to negative things, so the term dopamine detox actually doesn't really aim to reduce dopamine, but rather directs it so that dopamine can be produced in a way that is healthier, beneficial, not damaging to health, not disturbing productivity and does not make us lazy.",

      "title": "Paradigm Shift of Health Towards Obesity in Childhood",
      "abstract": "Obesity does not occur because of poor eating habits alone; it depends upon genetic predisposition, unhealthy environment, the body’s metabolism and most importantly, lifestyle choices. The “thrifty gene” possessed by our population in synergism with lack of physical activity has increased the childhood obesity prevalence from 4% to 30% (1). Watching television, playing video games for long hours and minimal outdoor activity enables the metabolism to be slow in favor of energy storage in the form of fat. The prevalence of junk food has increased in schools, so much so that it has become part of the weekly schedule in many schools. Although the variety of choices provides students with the independence to choose whatever they want to eat, it also can instill a habit of choosing junk food at all meal times. Such foods have low nutritional value but high caloric content. Furthermore, this habit of junk consumption may lead to refrainment from eating homecooked foods, vegetables and especially pulses. Thus there is a paradigm shift in the health of the younger population due to these factors. Childhood obesity has been reported to be between 6% and 19% in Pakistan (2). Obesity does not only affect the physical health of an individual (3, 4) but is also associated with impaired cognitive functions in both adolescents and adults in a number of studies (5-7). Literature supports a better intellectual outcome of obese and overweight children after physical activity intervention (8). We believe that schools are the best places to initiate awareness about following a healthy lifestyle. As children grow, they will begin to understand the health benefits. Our population must become aware of the need for lifestyle modifications such as increased physical activity, enjoyment of indoor and outdoor games, and proper diet (i.e., fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy products and plenty of water). Body mass index (BMI), defined as weight in kg divided by height squared in meters, is widely recognized as the most common and convenient tool for the assessment of obesity (9). Routine BMI measurements can be part of the six monthly schedules at schools. To summarize, understanding the importance of a healthy lifestyle can develop the groundwork for eradicating the epidemic of obesity and preventing associated illnesses. We recommend promoting physical well-being, healthy eating and participation in physical activities in schools. The message should not only be conveyed to children, but also to school administration as well as parents to prevent obesity. To have a healthy adult population in the future, school-age children must modify their habits and learn how to make healthy lifestyle choices. Introducing such modifications in schools can be very challenging, as the policies and students differ between private schools and public schools. School officials should develop a way to implement a strategy to prevent obesity.",

      "title": "Body Image Concerns, Unhealthy Weight Control Behaviors in Teenagers and the Role of Tobacco Policy",
      "abstract": "Unhealthy Weight Control Behaviors (UWCBs) include using diet pills, purging (vomiting or using laxatives) and fasting for 24 hours or more to lose weight. UWCBs are prevalent among teenagers, can have potentially dangerous health consequences and are precursors to eating disorders. Yet UWCBs have been largely overlooked in economics and there are few if any government or public health interventions to address such behaviors on a broader scale. Past economic research indicates that weight-conscious adolescents also use smoking as a strategy to control their weight - teenagers' demand for cigarettes may be in part derived from their demand for weight loss. In addition, research in epidemiology and public health finds that teenagers who engage in UWCBs are much more likely to smoke. This suggests that anti-tobacco policies such as cigarette taxes targeted to combat youth smoking are a possible policy lever for understanding UWCBs. If teens use cigarette smoking to lose weight, instead of or in combination with UWCBs, or if reduced smoking leads to unintentional weight gain among teens, higher taxes could have spillover effects to UWCBs. Using repeated cross-section, individual-level data from the 1999-2013 National and State Youth Risk Behavior Surveys combined with state-level policies and characteristics, this research provides evidence on the association between smoking, body image concerns and the use of UWCBs in teenagers. Results suggest that cigarette taxes reduce smoking, including for those trying to lose/maintain weight and especially among girls. Cigarette taxes increase the incidence of UWCBs, again among girls. Specifically, my main results indicate that a $1 increase in cigarette taxes leads to a 1.2 percentage point increase in UWCB participation among teenage girls, a meaningful increase relative to the overall sample prevalence of 22.3%.",

      "abstract": "It has long been believed that food restriction leads to psychological disturbances, including depression, preoccupation with food, and binge eating. However, recent studies suggest that comprehensive weight loss programs that incorporate behavioral treatment, diet change, and encouragement of physical activity in fact can improve the psychological state, including mood. A study conducted on subjects participating in the Weight Watchers program demonstrated positive psychological changes and improved quality of life. These changes may help motivate overweight people to maintain the physical activity and nutritional practices necessary to lose and maintain weight. Programs that include group support, like Weight Watchers, have been associated with psychological benefits independent of the amount of weight lost. Furthermore, dieters who regain lost weight do not appear to experience adverse psychological consequences. The development or exacerbation of bulimia has been linked by some authors to strict dieting, but more moderate weight control programs do not appear to produce disordered eating and may help reduce binge eating among overweight people. Individuals who successfully lose and maintain weight have been shown to experience improved mood, self-confidence, and quality of life. Additionally, decreasing levels of psychological and behavioral symptoms have been associated with increasing duration of weight loss maintenance. It can be concluded that quality of life and other psychological measures improve in individuals on comprehensive weight management programs.",

      "abstract": "“Why do you complain that you cannot afford meat? Why do you not just eat beans?”, by a well-meaning public figure to a gathering of people. It is ok if one is a vegetarian for whatever reason. You might be a vegetarian for religious or health reasons. You might even decide to eat a meatless diet on a whim. However, if your family is regular and not restricted in what they can eat, then suddenly fail to access a diverse diet, then one must think nutrition very seriously. Say a family has young children who have a good appetite and have been drinking milk, then all of a sudden milk is curtailed, advice cannot be “give them any other beverage”. Satiety-wise yes, but not nutrition-wise. So is meat a must in the diet? Yes, because of the unique essential nutrients it provides. And when we talk of meat we have to remember there are different types of meat. There is red meat from cattle, sheep, goats, and wild animals. Then there is white meat from poultry, fish, rabbits, and insects. Consumers delight in such meats for different reasons. Then the milk or eggs of these provide more or less the same nutrients. The human body requires certain essential nutrients, already determined scientifically as far as amounts needed. In most cases, it is a mixed diverse diet, which means both plant and animal sources. So, humans who consume only animal-source food, miss plant-source nutrients, and vice versa. For example, in Kenya, we have the Maasai who eat meat and drink blood and milk. But guess what? That is not all. They also take intestinal juices which help to digest the meat they consume, sometimes in raw form. We did some studies on Maasai eating patterns and found out that, their diet includes fruits, roots, and herbs from the wild. These provide vitamins and minerals to supplement what their meat-lacto diet provides. So, human beings need a mixed diet to be able to meet fully the body's nutritional requirements. Should you choose to, or find yourself eating only meats or vegetables, you will most likely suffer certain nutritional deficiencies. Where you can affordably access good supplements, you better get a doctor's advice to start taking these before you develop nutrient deficiency symptoms. Most cultures seem to have diets where foods complement each other. More studies are needed on this topic. Meantime, let us continue to research and learn more. All these nutrients our body needs work in unison and when you study them carefully, you find out that they are interdependent, in that if you take too much of one or some, the functioning of the others is affected, likely to lead to negative effects on your health.",

      "title": "NUTRITION INFORMATION USAGE IN FOOD CHOICES: A collection of interdisciplinary studies, with a focus on understanding the relation between intention and behavior",
      "abstract": "Healthy dietary intake patterns contribute to maintaining a good health and to theprevention of negative health consequences, such as hypertension. However, in spite ofthe negative effect of consuming unhealthy foods, which mostly are low-satiating,energy-dense, and have non-adequate quantities of micronutrients, consumers are stilloften engaging in food consumption behavior that negatively impacts their wellbeing.The usage of nutrition information, in this respect, can affect this food choice behavior.Next to reading this nutrition information, also the comprehension of this information isconsidered important in steering food choices, and thus dietary intake.According to multiple scientific sources, available nutrition information is often usedlimitedly, or incorrectly, in making food choices. Even consumers who have an activelong-term goal of consuming healthy foods, are found to not always utilize nutritioninformation to benefit their food choices. This group is characterized by having a strongmotivation to become or to stay healthy. As can be expected, however, there is a strongheterogeneity between these people in how well their intentions are translated intobehavior. In the second part of this thesis, we used a stage-model to describe howindividuals move through a pattern of distinct phases when translating intention tobehavior, derived from the Health Action Process Approach model. In doing so, westudied factors that influence how nutrition information affects food choices.In the first part of this thesis, we addressed two specific cases where foodconsumption decisions were steered by information about components of food. InChapter 2, we evaluated how European consumers perceive nutrition and health claimsabout specific food ingredients and what can be done to improve comprehension ofsuch claims. We found that nutrition and health claims are mostly only perceivedpositive by specific target consumers (who need the product, accept the ingredient,understand the benefit, and trust the brand). These consumers indicate that theproducts with substantiated and approved claims help them in reaching overall healthgoals, and are therefore willing to buy products with these claims. Other consumers,however, may have adverse reactions towards nutrition and health claims on functionalfoods. We set out that both from a legal perspective, as well as a public healthperspective, efforts should be made to increase nutrition literacy to avoidmisinterpretations of nutrition and health claims.In Chapter 3, a case study was presented in which nutrition information provided byvarious stakeholders is not in line with scientific findings. In particular, we evaluatedwhy recommendations to reduce fructose-consumption are disputable and impracticalgiven the current scientific findings on the relation between fructose and obesity. Weargued that the proposition that the causal role of fructose intake in the etiology of theglobal obesity epidemic rests on controversial interpretations of research. Whenconsumed in regular amounts, there appears to be no specific negative effect offructose-containing sugars on obesity – besides the expected contribution to the energybalance. Accordingly, consumers should not avoid foods with fructose-containingsugars. This chapter provided another example of how food choices are not determined solely by physiological needs (i.e., hunger or thirst), as they are dependent on manymore factors, including consumer perception of how a food may influence his or herhealth – termed outcome expectancies.In our overall conceptual model, we separated nutrition literacy as a distinctconstruct that influences how well intentions are converted into action, and added therole of demographic and psychosocial factors. In Chapter 4 of this dissertation, this rolewas further discussed using data obtained from a survey in individuals who intend toeat healthily. Using process tracing software in a computerized task in whichparticipants had to make dichotomous food choices, we measured the frequency andtime of categories of nutritional information considered. In the research, we confirmedthat, regardless of the increased aim to eat healthier, consumers often make choicesthat are not in line with their intention. The fundamental idea behind this phenomenonis the so-called intention-behavior gap. This phenomenon tells us that some people maydevelop an intention to perform healthy behavior, but they do not take the appropriateactions. We discussed that common psychosocial determinants of healthy behaviorneed to be augmented with a person’s actual reading and understanding of nutritioninformation to better explain the variance in healthy food choice behavior.In Chapter 5, we used the same date-set to form groups of consumers, who clusteron the level of energy, salt, sugar, and saturated fat levels considered. We did this toinvestigate differences between these groups and to see if consulting information onthese “four evils” leads to healthier choices. We confirmed the importance ofthoroughly reading available nutrition information to improve the healthiness of foodchoices in analyses of our online experiment. Remarkably, within our study population,consumers with high self-efficacy and a relative low intention to eat healthily(compared to others in our study) appeared to consult less information on energy, salt,sugar, and saturated fat. This could mean that some health-conscious consumers areoverconfident in their ability to make healthy choices. These findings jointly buildfurther on existing food choice models, and can help decision makers in public healthand food industry to understand better the complex process of food choices, especiallyin those consumers who already have an intention to eat healthily.In the general discussion of this dissertation (Chapter 6), a summary and integrationof all the (main) findings of the preceding chapter is presented. Methodological issuesare discussed, recommendations for future research and practice are given, and ageneral conclusion was drawn. We particularly focused on the role of outcomeexpectancies, nutrition literacy, and self-efficacy in food choices – which are oftenresearched in other food choice studies. Self-efficacy, in this respect, might act as adouble-edged sword. On the one hand, self-efficacy appears to operate on theformation of intentions to eat healthily, and thus in healthy food choices. On the otherhand, based on data from our study with consumers who had a high intention to eathealthily, complex food choices might not benefit from an increased self-efficacy – aspeople can become overconfident and omit to use nutrition information. These individuals might rely too much on the nutrition knowledge and beliefs that theyalready have, and make their (wrong) choices without using all available information.This needs further study.For further theory building, we recommend to replicate our studies in Chapter 4 andChapter 5 in a broad population, which does not have a high intention to eat healthily, apopulation of low-SES consumers, and a population of adolescents. Using data fromthese replication studies, new analyses can be conducted on the precise nutritioninformation attributes that these individuals consider – related to their psychosocialcharacteristics – to better understand their food choices. For practice, we argue thatfood industry should take responsibility in their role in the metabolic syndromeepidemic and use our findings to reformulate products, for instance by gradually limiting the amount of fat and added sugars in products to reduce energy density. We conclude that consumers now have access to a vast wealth of (mis)information,affecting their appetite and food choices. From both a practical and theoreticalperspective, we need to further build our understanding how this information can be optimally used to promote healthy food choices.",

      "abstract": "Regardless the amount of energy and macronutrients intake, many behaviors related to diet has healthy impact on body weight. The effect of behaviors related to diet on body weight was discussed in the review as managing these behaviors may help to maintain healthy weight. These behaviors are increase meal frequency, controlling snack, choose good time of meal, eating meals at regular time, eating at home, choose low dense food, decrease portion size, and eating slowly. So, modifying behaviors related to diet is a way to maintain healthy body weight even if the content of the diet is same. These behaviors should be considered in dietary recommendation for obese persons.",

      "abstract": "A 50,000-60,000 new cases of Parkinson’s disease are diagnosed each year in the United States, adding to the one million people who currently have Parkinson’s. It has been estimated that 7-10 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson’s. The good news is that my diagnosis explains all of the health issues I’ve had for the past three years. The bad news is that I’ve been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. My symptoms are made better when I am not cold, not under undue stress, and have adequate sleep. My simple analogy about Parkinson’s and dopamine is like a car with a fuel tank leak. You constantly are low on fuel (dopamine) so you are always adding fuel back (dopamine agonist), yet you never have a full tank. My life now is balancing fuel consumption (use of a dopamine agonist plus remaining dopamine) with factors that accelerate dopamine (fuel) consumption. Everyone with Parkinson’s expresses his or her disease differently, it’s very unique, but I remain dedicated to slowing the progression. My strategy for treating Parkinson’s goes as follows: Dopamine Agonist; Isradipine; Complementary and Alternative Medicine (lots of supplements); Stretching and Exercise; Meditation; Deeptissue massage; LSVT Loud; LSVT Big; and playing Golf. For those of us with Parkinson’s, we remain hopeful for new treatments, advances and one day ahead, a cure. But for now, we use courage and determination, mixed with a will to survive, and all held together by glue we call hope. Overall, I’m doing my best navigating life with Parkinson’s",

Whether you're in the mountains or at the beach, staying active during your holiday is essential, especially if you have diabetes.

      "abstract": "Diet composition can play a role in obesity treatment because it can influence energy intake and nutrient balance. The greatest potential effect of diet composition occurs not during weight reduction but during maintenance of a reduced body weight. During weight reduction, the extent of negative energy balance is the greatest determinant of the amount and rate of weight loss, and any effects of diet composition are likely to be very small. Conversely, during the maintenance period after weight reduction, maintenance energy requirements are reduced and the rate of fat oxidation may be low. Prevention of fat storage and regain of body weight can be achieved either by increasing fat oxidation (for example, by increasing exercise) or by reducing the fat content of the habitual diet. The treatment with the greatest chance for success combines a reduced-fat diet with aerobic exercise.",

Main factors contributing to lifestyle disorders include filthy food habits, physical inactivity, and disturbed biological clock. All of this leads to poor health, decreased immunity leading to easy susceptibility to different diseases. Ayurveda is an old age practice of healing. It not only aims at the treatment of disease but also the maintenance of health of a healthy person as the Prayojana of Ayurveda itself is “Swasthasya swasthya rakshanam aaturasya vikarprashmanam ch”. It can be achieved by Dhatusamya. Now a day’s not only India but western countries are also recognizing the importance of fasting. Langhana (complete fasting or light diet) plays major role in this by increasing the digestive fire and helps in digestion of Ama. It gives sufficient time to the body to complete the process of digestion. It is like load shedding in which new food is not introduced and digestive fire i.e, Agni gets sufficient time to digest Ama. It plays a major role in boosting immune system and longevity of life.

      "title": "Reducing the costs of alcohol in the workplace: the case for employer policies",
      "abstract": "More than 90% of the UK workforce drink alcohol and as many as 30% of male employees and 23% of female employees could be consuming quantities above ‘safe limits’. Survey results also indicate that the vast majority of dependent drinkers are in employment, Current evidence suggests that alcohol consumption, in or out of work time, can result in lower productivity, increased absenteeism and sickness absence, and increased accident rates. The annual value of industrial days lost though alcohol consumption in the UK since 1987 is estimated to be over £1.7 billion, excluding the value of lost productivity, accidents and injury. Alcohol acts as a depressant, impairing reasoning, memory, perception, balance and coordination skills even at very moderate levels of consumption. Physical and intellectual ability decline as more alcohol is consumed either at work or at leisure. In the longer run, continued consumption can lead to disease, emotional and social problems, chronic illness and even premature death. Because the majority of drinkers are in employment, these effects will have an impact in the workplace. Some adverse consequences at work are related to excessive alcohol misuse by a minority of employees, but most are associated with the moderate but inappropriate drinking behaviour of the majority. Existing evidence implies that alcohol is involved in at least one fifth of all UK industrial accidents. The probability of an accident increases six fold for the average man who has consumed two pints of beer, and risk-taking behaviour increases and decision making skills decrease even with low levels of consumption. One in ten men and one in twenty women report feelings the effects of a hangover at work and in one UK study, a quarter of all of the men interviewed reported regular lunchtime drinking. Up to 60% of USA corporations have introduced formal workplace policies of different types in order to reduce employment costs associated with alcohol consumption. However, less than 20% of UK firms have taken similar action. Workplace policies are designed to identify problem drinkers at an early stage and to provide treatment, avoiding the need for disciplinary procedures. Although many USA studies have shown workplace policies to be cost-effective, some studies report conflicting results using different definitions of successful outcome and policy goals. Many studies suffer from statistical defects and the poor definition of appropriate policy goals. The economic case for increasing the number and type of workplace policies in the UK cannot be confirmed without a consistent framework for evaluating cost-efficiency. Evidence of employment costs associated with alcohol consumption are examined in this paper and the need for further information identified. A framework for evaluating costs and benefits is outlined as a basis for future policy discussion, and the economic evaluation of alcohol workplace policies in the UK.",

Die Formuladiät ist einfach herzustellen und die wirksamste Maßnahme zur Gewichtsreduktion. Bei einem partiellen Mahlzeitenersatz zur Gewichtsreduktion werden täglich zwei Mahlzeiten durch Formula ersetzt. Eine verbleibende Mahlzeit aus natürlichen Nahrungsmitteln erlaubt Flexibilität und Variabilität, Teilnahme am familiären und gesellschaftlichen Leben. Nach der gewünschten Gewichtsabnahme kann durch Ersatz nur noch einer Mahlzeit durch Formula neuerlichem Gewichtsanstieg begegnet werden.

      "abstract": "People whose professional activity is associated with high energy consumption have a completely different lifestyle, unusual for the average person engaged in mental activity. They are directly related to one thing in common - high levels of physical activity. This leads to a large expenditure of the body's own energy and the breakdown of muscle tissue. To maintain the optimal state of a person during a period of intense activity, it is necessary to replenish energy costs in order to avoid the development of an extreme state, which is characterized by a severe state of the body, which develops under the influence of extreme emergency factors of the external and internal environments and is characterized by significant disorders of the body's vital functions. The article discusses issues related to rations for people with increased physical activity in extreme situations. Despite the fact that on the food market for people with increased physical activity there is a wide range of various snacks that are part of pocket and dry rations, one of the important tasks is to develop a modern food product that provides an increase in nutritional value. The existing rations are of insufficient nutritional value. The solution to this problem is possible through new technologies. The most promising are finely ground mixtures of various vegetables and fruits in combination with grain products. The creation of a new product in the form of a mixture for biscuits will expand the range of functional products and increase the profit of enterprises, since sales of such products in 2019 amounted to 274 billion rubles, which is 16 billion rubles more than in 2018. Biscuits from a multicomponent mixture with a high-grade protein in the composition will allow you to quickly restore the energy consumption of highly active people.",

      "abstract": "Successful long-term weight loss maintenance can be achieved by various means. A combination of dietary and physical activity interventions, along with one or more behavioral approaches, has proven successful in some persons, as documented by the National Weight Control Registry, but is limited by adherence to a consistent weight loss regimen. Successful approaches to weight loss maintenance include consulting with a physician, nutritionist, or another support source; adhering to a stable diet with a limited variety of food; monitoring weight; eating breakfast; and exercising regularly. Long-term pharmacologic treatments for weight loss maintenance have been studied and were found to have modest success, with some weight regain typically reported. Sibutramine and orlistat are the two medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration with the potential to help patients achieve long-term weight loss maintenance. Bariatric surgery is another modality for accomplishing successful long-term weight loss maintenance in patients with morbid or complicated obesity. Its success is due in large part to better weight loss outcomes, more successful long-term weight loss maintenance, and remission of comorbid medical conditions.",

Specific breakfast strategies such as certain types of breakfast, and consuming more calories in the morning relative to the evening, however, may produce greater weight loss.The act of eating breakfast, compared to skipping it, does not appear to have a large impact on body weight. More specific strategies regarding the size and type of breakfast may be required for a substantial effect on weight loss, and improving glycemic regulation may be an important reason to consume breakfast rather than skipping it.",

      "abstract": "Attualmente, l’obesita rappresenta uno dei maggiori disordini nutrizionali. Uno degli interventi in grado di contrastare questa patologia e rappresentato dalla restrizione calorica che genera una riduzione del peso che risulta difficile da mantenere in quanto il peso perso tende ad essere generalmente riguadagnato, al termine della restrizione, poiche in risposta alla restrizione calorica si manifesta un decremento adattativo della spesa energetica dell’intero organismo in parte attribuibile ad un incremento dell’efficienza metabolica. \nLa spesa energetica si riduce per un periodo di tempo che e piu lungo rispetto al periodo della perdita di peso, infatti questa riduzione adattativa della termogenesi, che induce l’organismo a risparmiare energia durante la restrizione calorica, persiste anche durante il periodo di rialimentazione e comporta un rapido recupero dei depositi di grasso. Tale meccanismo di conservazione dell’energia, che probabilmente si e evoluto come una risposta adattativa alla sopravvivenza in periodi con limitata disponibilita di cibo, e considerato un importante fattore che contribuisce al fallimento della maggior parte dei regimi dietetici nelle terapie dimagranti. \nLa ridotta spesa energetica e la soppressione adattativa della termogenesi indotte dalla restrizione calorica vengono fuori dai cambiamenti nei singoli organi e tessuti maggiormente coinvolti nel mantenimento del metabolismo corporeo, che sono il muscolo scheletrico e il fegato. Per cui lo scopo della tesi e stato quello di valutare il ruolo del fegato nella soppressione della termogenesi che guida il recupero di grasso durante la rialimentazione dopo un periodo di restrizione calorica. \nIn particolare sono stati valutati gli effetti di una restrizione calorica, gli effetti di un periodo di rialimentazione isocalorica in seguito ad un periodo di restrizione calorica e infine, gli effetti di una rialimentazione ad alto contenuto lipidico per simulare gli effetti degli odierni pasti ad alto contenuto energetico utilizzando due diverse diete iperlipidiche: una dieta iperlipidica ricca in acidi grassi saturi, e una dieta iperlipidica ricca in acidi grassi polinsaturi.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Although there are many negative reports on coffee consumption and the occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF), several factors are involved in the metabolism of caffeine, and it is possible that the response to caffeine changes with age. We present a case in which Apple Watch was useful in detecting very brief paroxysmal AF that was thought to be triggered by coffee consumption. Case summary The patient was a man in his early 60s. He often drank a cup of coffee after breakfast. At some point, after drinking coffee and commuting to work, he noticed palpitations. He got an Apple Watch, and when he recorded his electrocardiogram when the symptoms occurred, he found that he had AF. During the following month, the frequency of AF was examined in relation to whether coffee was consumed in the morning. Twenty days of 28 days, coffee was consumed, and of these, AF was observed on 8 days (40%). In the 8 days when he did not drink coffee, there was no AF. For the next 28 days, the coffee was changed to decaffeinated coffee and the frequency of AF was examined. AF was observed on 5 of the 24 days when decaffeinated coffee was consumed (21%). AF did not occur on the 4 days when decaffeinated coffee was not consumed. Discussion These results may indicate that AF was significantly more common on days when coffee was consumed. In the case of frequent but short-lasting AF, it is worth considering whether coffee consumption may be a trigger.",

Body water content drops and fat content increases so, because alcohol is more soluble in water, older people tend to have higher blood alcohol concentration for any given dose. There is also evidence that ageing impairs the body’s ability to deal with alcohol. Despite this, moderate alcohol has been found to have a protective effect for the cardiovascular system. This study examined levels of cognitive function, subjective well- being and depressive symptoms associated with different levels of alcohol consumption. The authors found significant positive effects on recall and numerical reasoning, improved subjective well-being and fewer depressive symptoms in older people who consume moderate (up to two drinks a day) levels of alcohol when compared with people who have never taken or have given up alcohol.",

Young people make a lot of effort and energy to achieve and maintain the ideals of beauty, not only by rational methods, such as sports, nutrition, personal care, but also with the help of destructive actions, such as restrictive eating behavior, excessive control of their weight and meal. Such actions have anti-vital character. Anti-vital behavior of young people has become an increasingly widespread problem of society. The formation of an anti-vital motif has been traced on the example of anorexia that defines pathological behavior. An important role is played by self-regulation as the ability to manage activities, plan it, and respond flexibly to changing environmental conditions. The study of young girls at the age that is most susceptible to pathological changes of personality is conducted. The article deals with results of a study of self-control violations at different stages of development of anorexia in young women. Pathological changes in motivation under restrictive eating behavior is found, which gradually demonstrates anti-vital character to women. The relation of specific distortions motivation (anti-vital motive activity) and disorders of self-control activities to limit food intake as the major mental disorders anorexia is identified.",

I have met very few people who actively want to put on weight, and they have almost all been of athletic disposition, and the weight gain sought is usually (but not always) in terms of muscle. Some people are entirely 'fat-phobic' and not persuaded that some types of body fat might actually be good, healthy even. Many people don't know that there are different types of fat deposit, and that some deposits of fatness carry limited or no negative health consequences – around the buttocks, hips and thighs, for example.

We discuss the historical context of one of the most popular food hypes: weight-loss diets based on carbohydrate reduction. Supporters of these low-carbohydrate diets claim that they suppress appetite, increase energy expenditure, stimulate fat loss and are superior to other diets in terms of weight loss. We checked these claims against the available scientific evidence and put them into context of a whole-foods based approach. Studies show that low-carbohydrate diets are no more effective than other energy-restricted diets for weight loss. Furthermore, few popular weight-loss hypes are successful in the long term. We propose that the focus on macronutrients is counterproductive in efforts to promote a healthy diet and sustained weight loss.",

Life has to do with maintaining the functions of biological systems.  Organisms must be healthy to maintain their life. Health is a perfect working condition of the body. Disease is a divergence from normal physiological conditions of the organism in question. The cause of most diseases can be traced to physiology and its effect on humans. Obesity is one of the contemporary diseases that are psychologically tied. For this reason, some clinical applications have been used, including exercise, diet and some surgical methods. However, alternative remedies are been applied and they include herbal therapy, hunger, aromatherapy, musical, color and magnet therapies, yoga and acupuncture amongst others for one to stay healthy. The above examples are referred to as naturopathy. Hunger is a psychological stimulus and not a pathological condition. When the glycogen level in the liver or glucose in the blood falls below a ratio, this is usually followed by a desire to eat. The often unpleasant feeling originates in the hypothalamus. Hunger is seen in different religions of the world as a rule.  Hunger, as a cure or remedy to diseases, has been used at different times because of its numerous advantages. In some cases, hunger makes one to be contented, and patient with life; it also brings about good health, as staying hungry can help one to fight against obesity.

Een verslechterde eetlust bij kinderen met kanker is geassocieerd met ondervoeding en gewichtsverlies en als zodanig met een grotere kans op complicaties en een verlaagde kans op overleving. De verschillende bijwerkingen van de intensieve behandeling – zoals orale mucositis, misselijkheid en smaakveranderingen – dragen sterk bij aan verslechterde voedselinname. Misselijkheid induceert het aanleren van langdurige voedselaversies. Een dergelijke aversie voor reguliere maaltijden kan eenvoudig worden voorkomen. Smaakvervlakking lijkt een acuut effect te zijn van verschillende cytostatica en wordt als belangrijkste oorzaak van eetproblemen beschouwd door patienten zelf. Verder lijken kinderen die genezen van kanker vaak permanente smaakdisfunctie te hebben.",

The most effective weight loss intervention is one that includes a moderately reduced-calorie diet, increased physical activity, and the use of behavior strategies to facilitate adherence. The goal should be a modest weight loss of 5% to 10% that can be maintained long term. Although individual studies have identified specific benefits associated with certain diets, no diet has been shown to be more effective than another. For substantial health benefits, adults should engage in at least 150 to 300 min/week of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 min/week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity. Effective behavior strategies include the combination of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior therapy. Other strategies include removal of environmental trigger foods, self distraction to help with cravings and boredom eating, and planning ahead. It is critical that children and adolescents avoid dieting or other consciously restrictive behaviors because these have been associated with weight gain and binge eating. Rather than weight, discussions with children and adolescents should focus on achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Physical activity should be encouraged from childhood through young adulthood.",

      "title": "Managing unhealthy alcohol use in general practice",
      "abstract": "WHAT IS UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE?Unhealthy alcohol use is an umbrella term that encompasses a spectrum of behaviours, ranging from risky drinking to alcohol use disorder. (1)Risky alcohol use is defined as: binge drinking, heavy drinking, or any alcohol use by pregnant women or those under 21 years of age. (2)Alcohol use disorder is categorised by severity according to the number of criteria present (Fig. 1). (3)Mild alcohol use disorder is broadly equivalent to alcohol abuse, while moderate and severe alcohol use disorder are broadly equivalent to alcohol dependence, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition). Local recommendationsIn Singapore, the maximum recommended alcohol intake is two standard drinks per day for men and one standard drink per day for women. (4)Definitions of a standard drink vary internationally.In Singapore, one standard drink is equivalent to 10 g of pure alcohol (Fig. 2) compared to 14 g in the United States.The United Kingdom defines one unit as 8 g of pure alcohol. (5)nother useful way of calculating alcohol intake is by using the following formula: (6) number of standard drinks = amount of drink (in litres) × alcohol by volume (%) × 0.789 (density of ethanol at room temperature).For example, for a 500-mL bottle of beer that is 5% alcohol by volume, the number of standard drinks it contains is: 0.5 × 5 × 0.789 = 1.97 standard drinks. HOW COMMON IS THIS IN MY PRACTICE?According to the Singapore Mental Health Study 2016, 4.1% and 0.5% of the population suffer from alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, respectively, at some point in their lifetime.Those who were more likely to have alcohol use disorders were male, aged 18-34 years, of lower education attainment and employed.Among all people with a mental disorder who sought help, 20% presented to a general practitioner. (7)he prevalence of binge drinking, in particular, is a rapidly growing problem, with a prevalence of 13.7% in 2016.Male and younger individuals (aged 18-34 years) were more likely to binge drink. (8)Underage drinking is also a problem, with a World Health Organization study from 2004 demonstrating that 73.5% of males and 64.5% of females aged 15-19 years drank alcohol. (9)",

      "abstract": "Sugar consumption activates the mesocorticolimbic system in a very similar way to substance abuse. But if all addictions initially start with a feeling of pleasure, as in the case of highly palatable foods and sugar rich diets, then why should I abandon something that makes me feel good? And then why does one continue to abuse food despite the negative consequences. There are various ways to deal with the different addictions. However, the problem with sugar addiction, or even more generally with food addiction, is that there is no awareness that the relationship with food can represent an addiction in some cases, and the tools are lacking to identify the most suitable professional figures to help manage the situation when needed. Therefore, the approach to the problem must be multidisciplinary. A methodology based on three fundamental elements is proposed: 1. Training the patient with regard to her/his addiction, providing objective and scientific information, 2. Providing the patient with the right tools, i.e. ‘know-how’, 3. Preventing relapses. Our patients’ stories report how they have learned to manage their emotional needs without escaping, to observe their thoughts by recognising their distortions, to identify what triggers their spasmodic desire for food and understand their behaviour in depth, and to connect better with themselves and others, also sharing the painful emotions along the way!

Maintenance of normal body mass may be effective in the prevention of infertility resulting from ovulatory disorders. Underweight and, to a larger degree, overweight and/or obesity, are related to the enhanced risk of infertility. Insulin resistance is an important pathogenic mechanism that may impair ovulation. Adequate intake of monounsaturated fatty acids, derived mainly from vegetable fats, as well as avoidance of trans isomers of unsaturated fatty acids which are present in industrially produced cakes and sweets, crisps, fast-foods, powdered soups and hard margarines, may be effective in the prevention of infertility in females. Choice of plant rather than animal sources of proteins, decrease in glycemic load of the diet, use of dietary supplements containing iron and folic acid, could also be beneficial. Avoidance of vitamin B12 deficiency and its supplementation seem to be important in the prevention of early miscarriages. Sufficient intake of antioxidants also promotes female reproductive functions. Free radical processes play an important role in the development of male factor infertility. It was shown that proper intake or supplementation with antioxidants may be effective in its prevention and treatment. Such nutrients as zinc, selenium and folic acid act beneficially on sperm quality. A well-balanced diet seems to play an important role in the prevention of infertility in both sexes.",

Energy requirements are therefore often assessed by measuring energy intakes. Intakes of protein, however, are no measure of protein requirements and the amounts customarily taken in Western diets are considerably more than man needs. The requirements for calcium are difficult to assess, for they are affected not only by age, but by other constituents of the diet, by the time of year, by individual peculiarities and by the previous intake. There is a physiological loss of calcium from the body starting in middle age which is not prevented by a high calcium intake.",

      "abstract": "A key feature of physical activity is that it results in an increased rate of energy expenditure and, as a result of metabolic inefficiencies that lead to high heat production, an increase in the requirement to dissipate the added heat through sweat.  Nevertheless, surveys commonly find that athletes fail to optimally satisfy both energy and fluid needs, causing them to perform at levels below their conditioned capacities.  To some extent this problem results from an excess reliance on the sensations of ‘hunger’ and ‘thirst’ to guide energy and fluid intakes, but there are also common misunderstandings of the best eating strategies for achieving optimal body composition and performance.  The need to improve the strength-to-weight ratio to enable an enhanced ability to overcome sport-related resistance can be misinterpreted as a need to be ‘small’, which may result in an under-consumption of energy through restrained eating and special ‘diets’.  The outcome, however, is nearly always the precise opposite of the desired effect, with lower strength-to-weight ratios that result in an ever-increasing downward spiral in energy and fluid consumption.  This paper focuses on within-day energy balance eating and drinking strategies that are now successfully followed by many elite-level athletes.  These strategies can help athletes avoid the common errors of under-consumption while simultaneously improving both body composition and performance.",

Although there is a large population of unsuccessful suicide attempts and the same patients are often admitted repeatedly, little investigation has been done to understand this group. 2. Prescription drugs were almost always used in overdose attempts. There was no indication that physicians successfully intervened in preventing abuse of prescribed medication among patients with a history of overdose suicide attempt. 3. Most people choose a method for suicide and repeatedly use the same method (physical versus overdose). The majority of repeat attempts occurred among young people, and alcohol use was especially high when physical methods were used. Identification of these trends could lead to effective intervention.",

Bu bileşenler, iş performansında belirgin bir düşüşe, genel mutsuzluğa, çatışmalara ve işten ayrılmaya neden olabilmektedir. Diyetisyenler bireylerin sağlıklı beslenme ve diyet programlarını yöneten, beslenme ile ilişkili sağlık problemleri ile başa çıkan sağlık profesyonelleridir. Tükenmişlik sendromu, diyetisyenlerde iş yükü, duygusal talepler ve mesleki stres gibi faktörlerden dolayı yaygın görülen bir durumdur. Diyetisyenlik mesleği duygusal bir yük barındırdığı için hastaların beklentilerini karşılarken ve hastaların sağlık durumlarını yönetirken diyetisyenler tükenmişlik riski ile karşı karşıya kalabilmektedir. Ayrıca yapılan çalışmalarda iş yükü, çalışma saatleri ve çalışma ortamları gibi faktörlerin de diyetisyenlerde mesleki tükenmişliğe yol açtığı görülmüştür. Tükenmişlik sendromuna maruz kalan diyetisyenlerin, iş ve sosyal yaşamları olumsuz yönde etkilenmektedir. Bu durum diyetisyenlerin mesleki sorumluluklarını yerine getirmede problemlere yol açabilmektedir. Tükenmişliğin sağlık hizmetleri üzerindeki olumsuz etkilerini azaltmak, diyetisyenlerin mesleki refahını artırmak ve sağlık hizmetlerinin kalitesini iyileştirmek gerekmektedir. Sonuç olarak, diyetisyenlerin tükenmişlik yaşama olasılığı yüksektir ve bu durumun kapsamlı bir şekilde araştırılması, hem bireysel hem de kurumsal düzeyde iyileştirici önlemler geliştirilmesine yardımcı olabilecektir. Bu derlemede profesyonel tükenmişlik sendromunun kavramsal çerçevesi, değerlendirme envanterleri ve diyetisyenler özelinde tükenmişlik sendromuna ilişkin farklı ülkelerde yapılan güncel çalışma sonuçları sunulmuştur.",

Here we attempt to help correct this situation by reviewing, in non-technical, plain English, how cereal grains-the world's most abundant food source-can affect human behavior and mental health. We present the implications for the psychological sciences of the findings that, in all of us, bread (1) makes the gut more permeable and can thus encourage the migration of food particles to sites where they are not expected, prompting the immune system to attack both these particles and brain-relevant substances that resemble them, and (2) releases opioid-like compounds, capable of causing mental derangement if they make it to the brain. A grain-free diet, although difficult to maintain (especially for those that need it the most), could improve the mental health of many and be a complete cure for others.",

L’évaluation de l’état corporel est une priorité. S’il n’est pas optimal, il faut revoir l’alimentation. Cela nécessite l’adhésion du propriétaire et doit être expliqué comme faisant partie intégrante du traitement. Dans tous les cas, il est souhaitable de vérifier que l’aliment est équilibré et le besoin protéique couvert. De manière à soulager la douleur liée à l’inflammation qui peut s’installer avec l’arthrose, l’ajout de source d’acides gras omega 3 à chaine longue, EPA et DHA, à dose suffisante et en routine, est à recommander sous forme de capsules, dont le contenu est ajouté à un petit repas.",

      "abstract": "The science of nutrition encompasses all the interactions that occur between living organisms and the nutrients in food. Since food choice affects multiple aspects of health including physical and mental performance and the ability to battle illness, deal with stress, and prevent disease, the importance of an adequate or perhaps optimal nutritional intake should not be underestimated. Eating a variety of foods is the key to good nutrition and to providing different textures, flavors, colors, and odors, which are all important components of food. The pyramid also promotes choosing nutrient-dense foods meaning that there is a relatively rich supply of nutrients in comparison with energy content. Foods like salad dressings, cream, butter, margarine, sugars, soft drinks, and colas, candies, and sweet deserts, along with alcoholic beverages, may tantalize the taste buds but when consumed in excess, can wreak havoc on a balanced diet.",

Children are at greater risk for dehydration than adults due to their higher surface-to-mass ratio. Additionally, children have different thirst sensitivities and body cooling mechanisms than adults. Children differ from adults in total body water content, and boys and girls differ in body water content with maturation. Research in young adults shows that mild dehydration corresponding to only 1% to 2% of body weight loss can lead to significant impairment in cognitive function. Dehydration in infants is associated with confusion, irritability, and lethargy; in children, it may produce decrements in cognitive performance.",

They have different attributes and actions. Therefore, they have both useful and harmful effects. If taken inappropriately, alcohol produces poisoning effects like moha or unconsciousness. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a medical condition characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences. In ayurveda intake of alcoholism is not prohibited but some rules &amp; regulations have been laid down to reap the benefits and avoid ill effects of alcohol consumption.",

Mehr Chance wird der Verhältnisprävention eingeräumt, die Lebensbedingungen schaffen sollte, unter denen ein günstiges Ess‐ und ein aktiveres Bewegungsverhalten leichter fallen. Dazu könnte eine Optimierung der Speisenangebote in den öffentlichen Küchen ein wichtiger Schritt sein, wenn gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen für die Realisierung sorgen.",

Werden die Ayurveda-Empfehlungen eingehalten, kommt es bei der Patientin zu einer zügigen Verbesserung der Reizdarmsymptomatik.

Concurrent‐schedule contrast occurred in the responding reinforced by food when alcohol reinforcers were removed. It also occurred in the responding reinforced by alcohol when food was removed. Multiple‐schedule contrast appeared for food when alcohol reinforcers were removed, but not for alcohol when food was removed. These results show that behavioral contrast may, but does not always, occur across qualitatively different reinforcers. They also show that multiple‐schedule contrast may be more difficult to produce than concurrent‐schedule contrast. The results have implications for a model of alcohol consumption.",

It has been claimed that diet regimes developed for this purpose will enable body weight control by stimulating a variety of mechanisms that increase satiety. The most popular of these diets are the ones that recommend the reduction of carbohydrate intake. Practices observed in Western societies and often aimed at avoiding high-fat diets promote high intake. There is no general consensus on what is a high diet; but in the food industry, the term protein enriched is used when more than 20% of the total energy comes from protein. High-protein diets in body weight loss studies often indicate diets in which 30% of the energy is obtained from protein. In this article, the effects of high-protein diets on the short and long-term changes in body weight and body composition, the body weight regain after loss, and the potential side effects (risk of cardiovascular disease, blood pressure and blood lipids, gastrointestinal effects, antioxidant status) are examined.",

Among all the so-called ‘secrets’, people are most curious about what they eat and how they eat to look that stunning. Compared to tiring gym sessions and boring lectures about anatomy and physiology, a brand-new revolutionary recipe is far more appealing. The trendy recipes are beneficial to some people who have special needs such as those who are obese, type-II diabetes patients, people who suffer from cardiovascular diseases, etc. Such recipes greatly altered the proportions of the different essential nutrients to improve some symptoms that are occurring due to an imbalance of nutrition. However, such a diet may be beneficial to the human body in the short run by adjusting the daily calorie intake and controlling the categories of food in each sitting, in the long run, it would lead to another malfunction of the body due to nutrition imbalance.",

      "title": "Is vegan diet advisable for children?",
      "abstract": "Vegan diet (VD) is a diet that consists of only plant based foods. This diet completely excludes all animal products; meat, fish, poultry and also food gotten from milk, oil and honey. Vegan diet differs from vegetarian diet, although they are similar; some vegetarian include egg (ovo vegetarians), milk from animals (lacto vegetarians) or fish (pescovegetarian) in their diet. VD is believed to be healthier than diets containing animal produce and generally have a higher diet quality than non-vegan diets. VD has many health benefits and may also reduce the risk of certain conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer. However, these benefits seen in adults may not be the same case for toddlers and young children. Their diet directly affects their height, weight and also psychomotor and neurocognitive development. VD may not supply all the nutrients necessary for development and may lead to nutrient deficiency. Vegan children are at a risk of insufficient supply and deficiency of some critical nutrients such as protein, long chain fatty acids, cholesterol, iron, zinc, iodine, calcium, and vitamin A, B12 and D. Deficiency of these nutrients could lead to various developmental and sometimes irreversible disorders. Apart from nutrition, VD also seems to alter the metabolomics and gut microbiota constitution of a vegan. Overall VD may have health benefits for children if it is properly fortified and supplemented. VD in children will also have to be carefully monitored to ensure the diet is healthy, nutritious and promote healthy growth and development.

Echte Nährstoffmängel sind heute jedoch nur noch selten zu beobachten und auch Futtermittelallergien sind viel seltener, als die Verdachtsdiagnose gestellt wird. Beweisend für eine echte Allergie ist erst der positive Provokationstest im Anschluss an eine erfolgreiche Eliminationsdiät (erneute Hautreaktionen nach Fütterung des „verdächtigen“ Futterbestandteils).

      "title": "Restriktive Flüssigkeitszufuhr in der Terminalphase kann Leiden reduzieren",
      "abstract": "Das Für und Wider von künstlicher Ernährung inkl. Flüssigkeitszufuhr am Lebensende ist häufig Quelle von Auseinandersetzungen. Leiden Sterbende unter Hunger, weil sie nicht mehr essen – muss man sie also künstlich ernähren, spüren Sterbende Atemnot, weil sie aufhören zu atmen – muss man sie also künstlich beatmen? Vergleichbares kann zum Durst ausgeführt werden, weiß man doch schon lange, dass künstliche Flüssigkeitszufuhr zumeist nicht geeignet ist, den Durst zu löschen [6]. Auf jeden Fall wird in diesen Situationen unabhängig von einer künstlichen Flüssigkeitszufuhr immer die konsequente und phantasievolle Mundpflege notwendig sein: So können etwa Sprühflaschen benutzt werden und kleine Eisstücke aus dem Lieblingsgetränk in den Mund gelegt werden [5]. Als Nachteile einer künstlichen Flüssigkeitszufuhr werden etwa die Zunahme von Ödemen, die Abhängigkeit von Pflegepersonal oder Ärzten oder die Verlängerung des Todesrasselns genannt [5, 7]. Todesrasseln und Atemnot sind die häufigsten belastenden Symptome in der Finalphase [6]. In einer Auswertung von 57 Sterbebegleitungen im Hospiz St. Hildegard, Bochum, aus dem Jahr 2004 wurde in keinem Fall ein Todesrasseln über mehr als 12 Stunden beobachtet, wenn entsprechend dem Patientenwillen allenfalls eine geringe künstliche Flüssigkeitszufuhr bei sorgfältiger Mundpflege erfolgte. Nur bei 8 Gästen (14%) trat überhaupt ein Todesrasseln auf. Bei 5 Gästen (63%) dieser Gruppe war eine ärztliche Symptomkontrolle aufgrund objektiver Stresszeichen (z.B. fahrige Armbewegungen, Schwitzen, Stöhnen, Tränenlaufen) notwendig. Demgegenüber erfolgte nur bei 8 von 49 Gästen ohne dieses Symptom ein ärztliches Eingreifen in der Sterbephase (16%). Die Dauer des Todesrasselns wird mit durchschnittlich 57 Stunden angegeben [2], Angaben zur Inzidenz variieren zwischen 23–80% [4, 7]. Während die Sterbephase unter Exsikkose von Beobachtern durchweg als nicht qualvoll und friedlich beschrieben wird, erzeugt das mitunter laute Todesrasseln nicht nur bei Angehörigen und Pflegenden den Anschein eines qualvollen Todeskampfes, oft ergeben sich hier aus palliativmedizinischer Sicht objektive Zeichen des Stresses, die einer invasiven Symptomkontrolle bedürfen. Eine unbefriedigende Symptomkontrolle trotz Therapie wird bei ca. 30% dieser Patienten angegeben [3]. Aktuelle palliativmedizinische Literatur empfiehlt letztlich die künstliche Flüssigkeitszufuhr bei Verdacht auf das Vorliegen einer behandelbaren Störung (z.B. Verwirrung infolge Dehydratation. Ohne Symptome wird lediglich der Einsatz einer phantasievollen Mundpflege empfohlen [1, 5]. Dies können wir anhand unserer Erfahrungen bestätigen. Voraussetzung für jede Entscheidung am Lebensende sind die konsequente Behandlung sämtlicher Symptome und die Aufklärung aller Beteiligten, auch der Angehörigen und Pflegenden.",

They are aware of all the possible side effects (nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation etc.) but they still want to lose weight. Now, Ozempic is being looked at for the possible effect of reducing drinking; alcohol is high in calories, after all, and there's not much in it that's actually good for you (unlike food, which you need to survive). Now, people have found that when they take the drug to eat less and lose weight, they also lose their taste for alcohol, or at least for drinking a lot of it. Ozempic is a diabetes drug; Wegovy is a weight‐loss drug, but both contain the same active ingredient — semaglutide — which makes people feel satisfied after eating. Questions such as whetherthese drugs reduce the capacity for pleasure, a side effect of naltrexone for some patients, do not appear to be an issue. They do, however, reduce the capacity to enjoy eating, as they are intended to do.",

This is due to the prevalent view that appetite cannot be trusted as a guide to the proper selection of foods. Results of experiments on rats using the self-selection technic indicate, on the contrary, that a very close relationship exists between appetite and nutritional needs of minerals and vitamins, as well as of fats, carbohydrates and proteins. In human beings there are only a few instances which throw light on the relationship between appetite and dietary needs.

      "abstract": "Alcohol addiction is simply defined as a compulsive need for an intoxicating liquid that is obtained from fermented grain or fruit. These liquids include beer, wine, and other hard liquors. One misconception that many alcoholic and addicts seem to have is that their drinking is not affecting anyone else. Many times they make statements like, “I am not hurting anyone but myself”. There is a great deal of research and a vast amount of anecdotal evidence that the behavior of addicts and alcoholics can affect everyone around them, including family, friends, employers and coworkers. Addicted family members are more likely to be violent or emotionally abusive, and when abuse is not a factor; households affected by addiction can be highly disordered, unstable and unloving. If one have a drinking problem and have children in home, they are being affected, sometimes so profoundly that the effects last their entire life time. The most vulnerable effects of alcoholism or addiction are the children. The children of people with alcohol problems usually suffer greatly. Children of alcoholics have deep-seated psychological and emotional reactions to growing up with an addicted parent. Children of addicts often grow up socially isolated and they tend to develop emotional difficulties and behavioral problems. As they grow up, these type of issues can lead to antisocial behavior, mood disorders, and drug and alcohol abuse. Children of addicts often develop feeling of anger and resentment towards their parents. Therefore alcohol addiction is recognized as significant barriers of the empowerment of children, with the consequences of child's health, their health-seeking behavior and their adaptation of the family norms. Studies have shown that a child may be more likely to follow in footsteps of his parents and have the same addictive behaviors. It is vital that children have a positive and honest relationship with their parents. Those who suffer from alcohol abuse need to seek help immediately in oreder to restore and improve the family relationship. There are many supportive groups and programs available to help those families that are dealing with addiction. the first step is realizing that one drinking has become a problem, and the second step is willing to do something about the problem.",

It is becoming increasingly difficult to define what is a drug (i.e., something that your brain wants or needs in order to function optimally) and what is a food (i.e., something that your body wants or needs in order to function optimally). The contents of your diet will only act upon your brain if in some way they chemically resemble an actual neurotransmitter within the brain, or if they are able to interact with an essential biochemical processes in your brain that influences the production, release, or inactivation of a neurotransmitter. Drugs and the contents of our diet often interact with these processes and alter how you think and feel.

      "title": "Exercise for obesity – how much is enough?",
      "abstract": "Exercise is an important part of weight management, particularly in the long term. However, there is conflicting evidence about how much exercise obese subjects need to perform. Diet, genetic or other factors may contribute to the difference in weight between normal and obese subjects if physical activities are equal between groups. Obese subjects may therefore need to be more active and perform more exercise than their normal weight counterparts in order to lower or maintain their weight. Regarding the amount of exercise, duration has a greater effect on weight loss than intensity. Moderate-intensity exercise is as beneficial as high-intensity exercise for weight loss and, as it appears to be more attractive to obese subjects, leads to a greater adherence to exercise programmes. Preservation of lean body mass is greater when exercise is performed as part of a weight management programme. If diet only is used for weight loss, lean tissue is lost. Combining aerobic and resistance exercise appears to preserve lean tissue, so both types of exercise should be encouraged. Aerobic exercise has a greater effect on weight loss, but resistance exercise could potentially increase lean tissue. High-intensity exercise may spare more lean tissue than moderate exercise, but the benefits of greater adherence of subjects to moderate exercise outweigh those of high-intensity exercise. When barriers to exercise exist, lifestyle changes combined with diet should be advised. In general, obese subjects should be encouraged to start off with lowintensity exercise and gradually progress to a higher level.",

      "abstract": "Beverages containing caffeine are consumed by most people in most countries most days. Consumption is mostly in beverages such as coffee, tea and some soft drinks, and smaller amounts from other foods such as chocolate. Children also consume caffeine, though in smaller amounts even relative to their smaller size. Many questions have been asked about possible health effects of caffeine and have been answered by scientific research. Studies on pregnant women consuming caffeine show no effects on the fetus, infants, or on development followed up to school age. There have been many studies on children of school age. For example, it has been shown that a single dose of 3 mg/kg is without appreciable effect on a variety of behavioral and physiological functions, and even 10 mg/kg, had only minimal effects, within the normal range of differences between the children without caffeine. While newborn infants metabolize caffeine slowly, children from less than 1 year to adolescence metabolize caffeine about twice as fast as non-smoking adults. The numerous studies showing safety of caffeine in adults, combined with the direct studies in children showing they are similar and not more susceptible to caffeine than adults, gives assurance that lifelong consumption of caffeine in foods and beverages, starting in childhood, is without deleterious effects on health.",

      "abstract": "In this study involving 336 urban Chinese adults, more than 40% belong to at least the second generation in Malaysia. The result shows the persistence of several Chinese traditional dietary habits. Almost all the subjects take rice daily and an assortment of noodles weekly. A wide variety of vegetables are consumed frequently. Soup is consumed daily or weekly. Steaming and stir frying are preferred methods of cooking. Majority reported adding salt lightly in cooking, eating little fat on meat, and not adding sugar to tea or coffee, but they use sweetened condensed milk. Urban Malaysian Chinese do not appear to manifest a high‐fat high‐meat diet that is becoming characteristic of rapidly developing countries. Their dietary practices seem to reflect an inclination towards the \"behavioural change\" dietary pattern away from the \"degenerative disease\" pattern according to the concept of nutritional transition as described by Popkin.",

Using a physiological relationship determining calories needed to maintain weight, we simulate the food consumption choices of a representative female over a 30-year period. Results show an individual will periodically choose to diet, but that diet will reduce weight only temporarily. Recurrence of weight gain leads to cyclical dieting, which reduces the trend rate of weight increase. Dieting frequency is shown to depend on decision period length, dieting costs, and habit persistence.",

      "abstract": "Why do so many people try dieting, only to fail? What distinguishes those who succeed from those who do not? Are fat people really any different from thin people? What makes us eat, and how do we stop eating? And how can dieting trigger problems with eating normally? Originally published in 1989, Sara Gilbert discusses these questions in Tomorrow I'll Be Slim, and draws on what is known about the psychology of eating, overeating, and weight control to dispel a number of popular myths about dieting. She shows how unsuccessful dieting can lead to new problems with eating and weight control. She points out that long-term success in slimming has more to do with individual factors such as a dieter's expectations, self-confidence, or social and family circumstances than with 'will-power'; and as much to do with how a diet is managed as with the content of a diet sheet. She suggests ways in which people who want to be slimmer can make a realistic assessment of their need to diet. She explains how individuals who seriously need to lose weight or change the way they eat might draw up effective strategies for themselves and prepare for the inevitable difficulties we all face whenever we try to change old habits. Finally, she addresses the problems of taking the emphasis off dieting and examining our attitudes to a slim figure as the key to happiness itself.",

      "title": "Confusion on All Sides of the Calorie Equation",
      "abstract": "In Brief The high prevalence of overweight and obesity in the United States has increased attention to the importance of balancing calories in and out to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Numerous policy and educational efforts are aimed at helping consumers achieve calorie balance. Still, a calorie disconnect exists as consumers remain largely unaware of personal calorie needs or the relationship between calories and weight management. A key first step in addressing consumers’ calorie confusion may be to familiarize them with their “daily calorie number,” or the amount of calories that are needed to maintain weight, and how that daily calorie number is impacted by physical activity. The need to individualize calorie balance communications is essential, as each person has a unique weight management profile that will be impacted by many factors, including age, physical activity, and desired weight outcome. Whereas some Americans would like to maintain weight and prevent further weight gain, many others would likely benefit from tipping the calorie balance equation to achieve successful weight loss. To effectively communicate calorie balance, it is imperative to examine consumer response to calorie balance communications. Some messages or terminology, although widely accepted by nutrition and health professionals, may not be understood by consumers. The social-ecological model is a useful framework to further examine factors that impact behavior change related to food and physical activity decisions, providing opportunities for future research and initiatives aimed at helping consumers achieve calorie balance. Experts on communications and experts on the science weigh in on how best to clarify some of the confusion about calories.",

His family live in a remote area, two hours’ drive to the nearest compounding pharmacy.

The medications are unpalatable, and his parents are spending up to three hours three times a day, every day, trying to give him his medication. \n\nGiving medications to children who cannot yet swallow tablets or capsules (hereafter referred to collectively as “pills”) is a common problem without a universal solution.

      "abstract": "Sommario L’utilizzo degli integratori è largamente diffuso in occidente e in Italia troviamo il mercato più ampio, con una previsione di vendite di 5 miliardi di euro nel 2025. Le motivazioni all’acquisto sono principalmente la ricerca del benessere psico-fisico o la risposta a specifiche esigenze di salute. Gli integratori sono prodotti destinati a integrare la dieta e fornire sostanze nutritive che mancano o non sono assunte in quantità sufficienti con la sola alimentazione. Tuttavia, il concetto di integrazione è stato esteso a sostanze di cui non abbiamo un reale fabbisogno in condizioni fisiologiche e a dosaggi non più di integrazione, ma farmacologici, causando confusione tra gli operatori e i consumatori. Gli integratori, se usati senza controllo, possono comportare rischi per la salute. In particolare, la potenziale tossicità dei nutrienti e degli integratori è un concetto spesso dimenticato, nonostante nei Livelli di Assunzione di Riferimento di Nutrienti (LARN) per la popolazione italiana sia definito per ogni nutriente il livello massimo tollerabile di assunzione. La scarsità di studi sistematici sugli effetti avversi degli integratori, che possono essere immessi sul mercato senza il supporto di studi clinici, rende difficile stabilire un nesso causale tra l’assunzione di un integratore e l’insorgenza di sintomi avversi. La tossicità è rara per le vitamine idrosolubili, ma più frequenti per le vitamine liposolubili, come la vitamina E, la vitamina A e i carotenoidi, e la vitamina D. In determinate situazioni, alcune categorie di persone possono essere a rischio di carenze nutrizionali; tuttavia, l’integrazione di nutrienti deve seguire in ogni caso un percorso di valutazione dello stato di nutrizione e di modulazione del comportamento alimentare e va mantenuta per il tempo necessario al recupero di un corretto stato nutrizionale e comportamentale. L’uso di integratori può anche predisporre gli individui a comportamenti alimentari scorretti e deve essere attentamente valutato in base al reale rapporto costo-beneficio.",

Some medications should be taken with a full glass of water; some must be taken with food, while others should be taken on an empty stomach. Patients should consult with a physician or pharmacist to determine if there are any foods that should be avoided while taking their medications. Yet for many reasons, patients rarely ask about which foods should be avoided. In some instances, patients will be instructed to take their medication with a particular food or beverage to aid palatability (and hence compliance), minimize local irritation to the gastrointestinal tract, or aid in drug absorption. However, importantly, there are many incidences when the consumption of specific foods in combination with certain medications presents a problem by interfering with the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of these drugs. If these instances go unrecognized, there may be significant divergence of therapeutic drug levels, and hence therapeutic effects and possible drug-related adverse events. This chapter highlights some of the main instances where concomitant ingestion of particular foods or beverages can interfere with medication action and then reviews how a better understanding of these interactions can sometimes be used to aid in patient management.",

A food allergy is an adverse immune response directed toward protein in food. This is in contrast to a larger number of non-immune-mediated adverse reactions to food.7 The nonimmune-mediated reactions include those caused by toxins in foods, such as spoiled foods, that would affect anyone ingesting the tainted food, pharmacological responses, and adverse reactions caused by a particular condition of the affected individual, such as a digestive problem (food intolerance).

      "abstract": "Our knowledge of dietetics has increased rapidly during the last twenty years, chiefly, however, in relation to the essential elements of diet needed by every one. The phase of the subject with which I wish to deal—namely, food allergy—has to do with the ordinary articles of diet which are usually wholesome and harmless but which, under certain circumstances, cause illness. <h3>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3> A rather large proportion of persons are born with a constitution which makes it possible for them to become hypersensitive to foreign substances. This constitution is hereditary—in fact, a positive history can be obtained in one or both parents in about 50 per cent, of cases. Once sensitive, a person is likely to react in characteristic ways whenever he comes in intimate contact with the substances to which he is sensitive. The condition is common, and afflicts, according to Cook's estimates, about 10 per cent, of all persons.",

We encountered a 26-year-old male patient who experienced recurrent episodes of anaphylaxis-like symptoms after ingesting seafood. A detailed history-taking and a histamine 50-skin-prick test confirmed the diagnosis of histamine intolerance. In addition, a low-histamine diet and prophylactic antihistamine medication did not result in symptom recurrence. Proper management of histamine intolerance can improve the individual's quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The number of US children who are overweight has more than doubled over the last decade. This change has broadened the focus of dietary guidance for children to address nutrient overconsumption and physical activity patterns. Total fat consumption expressed as a percentage of energy intake has decreased among US children. However, this decrease is largely the result of increased total energy intake in the form of carbohydrates and not necessarily due to decreased fat consumption. The majority of children aged 5–17 years are not meeting recommendations for Ca intakes. Much of this deficit is attributed to changing beverage consumption patterns, characterized by declining milk intakes and substantial increases in soft-drink consumption. On average, US children are not eating the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables. US adolescents become less active as they get older, and one-quarter of all US children watch 4 h television each day, which is positively associated with increased BMI and skinfold thickness. There is an urgent need in the USA for effective prevention strategies aimed at helping children grow up with healthful eating and physical activity habits to achieve optimal health.",

Nella storia, dopo un po' di tentativi (o esperimenti) che le fanno raggiungere estremi imbarazzanti, la bambina riesce a tornare dell'altezza \"giusta\".

Il matematico che ha scritto questa storia avrebbe potuto proporre un approccio diverso alla soluzione del problema: l'effetto totale sull'altezza della quantità di fungo mangiata con ogni boccone era proporzionale alla quantità mangiata? C'era qualche relazione tra la quantità e la velocità di cambiamento dell'altezza (è sempre imbarazzante crescere troppo velocemente o troppo lentamente)? Si trattava di una relazione lineare o non lineare? Sarebbe stato possibile individuare una strategia in grado di ottimizzare sia la velocità di crescita sia l'altezza finale?",

There is no evidence that the quality and concentration of protein in the cereal‐pulse based diet normally eaten in India is inadequate to meet protein needs, provided man eats enough to meet his energy needs. What diets apparently lack is energy foods to avoid the catabolism of the protein which is consumed. Supplementing diets with protein or amino acids is a costly and inefficient method of meeting energy and protein needs under these conditions. The concept of recommended protein intake and its use in assessing protein needs is commented upon.",

Viele Patientinnen und Patienten wünschen sich, gerade wegen des langfristigen Verlaufs eines Diabetes mellitus (= langfristige Einnahme von Medikamenten), nur mit Lebensstilmaßnahmen eine gute, stabile und sichere Einstellung des Glukosestoffwechsels und des Körpergewichtes zu erreichen. In diesen Gesprächssituationen kann eine kleine Studie aus den 80er Jahren (O’Dea et al. Diabetes 1984; 33: 596) als Hilfestellung benutzt werden. In dieser Studie wechselten n=10 Patienten mit einem Typ-2-Diabetes mellitus (australische Ureinwohner) von einem modernen, urbanen Lebensstil für 7 Wochen zurück in den traditionellen Lebensstil der australischen Ureinwohner als Jäger und Sammler. Antihyperglykämische Medikamente wurden abgesetzt. Die deutliche Verbesserung der Parameter des Stoffwechsels insgesamt sind verblüffend, und wird von den Autoren auf die vermehrte Bewegung bei der Nahrungssuche, eine fettarme Ernährung und eine Gewichtsabnahme zurückgeführt. Natürlich gibt es größere, kontrollierte und insbesondere längere Interventionsstudien zur Untersuchung verschiedener Strategien einer Lebensstilintervention. Aber diese Arbeit von 1984 zeigt plakativ auf, dass für eine gute Diabeteseinstellung ohne Medikamente möglicherweise langfristig eine so deutliche Änderung des Lebensstils notwendig wäre, die mit dem Leben in der Mitte unserer Gesellschaft kaum vereinbar ist. Daher werden von den Leitlinien auch Lebensstilmaßnahmen in Kombination mit Medikamenten empfohlen.",

      "title": "What is the role of portion control in weight management?",
      "abstract": "Systematic studies have shown that providing individuals with larger portions of foods and beverages leads to substantial increases in energy intake. The effect is sustained over weeks, supporting the possibility that large portions have a role in the development of obesity. The challenge is to find strategies to effectively manage the effects of portion size. One approach involves teaching people to select appropriate portions and to use tools that facilitate portion control. Although tools such as portion-control plates have been shown in several randomized trials to improve weight loss, limited data are available on whether education and tools lead to long-term changes in eating behavior and body weight. Another approach is to use preportioned foods (PPFs) to add structure to meals and minimize decisions about the amount of food to eat. A number of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of both liquid meal replacements and solid PPFs for weight loss and weight loss maintenance, but it is not known if they lead to better understanding of appropriate portions. Although portion control is important for weight management, urging people simply to ‘eat less’ of all foods may not be the best approach as high-energy-dense foods disproportionately increase energy intake compared with those lower in energy density. A more effective strategy may be to encourage people to increase the proportion of foods low in energy density in their diets while limiting portions of high-energy-dense foods. If people lower the energy density of their diet, they can eat satisfying portions while managing their body weight.",

      "title": "Childhood nutrition and cardiovascular disease risk: People in training for a plant-centered diet",
      "abstract": "Evidence is strong for a holistic approach for diet to prevent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other conditions. This includes dietary strategies, such as following a Mediterranean diet or otherwise eating a dietary pattern with low meat intake and a high intake of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, berries, seeds generally, unrefined unsaturated oils, fish, coffee, tea, chocolate, and alcohol (among drinkers, not in excess; intoxication should be avoided).1 Water is very important as a beverage. Some forms of dairy foods may also be recommended.2-4 Although an understanding of nutrients is important for controlling deficiency diseases, nutrients are not a good model for choosing what foods to eat. A nutrient approach to nutrition has been confusing to consumers. Paramount in this concept are the terms “low fat” and “low carbohydrate”; neither is particularly useful for choosing what foods to eat. “Low fat” as a food choice rule excludes apparently healthy foods, such as olives, walnuts, and salmon. “Low carbohydrate” would include these high-fat foods, but seems to discourage the consumption of whole plant foods. The idea that there is a concerted action of food constituents is called “food synergy”; this idea also supports that certain dietary patterns may be healthy. The food synergy and holistic idea is further supported by the notion that variety in the consumption of nutrient- or bioactive-rich plant food helps maintain health because there are many compounds with many functions. A simple example of the highly nuanced nature of biochemicals on health is the difference between oleic acid and its trans counterpart elaidic acid. The two molecules differ only in the placement of one double bond, yet the cis version, oleic acid, is a major part of olive oil, which is considered to be healthy,5 whereas the trans version, elaidic acid, is rare in nature, produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils, and is associated with excess risk of coronary heart disease.6 The consumer does not know in advance of eating which compounds are needed on any given day. There is also an epidemiologic advantage to studying diet patterns. Although many individual foods and nutrients have been seen to have very high within-person variability, diet patterns act like many other cardiovascular or diabetes risk factors, showing correlations of ~0.5 over periods up to 20 years. Jacobs and Orlich1 reviewed reports of 16 diet pattern scores and in all but one case found tracking correlations over several to many years of follow-up to range from 0.39 to 0.65. Jacobs and colleagues have formulated the A Priori Diet Quality Score (APDQS).1, 7-10 The theoretical basis for the APDQS is discussed by Jacobs and Orlich.1 Because the APDQS is based on foods, it differs somewhat from study to study, depending on which food groups were asked about. In Project EAT (Hu et al.12, table 4), positively rated food groups were formed, namely beans, chocolate, coffee, fish, fruit, green vegetables, low-fat dairy, nuts, poultry, tea, tomato, whole grain, and yellow vegetables. The negatively rated food groups were butter, fried foods, fried potato, grain dessert, organ meat, processed meat, red meat, salty snacks, sauces, soft drinks, sweet bread, and whole fat dairy. Each food group was placed in quintiles (or a non-consumer group and quartiles among consumers), and categories were scored 0–4 for lowest to highest reported consumption. The APDQS was calculated by summing category scores (0–4) of positively rated food groups with the reverse scores (4–0) of the negatively rated food groups. Additional foods were rated as neutral, namely diet soft drinks, eggs, fruit juice, margarine, other vegetables, potatoes, refined grains, seafood, and soup; these provide the full dietary context, but do not enter the score except through energy balance (replacing either positively or negatively rated foods). The APDQS has been shown to be inversely associated with total death that occurred over 26 years of follow-up from 1986 in Iowa women who were then aged 55–69 years.11 The APDQS is also related to health parameters in people followed from young adulthood.8, 10 However, APDQS has not been the subject of much study in children. Using data from Project EAT,12 we hypothesized that: (i) APDQS tracks from adolescence into young adulthood; and (ii) higher and increasing APDQS is associated with less weight gain in these participants. The following summarizes published data.12 In Project Eat, 4746 adolescents were recruited from middle or high school in Minneapolis–Saint Paul (MN, USA) in 1998–1999, with a mean age of 15 years (range 11–18 years). The study sample for the present report was the 2656 participants with follow-up visits in 2004 (mean age 20 years) and/or 2009 (mean age 25 years), adequate diet data, and self-reported weight and height at each examination. There were 1226 males and 1633 subjects were White in a racially diverse sample. Between mean age 15 and 25 years, mean (±SD) self-reported weight increased from 61 ± 15 to 76 ± 19 kg, whereas the corresponding mean APDQS was 45 ± 12 and 53 ± 12 points. There was no significant change in mean energy intake over these ages. As hypothesized, within-person tracking correlation of APDQS was 0.50 from mean age 20 to 25 years, but was a little lower (0.31) during the teenage years, from mean age 15 to 20 years. Per 15-point APDQS baseline difference (mean age 15 years), there was no cross-sectional weight difference: (mean 0.1 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI] –0.8, 0.8 kg). However, as hypothesized, there was less weight gain over the period 1999–2009 (mean − 1.8 kg; 95% CI –2.6, −1.0 kg) per 15-point higher APDQS at mean age 15 years. There was also less concurrent weight gain per 15-point APDQS increase between mean age 15 and 25 years (mean − 1.8 kg; 95% CI –2.2, −1.4 kg). There was a 5.6-kg mean difference in weight at mean age 25 years between participants who were below the median APDQS at mean age 15 years and had a decrease in APDQS between mean age 15 and 25 years and those participants who were above median APDQS at mean age 15 years and had an increase in APDQS between mean age 15 and 25 years (Table 1). In conclusion, a plant-centered dietary pattern with some resemblance to a Mediterranean diet is known to protect against chronic disease when eaten in adulthood.5, 7, 8, 10, 11 Children experiment with eating and learn dietary patterns,13 and have high energy intake during adolescence. Family meals, in particular, are a strategy that may promote better eating in adolescence.14, 15 Therefore, non-obese children may not suffer the same adverse metabolic consequences from eating high-energy foods that are not nutrient dense as adults. Children have a remarkable amount of latitude in food choice. We observed that eating a plant-centered diet by adolescence led to lower body mass index in young adulthood and appeared to set these individuals up for chronic disease avoidance throughout adulthood.12 Project EAT was funded by grants from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (Title V, Social Security Act) Health Resources and Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services (R40 MC 00319) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (R01HL084064, R01HL116892, and R01HL127077).

TH has nothing to declare. 既往已有强有力的证据表明, 全面控制饮食的方法可以预防心血管疾病、糖尿病以及其他疾病。这包括饮食策略, 例如遵循地中海饮食或者其他饮食模式, 其饮食特征为少量摄入肉类与大量摄入水果、蔬菜、豆类、全谷物、坚果, 浆果、一般的种子、未精炼的不饱和油、鱼、咖啡、茶、巧克力与酒精(饮酒者不应过量;应避免醉酒)1。水是一种非常重要的饮料。也推荐可以饮用某些类型的乳制品2–4。虽然对于控制营养缺乏性疾病来说了解营养成分非常重要, 但是对于选择吃什么食物来说根据营养素选择并不是一个很好的模式。补充营养素的营养疗法一直困扰着消费者。在这个概念中最重要的是“低脂肪”与“低碳水化合物”这两个术语;它们对于要选择吃什么食物来说都不是特别有用。“低脂肪”作为一种食物选择规则显然要将一些健康的食品如橄榄、核桃与三文鱼排除在外了。“低碳水化合物”将包括那些高脂肪的食物, 但是似乎还阻碍了全植物食品的消费。各种食物成分协同作用的理念被称为“食物协同作用”;这个理念也支持某些可能是健康的饮食模式。食物协同作用与整体理念进一步得到了以下观念的支持, 亦即消费多样化的富含营养成分或者生物活性的植物性食品将有助于保持健康, 因为其中包含了许多具有多种功能的化合物。生物化学品对健康的影响具有高度细微的差别, 有一个简单的例子那就是油酸与反式油酸之间的区别。这两个分子仅在一个双键的位置上有所不同, 但是油酸是顺式版本, 它是橄榄油的主要部分, 目前认为它是健康的5,然而反油酸是反式版本, 它在自然界中很罕见, 由植物油氢化后生成, 它是冠心病的极度危险因素6。消费者在任何一天的进食前都不知道需要的是哪种化合物。 另外, 使用流行病学调查的方法有利于我们研究饮食模式。虽然目前已经发现许多个体消费的食物以及营养物质在个体内的变异性非常高, 但是饮食模式就像其他许多心血管疾病或糖尿病的危险因素一样, 在长达20年的随访期间发现它的相关系数大约为0.5。Jacobs与Orlich1对16种饮食模式的评分报告进行了综述, 在这些报告中为了跟踪相关性随访了数年至许多年, 结果发现除了一例以外在所有人中的相关系数范围为0.39至0.65。 Jacobs与同事们为我们确切地阐述了先验性饮食质量评分法(A Priori Diet Quality Score,APDQS)1,7-10。Jacobs与Orlich针对APDQS的理论基础进行了讨论1。因为APDQS是以食物为基础的研究方法, 研究与研究之间都有所不同, 取决于被问及的是哪类食物。在EAT项目(Hu等12,表4)中, 规定了正面评价的食物类别, 即豆类、巧克力、咖啡、鱼、水果、绿色蔬菜、低脂乳制品、坚果、家禽、茶、番茄、全谷物以及黄色蔬菜。负面评价的食物类别是黄油、油炸食品、炸土豆、谷物甜点、内脏肉、加工肉类、红肉、咸味点心、酱料、软饮料、甜面包以及全脂乳制品。每种食物类别都按照五分位分组(或是一个非消费者分组, 而在消费者中按照四分位数分组),并且按照最少至最多报告的消费量进行分类(评分为0至4)。通过将正面评价的食物组类别得分(0-4)与负面评价的食物组类别得分(4-0)进行求和计算后得出APDQS评分。其他食物被评价为中性食品, 即软饮料、鸡蛋、果汁、人造奶油、其他蔬菜、土豆、精制谷物、海产品以及汤类;加上这些食物后饮食环境才够完整, 但它们不进入评分, 除非能够(替代正面或者负面评价的食物)影响能量平衡。有一项研究从1986年开始对爱荷华州的妇女进行了长达26年的随访, 刚开始的时候她们的年龄在55岁至69岁之间, 研究结果发现APDQS与总死亡率之间呈负相关11。对年轻成人进行随访后也发现APDQS与健康参数相关8,10。然而,APDQS一直还都没有成为儿童研究的对象。利用来自EAT项目的数据12,我们假设如下:(i)APDQS的轨迹是从青春期到成年早期;并且(ii)在这些参与者中,APDQS更高以及增加都与体重增加较少有关。以下我们总结了已公布的数据12。 在EAT项目中,1998至1999年间从明尼阿波利斯—圣保罗(明尼苏达州, 美国)中学或者高中招募了4746名青少年, 平均年龄为15岁(年龄范围为11–18岁)。这份报告的研究样本有2656名参与者, 分别在2004年(平均年龄20岁)和/或2009年(平均年龄25岁)进行了随访, 在每次调查的时候都要记录足够多的饮食数据以及自我报告的体重与身高。在这个具有多种多样种族的样本中, 有1226名男性以及1633名白种受试者。 在平均年龄为15至25岁之间的受试者中, 自我报告的平均体重(±SD)从61±15 kg增加到了76±19 kg,而相应的平均APDQS评分从45±12分增加到了53±12分。在这些年龄段受试者的平均能量摄入没有显著的变化。 就像假设的一样, 从平均年龄20岁至25岁, 追踪到的受试者个体内的与APDQS的相关系数为0.50,但是在十几岁(平均年龄为15至20岁)的受试者中相关系数要小一点(0.31)。 基线时每15分以内的APDQS差异(平均年龄为15岁),体重都没有横截面差异:(平均0.1 kg;95%置信区间[CI]为-0.8,0.8 kg)。然而, 就像假设的一样, 从1999年至2009年, 在平均年龄为15岁的受试者中,APDQS评分每升高15分, 体重增加就会显著减少(平均-1.8 kg;95%CI为-2.6,-1.0 kg)。在平均年龄为15岁至25岁之间的受试者中,APDQS评分每升高15分, 体重增加也会同时显著减少(平均-1.8 kg;95% CI为-2.2,-1.4kg)。平均年龄15岁时APDQS评分低于中位数并且平均年龄为15至25岁之间时APDQS评分有所减少的参与者与平均年龄15岁时APDQS评分高于中位数并且平均年龄为15至25岁之间时APDQS评分有所增加的参与者相比, 当他们的平均年龄到了25岁时, 两组之间的平均体重差异达到了5.6 kg(表1)。 总之, 以植物为主的饮食模式与地中海饮食有某些相似之处, 目前已经明确成年以后如果采用这种饮食模式可以预防慢性疾病5,7,8,10,11。儿童在不断地尝试不同的饮食并且在学习采用何种饮食模式13,到了青春期还存在高能量摄入。我们特别推荐家庭餐, 这是一种可以促进青少年采用更好饮食模式的策略14,15。因此, 非肥胖儿童摄入并非富含营养素的高能量食品后可能不会像成人那样出现同样的不良代谢结果。儿童在食物的选择范围上明显更广。我们观察到, 青少年进食以植物为主的饮食会导致成年早期时较低的体重指数, 并且似乎这样就会导致这些个体在整个成年期间都避免发生慢性疾病12。 表1 在EAT项目中平均年龄为25岁时的体重, 调查了1999年平均年龄为15岁时采用的饮食模式对2009年平均年龄为25岁时体重的影响。 信息摘自Hu等12的研究(表5)。",

      "abstract": "It’s common to think that being slim is a process of loss of body weight after a long period of exercise. In fact, it’s attributed to loss of water and mineral salts a great part of loss of body weight. In order to have a successful loss of weight, middle to long-term process, it is necessary to change one’s own style of life. Therefore, gaining an interaction between an adequate feeding and the practice of regular physical exercises, mainly aerobics. As to nourishment, it’s the outmost importance that a person has a negative energetic balance, that’s, the digestion of food has to be lesser and through exercises to burn more calories, such as: cycling and belt conveyor. Calories are closely linked to the digestion of O 2, VO2 Max. Each litter of O 2 corresponds to five kcal approximately. If the intensity is equal to both, the burned up calorie during the exercise will be even. It’s important to mention here that if a person doesn’t respect the hydration process, it’ll occur a decrease in the level of water and mineral salts as well. Due to the facts above, this study aims at verifying the degree of dehydration between the exercises (movement RT250) and Exercise cycles (technogym bike 600 xt pro). The exercise was monitored during 90 minutes, keeping a cardiac frequency between 70% and 80% of the maximum frequency. Exercise cycles (technogym bike 600 xt pro). To analyse dehydration it was used simple markers such as body weight pre and post exercises as well as urinary density pre and post.",

      "abstract": "Masa remaja merupakan masa transisi antara anak-anak dan orang dewasa dan membutuhkan perhatian khusus. Masalah gizi remaja dan berkurangnya aktivitas fisik biasanya meningkatkan nafsu makannya. Oleh karena itu, mereka biasanya mencari makanan lain berupa makanan padat energi, manis dan berlemak tinggi di luar waktu makan. Makanan tersebut rawan obesitas. Kelebihan berat badan atau Obesitas dapat diartikan sebagai penimbunan jaringan lemak tubuh secara berlebihan yang memberi efek buruk pada kesehatan. Kondisi ini dapat dialami oleh setiap golongan umur baik laki-laki maupun perempuan, akan tetapi remaja dan dewasa merupakan kelompok yang paling sering mengalaminya. Tingkat pengetahuan gizi remaja merupakan salah satu faktor yang mempengaruhi terjadinya obesitas pada remaja. Jika remaja memiliki pengetahuan dan sikap yang cukup untuk menjaga gizi dan pengaturan pola makan, maka sebagian besar masalah gizi sedikit banyak dapat dihindari. Oleh karena itu, salah satu upaya untuk mengatasi masalah gizi tersebut adalah dengan memberikan penyuluhan kesehatan kepada generasi muda. Pendidikan kesehatan tentang obesitas menggunakan media broadcast message memberikan pengaruh dalam meningkatkan pengetahuan pada remaja yang mengalami overweight dan obesitas. Dengan demikian, media broadcast message bisa digunakan untuk meningkatkan pengetahuan, dan sebaiknya frekuensi pemberian dilakukan lebih dari sekali misalnya sebanyak 3 kali secara bertahap selama dilakukan penelitian agar memberikan pengaruh yang lebih maksimal. Ada pengaruh edukasi dengan menggunakan media broadcast message terhadap peningkatan pengetahuan dan sikap remaja overweight.",

      "abstract": "Weight-loss supplements typically fall into 1 of 4 categories depending on their hypothesized mechanism of action: products that block the absorption of fat or carbohydrate, stimulants that increase thermogenesis, products that change metabolism and improve body composition, and products that suppress appetite or give a sense of fullness. Each category is reviewed, and an overview of the current science related to their effectiveness is presented. While some weight-loss supplements produce modest effects (&lt;2 kg weight loss), many have either no or few randomized clinical trials examining their effectiveness. A number of factors confound research results associated with the efficacy of weight-loss supplements, such as small sample sizes, short intervention periods, little or no follow-up, and whether the supplement is given in combination with an energy-restricted diet or increased exercise expenditure. There is no strong research evidence indicating that a specific supplement will produce significant weight loss (&gt;2 kg), especially in the long term. Some foods or supplements such as green tea, fiber, and calcium supplements or dairy products may complement a healthy lifestyle to produce small weight losses or prevent weight gain over time. Weight-loss supplements containing metabolic stimulants (e.g., caffeine, ephedra, synephrine) are most likely to produce adverse side effects and should be avoided.",

      "abstract": "Le vieillissement s’accompagne d’un déclin des sensibilités olfactives et gustatives (sensibilités chimiosensorielles). Or, lorsque nous mangeons, la saveur et l’odeur d’un aliment contribuent largement au plaisir associé à son ingestion. Plusieurs auteurs ont fait l’hypothèse que le déclin des capacités chimiosensorielles observé chez les seniors conduirait à des modifications des préférences alimentaires, celles-ci entraînant à leur tour des changements de l’appétit et de la prise alimentaire. Effectivement, lorsque les préférences sont mesurées à un instant t , les seniors tendent à préférer des aliments ayant une flaveur plus intense. Cependant, augmenter la concentration des composés de la flaveur dans les aliments proposés aux seniors afin de compenser le déclin des capacités chimiosensorielles n’a qu’un effet limité sur la prise alimentaire effective. Une explication possible est que l’effet du vieillissement sur les capacités chimiosensorielles s’accompagne d’une « remise à jour » permanente des représentations internes des aliments. Cependant, la diminution moyenne des capacités chimiosensorielles cache aussi une grande variabilité interindividuelle, encore trop peu prise en compte. Il est à souhaiter que les études futures s’intéressent davantage à l’impact de variables telles que le style de vie ou le degré de dépendance sur le lien entre perception chimiosensorielle et alimentation chez les seniors.",

Their investigation indicated that administration of a tryptophan-free amino acid mixture to remitted depressed patients led to relapse within 2 to 7 hours in a majority of cases. Unfortunately, this excellent study may be undergoing frequent replication by unknowing subjects. Tryptophan-free amino acid mixtures are a popular supplement sold in health food stores. All that is required for an unsuspecting person to replicate the experimental protocol is to consume a low tryptophan diet for 1 day before consuming the mixture. While probably few would take as much as in the study, the minimum conditions necessary to induce relapse are unknown. Abrupt return of intense depressive symptoms, as described in this study, might lead a person to discontinue otherwise effective antidepressant treatment or even become suicidal. This latter possibility is of particular concern",

The sense of smell is the dominant sensory system in animals. The cerebral center of the olfactory system is a part of the limbic system, which is in charge of emotion and memory. The sense of smell is directly linked to learning, memory, and emotions. The first sense that a fetus can feel inside the womb is the sense of smell. Nearly 80% of flavors come from smells in the nasal cavity; the rest are from tastes in the mouth. Almost all of the smell from the soil is actually due to the odor of geosmin, which originates from bacteria such as Streptomyces. There are many people who die from anorexia after becoming psychologically sensitive to foods.",

Eating is a human health activity that includes interactions between physiological, psychological, environmental, social, cultural, and other elements. Individuals are capable of attending to and adjusting their eating patterns towards safer, more agreeable, and practicable meals. Eating behaviours, especially those related to an overeating tendency, originate early in the developmental and exhibit individual continuity equivalent to stable personality traits. Appetitive qualities associated with increased satiety tended to reduce with maturation, whereas those associated with increased food reactivity tended to rise. This pattern is consistent with a steady increase in the risk of obesity.",

      "abstract": "Many athletes engage in unhealthy weight-control practices. This new policy statement urges pediatricians to attempt to identify and help these athletes and provides information about how to support sound nutritional behavior. Athletes may engage in unhealthy weight-control practices, particularly in sports in which thinness or \"making weight\" is judged important to success, such as body building, cheerleading, dancing (especially ballet), distance running, diving, figure skating, gymnastics, horse racing, rowing, swimming, weight-class football, and wrestling.1-3 Some athletes may use extreme weight-loss practices that include overexercising; prolonged fasting; vomiting; using laxatives, diuretics, diet pills, other licit or illicit drugs, and/or nicotine; and use of rubber suits, steam baths, and/or saunas. The majority of these disordered eating behaviors do not meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed, criteria4 for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. In two surveys of 208 female collegiate athletes, 32% and 62% practiced at least one of the following unhealthy weight-control behaviors: self-induced vomiting, binge eating more than twice weekly, and using laxatives, diet pills, and/or diuretics.5,6 Of 713 high school wrestlers in Wisconsin, 257 (36%) demonstrated two or more behaviors related to bulimia nervosa.7 In a survey of 171 collegiate Indiana wrestlers concerning their behaviors in high school, 82% had fasted for more than 24 hours, 16% had used diuretics, and 9.4% had induced vomiting at least once a week.8 Many athletes are secretive about these potentially harmful practices. Disordered eating may have a negative short-term impact on athletic performance. Athletes who lose weight rapidly by dehydration are probably impairing their athletic performance, especially if it involves strength or endurance,9 and these strength deficits may persist even after rehydration.10",

Only during the last decade have definite experimental proofs been given that 1, there is a minimum fat intake without which certain animals can not live and 2, much larger amounts of fat are required for the best health and optimum metabolism.

      "title": "Cooking clue to human dietary diversity",
      "abstract": "For primates, humans have pretty peculiar diets. Most often, our food intake includes large amounts of starchy plant food, together, particularly in developed countries, with considerable quantities of vertebrate muscle and other soft tissues. No other large primate eats like this. Instead, our near relatives tend to obtain most of their calories from the simple sugars in fruits and most of their protein from a single profligate photosynthetic enzyme in leaves. We are really very odd. Even the use of human “diets” in the plural indicates this. Compared with the comparatively stereotyped food intake of wild primates, the variety of diets consumed by our single species is staggering. Even if geographical factors are excluded, the diversity persists. Very few of the alternative dietary regimens recommended by experts (and others) have been totally refuted as biologically unfit, even when dietary dogmata are contradictory. Although many guidelines focus on the merits of protein vs. carbohydrate vs. lipid, or on plants vs. animals, some are directed instead at the raw vs. cooked dichotomy. All this conveys something quite clearly: our bodies do not provide us with adequate sensory or hormonal feedback to “tell” us what they want, and that we, as organisms, do not have enough “inside” knowledge as to what we are optimally built to consume. Otherwise, surely there would be no argument. So what threw all these confusing choices at us? One of the most important recent ideas is that cooking has opened up a whole range of items to us that either could not be digested, or else could not be consumed in a reasonable time period, unless heat was available to modify them (1). Commercial starches are all modified before sale, but the effect of heat on the digestion of muscle (i.e., meat) is less well known. However, in PNAS (2), Carmody et al. at Harvard University cap a series of articles on the benefits of cooking by offering definitive evidence in mice that the cooking of both meat and starchy tubers enhances their digestion significantly. The evidence comes from balanced short-term experiments on the ingestion of raw vs. cooked starchy tubers and meat that considered “pounding” (mechanical fracture and fragmentation using a mallet followed by pestle and mortar) as a separate factor. The evidence points strongly to the dominance of heat treatment as a digestive aid. Mice fed on raw diets lost some of their body weight, whereas those on cooked diets generally maintained it. Curiously, even naive mice preferred roasted meat, whereas experience was apparently needed to prefer roasted tubers. The importance of these experiments lies in how far the results can be applied to humans.",

Most of us were brought up on the adage, \"Stuff a cold and starve a fever,\" though long before our time Graves<sup>1</sup>had advocated a liberal diet and had suggested that should his friends after his death seek a suitable epitaph for his grave they might use the words, \"He fed fevers.\" In typhoid fever especially it was almost a universal practice to limit the diet to fluids and to a low caloric intake. Emaciation was believed to be inevitable in typhoid fever. Losses of weight as great as 30 or 41 per cent. (Curschmann<sup>2</sup>) have been recorded in extreme instances. Complications increased the loss of weight (Lorain<sup>3</sup>), but even on a diet of 2,600 calories per day in an ordinary case the weight may decrease by as much as 20 pounds (Purits<sup>4</sup>",

      "abstract": "As Mrs. Knowles complained to Dr. Johnson, ‘the mason’s wife, if she is ever seen in liquor, is ruined; the mason may get himself drunk as often as he pleases with little loss of character.’1 The ruin resulted not just from the liquor itself but from the association between liquor and sex. To preserve her honor a woman should never become drunk, better yet drink little, best of all never drink. In contrast to the effects of drink on the promiscuous woman, Bacchus never had power over the virtuous maiden in Chaucer’s ‘Physician’s Tale.’2 In short, two different images of women emerged that were dependent on the quantity of alcohol consumed: the good image of the woman who drank a little and the bad image of the woman who drank too much and as a consequence gained a reputation for unbridled sexuality.3 Studies of differential drinking in modern societies demonstrate the existence of a double standard in appropriate drinking behavior. Men suffer a loss of honor if they are poor drinkers, if they cannot hold their liquor, if they are easy drunks; they demonstrate their macho virility by consuming large amounts. Nonetheless, they do not lose as much honor as do women who drink a lot or become drunk. Such women gain a reputation for their lack of self-control, which leads to sexual promiscuity and in turn leads to the loss of respect.4",

Nowadays, food allergies and intolerances that cause changes in organism are omnipresent. Moreover, the problem of eating disorders such as obesity, anorexia and bulimia is becoming more widespread.

      "abstract": "There is no evidence of any nutritional benefit derived from the consumption of vitamin supplements in excess of the daily intakes recommended by the various international and national expert committees. Furthermore, in the case of certain of the vitamins such as vitamin A and vitamin D, excessive intakes result in toxic effects. To a lesser extent this is also the case for vitamin C and nicotinic acid. In addition, the use of high supplements or megadoses of any vitamin results in a wasteful misuse of economic resources. This reduces the capacity to acquire foods which would have clear nutritional benefits for the whole family. Consequently, the indiscriminate use of these megadoses must be discouraged. Their application is exclusively justified in clinical situations under direct medical supervision.",

      "abstract": "IN ACCEPTING the Borden Award I must say how deeply I appreciate this honor. One9s efforts in the realm of science tend to have a somewhat jaundiced look in retrospect, but when someone else thinks they have merit it is very heartening. I have chosen the nutritional requirements of children for my topic, if only to show how little we know about it and how important it is to know more. Why is it important to study nutritional requirements today? Isn9t it true that infant feeding is a dead subject? Can9t we feed a child today in a hundred different ways and have it thrive? That is certainly true of the normal subject in our own country. Food shortage is no problem. The problem of digestibility has been solved by a variety of processing techniques. We can supply the necessary nutrients with a wide margin of safety. We have no difficulty in meeting caloric and protein requirements, and vitamin deficiencies are almost a thing of the past. Why should we worry all out nutrition? The answer is, however, not hard to find. We may have mastered the problem of nutrition in health, but we have scarcely touched the problem of nutrition in disease. In the autopsy room we still see plenty of infants and children who are emaciated as the result of disease. Their nutrition has failed. If it could have been maintained the result might have been different. Disease poses special problems for the nutritionist. It may affect the organs of digestion, assimilation and utilization, and thus limit the quantity of nutrients available to the body. It may impose limitations on particular types of food and, finally, it may impose special nutritive requirements. We are all familiar with the increased caloric demands made by fever and there is evidence, too, of an increased nitrogen requirement at this time. We are familiar, too, with the demineralizing effects of acidosis and with an increasing number of situations in which potassium losses from the cells need to be replaced.",

And we surely do not have as much control over our beliefs as we have over simple actions. For instance, you can, if offered $500, immediately throw your steak in the trash, but a meat-eater cannot, at will, start believing that eating animals is wrong to secure a $500 reward. Yet, even though we have more control over our behavior than we have over our beliefs, some of our behavior, especially moral behavior, is heavily influenced by our beliefs. Meat-eating is one example. So, if we do not have direct control over our beliefs and our beliefs influence our moral behavior, it's no wonder meat-eaters aren't immediately boycotting Burger King and lining up for the Beyond Burger after hearing about the mistreatment of farmed animals. So, how, or can we, inspire meat-eaters to change their beliefs regarding the moral significance of meat-eating and, consequently, their animal-eating behavior? I propose an answer to this difficult question.",

But need in vitamins remained on the former level. Maximal volume of vitamins, which organism use, is conditioned on the level of genes. The reasons, allowing a development of state of hypovitaminosis especially in schoolchildren, remain. Increased metabolism, induced by the growth of organism, frequently inevitable stress, sometimes unbalanced nutrition, hard intellectual loads, etc., can lead to the development of the states, which need increased doses of vitamins. Observations during last 20 years showed that there is no almost any child, whose provision with vitamins con be estimated as optimal. In most children (up to 70%) the combined deficiency of three and more vitamins is detected, independently of their age, time of year and place of living. Pediatricians use vitamins not only for the maintenance of homeostasis itself, but for the initiation of all program of child's development. Schoolchild's organism needs additional volume of vitamins all the time, and they should be administrated during prolonged periods of time, independently of time of the year and adequacy of diet. Timely administration of vitamins and minerals complexes provides significant prophylactic of hypovitaminosis.",

      "abstract": "Hormones are substances released into the bloodstream from the gland or organs and affect\r\n the activity of the cell in another part of the body. Binding of the hormone to the receptor\r\n accelerates, slows or otherwise changes cellular function. They control growth and\r\n development, reproduction, and sexual characteristics. The affect the way the body uses or\r\n stores energy. They control the volume of fluids, salt level and sugar in the blood. In short\r\n hormones manage all physiological processes in the body, and when they are in balance\r\n physical, mental and emotional functioning of the human beings is in full capacity. A human\r\n feels vital and healthy, full of energy and looks good. But what happens when it's not? When\r\n does a human not feel good in his body, when does something prevent him from enjoying life,\r\n when does the body start to require excessive salty or sweet food? When does a human get\r\n thicker despite the normal food intake, depressed, anxious and generally in a bad mood? If\r\n health screenings do not indicate a state of clear inflammation or any other pathological\r\n condition what's happening in the body is most likely to be hormonal imbalance.\r\n Many current research on the effects of hormone on gender suggests that women are special\r\n prone to, and sensitive to, the changes that bear minimal hormonal imbalances. This paper\r\n discusses the effect of hormones on female health, and generally on physical, mental and\r\n emotional functioning of women in today's times when demands, personal and environmental\r\n enhancement,are demanding and sometimes exhausting. The second part of the paper presents\r\n a research on information and attitudes women have regarding hormones, the influence of\r\n hormones on women's health, and the affect of proper nutrition on hormonal status. People are\r\n confronted with stress, energy shortage and weight gain, and women are the ones who, because\r\n of hormonal imbalance, have greater health consequences. Nutrition as a key element for\r\n achieving hormonal balance, with some changes in life style, have proved to be key factors for\r\n achieving a life balance.",

It is as yet unclear whether the menopausal transition itself leads to weight gain, but it is known that the physiological withdrawal of estrogen brings about changes in fat distribution that increase the risk for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The treatment of postmenopausal obesity is very simple logically, but incredibly difficult – eat less and exercise more. Recent studies suggest that being active and fit is more important than losing weight; hence, a major recommendation is to exercise regularly, for at least 30 min on at least 5 days of the week, while maintaining a healthy balanced diet. Unfortunately, there are no ‘magic bullets’ (drugs) that may provide long-term treatment, and all diets work irrespective of their composition as long as people comply to them.

      "title": "Smoking cessation: the psychiatrist's role.",
      "abstract": "Although tobacco use is one of the leading preventable causes of death and the prevalence of smoking in persons with psychiatric disorders is very high, psychiatrists may be missing opportunities to assist patients to stop smoking, perhaps because this health promotion activity is seen to be in the province of the family physician.1 We may be consulted, however, when patients with psychiatric disorders consider smoking cessation or have difficulty in achieving abstinence.\r\n\r\nA patient with bipolar disorder resolved to stop smoking after experiencing several upper respiratory infections. He was a heavy smoker with a high Fagerstrom nicotine dependence score (8).2 His mood was well stabilized by treatment with lithium carbonate, and his only other medication was atorvastatin.\r\n\r\nThe patient decided on a quit date and started to exercise regularly, to avoid smoking while away from the house and to use nicotine gum 4 mg as needed. With this strategy, his consumption went from over 30 cigarettes daily to about 10 daily; he had no problems apart from cravings for cigarettes. A couple of weeks before the quit date and wishing to further reduce his intake of cigarettes, he saw his family physician, who prescribed varenicline according to the usual schedule (0.5 mg/d initially, increasing to 2 mg/d over 1 week). After starting the varenicline, the patient developed several significant symptoms, many attributable to acute nicotine withdrawal: sadness, difficulty thinking and executing actions, poor energy, and somatic sensations including “kinks in (his) body” and burning eyes. He felt as though he had taken a pill with residual effects that included his head not being clear and an “unnatural feeling.” Cigarettes failed to relieve these symptoms, and the usual feeling of satisfaction from smoking was lacking.\r\n\r\nHe was seen in the clinic after 10 days of treatment with varenicline. It was decided that he would discontinue this medication and attempt to quit as originally planned. His mood and ability to function returned to normal about 4 days after stopping the varenicline, by which time all the symptoms mentioned above had resolved. The patient was subsequently able to stop smoking completely (at the time of writing for 3 weeks) with the aid of the nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).\r\n\r\nVarenicline is a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is the main site of action of nicotine. Like NRT and bupropion, the use of varenicline increases the rate of complete smoking cessation by a factor of about 2 to 3. These pharmacologic aids are best employed in conjunction with various non pharmacologic approaches, including counselling and strategies such as making the home smoke-free and exercising regularly. Bupropion is relatively contraindicated in patients with bipolar disorder, given that it can cause mood cycling. Varenicline appears to be quite safe for use in patients with psychiatric illnesses, but there have been reports of exacerbation of schizophrenia and induction of hypomania, or even mania, following treatment with this drug.3–5\r\n\r\nSmoking cessation is a risk factor for the development of depression, but the timing of this patient's symptoms suggests a withdrawal syndrome resulting from an acute reduction in stimulation of the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors after the introduction of varenicline. Occupancy of the nicotinic receptors by this high-affinity drug also accounts for the failure of smoking to relieve the symptoms or produce a positive effect.\r\n\r\nNRT, bupropion and varenicline can be used in combination, and other drugs can also be employed as aids to smoking cessation. A review of these treatments and other aspects of this important field can be found in an excellent article published in the November 2007 issue of the CMAJ6 (cited in bibliography for the online version of this column appearing on the JPN website). NRT in its various forms (patch, gum, etc.) should, in my opinion, be considered the initial drug of choice for smoking cessation, with the other drugs being reserved for cases in which NRT is not tolerated or is ineffective, particularly in patients with psychiatric comorbidity.\r\n\r\nAssisting patients to stop smoking can be highly rewarding, and the more informed we are about developments in this important field, the more effective we will be in helping our patients.\r\n\r\nNicholas J.

      "title": "Toxic and essential trace elements in adolescents",
      "abstract": "There is a need for knowledge of trace element levels in different population groups. Several applications can be identi ed. One is as reference levels that can be used to detect changes in environmental exposure. Another is to reveal de ciency of essential elements, or in some cases toxicity. Toxic elements need to be monitored, as the exposure may be close to levels where adverse effects can arise. Absorption of elements occurs via the gastrointestinal tract and the lungs, and the absorbed fraction may depend on the route of exposure. Diet is the main source of exposure to trace elements in the general population that are not occupationally exposed. Toxic elements may enter the food chain through contamination of the environment, e.g. through atmospheric deposition or naturally high levels in soil. Essential elements are widespread in most foods, as they are also essential to plants and animals used for food production. Adolescents constitute a little studied group in regard to trace element levels in blood. They have a high recommended energy and nutrient intake per kg body weight. Moreover, a high energy intake may expose them to more toxic trace elements via the diet than adults. However, many adolescents do not consume an adequate diet and may therefore risk de ciency of essential elements. In a longitudinal Swedish nutritional survey, almost 400 adolescents (boys and girls) were sampled for blood and serum at the ages of 15 and 17 years for a trace element study within the survey. The adolescents were living in the two Swedish cities, Uppsala and Trollhattan. The cities differ in that Trollhattan has long had metal industries such as several smelters, while Uppsala is a university city, with almost no industrial metal emissions. The two cities also represent different socioeconomic structures, with a higher percentage of the adolescents’ parents having university-level education in Uppsala. The elements analysed were the well-known toxic elements cadmium, mercury and lead, as well as the essential elements cobalt, copper, zinc and selenium (1). The elements rubidium, platinum, palladium, rhodium, thallium and tungsten were also analysed. The analytical method used was inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which enables rapid and simultaneous multielement analyses. The trace element concentrations were then related to the adolescents’ age, gender, socioeconomic status and residential area (city) (2). It should be noted that the age factor may also re ect temporal changes in environmental exposure. This is mainly relevant for toxic elements. The in uence of  sh consumption on mercury and selenium concentrations, and of dental amalgam  llings on mercury concentrations, was also investigated (3). The adolescents’ blood concentration of lead was low from an international perspective, and also decreased between 15 and 17 years of age (2, 4). Decreasing blood lead has been reported in conjunction with decreasing use of leaded petrol, but the present decrease may also be a result of dilution of body burden in the growing adolescents. There was also a signi cant difference in blood lead concentration between Uppsala and Trollhattan (pB0.0005, F ig. 1). Boys had higher levels of lead in the blood than did girls. Reasons for a gender difference may be a higher haematocrit, or a higher energy intake in the boys. The levels of cadmium in blood were signi cantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers (pB 0.0005). Blood cadmium was also positively in uenced by socioeconomic status (2). The reason for this relationship is not obvious, but the higher consumption of vegetables in the higher socioeconomic groups may play a role, as vegetables are one of the main food groups contributing cadmium to the diet. It was shown that in this study population,  sh consumption was a statistically signi cant predic-",

      "title": "Psychophysical Responses to Sucrose in Young Likers and Non-likers",
      "abstract": "Humans are biologically predisposed to like and prefer sweet tastes and foods for the energy content and nutritional value of sugar. However, due to the abundance and accessibility of sweet foods, having a higher preference for sweet tastes, and particularly for foods that are high in both sugar and fat, can have negative health implications including increased risk for obesity. Although sweet tastes are generally considered pleasant, the development of preferences and intake of sweet foods varies across individuals and the relationship between liking, preference, and intake is rather complex.\n\tSucrose is a sweet tastant that is commonly used in psychophysical studies of taste and hedonic evaluation. Although sucrose is often considered a pleasant stimulus, there is some evidence to suggest the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between pleasantness ratings and concentration in a significant proportion of the population, such that the hedonic value of sucrose increases as the intensity or concentration of sucrose increases up to a certain point, then decreases as the intensity increases further. However, this U-shaped relationship is not universal, and some individuals demonstrate a consistent increase in hedonic response with increasing intensity. Moreover, although the findings are mixed, some research suggests that the degree to which individuals demonstrate liking for sweet tastes such as sucrose is explained in part by their sensitivity to the bitterness of the chemicals 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). \n\tThe present study aimed to investigate differences in psychophysical responses to sweet (and fat) tastes between young likers and non-likers of sucrose by examining the effects of sucrose concentration, sucrose liker status, PROP/PTC taster status, and gender on reported pleasantness ratings and perceived sweetness intensity ratings for sucrose solutions in various backgrounds. Participants included 40 younger adults; 20 were classified as sucrose likers, and 20 were classified as sucrose non-likers using previously established methods of classification. Within each group, 10 participants were male and 10 were female. Participants were administered taste solutions consisting of varying concentrations of sucrose in different backgrounds and instructed to provide pleasantness and intensity ratings of each using the generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS). Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with repeated measures were conducted to investigate the effects of sucrose concentration, sucrose liker status, PROP/PTC taster status, and gender on reported pleasantness ratings and perceived sweetness intensity ratings for sucrose solutions in various backgrounds. In general, results suggested that in young adults, hedonic response to sucrose in distilled water and fat backgrounds varied as a function of sucrose concentration, sucrose liker status, and gender. \n\tAssessing sweet-fat taste perception in young likers versus non-likers of sucrose is important because it addresses a…",
