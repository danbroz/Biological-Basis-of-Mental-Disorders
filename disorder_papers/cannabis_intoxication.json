      "title": "[Cognitive and psychotic effects after cessation of chronic cannabis use].",
      "abstract": "Establishment of residual cognitive and psychotic effects (effects present at the time that all active cannabinoids are eliminated from the body) putatively produced by prolonged heavy cannabis use is difficult, because of many confounding variables like slow elimination of active cannabinoids, lack of supervision during abstinence, poor use of well-matched control groups and the presence of withdrawal symptoms. Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild. The relationship of cannabis use, psychotic effects and schizophrenia was unclear; the cannabis conceivably gave relief, but it also appeared that cannabis caused schizophrenia in young people and (or) enhanced the symptoms, especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful.",

Es altamente adictiva y puede producir cuadros graves por su consumo, esporÃ¡dico o habitual o, por su abstinencia, a nivel sistÃ©mico y neurolÃ³gico. La exposiciÃ³n aguda a esta sustancia desencadena manifestaciones psiquiÃ¡tricas inmediatas, como cambios en el afecto o conducta: sensaciÃ³n de irritabilidad, hiperactividad, ansiedad, desasosiego, euforia o psicosis. Esta sintomatologÃ­a contrasta con inducciÃ³n en ciertos casos de depresiÃ³n, aislamiento o tristeza con la cronificaciÃ³n en su consumo.

      "title": "Psychotic Cannabis Withdrawal: A Clinical Case",
      "abstract": "Cannabis use has been associated with several psychiatric comorbidities and there appears to be a dose-response relationship between the intensity and duration of its use and the risk of psychosis. More commonly, acute episodes of cannabis induced-psychosis manifest immediately following exposure, are precipitated after the use of large amounts of cannabis, resolve with abstinence, and are of shorter duration than those observed with primary psychotic disorders. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms usually manifest when heavy, prolonged consumption of this substance is interrupted or significantly reduced. The withdrawal syndrome may include sympathetic autonomic hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and reduced appetite. On the other hand, cases of psychosis induced by cannabis withdrawal are rare. In this case, we present a 32-year-old healthy woman without personal or family psychiatric history who showed a heavy and continued consumption of cannabis since she was 10 years old, without developing any psychiatric symptoms. However, recently she experienced two brief psychotic episodes with disorganized behavior and persecutory delusions, both episodes happening a week after discontinuing cannabis consumption.",

In caffeine intoxication, these symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and are not due to a general medical condition or better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. an anxiety disorder). Nicotine is highly lipid‐soluble and rapidly enters the brain after inhalation. Nicotine receptors are found on dopaminergic cell bodies and stimulation of these receptors leads to dopamine release. Withdrawal symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of stopping smoking and include intense craving, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty in concentrating and increased appetite. Nicotine withdrawal can be misdiagnosed as depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and mania. Withdrawal can also exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenia.",

Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

The psychiatric symptoms associated with cannabis use are agitation, insomnia, depressive or raised mood, anxiety, hallucinations, and concentration problems. It is known that cannabis use increases the risk for psychoses and bipolar disorders and may deteriorate the clinical presentation of pre-existing psychoses and bipolar disorders. A characteristic symptom of autoscopic psychosis is visual hallucination of some part or the entirety of a person’s body, imitating his or her behaviors and being perceived as if seen in a mirror. This is not a specific symptom of any mental disorder and the cause is not definitively known. In this case presentation, the symptoms of a patient diagnosed with cannabis use-associated autoscopic psychosis are discussed in the context of the literature.",

      "abstract": "The usual phenomena of cannabis intoxication include experiences which in a non-intoxicated state would be considered as psychiatric symptoms. These can be distinguished from adverse reactions to cannabis, the commonest of which is an acute anxiety state. Acute psychotic episodes can also follow ingestion of the drug but are infrequent. These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness. Further controlled studies would be required to clarify the aetiological significance of the drug in these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive agent in cannabis (marijuana) plants. A variety of synthetic cannabinoids have also been developed. Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States; almost 44 million Americans report using in the past month. People who use cannabis may experience relaxation, euphoria, and mild hallucinogenic effects. Some may experience nausea and vomiting after use. Synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Cessation after regular use may result in drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness. Metabolites of THC can be detected in the urine up to a month after last use; some medications can cause false-positive tests. Serious medical complications of cannabis use are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users and acute cognitive and motor impairment. Synthetic cannabinoid use is associated with significant neuropsychological effects. Psychosocial modalities appear to help those who wish to stop or cut down on use. There are no medications approved for the treatment of cannabis use disorder or cannabis withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "Introduccion. El consumo de pasta base de cocaina (PBC) en Chile ha causado alarma aunque hay escasa informacion sobre la clinica del consumo. Se disena un estudio exploratorio y descriptivo que busca precisar sus caracteristicas. Material y metodo. Se registran los fenomenos clinicos en 61 pacientes consumidores de PBC, consultantes espontaneos de un centro tratamiento de adicciones en una comuna popular de Santiago, elegidos de modo aleatorio. Resultados. Alrededor de los dos meses de uso regular la PBC provoca conductas compulsivas de busqueda y consumo de la sustancia. Es una adiccion condicionada ya que la conducta compulsiva solo aparece como respuesta a estimulos externos (principalmente la posesion de dinero) o internos (cambios animicos o la fantasia de estar fumando). En un mismo individuo existen patones de consumo muy diferentes en un breve lapso de tiempo. Rapidamente se desarrolla sensibilizacion (hipertonia y estereotipias motoras, paranoia, ilusiones auditivas, visuales y cenestesicas, que son sintomas transitorios y vinculados al estado de intoxicacion aguda) y tolerancia (disminucion y desaparicion del efecto euforizante). La sensibilizacion y la tolerancia aparecen simultaneamente y en conjunto con la conducta compulsiva. Cada episodio de consumo por lo general termina con intensos sentimientos de culpa, ansiedad y aun ideas suicidas. Existen una frecuente perdida de normativas sociales y la constitucion de un sindrome psicopatico. Conclusiones. el consumo de PBC se cine a patrones de conducta muy variables pero siempre condicionadas a estimulos internos y externos, con poca o ninguna relacion con la euforia, sugiriendo un fenomeno asociado a la neurobiologia del aprendizaje",

      "title": "Acute and Long-Term Effects of Cannabis Use: A Review",
      "abstract": "Cannabis remains the most commonly used and trafficked illicit drug in the world. Its use is largely concentrated among young people (15- to 34-year-olds). There is a variety of cannabis use patterns, ranging from experimental use to dependent use. Men are more likely than women to report both early initiation and frequent use of cannabis. Due to the high prevalence of cannabis use, the impact of cannabis on public health may be significant. A range of acute and chronic health problems associated with cannabis use has been identified. Cannabis can frequently have negative effects in its users, which may be amplified by certain demographic and/or psychosocial factors. Acute adverse effects include hyperemesis syndrome, impaired coordination and performance, anxiety, suicidal ideations/tendencies, and psychotic symptoms. Acute cannabis consumption is also associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes, especially fatal collisions. Evidence indicates that frequent and prolonged use of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Chronic effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Keywords: Cannabis, marijuana, cannabinoids, dependence, addiction, THC, acute effects, long-term effects, and cannabis use disorders.",

      "title": "Cannabis, cannabinoids and health: a review of evidence on risks and medical benefits",
      "abstract": "Abstract The legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational purposes has progressed internationally. Cannabis and cannabinoids are advocated for a plethora of medical indications. An increasing number of medical and nonmedical users regularly consume large doses of delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component of cannabis. Aim: to summarize the evidence on (1) risks of recreational cannabis use and (2) effectiveness and safety of medicinal cannabis. Findings on recreational use: Cannabis is mostly used to experience its acute rewarding effects. Regular use of high THC products can produce addiction (cannabis use disorder or CUD). Acute consumption of high THC doses (including unintentionally) can cause time-limited mental, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular problems and motor vehicle accidents. Chronic patterns of cannabis use have been associated with multiple adverse outcomes that are of particular concern among adolescents and young adults, such as, disrupted learning, impaired cognitive performance, reduced educational attainment and an increased risk of CUD, psychosis/schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders and suicidal behaviors. There is debate about the extent to which cannabis use is a cause of these adverse outcomes. Physical health risks (e.g., respiratory and cardiovascular, prematurity and restricted fetal growth, hyperemesis syndrome among others) have also been linked with repeated consumption of cannabis with a high THC content. Findings on medical cannabis use: Herbal cannabis, medicines from extracted or synthetized cannabinoids—often used as adjuvants to standard medicines—may produce small to modest benefits. This is primarily the case in treating chronic pain, muscle spasticity, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and refractory epilepsy (in the case of cannabidiol, CBD). The evidence is inconclusive on their value in treating mental disorders and other medical conditions. Safety: Cannabis-based medicine is generally well tolerated. There is a risk of mild to moderate adverse effects and CUD.",

Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death.

      "abstract": "Objective: To discuss a case of synthethic marijuana use and subsequent withdrawal phenomenon that clinically resulted in PRES. Background: In the last decade synthetic marijuana has emerged as a new drug of abuse. Synthetic marijuana is colloquial known as “Spice,” which is typically composed of herbs, spices and other plant matter that are sprayed with at least one synthetic cannabinoid. They have diverse chemicals that are structurally distinct from THC. Given the heterogeneity of chemical composition, the intoxication effects are diverse. The presence of a withdrawal phenomenon following chronic use and clinical sequeale are not explored in the literature to date. Design/Methods: We discuss a case presentation of acute intoxication, withdrawal phenomenology and subsequent neurological complications of synthetic marijuana usage including PRES. Results: A 26yo man was found by police and paramedics to be confused and combative after he had smoked synthetic cannabinoids earlier in the evening. He was restrained by police and brought to the emergency department where he was noted to be febrile, combative and confused with normal heart rate and blood pressure. He had an unremarkable initial head computed tomography (CT) image. His labs were significant for hypernatremia, acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis. His LP showed no xanthochromia or pleocytosis. On days 2–4 of the hospitalization he exhibited autonomic instability following withdrawal of his daily consumption of synthetic marijuana. A MRI was eventually obtained following 8 days in the hospital because of unresolved encephalopathy. It showed evidence of PRES, right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), small bilateral cortical and corpus collosum hemorrhages and superior cerebellar vermis subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The CT angiogram (CTA) showed no evidence of vasospasm or vasoconstriction or aneurysm. Conclusions: Our patient exhibited withdrawal phenomenon following 2 days cessation of daily synthetic marijuana. Clinically the patient exhibited autonomic instability and poor mentation resulting radiographically in PRES, ICH and SAH. Disclosure: Dr. Stack has nothing to disclose.",

      "title": "Suicidal Ideation Induced by Episodic Cannabis Use",
      "abstract": "The report describes a patient who presented suicidal ideation only in two different occasions, immediately after acute cannabis intoxication. He used cannabis only in these two circumstances. Although a definite association between cannabis use and suicidal ideation or behavior has been already reported in the literature, the described case presents two original clinical aspects that deserve consideration. First, episodic assumption of cannabis induced suicidal ideation abruptly. Second, suicidal ideation appeared independent of mood depression, stressors, or life events, suggesting that suicidality may be not a direct consequence of depression and appears to be a relatively independent psychopathological dimension. There seems to be no linear relation between the severity of depression and the risk of suicide.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe principal routes of cocaine administration are oral, intranasal, intravenous, and inhalation.The slang terms for these routes are, respectively, \"chewing,\" \"snorting,\" \"mainlining,\" \"injecting,\" and \"smoking\" (including freebase and crack cocaine).Cocaine use ranges from occasional use to repeated or compulsive use, with a variety of patterns between these extremes.There is no safe way to use cocaine.Any route of administration can lead to absorption of toxic amounts of cocaine, allowing to acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular emergencies that could result in sudden death.Repeated cocaine use by any route of administration can produce addiction and other adverse health consequences.Those who snort or sniff cocaine through their noses suffer damage to their nasal and sinus passages.These include nasal crusting, nosebleeds, nasal congestion, irritation, facial pain caused by sinusitis and hoarseness.Cocaine addiction changes the responsiveness of the brain to various neurotransmitters or chemicals.The development of drug addiction involves persistent cellular and molecular changes in the Central Nervious System.The brain dopamine, GABA and glutamate systems play key roles in mediating drug-induced neuroadaptation.We show some physiological changes that can occur in some key pathways in which glutamate, dopamine and GABA receptors are involved.These chemical changes cause different effects in users, including: anxiety, confusion, dizziness, psychosis, headaches and nausea.Cocaine use and addiction affects the sympathetic nervous system (which controls automatic functions such as breathing, heartbeat, etc.).This system secretes adrenaline which raises ones heart rate, narrows blood vessels and significantly increases blood pressure.Chest pain, heart attacks and strokes are common side effects of cocaine use.The most widely studied neurobiological characteristic of cocaine addiction is the role played by dopamine transmission.It is clear that enhanced dopamine transmission in neurons projecting from the ventral mesencephalon to the limbic forebrain, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), is the pharmacological target for cocaine-induced reinforcement and locomotor stimulation (O'Brien., 2001) However, persistence of the behavioral characteristics of cocaine addiction, such as paranoia (sensitization) and the propensity to relapse years after the acute rewarding effects of the drug have disappeared, indicates that there must also be neuronal substrates undergoing Addictions -From Pathophysiology to Treatment 104 long-term neuroplastic changes.Although studies have endeavored to identify enduring changes in dopamine transmission that might underlie behavioral sensitization and the reinstatement of drug-seeking (relapse), the results have not been entirely consistent with an obligatory role for dopamine.Addiction can be viewed as a form of drug-induced neural plasticity.One of the bestestablished molecular mechanisms of addiction is up-regulation of the cAMP second messenger pathway, which occurs in many neuronal cell types in response to chronic administration of opiates or other drugs of abuse.This up-regulation and the resulting activation of the transcription factor CREB appear to mediate aspects of tolerance and dependence.In contrast, induction of another transcription factor, termed 1FosB, exerts the opposite effect and may contribute to sensitized responses to drug exposure.Knowledge of these mechanisms could lead to more effective treatments for addictive disorders.Cocaine Dopamine Tansporter (DAT) Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) Serotonine Transporter (SERT)",

Symptoms of cannabis intoxication or withdrawal need to be disentangled from symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Cannabis use disorders and psychiatric disorders worsen each other. Cannabis use disorders could induce psychiatric disorders, in particular depressive disorders and anxiety disorders. Cannabis withdrawal anxiety typically begins after cannabis use has been stopped or reduced. Patients with cannabis use disorder experience, on a daily basis, subthreshold withdrawal anxiety symptoms, characterized by irritability associated with craving for cannabis. By contrast, individuals with primary anxiety disorders have different features. Integrated approaches to treatment for patients presenting with co-occurring cannabis use disorders and psychiatric disorders are recommended, including simultaneous treatments.Consommation de cannabis et comorbidités psychiatriques.

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

Su uso, por vía oral o esnifada, se ha visto incrementado en los últimos años, con efectos psicopatológicos variables. CASO CLÍNICO Presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 22 años, que inicia seguimiento recientemente en su centro de salud mental, observándose rasgos narcisistas de personalidad. Es traído a Urgencias por sobreingesta medicamentosa e intento de ahorcamiento. Reconoce consumo frecuente de tusi o cocaína rosa, refiriendo además sentirse muy inquieto, nervioso y con ideas de muerte y autolesión, llegando a ingerir cantidades excesivas de lormetazepam o intentarse ahorcar en casa, de forma muy impulsiva y sin otro desencadenante aparente. El screening de drogas de abuso resulta negativo para las sustancias estudiadas. DISCUSIÓN Los efectos clínicos del 2C se encuentran entre lo estimulante y lo psicodélico, con sensación de bienestar, euforia, incremento de la sociabilidad, y a más dosis, alteraciones sensoperceptivas. Se ha descrito la aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras su consumo. La aparición de marcada ansiedad, impulsividad y conducta suicida podría estar relacionada con el consumo de esta sustancia, con consecuencias graves. CONCLUSIÓN Se necesita estudiar con mayor profundidad los efectos clínicos, psicopatológicos y especialmente sobre la conducta suicida del consumo de fenetilaminas, cuyo uso va en aumento, según los últimos datos. La correcta anamnesis en los hábitos de consumo debe ocupar un lugar primordial, y estar en alerta al no ser siempre detectada en los tests de drogas de abuso habituales.",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

A two-compartment model consisting of and dependence was used to clarify clinical features of dependence. was defined by drug liking. Dependence was defined by a compulsion to take a drug, and drug-induced pathological symptoms (withdrawal syndrome and acute disorders) and social disturbance. Nicotine produced a mild or the least degree of drug liking and withdrawal syndrome, without any significant social disturbance, or acute disorders. Thus, differed from other forms of drug in that was not associated with dependence syndrome. This review also introduced other current topics of dependence. First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse. However, further studies should be carried out to clarify clinical characteristics of the nicotine paradox.",

      "title": "Persistent Psychosis After a Single Ingestion of “Ecstasy” (MDMA)",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The street drug “ecstasy” (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; also “X” or “E”]) is a synthetic amphetamine that has both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties.1 It is increasingly used as a recreational drug and has a strong association with the “rave” culture. Subjective effects of MDMA include elevated mood, increased self-confidence and sensory sensitivity, and a peaceful feeling coupled with insight, empathy, and closeness to persons.2 It has gained a deceptive reputation as a “safe” drug among its users. MDMA use has been associated with various medical complications such as renal and liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, cerebral infarction, seizures, delirium, fulminant hyperthermia, intracranial bleed, cerebral edema, and coma.3–6 Adverse psychiatric symptomatology associated with MDMA includes panic attack, depression, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, rage reactions, psychosis, and severe paranoia.3 Persistent psychosis after even a single use has been reported.1,4,7 This case report describes persistent psychosis in a previously healthy adolescent girl after a single ingestion of MDMA\r\n\r\nCase report. In October 2010, Ms A, a 17-year-old African American girl without previous psychiatric or medical history, obtained MDMA from her friend and ingested the pill. She began experiencing auditory hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and behavior shortly thereafter. She was taken to the University of South Alabama, Mobile, emergency department for evaluation and treatment of her behavior. In the emergency department, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist noticed that the patient was awake and alert, but could not engage in meaningful communication. Results of routine laboratory testing showed no alcohol or illicit drugs present. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was seen by the neurology service, where physicians believed that the patient had no obvious etiology for her current symptomatology. There was no family history of mood disorders or psychosis among first- or second-degree relatives. The patient was cleared medically in the emergency department and was then transferred to an acute care inpatient psychiatric unit affiliated with the University of South Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn the psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate odd, bizarre behavior. She exhibited frequent episodes of crying and using profanity. She displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, eg, touching others sexually, dancing seductively, and assuming unusual postures by putting her hands underneath her pelvis while pushing the pelvis upwards. In addition, she attempted to eat food from another person's plate and multiple trash cans. Her speech was mostly nonsensical, and at times she claimed that she was pregnant and had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. She appeared to be responding strongly to internal stimuli. She gave the appearance of being paranoid, feeling scared, and being socially withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAfter a literature review, we decided to institute olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg every 12 hours. Haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg were also employed on an as-needed basis and were administered frequently over several days. After 14 days of this medication regimen, normal behavior was noticed, but there were intervals during which she became agitated and confused. After that point, her family had decided to take her home against medical advice. She was sent to school for a day by family to resume a normal life (she is an honor roll student and had been accepted to college on a scholarship). According to the family, the school personnel advised her to go back home immediately because “she is not normal.” She was promptly rehospitalized in our care due to frequent agitation, confusion, leaving the house at night, and walking in traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the unit, her assessment demonstrated her to be staring off blankly into space and making repetitive hand, eye, and head movements while screaming. She was placed on 1:1 observation due to her unpredictable behavior. Olanzapine was increased to 15 mg every 12 hours. Gradually, her behavior improved, such that she was no longer displaying stereotypic behavior. She was capable of having meaningful conversations. Furthermore, her reality testing improved. Upon discharge, she showed improvement of symptoms and organized thoughts. However, she continued to describe dysphoric mood. She recounted use of MDMA in October. Instantaneously she noticed she was not herself nor did she recall what happened immediately after taking MDMA.\r\n\r\nMDMA-induced psychotic disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by several characteristics associated with the former, including complete lack of prodromal symptoms (social withdrawal, anxiety, or lack of motivation), absence of sustained mood disturbance, and good premorbid functioning.1 The cause of MDMA-induced psychotic symptoms is not well understood.1 Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that MDMA reduces levels of brain serotonergic activity and depletes serotonin stores.8 MDMA acts by binding to presynaptic monoamine transporters, most strongly to the serotonin receptor transporter, causing rapid release and subsequent depletion of serotonin and dopamine from presynaptic terminals.6,9–11 Further damage is caused by the generation of free radicals that are taken by the serotonin nerve terminal, exhausting the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues.12 In laboratory animals, MDMA causes persistent damage to serotonergic neurons.6,9,12 It is thought that it causes similar damage to neurons in the human brain. MDMA does not have a potent direct agonist effect on dopamine receptors.1,2 MDMA may induce psychosis through dopaminergic or serotonergic pathways.13 Our patient did not have medical complications, as compared to a published case report.14 In our case, there was no laboratory toxicology evidence of MDMA exposure; however, routine toxicology screens do not screen for MDMA. Furthermore, presumptive diagnosis of MDMA use is often made without toxicologic evidence. In our patient, we were able to support MDMA use through patient interview and collateral from friends and family. The use of high-dose antipsychotic medication (haloperidol and olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (diazepam and carbamazepine) has been documented for the treatment of psychosis after MDMA use.1,5,6,15\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of MDMA and the potential adverse effects associated with it underlines the need for clinicians to inquire carefully about MDMA use and to include MDMA in toxicology screenings. MDMA use as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with paranoid psychosis, affective disorders, or anxiety has become increasingly important. When MDMA exposure is suspected, there should be close collaboration between the psychiatrist and medical personnel, since MDMA use is associated with serious medical complications. Whether these complications are due to MDMA use directly or caused by unrelated adulterants added during manufacturing is an area of ongoing research. Further studies are required to clarify the etiology of persistent psychosis after MDMA use and to describe the treatment options.",

      "abstract": "espanolLa adiccion a los preparados de cannabis sativa es un problema relevante en nuestra sociedad, con especial importancia durante la adolescencia. Su facil disponibilidad y los episodios adversos asociados a su abuso y/o dependencia han incrementado la demanda de tratamiento derivada por su consumo. En los ultimos 20 anos se ha podido avanzar mucho sobre la farmacologia del cannabis y de sus principios activos, moleculas grasas que actuan a traves de un sistema de senalizacion endogeno denominado sistema endocannabinoide implicado en el desarrollo y la plasticidad cerebrales. Su estimulacion cronica puede inducir no solo dependencia y adiccion, sino tambien derivar en consecuencias neurobiologicas que tienen repercusion clinica. Asi, por un lado se puede encontrar el incremento de trastornos mentales tanto primarios como inducidos (trastornos del estado de animo, trastornos de ansiedad y trastornos psicoticos) y por el otro, alteraciones en los procesos cognitivos (memoria, atencion, toma de decisiones, asuncion de riesgos, control de impulsos). Estas consecuencias son mas graves si el consumo se realiza en la adolescencia. Algunos de estos efectos son permanentes y el conocimiento de los mismos necesario para una correcta atencion sanitaria. EnglishAddiction to products derived from the plant cannabis sativa has become a relevant problem in western societies. Its prevalence in both teenagers and young adults has grown in the last decade. The problem is aggravated by the availability of plant derivatives with a high THC content. Today, the number of cannabis users requesting medical treatment is growing, as well as the incidence and variety of the adverse effects associated with its chronic consumption. On the other hand, the last 20 years� research have revealed the hidden pharmacology of the active principles of cannabis. Cannabinoids, the psychoactive chemicals of the plant, exert their pharmacological actions through their interaction with an endogenous signaling system, the endocannabinoid system. This system is involved in brain development, plasticity and repair, and its chronic stimulation can induce not only dependence/addiction, but also result in adverse clinical effects. The negative side of cannabis use has greatest impact in the adolescent period. The main adverse effects of chronic cannabis use include the increase in the incidence of mental disorders (mainly psychosis), as well as alterations in cognitive processes including memory, attention, decision-making, risk behaviors as well as impulsivity. Some of these effects are permanent and information and research on their nature is greatly needed in order to achieve a correct public health approach to cannabis use.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. In recent years there has been a rising trend of anticholinergics use among high school students and it is especially common to mix alcohol with anticholinergics. The characteristic features of anticholinergic intoxication are the rapid onset of alterations in mood, cognition and perception in the presence of a clear sensorium and following the ingestion of the drug in a commonly distributable form. But if psychotic symptoms are present in the absence of retained reality testing a diagnosis of substance- induced psychotic disorder may be warranted. Therefore, in same cases clinical picture presents a differential diagnostic dilemma. Case Outline. The authors present the case report of twenty-one year old male with dependence of multiple drug use (according the criteria of ICD-X ) ,who was observed in the Detoxication Clinic. In early adolescence he used different psychoactive substances (opiate and nonopiate psychoactive substances). During the last two years he episodically consumed anticholinergics. Upon the mixed use of alcohol with anticholinergics he experienced auditory hallucinations, rapid and incoherent speech and paranoid ideation. He acted out his imperative hallucinations aggressively and violently. During hospital treatment he was treated with antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines and supportive and educational therapies. Conclusion. On this regiment psychotic symptoms resolved completely. Results of the complete psychiatricpsychological examination did not indicate psychotic disorder. .",

      "title": "Diagnóstico y tratamiento del insomnio en el adulto mayor",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the diffi culty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy.

      "abstract": "TCA are used for the treatment of major depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, chronic pain syndromes, and peripheral neuropathies associated with psychiatric and medical conditions that call for a higher rate of prescription drugs. Frequently observed toxic symptoms are sinus tachycardia and altered mental status. Severe toxic symptoms include altered mental status, dysrhythmia, seizure, and secondary complications. Serious cardiotoxicity can lead to ventricular dysrhythmia and a classic TCA electrocardiogram. Gluteal myonecrosis is reported in postoperative alcoholic states, unconscious conditions where patients remain in one position over a long period of time, strenuous physical training, or in crushing injuries. We report a case of gluteal myonecrosis after treatment with several drugs including TCA resulted in intoxication. The patient was mentally drowsy and had been lying down for 20 hours upon discovery. The patient presented on arrival to the ER with cardiotoxicity secondary to TCA intoxication and was treated. Two weeks following the incident, she complained of pain in the gluteal area. Subsequent management and investigation revealed that her gluteal myonecrosis was a result of delayed complication from a prolonged recumbent position and hemolysis due to drug interactions. She eventually recovered without the need for surgery (fasciotomy).",

      "title": "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse has become a social and medical problem. Amphetamine and cocaine have a potent sympathicomimetic action, so they have important effects on the Central Nervous and Cardiovascular Systems. Their neurological complications are principally: psychic alterations, seizures and stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic). The latter are the most important in the clinical practice. Their capacity to produce transit arterial hypertension and cerebral vascular constriction could be the physiopathological substrate of such alterations. Angiographic studies have shown lesions suggesting vasculopathy. In the last ten years cocaine abuse has become an authentic epidemic. We have reviewed its neurological complications, particularly the vascular ones--42 hemorrhagic and 24 ischemic--and the following conclusions were drawn: it should be considered as a risk factor in the younger age group; a short period of time between the last drug dose and the clinical picture is frequently seen; clinical features may appear with the first drug administration; no characteristic lesion in relation to the way of administration or consumption time was elicited.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol and other psychoactive drugs are oftentimes implicated in legal cases. A pertinent question herein is whether such substances might adversely affect testimonies of victims, eyewitnesses, or suspects by propelling the formation of false memory and increasing susceptibility to suggestion. In the current review, we amassed all available evidence on the effects of intoxication on false memory formation and suggestibility, including the substances alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, stimulants, hallucinogens, and antipsychotics. Our review indicated that alcohol and cannabis under certain conditions increased the susceptibility to false memories and/or suggestion with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. When intoxicated during an event, alcohol is most likely to increase this susceptibility at high intoxication levels or after a delay, whereas cannabis exerts detrimental effects during acute intoxication but not necessarily once sober. For other substances, ecologically valid research separating different memory phases is needed. Overall, differences between substances regarding false memory effects exist, suggesting that a nuanced approach is needed when dealing with intoxicated individuals in a legal context.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1.5% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and approximately 61,500 deaths involved stimulant use in 2022. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction, stroke) and psychiatric (agitation, delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. Contingency management has been shown to be effective for stimulant use disorder. Other psychosocial modalities may reduce stimulant use among selected individuals; these include individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, and community reinforcement. Medications may provide modest benefits, including bupropion with or without naltrexone, topiramate, mirtazapine, and prescription stimulants. Harm reduction interventions such as syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased complications related to stimulant use. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "title": "Experience with Drugs and Driving in Queensland, Australia",
      "abstract": "The effect of any one psychoactive drug on an individual is a function of its interaction with that individual; for this reason, the effect upon one person may not be the same as on another person. When two or more drugs are given at the same time, their effect may be one of antagonism, synergism or potentiation. The effects of a psychotropic drug (ataxia, incoordination, altered level of consciousness or awareness, disturbances of vision and increased reaction time) must surely impair the skills required for safe driving. Many prescribed drugs acting principally on the central nervous system are capable of impairing driving performance: analgesics, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics and tranquillizers. Other prescribed drugs: anti-histamines, hypotensive agents, hypoglycaemic substances may produce undesirable side effects which impair driving performance. In Queensland if breath analysis indicated a BAC too low to account for a driver's behaviour, a doctor is called to examine the driver, and samples of blood and urine are forwarded to a central laboratory. If the blood concentration of a drug equals or exceeds the accepted therapeutic level of the particular substance, the driver is considered to be under the influence of the drug. The most dangerous period is during the initial stage of taking a prescribed drug. Psychotropic drugs taken in prescribed dosage may initially produce drowsiness, ataxia, impaired judgement and increased reaction time. After a period of time, tolerance to the drug develops, with marked reduction in unwanted side effects. The most common drugs include morphine, pethidine, methadone, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. The common purpose for such abuse is to get high -a stage of unreality characterized by euphoria and/or hallucinations, either visual or auditory or both. Intoxication by any of these drugs produces severe impairment of driving skills. An exaggerated pharmacological effect commonly occurs when alcohol is taken at the same time as another psychoactive drug. Benzodiazepines are the prescribed drug most commonly involved in instances of driving impairment, both alone and in combination with alcohol. Some drugs commonly associated with impaired driving performance are: mandrax, methadone and diazepam. The extent of the contribution of drivers impaired by drugs and drug-alcohol interaction to traffic accidents has not yet been defined. It will not be defined until all countries enact effective legislation to enable such drivers to be identified. The use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs in Australia has been increasing steadily over the past few years, and continues to increase. It is impossible to obtain accurate figures on the consumption of psychotropic drugs in Australia. (Shortened Author Abstract/TRRL)",

Cocaine-induced excited delirium refers to fatal cocaine intoxication with the following symptoms occurring sequentially: hyperthermia, delirium with agitation, respiratory arrest, and death. We present a case of cocaine-induced excited delirium in a cocaine \"body packer\" or a \"mule\", specifically an individual who attempts to smuggle cocaine within the body. Investigators at the scene initially suspected homicide due to the victim's sharp and blunt force injuries. Three rubber packets containing cocaine were removed from the victim's rectum. Blood toxicological analysis revealed an alcohol concentration of 0.016 g/100 and cocaine >1 mg/L. The forensic pathologist should consider cocaine-induced excited delirium when an individual exhibits aggressive behavior, unexpected strength, and resistance to pain who dies suddenly. Further analysis should be performed during the scene investigation and autopsy for evidence of body packing.",

Tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) is the psychoactive agent in the leaves of marijuana plants; a number of synthetic cannabinoids have also been recently developed which are more potent. Marijuana users may experience relaxation, euphoria, and mild hallucinogenic effects. Some may experience nausea and vomiting after using marijuana; synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Regular users may experience drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness with cessation of use. Serious medical complications are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users, and acute cognitive and motor impairment. Psychosocial modalities appear to help those who wish to stop or cut down on use. There are no medications that have been shown to be effective for cannabinoid use disorders.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients with Substance Intoxication Presenting to the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, revision 10 (ICD-10) describes intoxication as \"a transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.\"[1] Intoxication is generally an acute phenomenon, the intensity and effects of which wear off with time and disappear completely in the absence of further use of the substance. While most episodes of intoxication do not need medical attention, intoxicated patients may sometimes present to the emergency department.[1] The reasons for seeking medical attention may either be due to the substance use itself (e.g., extreme agitation or violent behavior that may endanger the patient or others around them) or due to an adverse consequence of substance use (e.g., head injury in a road traffic accident that occurred due to driving while intoxicated). Common substances of intoxication encountered in the emergency setting in India are alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cases of intoxication from other substances like inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and newer psychoactive substances including synthetic cannabinoids and club drugs may also present to the emergency unit. Often the substance of intoxication may be unknown or falsely reported due to fear of legal ramifications or there may be use of more than one intoxicating substance, thereby complicating the clinical picture. Patients may present with decreased levels of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, or other symptoms that may resemble other medical or surgical emergencies. It is, thus, imperative that psychiatrists attending to patients in the emergency department be well-versed with identification, assessment, and management of patients with substance intoxication.[2] Caring for intoxicated patients in the emergency department comes with various other issues that require a psychiatrist's time and effort. These patients may be brought into the emergency department against their wishes and refuse medical care. They may also be brought in for medical attention by law enforcement authorities with no available identification details and reliable history or even in association with an alleged crime or illegal activity, making it essential for the emergency care provider to be competent in dealing with the medicolegal aspects of intoxication and providing optimum medical services to the patient along with safeguarding the legal procedures. The present clinical practice guidelines deal with the assessment and management of patients with substance intoxication presenting to the emergency department. The guidelines present the general considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient, followed by general signs of intoxication. Thereafter, details of intoxication with specific substances are discussed, namely, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other substances. Features of intoxication, assessment, and management are discussed for each of these substances. Multiple substance intoxication is also discussed in the guidelines. Special populations are referred to in the guidelines, including children and adolescents, women, and the elderly population. The guidelines do not cover nicotine or caffeine intoxication (these are unlikely to be encountered in a clinical setting). Accidental ingestion of substances of use is not catered to in these guidelines. We also do not go into details of intoxication presenting with additional psychiatric and/or medical illnesses and each such case is likely to be unique with its own specific constraints and challenges in management. General considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient Patients with intoxication with a substance of abuse present several challenges during assessment and management [Figure 1]. One of the foremost concerns is the potential unreliability of history. Patients with substance intoxication may give inaccurate or unreliable history. This may be partly attributable to patients trying to minimize their substance use, not recollecting details adequately due to cognitive impact of the substance, concealment of the details of substance use from the family, or avoiding sharing details to prevent legal ramifications. Thus, multiple sources of information can be referred to obtain a more comprehensive account of the patient's condition. Friends, family, and previous treatment records can be useful sources of collateral information about the patient. In some circumstances, physical examination and mental status examination of an uncooperative patient can be helpful to get a clearer clinical picture of the patient (e.g., injection track marks can hint at opioid overdose in an otherwise comatose patient).Figure 1: Challenges in assessment and management of patients with substance intoxicationAnother challenge that comes across in patients with intoxication is the occurrence of agitation or violence. Some of the intoxications with substances like alcohol and stimulants like cocaine may be associated to aggression. Aggression may be due to disinhibition and impaired judgement associated with substance use. Furthermore, substance use disorder may be associated with other psychiatric or medical illnesses that may individually contribute to the state of agitation or aggression. Addressing aggression promptly is required to prevent harm to the self and others. Other relevant guidelines of the Indian Psychiatric Society may be referred to while addressing aggression and violence when patients with substance intoxication present to the emergency department. A related issue is the consumption of substances or presentation with substance intoxication when the patient intends to kill themself. This may be a presenting feature in patients with overdose of opioids or sedative-hypnotics. Sometimes, patients may also consume large amounts of alcohol when they have an intent to die. Thus, self-harm should be considered as a possibility when patients present with substance intoxication, and suitable assessment measures should ascertain risk to self and the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorder. If required, additional treatment should be instituted for the patient. A relevant aspect of consideration is to determine the line between simply the use of a substance or substance intoxication. Description in the ICD-11 mentions substance intoxication as occurrence of \"clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration.\"[3] Hence there is a leeway for the clinician to determine what is considered as \"clinically significant\". One way to simply operationalize is to consider any clinical encounter with a patient having a recent history of substance use which has resulted in the abovementioned mental or neuropsychiatric disturbances and are brought to the emergency/clinical setting as \"clinically significant\" (those situations where these disturbances are expected by the person and are found to be pleasurable would be considered simply as use). The disturbances are described as transient and reversible, and hence they are expected to abate with time. Patients with substance intoxication may have an issue related to their mental competence. Substance use may result in impairment of judgement or consciousness. This may result in impairment of competence, that is, the ability of the person to comprehend choices, decide a course of action, and communicate their choice back. This lack of competence has a bearing on treatment choices that should be instituted and promulgation of coerced treatment. It is generally accepted that when a person is not found to be competent, the nominated representative can be the proxy decisionmaker for the person. The treatment providers can also institute emergency treatment in the best interests of the patient. Furthermore, substance intoxication is a reversible process, so if emergency treatment is not required, then one can wait for the patient to re-attain competence as the substance intoxication wanes. A clinical consideration for patients with substance use disorders is the concurrent use of many substances together. This may lead to the clinical picture being altered or complicated by features of intoxication or withdrawal from different substances. For example, a patient with opioid dependence may experience sedation during intoxication. If benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently with opioids, then the sedation may be accentuated. In such a patient, reversal using naloxone may offset the features of intoxication from opioids, but not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. Similarly, intoxication from cocaine and other stimulants may lead to paranoia, which may be accentuated by the consumption of higher than usual amounts of cannabis. Thus, a clinician needs to be open to the idea of multiple substance consumption in a patient with substance intoxication. Another issue in the clinical management of patients with substance intoxication in the emergency setting is the potential lack of social support in the treatment process. Patients may be consuming substances alone, or it is possible that casual acquaintances do not intend to help or are not in a position to help (due to their own intoxication as well). Family and friends may be disinclined or burnt out due to the substance use disorder and hence may not be forthcoming in engaging with the care process. Thus, the ancillary supports available in the treatment process of patients with substance intoxication may be few. Sometimes, police or other bystanders may bring a patient with substance intoxication to the emergency unit and the identity of the patient may be unknown to them. Thus, clinicians may have to work with limited information on occasions. There may be legal concerns with the consumption of certain substances considered illegal under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This may make patients hesitant to disclose use of some of the substances; for example, heroin. Treating psychiatrists might also be apprehensive about documentation. However, it should be reiterated that clinicians can help patients better if they are able to get a reliable history of the patient. Thus, it would be preferable to gather detailed information and document suitably while ensuring confidentiality of the treatment records and providing reassurance about this to the patient. It might also be prudent to perform urine or blood testing for substance abuse, ensuring a safe chain of custody of the sample. It is unlikely that such treatment records are referred to by the legal process, but a psychiatrist may need to present the relevant information to courts when requested through due processing. General signs of intoxication As specified in the ICD-11,[3] intoxication from one or more psychoactive substances may be suspected in cases where the following features are present: Transient, but clinically significant disturbances occur in consciousness, coordination, perception, cognition, affect, or behavior that develop during or shortly after the consumption/administration of the substance(s) The symptoms are in accordance with the known pharmacological effects of the substance. The intensity of the symptoms is closely related to the amount of substance consumed/administered. The symptoms are time-limited and subside as the substance is cleared away from the body. The symptoms cannot be better explained by another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Table 1 enumerates signs and symptoms of intoxication with different substances.Table 1: Features of intoxication with common psychoactive substancesGeneral management of intoxicated patients in the emergency setting As mentioned earlier, patients presenting with intoxication may prove challenging to manage. Intoxicated behavior may often be confused with other disease conditions and vice versa. A brief outline on general management of a patient presenting with intoxication is given in Figure 2.Figure 2: General management of intoxicated patients in an emergency settingALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Alcohol (primarily) is a widely used psychoactive substance globally and in India. In people aged 20–39 years, approximately 13.5% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol. More than 200 disease and injury conditions are related to alcohol use. Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program of United States, which included non-fatal emergency department visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, indicated that in 2020 1.8% of the total annual emergency visits were related to alcohol use. Of the many alcohol related disorders presenting to the emergency department in India, a vast majority presents with road traffic accidents due to driving under intoxication followed by acute alcohol poisoning, which is defined as ingestion of a large amount of alcohol in a short duration of time.[4] Clinical features of alcohol intoxication Alcohol is a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Acute ingestion generally results in elevation of mood, disinhibition, and increased confidence, leading to argumentative or combative behavior. In addition to those mentioned in Table 1, some features of alcohol intoxication seen with increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are discussed in Table 2. In naïve drinkers, BAC of 150–250 mg per 100 ml result in clinically apparent intoxication; BAC of 350 mg per 100 ml cause stupor and coma; while levels more than 450 mg per 100 ml can be fatal. Regular users of alcohol often develop tolerance and are significantly less likely to manifest symptoms/signs of intoxication at the same BAC than non-regular drinkers.[5] Effects can last from 2 to 3 hours after a few drinks to up to 24 hours after heavy drinking.Table 2: Effects of increasing blood alcohol concentrationAssessment of alcohol intoxication An asssessment of a patient presenting with alcohol intoxication aims at identifying the immediate risks to the patient and attendants and uncovering maladaptive patterns of alcohol use that may require specialized management and care. Acute alcohol intoxication may result in several metabolic abnormalities, like hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Thus, these may be required on an urgent basis. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachy-dysrhythmias. Hence, an urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) may be required. Further discussed are the assessment measures for alcohol intoxication: Clinical history Elicit details of current episode of alcohol use: amount, preparation, duration, mixing with other substances, etc. Ask for similar details about previous drinking episodes. Elicit, wherever possible, events of high-risk behavior under intoxication: driving, operating heavy machinery, self-harm, or violence toward others. Attempt should be made, wherever possible, to identify alcohol dependence or harmful use pattern. Physical Examination Assess levels of consciousness (the Glasgow Coma Scale may be used), cardiac and respiratory parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate), and urine output, if possible, with hourly intervals until parameters begin to normalize. Unresponsive patients may suffer from an occult head injury that may be identified from increased intracranial pressure. It is thus advised to perform a direct ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema, which is a clinical sign for increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema without increased intracranial pressure may also be seen in methyl alcohol poisoning. Thus, imaging (CT/MRI) may be required to determine definitive management. In responsive patients, rule out diplopia and assess eye movements in all cardinal positions, any muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Observe for any abnormal or involuntary movements. Check for other physical injuries and bleeding from the ear, nose, or mouth. Mental status examination Assess for speech and behavioral abnormalities; pay special attention to aggressive behaviors, and ensure patient and staff safety. Assess thought and perceptual disturbances. Assess orientation to time and place: immediate, recent, and remote memory, insight, and reality testing. Rule out other causes of altered sensorium: Metabolic causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperosmolar hypoglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and metabolic acidosis may be detected by laboratory investigations including blood glucose, renal function tests, and arterial blood gases. Cerebral trauma, cerebrovascular events, and meningitis may be identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Encephalopathies and toxicity from other substances (methanol, lithium, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and isoniazid) may be identified through laboratory investigations for serum ammonia, and levels of suspected agents in the blood. Higher serum levels than the therapeutic window indicates toxicity. The abovementioned assessments and investigations are based on individual case considerations and clinical suspicion. MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Individuals with some symptoms of alcohol intoxication (mild and moderate cases, i.e., without impairment of consciousness or significant medical issues) can be managed in relatively simple surroundings without much medical intervention. Those who are severely intoxicated should be admitted and further managed in a setting where high-dependency or intensive care can be provided.[4,6] Treatment for acute alcohol toxicity is largely supportive. The first priority is airway protection and maintenance of breathing as respiratory depression due to alcohol intoxication may result in death. Alcohol acts as a diuretic; thus, patients with signs of dehydration (dry lips and mucosae and poor urine output) may be provided with intravenous fluids. Checking glucose is important, as many individuals with alcohol use disorder may have depleted glycogen stores. Hypoglycemia needs to be corrected with 5% dextrose intravenously. Routine use of vitamins is not necessary for all cases of alcohol intoxication. However, thiamine supplementation is needed for patients with alcohol dependence to prevent the occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, prophylactic thiamine may be administered to patients who appear at risk of developing thiamine deficiency (prolonged use of alcohol, poor nutritional status, confused mental state, gait abnormalities, and ophthalmoplegia).[7] Usual dose should be at least 250 mg of thiamine daily intramuscularly for 3–5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100 mg daily.[8] It is important to remember that in an emergency setting, thiamine is to be administered before glucose replenishment so that the glucose is utilized in ATP generation (which utilizes thiamine as a co-factor), preventing sequestration of the already limited thiamine which may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. A brief schematic flowchart for management of alcohol intoxication in the emergency setting is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of alcohol intoxication in an emergency setting General management Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and maintain urine output. Hypoglycemia should be corrected with oral glucose, if conscious level permits, or else with 5% or 10% intravenous (IV) dextrose. Maintain ambient room temperature, with quiet surroundings and minimal disturbance. At least one electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for all heavily intoxicated patients and for those with known cardiovascular conditions. \"Holiday heart syndrome\" characterized by new-onset arrhythmias/atrial fibrillation can occur following alcohol ingestion. Serial ECG monitoring should be done if arrhythmia is detected. As intoxication abates, ECG changes should resolve, but if the changes persist an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated from the patient, a CT scan of the head can be considered for detecting intracranial pathology contributing to the patients' mental status (e.g., subdural hematoma). MRI can also be considered for select cases. If suicidality is expressed, then psychiatric evaluation should be considered. Laboratory investigations Blood glucose, plasma electrolytes, and blood gases should be measured as frequently as possible in patients with altered sensorium until recovery is assured. Urine toxicology may be performed, if needed, to check for presence of narcotics and sedatives, if suspected. Complete blood counts can be done to detect megaloblastic anemia. Liver function tests should be done when prolonged harmful pattern of alcohol use is suspected. Renal function tests should be done in cases of altered sensorium, poor urine output, or if behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Blood alcohol levels may be required in medicolegal cases when reliable history is not available or when behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Whole blood thiamine levels may be measured in patients at risk of or suspected to develop Wernicke's encephalopathy. Symptomatic management Control aggression by adopting a concerned and non-threatening demeanor. Sedatives should be used judiciously to avoid over-sedation. Metadoxine (given as a single IV/intramuscular [IM] injection of 300–600 mg) may be used to accelerate the elimination of alcohol in adults leading to faster recovery from intoxication. In cases of agitation or violence, antipsychotics (haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine 50 mg) should be considered. In-patient admission of a patient with alcohol intoxication can be considered when there is severe intoxication, medical complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, dysrhythmias or convulsions, persistent disorientation, continued abnormality in cardiopulmonary parameters, known chronic systemic illnesses that require medical attention independently, prolonged aggressive behavior, or perceptual abnormalities. The specialty under which the patient needs to be admitted can be determined according to the indication for admission. CANNABIS INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Cannabis is the most common illicit substance of abuse in India. Cannabis intoxication sometimes presents to the emergency setting after consumption (either inhalational or oral) of high amounts of cannabis. It usually presents in those who have never tried cannabis before and experience severe psychiatric or medical manifestation of cannabis consumption. Sometimes, regular cannabis users may also experience symptoms and signs of cannabis intoxication when they are introduced to a cannabis product of higher potency. Cannabis intoxication manifests with several symptoms as mentioned in Table 3.[9] There can be several physical symptoms of cannabis intoxication. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nystagmus, increased appetite, and, rarely, precipitation of arrhythmias, angina, or myocardial infarction. Rarely, deep inhalation or breath holding may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Marked perceptual and mental status changes can be observed in cases of cannabis intoxication. These can include alteration in perception of time, with the perceived time being faster than clock time. Music is perceived as more engrossing and colors may appear brighter. There may be hallucinations, primarily auditory ones. There can be a sense of depersonalization. One may become more self-conscious, and may manifest paranoid thinking or delusions (persecutory, referential, or grandiose). Cannabis intoxication affects cognition and psychomotor performance as well. There may be motor incoordination and impaired attention and concentration. Judgment may be impaired due to cannabis intoxication.Table 3: Features of cannabis intoxicationThe cognitive and psychomotor features of intoxication may not be immediately apparent and may manifest up to three hours after consumption of the cannabis product. This may lead novice users to consume higher amounts and experience dysphoria, anxiety, perceptual alterations, and cognitive changes to a higher than anticipated extent. These features of intoxication may last even for 12 to 24 hours after the consumption of cannabis due to accumulation in the adipose tissue and gradual release afterwards. Assessment of patients with cannabis intoxication The assessment of cannabis intoxication is through elaboration of the history and conduct of the examination, supplemented with urine drug screening. Patients presenting to the emergency department with panic attacks or psychotic symptoms after cannabis usage can describe their psychopathology. Attempts should be made to assess the consumption of cannabis products prior to occurrence of such symptoms. Sometimes, friends and family members can provide corollary information. A physical examination that reveals bilateral conjunctival injection without itchiness or pain may indicate cannabis intoxication. A high degree of suspicion may be necessary as the patient may not be forthcoming with proper history, fearing legal or social repercussions. Urine enzyme-linked immunodorbet assay (ELISA) tests might provide objective information about consumption of cannabis, as cannabis remains in the body and is excreted in the urine for at least three days in infrequent consumers and for an even longer duration for regular users. One has to be cautious about urine false positives for cannabis due to efavirenz and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication may include intoxication with other substances of use like cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines, and synthetic cannabinoids. When a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks, one should evaluate for the exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric illness like schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic disorder, or panic disorder. Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting can be initiated with placing the patient in a dimly lit space, reassuring them, and decreasing stimulation. In most cases, the intoxication would fade in a few hours. The patient may be given benzodiazepine orally if the patient is accepting the medication orally. Clonazepam 0.5 mg or lorazepam 1 mg can be given in such a situation. If the patient is agitated or violent, then appropriate measures should be taken for the management of agitation or violence. This may include use of antipsychotics (like haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine (Phenergan) 25 mg, given intravenously or intramuscularly), or cautious and limited use of restraints. In cases of chest pain, the patient should be evaluated for cardiac or pulmonary etiological causes. These may focus on myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, or evaluation of exacerbation of asthma. ECG or X-rays coupled with referral to cardiologists/pulmonologists or medicine specialists would be useful. Once the patient recovers from cannabis intoxication, they should be debriefed and offered counseling, providing information about harms associated with cannabis use. If a cannabis use disorder is identified (harmful use or dependence), then the patient should be suitably referred for further treatment of substance use disorder. OPIOID INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Opioids are highly dependence-producing substances. Opioids used commonly include both pharmaceutical ones (used generally in the form of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and pentazocine), and non-pharmaceutical ones (generally used for recreational purposes like heroin and raw opium). Intoxication with opioids can be intentional (a patient may be taking increased amounts of opioids to experience a more intense high or as an attempt to harm oneself) or unintentional (a patient may be unable to know the potency of street heroin and hence may inject higher doses of it). There are several risk factors for opioid intoxication or overdose that have been reported in the literature.[10] These include escalating doses of opioids, combination of opioids and sedative drugs, use of opioids after a period of cessation, and presence of comorbid conditions like HIV, depression, and liver disease. Opioid intoxication is defined as a condition of transient and clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, perception, behavior, cognition, affect, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration of opioids. Presenting features include somnolence, stupor, psychomotor retardation, slurred speech, mood changes (euphoria followed by dysphoria), respiratory depression, and impaired memory and attention. Pupillary constriction is generally present. The intensity of these symptoms is related to the amount of opioids consumed, and in severe intoxication, coma may occur. These symptoms are not better accounted by the presence of another medical condition or presence of intoxication or withdrawal of another substance. Opioid intoxication can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the level of psychophysiologi",

      "title": "Gangguan psikotik akibat penggunaan ganja (cannabis): studi kasus",
      "abstract": "Ketergantungan dan penyalahgunaan zat bukan merupakan masalah baru di Indonesia. Terjadi peningkatan penyalahgunaan Narkotika, Psikotropika dan Zat Adiktif lainnya (NAPZA) di Indonesia dari tahun ke tahun, terutama penggunaan ganja karena mudah didapat. Di Indonesia terdapat antara 2-3juta orang yang pernah menghisap ganja. Penggunaan ganja dapat menyebabkan penyakit fisik (gangguan pernafasan dan kardiovaskuler) maupun mental (gangguan psikotik). Penggunaan ganja secara teratur terkait dengan munculnya gejala psikotik seperti pemikiran tidak teratur (disorganized), halusinasi, dan delusi. Umumnya para pengguna menggunakan beberapa zat, tetapi pada kasus ini hanya menggunakan satu zat saja yaitu ganja. Pada laporan ini, kami menyampaikan kasus lelaki umur 30 tahun yang mengonsumsi ganja sejak usia 17 tahun didiagnosis dengan gangguan mental dan perilaku akibat penggunaan zat multipel dan penggunaan zat psikoaktif lainnya dengan sindrom ketergantungan (F19.2) dan episode depresi sedang dengan gejala somatik (F32.11). Pasien mengalami halusinasi visual dan auditorik. Pasien mendapat terapi clozapine 25 miligram tiap 12 jam intraoral. Kasus diatas dapat disimpulkan bahwa penggunaan ganja secara kontinu memicu terjadinya psikotik.Dependence and substance abuse is not a new problem in Indonesia. There is an increase in the abuse of Narcotics, Psychotropic and other Addictive Substances (NAPZA) in Indonesia over the years, especially the use of cannabis because it is easy to obtain. Among 2-3 million people in Indonesia have smoked cannabis. The use of cannabis can cause physical illness (respiratory and cardiovascular disorders) as well as mental (psychotic disorders). Regular use of cannabis is associated with the emergence of psychotic symptoms such as disorganized thinking, hallucinations, and delusions. Generally users use some substance, but in this case only use oneÂ substance that is marijuana. In this report we present the case of 30-year-old man who consumed marijuana since the age of 17 years was diagnosed with mental and behavioral disorders due to multiple substances use and other psychoactive substance use with addiction syndrome (F19.2) and episodes of severely depressed somatic symptoms (F32.11). The patient experienced visual and auditory hallucinations. Patients were given 25 milligrams of clozapine therapy every 12 hours intraoral. From this case can be concluded that the continuous use of cannabis trigger the occurrence of psychotic.",

The cannabis-induced psychotic disorder is a rare condition, with transient paranoid ideation being the most common manifestation. Symptoms of anxiety are the most common adverse reaction associated with the moderate use of smoked cannabis.

      "abstract": "Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and nearly 25,000 deaths were attributed to stimulant overdose in 2017. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction and stroke) and psychiatric (agitation and delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected individuals, including individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. No medication has been consistently shown to reduce complications and use of stimulants, although prescription stimulants and topiramate show some promise for treating cocaine use disorder. Syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased stimulant use-related complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "abstract": "To examine the spectrum of emergency department presentations associated with cannabis use or misuse that are currently seen in the pediatric population.There is a growing concern that pediatric emergency department visits related to cannabis are on the rise, especially given rapidly changing legislation on cannabis and its broad availability in certain areas. These concerns are substantiated in the current literature, as the evidence mounts for an array of emergency department presentations of intentional or accidental cannabis use. The range of presentations documented in the recent literature spans gastrointestinal, psychiatric and cardiorespiratory effects, in addition to traumatic injuries and accidental ingestions by younger children. Complications of chronic cannabis use, such as 'cannabis hyperemesis syndrome', depression, psychosis or cognitive impairment, are now recognized outcomes and even more are likely to emerge.An array of cannabis-related symptoms is possible from acute use or exposure. Common presentations include acute intoxication, hyperemesis, depression and acute physical injuries from impaired psychomotor function. Uncommon presentations include cardiorespiratory effects, and a range of symptoms in young children that include hyperkinesis and coma. Clinical vigilance is needed to suspect and clinically diagnose cannabis exposure in the emergency department.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis is evermore present in society, whether within the general public or as a subject for scientific debate. Mass consumption of cannabis, for example, is stabilising around 22 percent of 18-year old who admit to having used it at least once during the previous month; however, this consumption rate falls off as they enter later adulthood. This article describes the emerging scientific consensus about the effects of this drug. The psychotropic effects of cannabis--the result of cannabinoids contained in its resin that activate specific receptors--include general euphoria, a mild release from inhibitions and, in certain cases, some distortion of sensory perception. Some patients also experience drowsiness, a stimulated appetite and anxiolysis, while others anticipate a more intense experience such as an altered state of consciousness. The toxicity of smoked cannabis and its acute, chronic secondary effects are described, as well as the problematic relationship between cannabis consumption and psychosis. The damages and toxic effects attributed to such consumption are presented via three, related themes: the growth of dependency, negative somatic consequences (including cognitive impairment and its consequences for driving an automobile, and damaging psychosocial effects. \"Escalation theory\" is criticized. In their conclusion, the authors cast doubt on the scientific grounds for penalisation of cannabis consumption, and recommend a \"de-demonisation\" of the drug. An analysis and discussion of the current penalties applied in Belgium are presented.",

Nevertheless, the historical accounts of the properties of marijuana have provided an impetus for modern investigations on the effects and potential therapeutic uses of marijuana, its constituents, and their analogs. A seizure is a paroxysmal event that consists of a transient distortion of normal electrical activity in the brain and some alteration of normal motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic function. Convulsions subsequent to cannabinoid administration have been reported to occur under certain conditions in \"normal\" animals, genetically seizure-susceptible animals, and experimentally seizure-susceptible animals. Convulsions subsequent to relatively low-dose administration of cannabinoids can occur in animals rendered seizure susceptible by some experimental techniques. Gammaaminobutyric acid deficiency may be involved in chorea, tardive dyskinesia, and spasticity, and serotonin deficiency in postanoxic myoclonus and perhaps in other neurological disorders.",

In this short review, we will focus on the latter, i.e., the mathematical description of the ventilatory controller and some techniques to measure the ventilatory drive. Note that the model(s) we will discuss can be applied to “chemical control of breathing” only. Chemical control of breathing is control dependent on arterial blood gasses (e.g., PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and pH), and it is active during states of mental relaxation, such as non‐REM sleep, anesthesia, and possibly physical relaxation. The models do not apply to the respiratory effects of exercise or behavioral/emotional activities such as eating, speaking, and playing a musical instrument.",

      "abstract": "La toxicité cérébrale du cannabis est marquée principalement par des effets cognitifs, addictifs et psychotomimétiques. Troubles cognitifs Plusieurs études ont montré que l’administration aiguë de Δ-9-THC, principal principe actif du cannabis, et que la consommation régulière de cannabis entraînaient des troubles de l’attention, de la mémoire, en particulier de la mémoire de travail et de la mémoire épisodique ainsi que des troubles des fonctions exécutives. Ces troubles ont un impact sur l’apprentissage, les acquisitions scolaires, la conduite d’un véhicule et les tâches complexes. Ils sont liés à la dose, à la fréquence, à la durée d’exposition et à l’âge de la première consommation. Ils peuvent disparaître après sevrage, mais des anomalies durables s’observent chez les sujets ayant débuté leur consommation avant l’âge de 15 ans. Effets addictifs La fréquence sur la vie entière de la dépendance au cannabis, caractérisée essentiellement par le craving , la perte de contrôle de la consommation et le retentissement important sur la vie familiale/professionnelle/sociale est, d’après certaines études, de 1 % en population générale. Le syndrome de sevrage, décrit en 2004, pourrait être inclus dans le DSM-5. Effets psychotomimétiques Fréquents, les symptômes psychotiques induits par la consommation de cannabis (idées de référence, de persécution) disparaissent spontanément dans les 24 heures. Ils durent parfois plusieurs semaines dans les pharmacopsychoses. Neuf études longitudinales ont montré que les sujets qui avaient fumé du cannabis avaient deux fois plus de risque environ que les sujets abstinents, de présenter ultérieurement des troubles psychotiques. Le risque, dose-dépendant, est plus élevé lorsque la consommation de cannabis a débuté avant l’âge de 15 ans et chez les sujets qui ont des antécédents familiaux de troubles psychotiques. L’évolution de la schizophrénie est aggravée par la consommation de cannabis. Toxicité cérébrale du cannabis Elle est liée à l’interaction du Δ-9-THC sur les récepteurs cannabinoïdes cérébraux CB1, localisés principalement dans l’hippocampe, le cervelet, le cortex frontal, le striatum et les ganglions de la base. Plusieurs études ont retrouvé que la consommation de cannabis pouvait interférer avec le système endocannabinoïde cérébral lors de la maturation du cerveau à l’adolescence. Elle favorise aussi des troubles vasculaires cérébraux. Les études d’imagerie cérébrale ont retrouvé que les effets du cannabis, modérés en cas d’usage simple, étaient marqués chez les consommateurs réguliers par une diminution dose-dépendante de la densité de substance grise au niveau de l’hippocampe, des régions parahippocampiques et de l’amygdale.",

The following four issues will be dealt with: 1) the neurobiological basis of the psychosis-inducing, pathogenic effects of THC, the agent contained in cannabis products. 2) Can cannabis use - and for comparison alcohol abuse - prematurely trigger or even cause schizophrenia? 3) Are persons genetically liable to schizophrenia, psychosis-prone individuals or young persons before completion of brain development at an increased risk? 4) What consequences does cannabis use have on the symptomatology and further course of schizophrenia? Results from recent literature and the ABC Schizophrenia Study show that the risk for cannabis use in schizophrenia is about twice the size in healthy controls. In most cases cannabis use starts before first admission, in a third of cases before schizophrenia onset. There is an increased affinity to misuse already at the prodromal stage. Cannabis can prematurely trigger schizophrenia onset - on average eight years earlier than in non-use - and cause the illness partly in interaction with predisposing factors. Cannabis use in the course of schizophrenia increases positive symptoms and reduces affective flattening, thus leading to dysfunctional coping in some cases.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse consists of the use by a subject without a medical recommendation, in quantities or with nonrecommended methods. Substance abuse also refers to their use in order to increase intellectual or physical performance, against the rules established by society. Substance abuse involves the chronic use of non-medical chemicals for hedonistic or entheogenic purposes [1]. Drugs such as alcohol, antidepressants, amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, glue, cocaine, hallucinogens, metacular, narcotics, opiates, sedatives, stimulants and some organic solvents can be named [2]. Substance abuse can cause criminal or antisocial behavior, may generate long-term changes in personality [3]. Cocaine has major toxic effects on the body. Treatment of cocaine poisoning is complex. The main sales are those that can lead to patient death. For the proper treatment of any inoculation, it is necessary to identify the xenobiotic that generated it. The presence of metabolites, in the case of cocaine - ethylbenzoylcogene (EBE), provides information on the time of administration of the xenobiotic. Gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is an optoelectronic method that can identify the presence of cocaine and / or EBE from biological samples. In order to increase the sensitivity of the method, a special mass metrology technique - MS/MS can be used [4, 5].",

It is more conflicting the data about if they can produce or unmask vulnerabilities to long term psychiatric disorders; or to affect its course and phenomenology; or to influence the response to the therapeutic resources used to treat them, beyond the period of abstinence. The objective is to update the knowledge available on the ability of the marijuana and the stimulants to produce long term psychiatric disorders, or to unmask vulnerabilities to them. We have done an electronic bibliographical research in MEDLINE using the following key words: psychiatric disorders, amphetamine, stimulants, marijuana, cannabis, long term effects, psychosis, cognitive and cognitive deficits. The marijuana might induce permanent psychosis in subjects with vulnerability to schizophrenia or to psychosis. The cognitive effects are acute and subacute, related with the presence of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the central nervous system. The stimulants can produce a schizophrenia-like psychosis, and they can produce long term cognitive deficits. The stimulants also might produce subsyndromic mood disorders.",

The first patient had also used cocaine, cannabis and alcohol, while the second patient had only used the hallucinogenic mushrooms. Both patients were treated symptomatically and survived despite their severe stab wounds. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are used as mind-altering drugs. These drugs may sometimes induce 'bad trips', a psychotic reaction accompanied by fear, panic, and dangerous behaviour, especially when used in combination with other drugs and alcohol or by psychiatrically unstable patients. During a bad trip, patients may hurt themselves. Because the duration of the psychotic and sympathicomimetic effects of psilocybin after ingestion of mushrooms is short (up to 6 h), and since psilocin itself causes no permanent organ toxicity, the treatment of psilocybin intoxication is only symptomatic. The diagnosis ofpsilocybin intoxication is hampered by the lack of routinely available, rapid and sensitive, analytical methods for the quantification ofpsilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin.",

In a typical scenario, a perpetrator adds a date-rape drug which has sedative effect into alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person. After drug administration, mostly amnesia and symptoms such as confussion, loss of memory, lack of muscle control, dizziness occur. The main drugs in sexual assaults are benzodiazepines such as γ-hydroxy butyrate and its analogs, clonazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, ketamine, barbiturates, antidepressants, cocaine and stimulants. Most of these drugs are colorless, odorless and highly soluble in alcohol or other beverages quickly. They are rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. A victim may complain to police or other legal forces after several days due to emotional trauma as shame, fear, doubt and disbelief. For this reason, It is important to know what time the sample is taken from the victim to confirm the presence of the drug. In this study, we will present a general approach to date-rape drugs used in sexual assault.",

When administered intravenously in the context of a therapeutic interview, cocaine caused large, rapid increases in pulse and blood pressure concomitant with profound mobilization of affect and tearfulness. Infusions that caused lesser changes in vital signs were associated with milder degrees of affective change and less dysphoria. Thus, while cocaine was capable of eliciting positive affective change (such as calmness and elation) in depressed patients, affective flooding and dysphoric components were often admixed, indicating that cocaine's effect in this context could not be classified simply as antidepressant.",

The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system.

      "title": "Clozapine: Since the very beginning?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Psychosis in childhood and adolescence could be defined as having hallucinations, with the hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight. A broader definition includes symptoms such as delirious thoughts, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, cognitive and mood symptoms and what is called negative symptoms. Several researches have been done focused in the treatment of first episode of psychosis showing clozapine as a keystone in the treatment of psychosis, especially in refractory first episodes. Objectives Clozapine has unique efficacy in improving treatment-resistant patients with chronic schizophrenia but the moment of instauration remains unclear. There have always been doubts about the right moment to start clozapine, after two or more previous anti-psychotics or as first option. Materials and methods We report a 18-year- old woman with family history of severe psychosis. Her mum reasserted patient's symptoms contributing to a longer period of non-treating psychosis (about 10 months). Auditory hallucinations, incongruent mood and incoherent language appeared for the first time at the age of 17. High doses of two consecutive anti-psychotics were tried without remission and finally clozapine was initiated with clinical improvement. Discussion In clinical practice, a subgroup of psychotic patients experience, significant ongoing positive symptoms despite of using first line anti-psychotic medication. Conclusion Most recent research; suggest that clozapine may have an important role in the early treatment of first-episode patients, even becoming a first line option to consider.

A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

The former because it affects learning and the latter because it interferes with proper handling of motor vehicles. The most frequently observed complication of cannabis inebriation, however, is a short-lasting acute psychological disturbance with symptoms of panic, paranoid apprehension and personality disorganization. This type of reaction is often not dose-related, and could appropriately be termed \"pathological intoxication\". In addition to the acute effects of cannabis on mental performance and behaviour, this paper reviews the psychiatric consequences of chronic use and the accumulated evidence on organic toxicity associated with it: residual cognitive deficit, lethargic symptoms, cannabis psychosis, respiratory, gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular complications, as well as effects on immune response and gonadal functions, are discussed.

      "abstract": "‘If I can’t feel, if I can’t move, if I can’t think, and I can’t care, then what conceivable point is there in living?’ (Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness) Mood is a person’s subjective emotional state. According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "title": "Composers - Substance Abusers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

      "title": "Delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism with leukoencephalopathy associated with carbon monoxide poisoning",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare disorder that occurs following any event that causes prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation.[1] The earliest cases of this condition were associated with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, which continues to be the most common inciting agent.[2] However, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is also associated with cardiac arrest, strangulation, anesthetic or surgical complications, benzodiazepine or opiate overdose, and hemorrhagic shock.[3-7] Although its exact incidence is unknown, it is likely to increase due to the decreased fatality rate resulting from improved medical care of the aforementioned causes; for example, the mortality rate with CO poisoning has decreased from 33% to 3% since the early 19th century.[8] Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy characteristically presents in two phases: altered sensorium followed by complete recovery and a subsequent acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with or without associated features such as parkinsonism, mutism, hyperreflexia, and frontal release signs. The lucid interval typically lasts 1–3 weeks (with a range of 2–40 days).[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals diffuse symmetrical anterior predominant cerebral white matter demyelination. A typical history with MRI findings that exclude alternative possibilities is sufficient for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted investigations and treatment. We present a case of delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following CO poisoning to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis. A 39-year-old man, with no prior comorbidities or addictions, was discovered unconscious in his room by his brother. The patient had not experienced any previous symptoms of fever, headache, or seizures but had slept in his room with burning logs of coal for warmth the previous night. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received a Glasgow coma scale score of E3V1M5 (9/15) and was intubated for airway protection. There were no signs of meningeal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonspecific changes [Figure 1], and his cerebrospinal fluid examination and routine investigations were within normal ranges. He was treated with high-flow oxygen and showed improvement over the next five days, following which he was extubated. He gradually regained near baseline status and was discharged after ten days. However, one week after his discharge, he developed a sudden onset of worsening behavioral symptoms (aggression and verbal abuse), generalized stiffness, and slowed activities (required more time to do tasks such as washing, eating, and conducting daily living activities). He also exhibited intellectual abnormalities (inability to understand spoken words, producing incomprehensible sounds, and forgetfulness regarding navigating around the house). Therefore, he was referred to our facility for further management. Upon examination, he appeared drowsy with mask-like facies and displayed cog-wheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and hyperreflexia in all limbs (without asymmetry). He did not exhibit tremors, his extra-ocular movements were normal, and he did not experience postural instability. A detailed cognitive and sensory assessment was not possible, and he did not present with any focal neurological deficits.Figure 1: Axial T2-WI (a, c) images show nonspecific multiple hyperintense foci in the deep frontal white matter (arrows in a) and bilateral centrum semiovale (c). These lesions are hyperintense on DWI (arrows in b and d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (not shown)The routine blood investigations were normal. The MRI brain revealed widespread bilateral white matter hyperintensities, without any restriction in diffusion and with patchy contrast enhancement [Figure 2]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a slightly increased protein level (83 mg/dl) with no presence of cells and normal sugar levels. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, serum and CSF autoimmune and paraneoplastic panel, extractable nuclear antigen panel, blood and urine toxicology screen, and CSF-venereal disease research laboratory all yielded negative results. The electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse delta slowing of brain waves.Figure 2: Follow-up MRI displays diffuse confluent symmetrical white matter hyperintensity T2-WI (a, b) and diffusion-weighted images (c, d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (e, f). Multiple foci of hyperintensities (arrows in b) are observed within the bilateral centrum semiovale, Following gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen except for a few enhancing foci in the left centrum semiovaleBased on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the investigations, a diagnosis of delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration was established. The patient was managed conservatively with the administration of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine), levodopa-carbidopa, and baclofen. He continued to improve gradually and approached the baseline status over 6 months. Our patient developed delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration caused by CO poisoning resulting from sleeping in a closed room with biofuel combustion. CO binds tightly and preferentially to hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen binding and causing anemic hypoxia.[1] In addition, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, inhibiting aerobic respiration.[1] Hypo-oxygenation and associated energy depletion of cerebral white matter lead to delayed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[9] CO poisoning can also occur from the use of gas geysers in domestic settings.[10] Correia et al.[10] reported cases of 26 patients developing unexplained neurodeficits while bathing in ill-ventilated bathrooms with gas geysers. Thirteen of these patients presented with acute CO intoxication, and two of them later developed parkinsonian features. Lee and Marsden reported cases of delayed post-hypoxic neurological manifestations as typically conforming to either parkinsonism or akinetic mutism along with the neuro-behavioral syndrome.[11] The patients who develop parkinsonism develop varying combinations of short-steppage gait, decreased arm swing, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies, and a stooped posture.[11] Certain patients even develop concomitant dystonic posturing of the limbs. Approximately 60% of the patients improve with supportive treatment and recover independent ambulation within 10–148 days after sequelae onset.[11] In our case, the patient had developed typical parkinsonian features (i.e., rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies with hypokinetic dysarthria) and responded well to conservative management with levodopa and low doses of antipsychotics. The patient recovered his baseline status at the 6-month follow-up visit. Alternative diagnoses were ruled out through imaging, blood tests, and CSF testing. The prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented unnecessary resource utilization, such as brain biopsy or other invasive procedures, and provided symptomatic relief. Acknowledgment None.

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

      "abstract": "Ketamine, also known as 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)-cyclohexanone, is a dissociative anesthetic that has gained popularity as a recreational substance among young people, especially in nightclubs and at parties. It acts as a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, inducing a dissociative state that manifests as catalepsy, unconsciousness and amnesia. Recreational use of ketamine and the number of illicit seizures of ketamine have increased in recent years, prompting a review of current evidence on its toxicity. Recreational ketamine use is associated with a number of toxic effects, both acute and chronic. Predominant among the acute effects are psychotic symptoms, hallucinations and aggression, which can lead to serious injuries. Chronic ketamine use leads to intractable urological problems and neuropsychiatric problems, Long-term effects also include gastrointestinal problems such as abdominal pain and liver function abnormalities. This review summarizes current evidences on the acute and chronic ketamine toxicity associated with its recreational use.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological studies of marijuana during the past three years have confirmed most of the clinical effects of the drug reported before. The outstanding effects are an initial alteration of mood characterized by euphoria, followed by alteration of consciousness characterized by sleepiness. Other mental effects reminiscent of those observed with psychotomimetic drugs, such as alterations in time perception, visual perception, auditory perception, changes in ability to remember or keep track of things, and depersonalization, may be observed after higher doses of the drug. In general, the severity of effects parallels the dose of drug closely, so that generalizations about effects of marijuana must be qualified according to the dose used. As most use of marijuana in Western society employs relatively small doses, the drug may appear to be more innocuous than would be the case if the dosage pattern should be changed by use of increasingly potent materials.",

      "title": "[Clinical practice guideline. Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "title": "Does Cannabidiol Protect Against Adverse Psychological Effects of THC?",
      "abstract": "The recreational use of cannabis can have persistent adverse effects on mental health. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and most, if not all, of the effects associated with the use of cannabis are caused by THC. Recent studies have suggested a possible protective effect of another cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD). A literature search was performed in the bibliographic databases PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science using the keyword 'cannabidiol.' After removing duplicate entries, 1295 unique titles remained. Based on the titles and abstracts, an initial selection was made. The reference lists of the publications identified in this manner were examined for additional references. Cannabis is not a safe drug. Depending on how often someone uses, the age of onset, the potency of the cannabis that is used and someone's individual sensitivity, the recreational use of cannabis may cause permanent psychological disorders. Most recreational users will never be faced with such persistent mental illness, but in some individuals cannabis use leads to undesirable effects: cognitive impairment, anxiety, paranoia and increased risks of developing chronic psychosis or drug addiction. Studies examining the protective effects of CBD have shown that CBD can counteract the negative effects of THC. However, the question remains of how the laboratory results translate to the types of cannabis that are encountered by real-world recreational users.",

Symptoms associated with use are often indistinguishable from those encountered with a primary mental illness and also include aggression, confusion, and anxiety. For these patients, clinicians rely on physical presentation, symptom(s) onset, and episode duration when evaluating patients.An adult man was involuntarily admitted to inpatient status secondary to reports of bizarre behaviors that included paranoia and psychomotor agitation. Because of the severity of the symptoms, he was unable to participate in the admission assessment. On day 2, he reported having smoked a substance provided by a friend. In addition, he admitted to previous SC use on 3 occasions, with each occasion resulting in an involuntary admission to inpatient status. The course of this admission was unremarkable.A brief overview of psychiatric signs and symptoms of SC use and information to help clinicians are included. The presentation of psychotic symptoms secondary to SC may be consistent with those of psychosis or other substances of abuse. Because of the variability in the symptoms produced by SC use, clinicians are encouraged to consider SC use in the diagnostic evaluation.",

Undetectable by many urine drug screens, SC are a heterogeneous group of chemicals with various documented side effects including myocardial infarctions, tachycardia, agitation, psychosis, nausea, and vomiting. Methods: In this case report, we present a 38 year-old female with dysphonia secondary to SC. Our patient developed dysphonia after 2.5 years of regular SC use. She was thoroughly evaluated by her primary care physician and referred to both, otorhinolaryngology and pulmonology, with an exhaustively negative workup. Her dysphonia persisted for 13 months and only improved after she abstained from using SC. Conclusions and Significance: We could find no previous cases of dysphonia or hoarseness attributed t SC use/ abuse in the literature and is yet another kind of health sequelae frontline providers should look for in chronic users of SC. The previously unrecognized relationship between SC and dysphonia demonstrates our limited understanding of the chemicals’ adverse effects. Just as nicotine affects the larynx and causes dysphonia and laryngeal carcinoma, this case also raises the question of whether the chemical composition of SC affects the larynx in the same way and its use leads to an increased risk of laryngeal cancer for users/abusers",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Occupational stress was perceived to be a problem only in jobs with high pressure and low pay, such as teaching and social services. Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

Many types of medicaments can cause akathisia as an adverse event of their use and they include: antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiemetics, antihistamines, and psychoactive substances. We will present the case of a 50 year old patient, treated on two occasions for psychotic depression. During the second hospitalization it is possible that antipsychotic treatment combined with an antidepressant caused akathisia or there were symptoms of agitated depression and akathisia present at the same time, which is very difficult to determine in everyday clinical practice. We can conclude that in this case, as in many others, akathisia as a possible adverse effect of psychopharmacs was very hard to identify. Therefore, it is necessary to have akathisia in mind when using certain medicaments, especially when combining several that use the same enzymatic system and consequently raise levels of at least one of them.",

The characteristic features of anticholinergic intoxication are the rapid onset of alterations in mood, cognition and perception in the presence of a clear sensorium and following the ingestion of the drug in a commonly distributable form. But if psychotic symptoms are present in the absence of retained reality testing a diagnosis of substance-induced psychotic disorder may be warranted. Therefore, in same cases clinical picture presents a differential diagnostic dilemma.Method:The authors present the case report of twenty-one year old male with dependence of multiple drug use (according the criteria of ICD-X), who was observed in department of alcoholism. In early adolescence period he used different psychoactive substances (opioids and non-opioid psychoactive substances). At last two years he episodically consumed anticholinergics. Upon the mixed use of alcohol with anticholinergics he experienced auditory hallucinations, rapid and incoherent speech and paranoid ideation. He acted out his imperative hallucinations aggressively with violent behavior.During hospital treatment he was treated with antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines and supportive and educational therapies.Results:On this regiment psychotic symptoms resolved completely after two weeks.Conclusion:Results of complete psychiatric-psychological examination did not indicate psychotic disorder.",

Despite returning to baseline after several days to weeks, patients can suddenly decompensate, exhibiting what is called postictal psychosis despite being abstinent from the substance. This condition can lead to chronic psychosis if not properly treated. In this case, a male in his twenties, presented with 1 month of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. After his last cocaine use 1 month ago, the patient developed seizure-like activity and shortly after returned to baseline. Approximately 1 week later, the patient started to experience psychosis. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted and started on Risperidone 2mg twice a day but did not respond. Clonazepam 1mg twice a day was added, which helped patient to return to baseline. Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is underreported, and it can be difficult to recognize. Similarly, there are few guidelines as to how to treat this condition. Clinicians need to rapidly address if they suspect that the patient is experiencing possible postictal psychosis given that this can lead to chronic psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Background: Alcohol use disorders, defined as the maintenance of alcohol use for at least a 12-month period despite negative psychological, biological, behavioral, and social consequences, are frequently associated with psychotic symptoms. Objective: Our aim in this paper is to review alcohol-related clinical conditions that are accompanied by psychotic symptoms, alcohol-induced psychotic disorder, alcohol withdrawal delirium, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, Korsakoff’s dementia, comorbid schizophrenia, or delusional disorder. Methods: This is a non-systematic, narrative review based on the relevant literature indexed in PubMed and Google Scholar databases [2000-2020]. Results: Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder is characterized by the presence of auditory hallucinations or delusions. In the state of alcohol withdrawal, tactile, visual hallucinations and delusions are common. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, caused by malnutrition secondary to chronic alcohol misuse, is characterized by the presence of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and a range of mental disturbances. The dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder rests on shared biological impairments, as shown by neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies. The subtype of the delusional disorder called Othello’s syndrome, or delusional jealousy based on false beliefs of infidelity, is often seen in the context of alcohol alone or alcohol and neurological disorder. Treatment for alcoholic disorders with psychotic symptoms are dietary, psychological, and pharmacological. Conclusions: There are a number of alcohol-related psychotic syndromes, each requiring its own specific treatment approach.",

While a person who was intoxicated may not be able to form the requisite specific intent to commit some offences, voluntary intoxication usually disentitles a person from an insanity or \"mental impairment\" defence. However, a person may also consume alcohol or use a substance without becoming intoxicated and the presence of alcohol, substances or metabolites of substances in a person's urine or blood is not conclusive when the question of intoxication is relevant. A jury (or a judge sitting without a jury) may require expert opinion evidence when cannabis or methamphetamine intoxication are implicated in the alleged offending.",

The use of antihistamines alone or in combination with other substances of abuse may predispose individuals to develop psychiatric symptoms or syndromes as a part of intoxication, withdrawal or as co-morbid conditions. We present two case reports to highlight the occurrence of co-morbid psychopathology in association with antihistamine abuse and dependence.<br>Case I used high doses of pheniramine for about 2 years and became suspicious of his wife; he even doubted the paternity of his yet-to-be-born child. The associated behavioural abnormalities suggested that he was acting out on the delusion. He also had seizures associated with the intake of a high dose of pheniramine. Case II had multiple substance use, and dependence on alcohol and pheniramine. He demonstrated abnormal behaviour suggestive of psychosis and organic brain syndrome that persisted for a few days and remitted on discontinuation of the substances. These two cases demonstrate the occurrence of psychotic syndromes associated with heavy pheniramine use. The psychopathology can vary from an independent psychotic syndrome to an organic brain syndrome-like disorder.",

It is unsure if the memory deficits that result from drug abuse persist forever as study examining memory impairments after more than a month's abstinence of drug use is not found. Conclusion: Therefore, it is incorrect to say that drug users or ex-drug users are incapable of learning; instead, as a result of neurological changes in the brain caused by chronic drug use, learning may take more time and effort for them as compared to non-drug users.",

Consuming cannabis are presented psychotic episodes in lucid conscience with few formal alterations of the thought, maniac feature affectivity, hostile behavior, short duration and reappearance always preceded by its consumption. However, it continues in discussion if the cannabis is the detonative of the psychosis or a form of self-medication of a primary psychotic disorder. The reiterated use of cannabis from very young, above all in subject genetically vulnerable, cause schizophrenias whose first episode is presented after a yr of THC consumption, generally before 18 years, with more positive symptoms and less negative than schizophrenics not users, with worse response to the antipsychotic and more relapses in the following 15 years. This seems be due to the fact that in the schizophrenics is produced an similar alteration of the endogenous cannabinoid system at the originated by the cannabis-related poisoning in healthly subjects. To consume high cannabis dose during much time leads to a passiveness and nonchalance state characterized by generalized dysfunction of the cognitives capacities and of the interpersonal and social abilities (call amotivational syndrome) of the that are begun to have neuropsychological, morphologic and functional evidences.",

      "title": "Dual pathology and Takotsubo syndrome. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Cocaine use is a significant health problem, since its abuse constitutes a substance use disorder and can produce cardiovascular symptoms, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Tako-tsubo syndrome (TTS) is a transient dysfunction of the apical left ventricle that can manifest with intense chest pain and alterations in the electrocardiogram. TTS can be triggered by physical stressors (hyperthyroidism, cocaine or amphetamine abuse) or psychological stressors (grief or reaction to acute stress). Objectives The objective is to present the case of a patient who developed tako-tsubo syndrome after harmful cocaine use. Methods A 50-year-old woman, under psychiatric follow-up, diagnosed with mixed personality disorder, with a medical history of hypothyroidism. The patient has been presenting for 2 months after mourning the death of her husband with anxiety-depressive symptoms with a great behavioral impact with episodes of heteroaggression and begins with abusive consumption of cannabis and cocaine toxins. The patient presents an episode of psychomotor agitation after acute consumption of cocaine, presenting psychotic symptoms. During the study in the emergency area, she verbalizes chest pain and complementary studies are performed with elevated cardiac enzymes and alterations in the electrocardiogram. Cardiology is contacted and after hospital admission and complementary studies, the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome is reached, filiating it with Takotsubo syndrome triggered by cocaine consumption. The diagnoses presented by the patient with dual pathology would be a psychotic disorder due to toxins, a borderline personality disorder and harmful consumption of cocaine. Results Dual pathology in patients with personality disorder with toxin abuse such as in this case cocaine is very frequent.The situation of grief is an acute stressful situation that leads to greater emotional instability and, together with the toxic effects of cocaine, can trigger Takotsubo syndrome in patients. Therefore, when approaching patients with substance use, it is very important to always take into account the possible somatic complications that can be triggered.The treatment chosen to treat the psychotic symptoms that the patient presented was lurasidone, since it has a tolerability and cardiological safety profile. Conclusions In patients with dual pathology, it is very important to address all possible complications, both somatic and psychiatric, for proper therapeutic management.

      "abstract": "Marijuana ( Cannabis sativa ) is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide as well as in the Unites States. Prolonged use of marijuana or repeated administration of its primary psychoactive constituent, Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can lead to physical dependence in humans and laboratory animals. The changes that occur with repeated cannabis use include alterations in behavioral, physiological, and biochemical responses. A variety of withdrawal responses occur in cannabis-dependent individuals: anger, aggression, irritability, anxiety and nervousness, decreased appetite or weight loss, restlessness, and sleep difficulties with strange dreams. But the long half-life and other pharmacokinetic properties of THC result in delayed expression of withdrawal symptoms, and because of the lack of contiguity between drug cessation and withdrawal responses the latter are not readily recognized as a clinically relevant syndrome. Over the past 30 years, a substantial body of clinical and laboratory animal research has emerged supporting the assertion that chronic exposure to cannabinoids produces physical dependence and may contribute to drug maintenance in cannabis-dependent individuals. However, no medications are approved to treat cannabis dependence and withdrawal. In this review, we describe preclinical and clinical research that supports the existence of a cannabinoid withdrawal syndrome. In addition, we review research evaluating potential pharmacotherapies (e.g., THC, a variety of antidepressant drugs, and lithium) to reduce cannabis withdrawal responses and examine how expanded knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms in the endocannabinoid system may lead to promising new therapeutic targets.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of marijuana extracted from Cannabis sativa and indica plants involves an important cultural impact in Mexico. Their psychological stimulatory effect is widely recognized; their biochemical and molecular components interact with CB1 and CB2 (endocannabinoid system) receptors in various central nervous system structures (CNS) and immune cells. The psychoactive element Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can be reproduced synthetically. Systematic reviews show evidence of therapeutic effectiveness of therapeutic marijuana only for certain symptoms of multiple sclerosis (spasticity, spasms and pain), despite attempts for its widespread use, including refractory childhood epilepsy. Evidence indicates significant adverse effects of smoked marijuana on the structure, functioning and brain connectivity. Cannabis exposure during pregnancy affects fetal brain development, potentially leading to later behavioral problems in children. Neuropsychological tests and advanced imaging techniques show involvement in the learning process in adolescents with substance use. Also, marijuana increases the cognitive impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis. Social and ethical consequences to legally free marijuana for recreational use may be deleterious transcendentally. The medicinal or psychoactive cannabinol no addictive effect requires controlled proven efficacy and safety before regulatory approval studies. El consumo de la mariguana conlleva un importante impacto cultural en México. Su efecto psicológicamente estimulante es ampliamente reconocido, sus componentes bioquímicos y moleculares interactúan con los receptores CB1 y CB2 (sistema endocannabinoide) en diversas estructuras del sistema nervioso central (SNC) y de las células inmunes. El elemento psicoactivo Δ-9-Tetrahidrocannabinol (THC) puede ser reproducido sintéticamente.Revisiones sistemáticas muestran evidencia en efectividad del consumo de mariguana terapéutica solo para ciertos síntomas de esclerosis múltiple (espasticidad, espasmos y dolor), a pesar de los intentos para su uso extenso, incluyendo epilepsias infantiles refractarias. La evidencia señala importantes efectos adversos de la mariguana fumada sobre las estructuras, el funcionamiento y la conectividad cerebral. La exposición al cannabis durante el embarazo afecta el desarrollo cerebral del feto, pudiendo generar problemas conductuales tardíos en los hijos. Pruebas sensitivas neuropsicológicas y avanzadas técnicas imagenológicas demuestran afectación en el proceso de aprendizaje en adolescentes consumidores. Asimismo, la mariguana aumenta el deterioro cognitivo en pacientes con esclerosis múltiple. Las consecuencias sociales y éticas al liberar legalmente mariguana para uso lúdico pueden ser trascendentalmente deletéreas. El cannabinol medicinal sin efecto psicoactivo o adictivo requiere de estudios controlados de eficacia y seguridad comprobadas antes de su aprobación regulatoria.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

A clinician may hypothesize that a patient is hallucinating based on observations or descriptions of the person's behavior. Hallucinations and illusions most commonly occur in the auditory domain. Visual hallucinations and illusions may take many forms, including these: flashing lights in all or part of the field of vision; geometric patterns in all or part of the visual field; and so on. Hallucinations of taste (gustatory) or hallucinations of smell (olfactory) are most often of unpleasant sensations. Gustatory and olfactory hallucinations often correspond to disease in the temporal lobes of the brain. Tactile or kinesthetic hallucinations can take many forms.",

It is characterised by unwanted and distressing thoughts, images, or urges (obsessions) and repetitive behaviours or mental acts that aim to decrease the resulting distress. Case Summary: A 26-year-old man presented with intrusive thoughts, ritualistic acts and compulsive actions. After case taking, Calcarea carbonicum, Lycopodium, Sulphur and Tuberculinum bovinum were prescribed as and when required based on symptom presentation during the course of homoeopathic treatment. Individualised homoeopathic medicines led to a remarkable improvement in the case by relieving him of his obsessive and compulsive thoughts and enabling him to engage in his social, occupational and familial life without adverse effects.",

      "title": "Some aspects of tobacco smoking in the context of alcohol drinking, hangover and mental health problems",
      "abstract": "The public health relevance of hangover is in its potential effects on occupational safety and performance. Apart from pharmacological effects of ethanol and congeners, psychosocial factors also contribute to morning-after feelings, particularly the emotions of shame and guilt. Tobacco smoking increases the hangover's incidence and severity, explained by pharmacological effects of nicotine and other smoke constituents. During a drinking binge, many people would smoke more than usual; some intermittent smokers or those who gave up would restart. The hangover \"curing\" with beer or vodka the next morning (hair of the dog) may contribute to negative affectivity in the long run, as it implies a cycle of alcohol consumption and shame. Some individuals experience a temporary symptomatic relief after a hair of the dog drink. According to our observations, if the \"curing\" is accompanied by smoking, the elevated mood in some people would more easily shift to dysphoria, irritation or depression. Psychological mechanisms thereof are discussed here. Besides, the problem of smoking in psychiatric hospitals is briefly discussed. In conclusion, smoking can exacerbate hangover symptoms through both toxicological and psychosocial mechanisms. The problem of smoking in the settings of alcoholism and mental health problems should be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "Patients with the combination of cannabis abuse and psychosis are difficult to treat. The intoxicated state has many similarities to schizophrenia. Like other drugs with abuse potential cannabis affects the brain's reward system. It has not been possible to show major structural changes in the cerebrum, but by electron microscopy structural changes can be shown in animals especially in the hippocampus. The drug is taken in order to escape reality, and a vicious circle tending to maintain the person's abuse pattern which includes reduced energy, judgment and memory may be established. Cannabis may cause toxic psychosis, with a tendency to recurrent psychoses with continued abuse. There is no convincing support for the assumption that cannabis can cause chronic functional psychosis following cessation of abuse. Schizophrenic patients who use cannabis are often trying to reduce the discomfort caused by symptoms in the prodromal phase. By continued abuse positive psychotic symptoms are worsened. Antidepressant drugs may diminish the depressive elements of the disease. Some cannabis users are especially sensitive and develop toxic psychosis. Patients with repeated toxic psychosis may erroneously be diagnosed as schizophrenics. It is therefore important to be aware that a psychotic state may be caused by abuse of cannabis, and adjust treatment to this fact.",

Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol.

      "abstract": "Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated in people with co-factors such as depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and bulimia/bingeing. These behavioral or cognitive patterns may be adaptive or neutral in the conditions under which we evolved but maladaptive in environments requiring alertness for extended periods, where a fully mobilized fight-or-flight response is inappropriate, and where food availability makes lack of an \"appestat\" a liability. Such conditions are amenable to management by nicotine because of its ability to produce small but reliable adjustments in relevant cognitive and behavioral functions. Moreover, symptomatology may be unmasked or exacerbated by nicotine abstinence, persisting beyond the usual time-course for nicotine withdrawal, which may explain the particular attraction of smoking and the difficulty these individuals experience in quitting without necessarily requiring that they be more nicotine-dependent. The implications are: (1) a better understanding of the evolutionary psychobiology of smoking may promote development of tailored interventions for smokers with co-factors; (2) nicotine may have therapeutic applications for non-smokers with co-factors; (3) because smoking has a fairly high heritability index, and because of evidence of assortative mating, special prevention efforts targeting children of smokers with co-factors, as well as early identification of the co-factor itself, may be needed.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Acute and transitory psychotic disorders comprise a polymorphous picture such as Leonhard’s cycloid psychoses, which alternate episodes of affective symptoms such as psychosis between two poles (anguish/happiness, incoherence/stupor, or akinesia/hyperkinesia). Objectives To describe a case report of a 20-year-old man, in outpatient psychiatric follow-up, after debuting at age 18 with a severe depressive episode of endogenomorphic characteristics without psychotic symptoms, with subsequent complete remission. Two years after clinical stability, he required prolonged hospitalization due to polymorphous psychotic syndrome of abrupt onset in a context of previous continuous use of cannabis and cocaine. Suspicion towards parents, bizarre behaviors, rushing desires, unmotivated laughter, fixed gaze, bewilderment, anguish with a feeling of imminent death, alternates with euphoria and senseless purchases. Methods We present the case report of this patient with a mental examination of conscious, scattered attention with marked distractibility, confusion and experiences of strangeness, memory gaps, subjective sensation of well-being with tachypsychia, which fluctuates with thymic oscillations and alternates with episodes of marked indefinite anguish, intense anxiety with delusional fear of the death of him or his family. Little systematized ideas of reference and prejudice based on intuitions or delusional occurrences in their environment. Megalomaniac and religious-messianic ideation. No sensory perception disturbances. Disintegrated course of thought, with frequent illogical associations, ambivalence of thought, affectivity and psychomotricity. Motor restlessness and behavioral disorganization. Global insomnia. Judgment of reality and superior functions diminished. No auto/heteroaggressiveness. Results Various psychoactive drugs were tested for two months, obtaining a response only with valproic acid 1500mg, pregabalin 450mg and olanzapine 15mg, presenting slow improvement in a situation of absence of consumption, with a predominance of symptomatic polymorphism, decreasing fluctuation between episodes of expansiveness and psychotic anguish, remitting disorganization and motility alterations, persisting poor awareness of the disease and cognitive complaints. He was referred for follow-up at the mental health center where his gradual recovery continued. A differential diagnosis of polymorphous psychosis is proposed, compatible with a cycloid psychosis of the anxiety-happiness type with marked affective symptoms, precipitated by substance use. Conclusions Cycloid anxiety-happiness psychosis stands out for intense and fluctuating anxiety, oscillating with feelings of happiness, ecstasy, and placidity, mystical-religious delusions, and preoccupation with death, which may comprise a different psychotic debut.

Especially detrimental to the brain is substantial binge drinking, which may in the worst case lead to loss of the brain's gray matter gray substance and reduced integrity of the white matter. These changes are reflected in many cognitive functions. Also cannabis interferes with brain maturation and causes impairment of cognitive functioning. Although the structural changes induced by drugs are likely to largely return to normal after cessation of use, their overall effect on the functional capacity of the young may be significant.",

      "abstract": "Catatonic syndromes could accompany a variety of psychiatric and medical conditions. The most common conditions underlying catatonia are affective disorders followed by schizophrenia, but several medical conditions including intoxications affecting the central nervous system can also present with catatonic signs and symptoms. Therapeutic doses of disulfiram could induce catatonia with or without accompanying psychosis or mood disorder. A case of disulfiram intoxication manifesting with catatonia is reported here together with a brief overview of the literature. A patient was admitted to the toxicology ward after a suicide attempt with approximately 20 g of disulfiram. On transfer to the psychiatric ward, she was sitting still, in a semi-stuporous state and displayed motiveless resistance to instructions or attempts to move (active negativism). She was unresponsive to most of the questions (mutism), occasionally verbigerated 1-2 words and stared for more than 20 seconds between shifting attention. After developing a comatosus state her treatment continued at the toxicology ward, where a contrast-enhanced computer tomography scan revealed bilateral emollition of 1.5 cm diameter in both nucleus lentiformis at the level of the third ventricle. Following treatment her condition improved and she benefited of rehabilitation facility and a second psychiatric treatment. She was discharged free of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. In conclusion, we underscore the importance of accurate diagnosis of the underlying psychiatric or medical condition when encountering a fast emerging catatonic syndrome and focus first on treating the causative condition while simultaneously attempting symptomatic treatment of catatonia.",

There are two primary features of addiction to all forms of natural and pharmacological stimuli. First, the rewarding stimulus associated with the addiction is a compelling motivator of behavior at the expense of behaviors leading to the acquisition of other rewarding stimuli. Thus, individuals come to orient increasing amounts of their daily activity around acquisition of the rewarding stimulus to which they are addicted. Second, there is a persistence of craving for the addictive stimulus, combined with an inability to regulate the behaviors associated with obtaining that stimulus. Thus, years after the last exposure to an addictive stimulus, reexposure to that stimulus or environmental cues associated with that stimulus will elicit behavior seeking to obtain the reward.",

      "abstract": "The exogenous cannabinoides include pharmacologically active compounds of the Cannabis sativa, such as Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol and cannabinol. Those molecules are strong psychoactive substances that bind to CB1 and CB2 receptors in the brain and consequently influence dopaminergic system. Cannabinoids may along with other milder symptoms induce a dysphoric state and, in rare cases after the use of high doses, cause visual hallucinations, depersonalization and psychotic episodes. Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by an abnormal connections inside brain's neural network. In schizophrenia there is a joint action of genetic predisposition and environmental factors and some recent research reveals three main pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia: dopamine dysfunction, disturbed transmission in the glutamate system and inflammatory process in the brain. The prevalence od cannabis use in schizophrenic patients is higher than 50% being as high as ten times greater than in general population. Recent studies suggest that cannabis use accelerates the onset of first psycho for three years. In addition- cannabis use in adolescence increases the number of rehospitalizations, positive symptoms and frequencies of relapse. An entity „schizophrenia induced by cannabis“ is still a topic of many discussions. Reasons of such high rates of cannabis use in schizophrenia are not well understood. Some hypotheses include: „ self medication- self healing“, increased positive and decreased negative affect of psychoactive substances in those patients, environmental risk factors and dysfunctional reward system. The relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia is based on interaction of dopamine and brain structure modeling. This comorbidity requires specific approach in order to provide comprehensive care for this highly vulnerable population.",

      "abstract": "Ketamine was originally synthesised for use as a dissociative anaesthetic, and it remains widely used legitimately for this indication. However, there is increasing evidence of non-medical recreational use of ketamine, particularly in individuals who frequent the night-time economy. The population-level and sub-population (clubbers) prevalence of recreational use of ketamine is not known but is likely to be similar, or slightly lower than, that of other recreational drugs such as cocaine, MDMA, and amphetamine. The predominant features of acute toxicity associated with the recreational use of ketamine are neuro-behavioural abnormalities such as agitation, hallucinations, anxiety, and psychosis. Secondary to these, individuals put themselves at greater risk of physical harm/trauma. Cardiovascular features (hypertension and tachycardia) occur less frequently and the risk of death from recreational use is low and is predominately due to the physical harm/trauma. Long-term recreational use of ketamine can be associated with the development of psychological dependence and tolerance. There are reports of gastro-intestinal toxicity, particularly abdominal pain and abnormal liver function tests, and of neuropsychiatric disorders, typically a schizophrenia-like syndrome, in long-term users. Finally, there are increasing reports of urological disorders, particularly haemorrhagic cystitis, associated with long-term use. The management of these problems associated with the long-term use of ketamine is largely supportive and abstinence from ongoing exposure to ketamine. In this review we will collate the available information on the epidemiology of recreational use of ketamine and describe the patterns of acute and chronic toxicity associated with its recreational use and the management of this toxicity.",

Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

Febrile reactions have been observed after the administration of arsenical drugs, bismuth and, more recently, penicillin. The literature contains only brief comments concerning the incidence and severity of fever after the use of these drugs. Symptomatic Herxheimer reactions occur not only after the administration of spirocheticidal drugs but also during fever therapy (especially induced malaria). The variety of manifestations observed is related to the type of neurosyphilis. For example, in patients with dementia paralytica there may occasionally occur exacerbations of the existing psychoses or the development of new symptoms.

Parapsychological (psi) research also indicates that when individuals are exposed to techniques to alter the state of consciousness such as sensory homogenization, meditation, hypnosis, and psychedelic drugs, they exhibit stronger evidence of psi functioning than when they are in ordinary waking consciousness, particularly if they are prone to having spontaneous alterations of consciousness and/or have had a mental practice for a long time.

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug.

Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

States of agitation are mainly due to simple or pathological inebriety. Any case of acute alcoholic intoxication requires a full clinical examination and a simple laboratory work-up. Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states. States of anxiety generally regress with non-neuroleptic tranquilizers, and attempted suicide mainly requires close surveillance or intensive care.",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "title": "Excitotoxicity, Synaptic Repair, and Functional Recovery in the Mammalian Cochlea: A Review of Recent Findings",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This so‐called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two‐step mechanism: (1) An acute swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry of Ca 2+ , which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in ischemic‐ or noise‐induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.",

Caso clínico: Paciente de 31 años sin antecedentes conocidos que debuta con un primer episodio psicótico, no enfermedades conocidas de interés. Consumo diario de cannabis sin especificar cuánto pero en incremento en los meses previos. Niega consumo de otras sustancias, no tiene ningún tratamiento pautado. Nula conciencia de enfermedad de la clínica psicótica ni del trastorno relacionado con el consumo, solicitando durante el ingreso que se le recete cannabis porque es la única medicina que le ayuda. Durante los dos años previos al ingreso se produce una situación de aislamiento progresivo, rompiendo los vínculos sociales y familiares, llegando a dejar de hablar incluso con los convivientes. Durante el ingreso en la unidad de hospitalización breve se realiza coordinación con profesionales de la unidad de conductas adictivas y del centro de rehabilitación psicosocial para un abordaje integral del caso. Conclusiones: En múltiples estudios se ha descrito la asociación entre la aparición de psicosis y el consumo de cannabis, describiéndose como factores que influyen en esta asociación la edad de inicio del consumo y la frecuencia. Así mismo, tanto la psicosis como el consumo de cannabis pueden influir de forma negativa sobre el funcionamiento psicosocial y laboral. Por todo lo anterior ante estos casos para un abordaje integral del caso se necesita recurrir a dispositivos diversos de la red de Salud Mental, tanto asistenciales como de rehabilitación, y de la red de tratamiento de conductas adictivas, con una adecuada coordinación entre ambas.",

      "abstract": "Several behavioral/psychological/psychiatric traits/disorders have been associated with increased initiation of smoking, nicotine dependence, and decreased cessation. Although much research has focused on psychiatric disorders, subclinical syndromes (e.g., minor depression and heavy drinking) probably influence smoking initiation and cessation more because they are so much more prevalent. In prospective studies, comorbidity predicts smoking and smoking predicts comorbidity. Preliminary evidence suggests several plausible mechanisms by which this two-way linkage could occur. In addition, other variables (e.g., genetics) could account for the comorbidity/smoking association. What we need to know: how strong and consistent are comorbidity/smoking associations? Is the association of smoking and comorbidity increasing over time? Are the hypothesized mechanisms for the association valid? Can treating comorbidity improve smoking cessation outcomes? Would applying the concept of comorbidity to psychosocial conditions (e.g., poverty) be helpful?",

Ethanol is also frequently encountered. These drugs can be used for recreational purposes by addicts or can be observed after sexual assaults (drugs spiked in food). Forensic toxicology can be involved in several situations to document impairment, such as: crime under influence, date rape, driving under influence, psychiatric disorders, determination of the cause of death... In some particular situations, it can be very cautious to investigate exposure to psycho-active drugs, due to late sampling of biological specimens. To enhance the window of detection of 3 specific drugs, the authors propose the following: 1. Use of an ultra-sensitive technique, such as GC/MS/MS/NCI for 7-aminoflunitrazepam; 2. Use of a cumulative specimen, such as sweat for GHB and 3. Use of a metabolite with a long half-life, such as ethyl glucuronide for ethanol.",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

This article provides an update on the progress made in this area over the past decade or so. Psychopathology and psychiatric syndromes associated with cannabis use that have received research attention in recent years include cannabis withdrawal, cannabis and psychotic disorders (especially schizophrenia), depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Status of a specific cannabis withdrawal syndrome and a specific 'cannabis psychosis' remains controversial. Current evidence indicates that there is a clinically significant association between cannabis use disorders and psychotic syndromes, depression, anxiety and possibly mild cognitive impairment. However, the nature of this association is often not clear. Several hypothesis related to the cannabis-schizophrenia association are examined. Cannabis use might be casually related to the later development of schizophrenia in an indirect way in a few heavy users, but more commonly, its use may precipitate disorders in persons who are vulnerable to developing psychosis and worsen the course of the disorder.",

      "title": "How once-nightly sodium oxybate is processed in the body in healthy volunteers: a plain language summary",
      "abstract": "What is this summary about? This is a plain language summary of an article originally published in the journal Sleep Medicine. Narcolepsy is a sleep condition in which people have periods of extreme sleepiness during the day. People with narcolepsy may also have symptoms of muscle weakness (cataplexy); seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling something that seems real but isn't actually there before falling asleep or while waking up (hallucinations); an inability to move before falling asleep or while waking up (sleep paralysis); and poor sleep at night. Sodium oxybate (SXB for short) has been used to treat narcolepsy for over 20 years. For more than 20 years, the only available form of SXB needed to be taken twice each night. Twice-nightly SXB (TN-SXB) requires people to take the first dose at bedtime. Most people fall asleep within 5 to 15 minutes after the first dose. Patients then need to wake up and take the second dose of TN-SXB 2.5 to 4 hours later, which is when most of the medicine has left the body. The United States Food and Drug Administration (also called FDA) approved a once-nightly form of SXB called LUMRYZ ™ (sodium oxybate for extended-release oral suspension; ON-SXB for short) in May 2023. ON-SXB treats excessive daytime sleepiness and muscle weakness, also known as cataplexy. People with narcolepsy who take ON-SXB only need to take 1 dose at bedtime. This summary describes a study that looked at how ON-SXB enters, travels through, and exits the body of healthy volunteers (people without narcolepsy). The study measured the amount of SXB in the blood after taking SXB in 2 different ways: as a once-nightly version and as a twice-nightly version. Looking at the amount of ON-SXB and TN-SXB in the blood at different time points helps researchers see if people who take the 2 medicines, with different dosing, have the same amount of drug in the body overnight. What were the results? Overall, the study found that healthy volunteers had the same amount of SXB in their bodies after taking ON-SXB as they did after taking TN-SXB. When they took the same amounts of ON-SXB and TN-SXB, the SXB stayed in their bodies for similar amounts of time. The highest amount and the total amount of SXB in the participants' blood were similar with ON-SXB and TN-SXB. The amount of SXB in the participants' blood 8 hours after taking the medicine was significantly lower with ON-SXB than with TN-SXB. This means that people taking ON-SXB will have less medication in their blood when they wake up the next morning and may be less groggy. What do the results mean? The results mean that if people with narcolepsy take the same dose amount of ON-SXB or TN-SXB, their bodies will receive the same amount of SXB in their blood. ON-SXB provides an option for people with narcolepsy to take their medicine once at bedtime without the need for a middle-of-the-night dose, which can improve quality of life.",

Marijuana use has been linked to transient global amnesia in some cases [4-6], presumably through the effect of Δ9- Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the Cannabinoid receptors (CB1) that are located presynaptically in the lipid membranes of neurons, which results in neuromodulation with changing the number of neurochemicals such as glutamergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic systems, all of which end up affecting the memory [7].",

      "abstract": "Aims: Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by alterations in motor behavior, vigilance, thought and mood. Catatonia syndrome occurs in many neuropsychiatric and medical conditions, but it is very rarely mentioned as occurring during alcohol withdrawal. We think that this co-occurrence could be underestimated in clinics because alcohol withdrawal symptoms may distract from its identification. Methods: We report the case of a patient presenting with catatonia during the benzodiazepine reduction period of alcohol detoxification. Results: A 65-year-old woman presented with a 15-year history of alcohol dependence and developed catatonic episodes several times during alcohol withdrawal treatment. Misdiagnosis delayed specific treatment. Symptoms of episodes dramatically improved 48 h after treatment with diazepam and revealed an anxiety disorder. Conclusion: This report confirms that catatonia is a non-specific response to psychological, physical and psychosocial stress factors. Recent alcohol withdrawal may sensitize the patient to benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia, and this phenomenon is probably underestimated. Catatonia Rating Scales can be useful when diagnosis is complicated as in alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal. In that situation, misdiagnosis is common and may delay specific treatment.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

Drug abuse is associated with many medical problems and complications stemming both from regular use and from overdoses. Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

Opiate abuse is often associated with benzodiazepine abuse. Hence, intravenous administration of the antagonist flumazenil is indicated in patients with suspected acute opiate intoxication resistant to naloxone. Cocaine abuse is not frequent in this country but is usually very severe and clinically heterogeneous. The clinical pattern of cocaine intoxication is initially due to excitatory and later to depressant effects on central nervous, circulatory and respiratory systems. The treatment of acute cocaine intoxication is symptomatic.

Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

      "abstract": "Abstract When individuals, regardless of their age, are subjected to a significant psychosocial stressor, two possible outcomes are likely—in one instance the person is not significantly affected by the stressor and proceeds on with their life without indication of perceptible problem. In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

However, one of the hallmark features of hallucinogens or psychedelic agents is their ability to induce states of altered or distorted perception, thought, and mood. Many hallucinogens produce classic sympathomimetic effects; that is, hyperactivity, mydriasis (dilated pupils), hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia. However, the effects vary considerably, depending upon the hallucinogen ingested. Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is suffering from hallucinogen intoxication such as marijuana use can be helpful to the clinician. However, the common toxicologic drug screens used by most clinical laboratories do not detect many hallucinogenic agents (such as LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide]). Thus, diagnosis of hallucinogen ingestion and treatment is often based on history of use and physical examination.",

In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions. Alcoholics with continuous drinking more frequently as a result of the facts of alcoholism are alcoholic polinuropatiju, in most cases, are divorced, live alone and have no children.

      "abstract": "Cannabis use is associated with a spectrum of effects including euphoria, relaxation, anxiety, perceptual alterations, paranoia, and impairments in attention and memory. Cannabis is made up of approximately 80 different cannabinoid compounds, which have synergistic or antagonistic effects on the principle active ingredient in cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The net overall effect of cannabis is thought to be related to the ratio of its composite constituents; in particular, the ratio of THC to cannabidiol (CBD). Since cannabinoids induce subjective and cognitive changes that share qualitative similarities with schizophrenia, cannabinoids have been used to model psychosis. Some limitations of cannabinoid models of psychosis include the relatively high variability in experiences between different individuals, the potential for inducing unwanted effects, such as toxic psychosis in study subjects, and the lack of data showing that effective anti-psychotic treatments can reverse the behavioural and cognitive/motor effects of cannabinoids. Nabiximols (Sativex®) is an oromucosal spray containing THC and CBD in an approximate 1:1 ratio. While not extensively studied, most studies confirm that nabiximols, despite the different route of administration and presence of CBD, have similar or slightly reduced subjective/cognitive effects compared to similar doses of oral THC. While the presence of CBD may have utility in some models, it is likely that the concentrations are not high enough to meaningfully affect those aspects important for psychosis research. This review suggests that while it may present an alternative to the use of oral THC, oromucosal nabiximols may not present substantial advantages for use in psychosis research.

      "title": "Sleep deprivation and hallucinations. A qualitative study of military personnel",
      "abstract": "Much anecdotal evidence suggests that sleep deprivation not only impairs performance, but also brings about other extraordinary effects like hallucinations. However, knowledge about how sleep deprivation may trigger hallucinations is limited. To qualitatively describe hallucinatory experiences during sleep deprivation 12 male military officers from the Norwegian Armed Forces who all had experienced at least one sleep loss-induced hallucinatory experience were recruited. Data were collected and analyzed by semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. This resulted in the identification of three distinct main themes: (1) Modalities, (2) circumstances/triggers and (3) reactions to hallucinations. Hallucinations were experienced in several modalities (visual, auditory and multi-modality), although visual hallucinations seemed to dominate. Typical reported circumstances/triggers were sleep loss, physical exhaustion, time-of-day, low calorie intake, mental exhaustion and lack of external stimuli (low sensory and social input, boring situations, and monotonous activity). Negative emotions were dominant during the hallucinatory episodes. Often some reasoning and checking on behalf of the officers were necessary to differentiate between real percepts and hallucinations. In some cases the hallucinations caused erroneous actions. Retrospectively, most officers viewed their hallucinatory experiences in light of positive emotions and several emphasized having learned something from them. The results are discussed in relation to the existing literature and suggestions for future studies are outlined.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

She concluded that heavy marijuana users do not process emotional stimuli in the same way as non-users and this is true even when stimuli are below the level of conscious awareness. The complaints by significant others of their marijuana using partner’s emotional absence is consistent with Gruber’s findings. Individuals prone to aggression exhibit more relationship aggression during irritability caused by withdrawal. Decreased motivation over years of marijuana use is evidenced by diminished activity in the nucleus accumbens reward circuitry in response to non-marijuana stimuli. Acute psychotic episodes occur most frequently with high THC products in edible forms. Epidemiologists repeatedly find higher rates of schizophrenia in marijuana users than non-users, and higher rates of marijuana use in schizophrenics than in healthy populations.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

Pharmacological therapies such as antidepressants and antipsychotics or also called neuroleptics are intend to reduce the frequency and severity of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenics. Treatment with antipsychotics which oftenly cause some side effects such as dry mouth (xerostomia). Secondary xerostomia to hyposalivation can also result in dental caries, oral fungal infections such as candidiasis, changes in taste, bad breath or burning mouth sensation. Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss among young group. The loss of one or several teeth can cause functional of mastication, speech and aesthetic disorders that can affect a person's quality of life. This study aims to determine the correlation of paranoid schizophrenic psychotic disorders to partial tooth loss in patients at Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. The method of acquiring the data were delivered by Non-Probability Sampling that use Purposive Sampling method obtained by 24 subjects. Data which obtained from the study were analyzed by the Chi-Square Test to see the correlation of partial tooth loss in paranoid schizophrenic patients with the effect of duration in medication treatment , gender and medication consumed. The results indicate that the gender variable did not provide significant results because of the p = 1.000. Nevertheless the variable of duration in medication treatment indicate a significant results because of the p = 0.041 and also the variable of the drugs consumed also indicate a significant results of the p = 0.027. The results of the study reveal a significant correlation between psychotic disorders of paranoid schizophrenia to partial loss of teeth in patients at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital with a significant duration of treatment and type of drugs consumed by the patient, but there is no significant correlation to gender.\r Keywords: Paranoid Schizophrenia, Antidepressant Drugs, Antipsychotic Drugs, Xerostomia, Dental Caries, Partial Tooth Loss.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

However, it has not been found a unique profile of impairment associated with cocaine addiction.To review the studies about neurocognitive performance in cocaine addicted patients, with special attention to the research method used.A great diversity in the research methodology of cognitive deficits associated with cocaine addiction has been used. These differences make difficult to compare results and obtain a clear profile of neuropsychological deficits. Even though, most of studies find neuropsychological deficits (mainly of medium size) associated with cocaine addiction. These problems are usually related to attention, verbal and visual memory and executive functions (working memory, mental flexibility, verbal fluency, inhibition and decision making). Moreover, in some studies a dissociated profile of cognitive performance has been found.Chronic use of cocaine is associated with worse cognitive performance. Therefore, the cognitive assessment of cocaine addicted patients can improve the understanding of the nature of the difficulties that these patients exhibit in everyday life and also can help to guide the treatment. Probably, the presence of subtle cognitive changes has important consequences on the behaviour of these patients. However, neuropsychological performance is not usually assessed in the assessment guidelines of this disorder. Therefore, it is proposed to include a neuropsychological assessment for initial assessment of cocaine addicted patients, as well as to tailor treatment to the found deficit.",

      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that presents significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by the following: (1) Social communication difficulties: challenges in understanding and responding to social cues, initiating and maintaining conversations, and developing and maintaining relationships. (2) Repetitive behaviors: engaging in repetitive actions, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or lining up objects. (3) Restricted interests: focusing intensely on specific topics or activities, often to the exclusion of other interests. (4) Sensory sensitivities: over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, such as sounds, touch, tastes, smells, or sights. These challenges can significantly impact individuals' daily lives and require specialized support and interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked (≥2) seizures that occur >24 h apart. Single seizures are not considered epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is often idiopathic, but various brain disorders, such as malformations, strokes, and tumors, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. While these two conditions were once considered distinct, growing evidence suggests a substantial overlap in their underlying neurobiology. The prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with ASD is significantly higher than in the general population. This review will explore the epidemiology of this comorbidity, delve into the potential mechanisms linking ASD and epilepsy, and discuss the implications for diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

      "title": "Organic cerebral reactions in alcoholism: psychobiological aspects of treatment.",
      "abstract": "The paper considers the rational biological basis for treatment of alcohol withdrawal reactions, alcoholic hallucinosis and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Both clinical and experimental data indicate that the alcohol withdrawal reaction reflects a state of hyper-reactivity of the central nervous system. The evidence comprises physiological, electrophysiological and biochemical findings. Magnesium, vitamins and antipsychotics are not specific in the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal reactions per se; rational treatment comprises drugs that may substitute for the suppressive effects of alcohol in the CNS during readaptation to the alcohol free condition (e.g. barbiturates or benzodiazepines). Alcoholic hallucinosis is characterised by acutely developed auditory hallucinations of an evil or reproachful nature. The condition may develop during or shortly after excessive alcohol consumption in chronic alcoholics. Suggestibility and unclear consciousness is not part of the condition. Tentatively three subgroups are suggested to occur: a) a withdrawal reaction; treatment with sedatives is recommended; the prognosis is good, b) a toxic reaction occurring during the drinking bout; this condition should be treated with antipsychotics until symptoms have disappeared. The prognosis is fairly good, c) a schizophreniform condition. Long-term treatment with antipsychotics must be applied. The Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is described. The condition often occurs during or shortly after an acute withdrawal reaction. The biochemical role of the etiological factor thiamine in glucose metabolism suggests that precautions (thiamine treatment) must be taken when giving a glucose load to alcoholics. Finally focus is set on the recent suggestion that the syndrome may in some cases result from an inborn enzymatic abnormality comprising low binding of thiamine pyrophosphate to transketolase. Psychobiological aspects of treatment in alcoholism may apply to a very large spectrum of conditions involving symptoms of cerebral, hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardial and peripheral nervous system origin. In the present expose we shall concentrate on organic cerebral reactions partly or exclusively presenting with psychiatric symptoms and signs. Thus the review will consider the rational biological basis for treatment of alcohol withdrawal reactions (including delirium tremens), alcoholic hallucinosis and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.",

      "title": "Where do we go in occupational neuroepidemiology?",
      "abstract": "Early knowledge about the neurotoxic effects of occupational exposures appeared through clinical observations. The observed effects were more or less acute and concerned exposure to metals such as lead and mercury or solvents like carbon disulfide and trichloroethylene. With time, however, also more chronic and clinically less obvious effects of neurotoxic agents have been assessed through modern examination methods and systematic studies of larger groups. Still, the interpretation of the findings has been controversial and debated, such as the chronic effects of solvent exposure (1). The difficulties met in interpreting chronic neurotoxic effects depend on both the diversity and vagueness of symptoms and signs and the associated problem of defining a proper disease entity for conclusive epidemiologic studies. For example, in solvent exposure, the chronic effects might include memory and concentration problems, tiredness, lack of initiative, affect lability, irritability, and sometimes dizziness, headache, alcohol intolerance, and reduced libido. Neurophysiological methods have also revealed various functional disturbances, again difficult to condense into any single disease entity. Similarly, a variety of neurobehavioral effects also seems to occur due to other occupational exposures, such as moderate lead exposure or welding with some exposure to aluminum, lead, and manganese or exposure to pesticides. Again there are also neurophysiological or neurological signs, among others, polyneuropathy, tremor, and disturbance of equilibrium, in individuals exposed to organochlorine, organophosphorus and other insecticides. In view of the epidemiologic problems involved in defining a disease entity out of the many types of neurobehavioral effects referred to, it has also become natural to consider some clinically, more or less well-defined neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to occupational exposures. Since the 1970s, several studies have especially focused on solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome, when of disabling severity. More recently also Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and related conditions have attracted interest in occupational epidemiology. Regarding solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome (or toxic chronic encephalopathy in clinical occupational medicine, when exposure is taken into diagnostic account), the problem of defining a proper disease entity was apparent and it first led to considering en bloc the diagnoses of encephalopathia, dementia, and cerebral atrophy, but also neurosis, neurasthenia, and nervositas were included as not necessarily distinct from each other in medical practice (2). Recently, more specific disease entities, such as organic dementia and cerebral atrophy, have also been associated with solvent exposure (3). The findings have not been totally consistent, however, as no excess of \"presenile dementia\" appeared in a large-scale case-referent study in the United States with as many as 3565 cases of various neuropsychiatric disorders and 83 245 hospital referents (4). However, in comparison with bricklayers, there was about a 45% excess of disabling neuropsychiatric disorders among white male painters, except spray painters. Occupational exposures also seem to play a role for disorders more specific than the psychoorganic syndrome. Hence, in 1982, an association between multiple sclerosis and solvent exposure from glues was first indicated in the Italian shoe industry (5). This relationship has been considerably strengthened by further studies in Scandinavia (6--8) and elsewhere, so that 13 studies with some information on solvent exposure could be considered in a review (9). Ten of these studies provided enough data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, showing about a twofold risk for multiple sclerosis among individuals with solvent exposure. Some studies also associate multiple sclerosis with radiological work, welding, and work with phenoxy herbicides (6--7). Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in rural areas (10), especially at younger ages (11). More interestingly, a study from Calgary, Canada, showed a threefold risk for herbicide exposure (12). All the case persons who recalled specific exposures reported exposure to phenoxy herbicides or thiocarbamates. One of them recalled exposure to paraquat, which is chemically similar to MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), an inducer of a Parkinson-like syndrome. Paraquat workers have not yet been found to suffer from such a syndrome, however (13). Case-referent studies from Canada, China, Spain, and Sweden have indicated a relation with exposure to unspecified industrial chemicals, pesticides, and metals, especially manganese, iron and aluminum (14). In a study from the United States, an increased risk of motor neuron disease (encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy) appeared in connection with welding and soldering (15). Welding also appeared as a risk factor, as did electricity work, and also work with impregnating agents in a Swedish study (16). Hereditability for neurodegenerative and thyroid disease, combined with solvent exposure and male gender, showed a risk as high as 15.6. Other studies also indicate that exposure to lead and solvents could be of importance (17--20). For Alzheimer's disease, no clear indication of any occupational risk appeared in a meta-analysis of 11 case-referent studies (21), but more recently an increased risk was connected with blue-collar work (22). Another new study, which included also the oldest ages, indicated that solvent exposure could be a rather strong risk factor (33). The recent suggestion that Alzheimer's disease might be related to exposure to electromagnetic fields was perhaps even more surprising (44). Both these studies are likely to stimulate interest in several new investigations along the indicated lines. Hence, in view of the current perspectives in occupational neuroepidemiology, as briefly outlined, there seems to be a reason for conducting additional work-related studies of different, hitherto more or less neglected, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is not unlikely that there are some contributing effects from various occupational exposures, in the same manner as we have seen for many cancer types. In addition, as in etiologic cancer research, new clues suggesting ultimate causes or triggering mechanisms behind some of the serious neurological disorders may be obtained from occupational epidemiology.",

First, a case is presented of a 150-day delay period before the clinical manifestations of brain damage after a single brief (<1 day) exposure to dimethylmercury. The second example is taken from the Iraq outbreak of methylmercury poisoning in which the victims consumed contaminated bread for several weeks without any ill effects. Indeed, signs of poisoning did not appear until weeks or months after exposure stopped. The last example is drawn from observations on nonhuman primates and from the sequelae of the Minamata, Japan, outbreak in which low chronic doses of methylmercury may not have produced observable behavioral effects for periods of time measured in years. The mechanisms of these latency periods are discussed for both acute and chronic exposures. Parallels are drawn with other diseases that affect the central nervous system, such as Parkinson disease and post-polio syndrome, that also reflect the delayed appearance of central nervous system damage.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

This was not a continuation of an earlier confusion or drowsiness (as is often found) since he indicated he was wide awake following hypnosis. Two parallels exist with previous reports: unpleasant childhood experiences with chemical anesthesia and a conflict involving a wish to experience hypnosis but a reluctance to relinquish control. Case 2 was a female who, while in hypnosis, experienced an apparent epileptic seizure that had characteristics of both petit mal and grand mal seizures. Although having a history of epilepsy, she had not had a seizure in 7 years. We suspect that the seizure was psychogenic and may have been triggered by wording used in the hypnotic scale or other similarities. Possible mechanisms are discussed and preventative recommendations are made.",

We present two cases that show the ability of caffeine to induce psychotic and manic symptoms, and we also review the extant literature on caffeine-induced psychiatric manifestations. On the basis of our own and others’ findings, we suggest that caffeine may be related to not only de-novo psychotic or mood symptoms but also to aggravation of pre-existing psychotic or mood disorders. We therefore suggest that caffeine consumption among patients with mood or psychotic symptoms should be assessed carefully in clinical practice as part of routine psychiatric evaluations.",

      "title": "Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Cannabis withdrawal is a well‐characterized phenomenon that occurs in approximately half of regular and dependent cannabis users after abrupt cessation or significant reductions in cannabis products that contain Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This review describes the diagnosis, prevalence, course and management of cannabis withdrawal and highlights opportunities for future clinical research. Methods Narrative review of literature. Results Symptom onset typically occurs 24–48 hours after cessation and most symptoms generally peak at days 2–6, with some symptoms lasting up to 3 weeks or more in heavy cannabis users. The most common features of cannabis withdrawal are anxiety, irritability, anger or aggression, disturbed sleep/dreaming, depressed mood and loss of appetite. Less common physical symptoms include chills, headaches, physical tension, sweating and stomach pain. Despite limited empirical evidence, supportive counselling and psychoeducation are the first‐line approaches in the management of cannabis withdrawal. There are no medications currently approved specifically for medically assisted withdrawal (MAW). Medications have been used to manage short‐term symptoms (e.g. anxiety, sleep, nausea). A number of promising pharmacological agents have been examined in controlled trials, but these have been underpowered and positive findings not reliably replicated. Some (e.g. cannabis agonists) are used ‘off‐label’ in clinical practice. Inpatient admission for MAW may be clinically indicated for patients who have significant comorbid mental health disorders and polysubstance use to avoid severe complications. Conclusions The clinical significance of cannabis withdrawal is that its symptoms may precipitate relapse to cannabis use. Complicated withdrawal may occur in people with concurrent mental health and polysubstance use.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol dysphoria is a pathognomonic, severe, and therapeutically resistant syndrome considerable for alcohol and drug-addicted patients. The term “dysphoria” (from Greek δυσφορέω to suffer, torment, annoy) means an abnormally low type of mood, characterized by anger, gloom, irritability, feelings of hostility to others. In addictology, it is often identified in the withdrawal syndrome structure. Objectives To develop innovative improvement in treatment for alcohol dysphoria. Methods Valid clinical diagnostic, laboratory, biochemical, electrophysiological, psychological (scaling, testing), statistical methods identifying alcohol dependence complicated by dysphoria. Results The proposed method involves a complex of anti-affective, anti-abstinence, anti-craving pharmacological agents and drug-free methods, and differs from those conventional, along with psychotherapeutic potentiation, by additional targeted pharmacological triad (peroral Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day: in the morning and in the evening; intramuscular Halopril (Haloperidol) 1 ml (5 mg) daily; oral Sonapax 1 tablet (25 mg) three times a day for 3-5 day treatment) used for a new purpose. 17 patients experienced this method. Efficacy: alcohol dysphoria acute manifestations were relieved by our method within 3-5 days that 37.8% exceeds conventional treatment. In 15 minutes, patients decreased irritability, motor restlessness, stress, cravings for alcohol. In 30 minutes, the patients fell asleep. Sleep lasted 3.5 hours on average. Subsequently, patients denied craving for alcohol, calmed down emotionally and psychomotorically, wished to be treated for alcoholism. No dysphoric relapses were observed. Conclusions The proposed multimodality method alleviates alcohol-induced dysphoria, involving pharmacotherapeutic triad along with psychotherapeutic potentiation.",

      "title": "Post-Stroke Apathy: An Exploratory Longitudinal Study",
      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (&amp;#x03C7;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

She then presented a depressing picture. In the current episode, the patient is anxious to be in a kind of dream. She says it is able to communicate through thought, and says his mind thinks fast. Make interpretations, giving meaning to everything that is new. Refer to hear voices in his head of his children. It is told with great emotional impact. Absence of previous consumption. Objectives It presents the case of a patient with psychotic symptoms treated early. Methods Psychopathological examination: conscious, oriented, collaborative. Good looks and touch. Tachypsychia and tachylalia. Speech inconsistent with loose associations of ideas. Dysphoria with emotional lability and continuous crying, feelings of guilt. Great anxiety component. Phenomena of derealization and depersonalization. Delusional interpretations of objects. Alterations of the experience of self. Possible auditory hallucinations. Insomnia. Results During treatment with olanzapine, income starts to 20 mg and then proceeds to therapeutic change aripiprazole with good response, objectifying a partial remission of symptoms, quiet and adequate meeting, being aware of what happened. Conclusions Schizoaffective disorder describes a mental disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mood changes underway in all cases with psychotic symptoms. People with schizoaffective disorder are more likely to return to their previous level of function than do people with other psychotic disorders.",

      "title": "Gone to Pot â€“ A Review of the Association between Cannabis and Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide, with approximately 5 million daily users worldwide. Emerging evidence supports a number of associations between cannabis and psychosis/psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia. These associations based on case-studies, surveys, epidemiological studies, and experimental studies indicate that cannabinoids can produce acute, transient effects; acute, persistent effects as well as delayed, persistent effects that recapitulate the psychopathology and psychophysiology seen in psychotic illness such as schizophrenia. Acute exposure to both cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids (Spice/ K2) can produce a full range of transient psychotomimetic symptoms, cognitive deficits, and psychophysiological abnormalities that bear a striking resemblance to symptoms of schizophrenia. In individuals with an established psychotic disorder, cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness. Several factors appear to moderate these associations, including family history, genetic factors, history of childhood abuse, and the age at onset of cannabis use. Exposure to cannabinoids in adolescence confers a higher risk for psychosis outcomes in later life and the risk is dose-related. Individuals with polymorphisms of COMT and AKT1 genes may be at increased risk for psychotic disorders in association with cannabinoids, as are individuals with a family history of psychotic disorders or a history of childhood trauma. The relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia fulfills many but not all of the standard criteria for causality, including temporality, biological gradient, biological plausibility, experimental evidence, consistency, and coherence. At the present time, the evidence indicates that cannabis may be a \"component cause\" in the emergence of psychosis, and warrants serious consideration from the point of view of public health policy.",

Consumption seems to be driven and maintained for desired effects on cognitive or emotional states. ‘Drug use’ in some situations is seen as socially acceptable such as getting a caffeine ‘hit’ from a morning cup of coffee to ‘get going’ or drinking alcohol as part of a social occasion. However, for some individuals and for some substances, drug use risks adverse consequences for brain function and possible enduring harm. This chapter will focus on how brain function may be altered as a consequence of drug use and describe the current understanding of the neurobiology of drugs of abuse and how this may be related to neuropsychiatric consequences. Drugs can produce neuropsychiatric effects acutely during intoxication or withdrawal, and also after chronic exposure, with effects which may or may not be enduring with abstinence.",

Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda .

Te nervous system affinity of alcohol is due to biochemical and metabolic characteristics of this substance: 1) Alcohol is rapidly and homogeneously distributed by body tissues and fluids, penetrating through body barriers, including the hematoencephalic one. 2) Because of its great liposolubility, it interacts with lipoid component in neuronal membrane causing long-term changes in neuronal conductance, and long-term structural changes. Behaviour disturbances in alcohol-abusing persons are related with: 1) Alcohol acute effects on neuronal membrane and synapses consisting in transitional disturbances on membrane potential and neurotransmission function. 2) Alcohol long-term effect causing by brain adjustment in synaptic transmission. 3) The relative irreversible disturbances induced by structural synaptic damage. 4) Other conditions related with alcohol abuse but not directly causing by it, such as nutritional deficiencies, and pathologic conditions seen in chronic alcoholism. In clinical practice we usually find disorders due to acute effects of ethanol on brain like different disorders related with alcohol intoxication; disorders due to tolerance development, such as withdrawal syndrome; and those chronic ad multicausal conditions with different degree of reversibility which are consequences of structural brain damage, like Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy, alcoholic neuropthaty, and alcohol induced dementia.",

In atypical courses of intoxication (\"horror-trips\") anxiety and excitement are predominant. Atypical courses of intoxication may be interrupted by \"talk down\" and additional application of tranquilizers. In a certain number of LSD-users in our clinic we saw psychoses. We classify them into flash-backs, exogenic (toxic) psychoses and so-called \"endoform psychoses\". The latter implies three possible constellations: accidental coincidence of LSD-use and psychosis; pre-existing psychosis with symptomatic use of LSD as an attempt of self-treatment; finally the onset of a psychosis may be triggered by the use of the halluzinogen. From the symptomatological cross-section they cannot reliably be distinguished from real schizophrenia. An independent nosological unit \"LSD-psychosis\" does not seem to exist.",

      "abstract": "The previous two decades have been marked by profound societal transformations, including ongoing developments in the illegal drug market and the emergence of numerous novel psychoactive substances. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the diverse clinical presentations of psychopathological conditions, particularly within the domain of psychotic symptoms, remains deficient. In this clinical overview, our aim is to provide a detailed analysis of the psychotic manifestations induced by various substances. Exogenous psychoses may present with visual hallucinations, delusional perceptions, and paranoid ideation, frequently accompanied by an ego-dystonic experience that deviate from an individual's customary self-identity. Variations in the presentation of symptoms are also influenced by the specific pharmacological pathways with which the substance interacts. Visual hallucinations characterized by vivid colours and associated with positive or negative emotional experiences are most frequently linked to the serotonergic pathway. Paranoid ideation and auditory hallucinations are primarily associated with the dopaminergic pathways. Dissociative responses, often characterized by feelings of derealization and somatopsychic depersonalization, are typically elicited through glutamatergic pathways. Lastly, the endocannabinoid pathways are associated with anxiety-related psychosis-like states, ideas of reference, grandiose delusions, and paranoid delusions.",

      "abstract": "Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a popular recreational drug, a \"designer drug\", which has been developed from the basic structure in amphetamine. Ecstasy has now reached the illegal drug market in Denmark via the US, Great Britain and Sweden. The drug is related to a certain youth culture from which it is estimated that many drug abusers have been recruited. The desired effects of ecstasy, namely enhanced openness, awareness and empathy, have previously been used in various therapeutic connections. In later years the drug has led to abuse which, in connection with certain cultural behaviour patterns (for example in discotheques), can cause dangerous psychiatric as well as somatic effects. The undesirable psychiatric effects range from fear through depression to actual psychoses, and the somatic effects vary from symptoms of increased sympathetic activity to malignant hyperthermia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and lethal hepatotoxicity. The last mentioned symptoms occur in connection with prolonged physical activities such as exhausting dancing sessions. The article discusses the available treatments for conditions of abuse and stresses the need for prophylactic efforts in the form of information and awareness of the problem.",

      "abstract": "This chapter updates our knowledge of the short- and long-term effects of cannabis on cognition based on integrating evidence from the most recent literature on this topic. Numerous studies have examined the acute effects of cannabis on human cognition. Cannabis induces perceptual distortions and impairs memory and concentration during acute intoxication. Studies of long-term and heavy cannabis users have continued to investigate residual or persistent effects of cannabis on cognitive function. Verbal memory is consistently impaired in chronic cannabis users, with impaired performance on word list learning tasks. It might be expected that people with schizophrenia who are already cognitively impaired may be even more vulnerable to the adverse effects of cannabis on cognition. Cognitive functions, encompassing attentional, memory, executive and inhibitory processes are impaired during both acute intoxication period and following long-term use of cannabis.",

In this study is shown a case with recurrent and inexplicable vomiting in a cannabis daily user and the diagnostic hypothesis derived from it.

      "abstract": "Adolescents with psychoses usually have full recovery from their first psychotic episode, but the first relapse often arises within 2 years of the first episode. Cannabis-related psychoses are difficult to distinguish from schizophrenic psychoses. Here, we describe a particularly severe clinical case, with a first psychotic episode occurring after heavy cannabis smoking, an atypically long symptom-free duration, and a subsequent non-substance-related episode.A 17-year-old male adolescent of Middle-East origin presented with delusions and hallucinations after extensive cannabis smoking. His first psychotic episode, with paranoid delusions and hallucinations, progressed into severe catatonic symptoms. His symptoms were treated with electroconvulsive therapy and risperidone and he was transferred to a residential substance abuse treatment center. He remained drug-free and non-psychotic for 3.5 years. Given the temporal association with extensive cannabis use, and his full remission of symptoms lasting several years, a cannabis-induced psychosis-though atypically extended-could be suspected. However, after 3.5 years without psychiatric care, and in a drug-free state, our patient again presented with positive psychotic symptoms, possibly induced by a period of severe psychosocial stress.We here discuss whether a primary schizophrenic episode possibly induced by cannabis can increase the risk of subsequent non-drug-related schizophrenic episodes.",

Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications.

      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

      "title": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: how to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat it.",
      "abstract": "(1) When people who are physically dependent on alcohol stop drinking, they experience an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms generally resolve spontaneously within a week, but more severe forms may be associated with generalised seizures, hallucinations and delirium tremens, which can be fatal. (2) We carried out a literature review in order to obtain answers to the following questions: how to predict or rapidly diagnose a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome; how to prevent and treat this syndrome; how to manage severe forms; and how to deal with the risk of vitamin B1 deficiency. (3) The main risk factors for severe withdrawal syndrome are: chronic heavy drinking; a history of generalised seizures; and a history of delirium tremens. (4) Anxiety, agitation, tremor, excessive sweating, altered consciousness and hallucinations are signs of a severe withdrawal syndrome. (5) Individual support and effective communication seem to reduce the risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. (6) Oral benzodiazepines are the best-assessed drugs for preventing a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly the risk of seizures. When given for a maximum of 7 days, the adverse effects are usually mild. (7) Clinical trials of other antiepileptics suggest they are less effective than benzodiazepines, and their addition to benzodiazepine therapy offers no tangible advantage. (8) Betablockers increase the risk of hallucinations, and clonidine increases the risk of nightmares, and the efficacy of these two drugs is not well documented. Neuroleptics increase the risk of seizures. There are no convincing data to support the use of magnesium sulphate or meprobamate (the latter carries a risk of serious adverse effects). Acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are not beneficial in alcohol withdrawal. (9) Gradual withdrawal, i.e. ingestion of decreasing amounts of alcohol, has not been compared with other methods but is generally not recommended. (10) There are no specific recommendations on hydration. Note that excessive water-sodium intake carries a risk of pulmonary oedema in patients with heart disease. (11) As vitamin B1 deficiency is frequent and can lead to serious complications in alcohol-dependent patients, oral vitamin B1 supplementation is widely recommended, despite the absence of comparative trials. High doses must be used to compensate for poor absorption. Intravenous administration is best if patients have very poor nutritional status or severe complications such as Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (a medical emergency), even though rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported after vitamin B1 injection. (12) Planned alcohol withdrawal in specialised hospital units has been extensively studied. Outpatient withdrawal may be more appropriate for patients who are at low risk of developing severe withdrawal syndrome. (13) A large proportion of alcohol-dependent patients were excluded from trials of withdrawal strategies. These include elderly patients, patients with serious psychiatric or somatic disorders, and patients who are also dependent on other substances. (14) An oral benzodiazepine is the best-assessed treatment for a single episode of generalised seizures or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal. (15) In randomised comparative trials benzodiazepines were more effective than neuroleptics in preventing delirium-related mortality. Currently, with appropriate fluid-electrolyte support, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and respiratory support if necessary, the mortality rate for delirium tremens is under 3%. (16) In practice, patients who are attempting to stop drinking alcohol need close personal support and communication, and a reassuring environment, as well as regular monitoring for early signs of a withdrawal syndrome; the latter may require benzodiazepine therapy.",

The symptoms of this phenomenon contain: sensed presence, fear, visual and auditory hallucinations, unusual body experiences such as out-of-body experience and feelings of floating/paralysis, experiencing a pressure on the thorax, difficulties breathing and a feeling of pain(1). This phenomenon appears to be universal, but has different cultural explanations(2). Objectives We present a case of possible incubus phenomenon to raise awareness about this specific condition. Methods A literature search in English was performed using PubMed with the following mesh term: ‘incubus phenomenon’. Results We present a 29-year old man, known with an intellectual disability (IQ=74), psychotic disorder and a cannabis use disorder. After neurological examination, he was diagnosed with narcolepsy and cataplexy. Over the past weeks there had been an increase of hallucinations that appear before, during or after sleep. The patient’s thoughts included sexual approaches by caregivers, difficulties in breathing and a moving sensation while laying down in bed and experiencing pressure on the thorax assuming a woman was sitting on his chest. Literature search shows a lifetime prevalence of 0.11 % in general population versus 0.41 % in psychiatric patients(2.) Conclusions Literature review shows only a few cases describing the incubus phenomenon. The prevalence is four times higher in patients with a psychiatric history(2) and should not be confused with psychotic disorder. Recognizing is important for proper treatment, as reoccurring attacks can be treated with anxiolytics, antidepressants, anticholinergics or anti-epileptics, and sleep hygiene methods(1.)

It is a complication which becomes obvious when the induced hypoglycemia is terminated by the administration of dextrose in quantities sufficient to bring about hyperglycemia. The picture differs from that of the usual uncomplicated recovery which follows the hypoglycemic state in that its criteria are: (1) normal blood sugar or induced hyperglycemia; (2) a shifting neurologic picture; (3) peripheral manifestation of fluctuant control of the autonomic nervous system, such as alterations in regulation of heat, disturbances in cardioregulatory function, sudomotor hyperactivity and hyperpnea, with consequent tetany; (4) convulsive phenomena or their equivalents; (5) prolonged coma, and (6) associated with recovery of consciousness, disturbances in the sensorium, alterations in memory function and a quantitative reduction in all higher cortical functions.

There are also two synthetic pharmaceutical cannabinoids, nabilone and dronabinol, available by prescription in the United States. The use of marijuana has increased in the United States with passage of medical marijuana laws in many states and legalization of recreational marijuana use in several states. In addition, the potency of marijuana has increased in recent years. Marijuana has been used for a variety of medical purposes, including management of nausea and vomiting, appetite and immunologic stimulation in patients with HIV infection and AIDS, glaucoma, neurologic disorders, and pain relief. Studies on the benefits of marijuana as a treatment for various conditions have been inconsistent, except for those on pain management. Marijuana has adverse effects, and has been associated with driving impairment, psychosis, dependence and withdrawal syndromes, hyperemesis, acute cardiac events, some cancers, and impaired lung function. As with studies on the benefits of marijuana, studies of adverse effects have yielded inconsistent results. Except for impaired driving and the occurrence of dependence and withdrawal syndromes, the adverse effects of marijuana use have not been fully studied.",

The consumption excessive use of alcohol mainly affects the human being that can be physical and mental since some aspects of the social and cultural life are forming and socializing like a placental activity generating effects of euphoria, bad humor and relaxation. Alcoholism produces pathophysiological effects where alcohol is concentrated in the blood which is related to the central nervous system causing depressive disorders where the human can lead to a coma. One of the main consequences is the excessive use of alcohol that causes physical, mental and social damages as it affects the brain centers responsible for self-control, which means that we do not stop taking the effects of substance use. Symptoms of withdrawal include autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor in the hands, insomnia, visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations. One of the factors that increase the level of alcohol consumption is sex, young age, aggression, anxiety, sweating, and depression. Through nursing interventions in a patient with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, it will be possible to identify, plan, organize and execute the actions that will be performed both for the patient and the family and to determine the most damaging effects and consequences in this type of pathology.",

      "title": "Clinical Indices of Tobacco Use in People with Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT People with schizophrenia are more likely to smoke and less likely to quit than people in the general population. Several biological and environmental factors could interact to account for high smoking persistence in this population, including increased sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of nicotine or conditioned cues, beneficial effects of nicotine on symptoms or cognitive function, higher levels of craving or negative affect during abstinence, exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms during abstinence, and reduced motivation, self-efficacy or support for quitting. Controlled comparisons of responses to abstinence, cues and nicotine replacement in smokers with schizophrenia and equally-dependent smokers who do not have psychiatric illness may help to clarify the degree to which these biological and environmental factors may contribute to smoking persistence in people with schizophrenia. This chapter summarizes the research findings in this area and offers directions for future research.

A 9-year-old taking clonidine and dextroamphetamine developed psychosis, abnormal involuntary movements, and insomnia. An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first. Clinicians should be aware of emergent dyskinesias when combining atomoxetine with dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotonergic medications.",

      "abstract": "Vaccines are crucial to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild to moderate side effects. A number of cases of cardiac, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric side effects have been reported as rare side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. This article presents a patient, who after the second injection of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, immediately developed anxiety, nonspecific fear, and insomnia as the prodromal phase of psychosis. Starting from the second week, the patient manifested delusions of persecution, delusions of influence, thoughts insertion, and delusional behaviour, culminating in the suicide attempt. The duration of psychosis was eight weeks, and symptom reduction was observed only after the gradual administration of antipsychotics over four weeks. The investigations of the patient did not support any structural changes of the brain, any severe medical conditions, a neurological abnormality, a confusion or a state of unconsciousness or alterations in laboratory tests. Psychosis due to the use of alcohol or psychoactive substances was excluded. The psychological assessment of the patient demonstrated the endogenous type of thinking, and the patient had schizoid and paranoid personality traits strongly associated with schizophrenia. This case indicates a strong causal relationship between the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine injection and the onset of psychosis. We intend to follow up this case for possible development of schizophrenia and understand that the COVID-19 vaccine could possible play a trigger role in the development of primary psychosis. Longer-term supporting evidence is needed to estimate the prevalence of psychosis following vaccination with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.",

What the authors observed was the same spectrum of psychic symptoms repeatedly reported from withdrawal reactions to alcohol or other sedativehypnotic drugs. \"Acute brain syndrome due to drug withdrawal\" is a much more precise phrase. Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued. Drugs such as the benzodiazepines (or phenobarbital)",

This uncertainty has sparked a lively-though still largely hypothetical-debate on whether psychedelics without subjective effects (\"nonsubjective psychedelics\" or \"non-hallucinogenic psychedelics\") could still have the same therapeutic impact, or whether the acute subjective effects are in fact necessary for this impact to be fully realized.3,4,5.",

      "abstract": "Anticholinergic poisoning is one of the most common causes of poisoning in the emergency department. Beautiful hawthorn (atropa belladonna), which is found in our country, is one of the plants that can cause anticholinergic syndrome. It is important in the differential diagnosis in cases progressing with general status disorder and loss of consciousness and psychotic findings. The onset of anticholinergic intoxication varies depending on the toxin and occurs within one to two hours following oral ingestion. The diagnosis of anticholinergic poisoning is based on clinical findings. Anticholinergic poisoning is easily diagnosed when a history of exposure to an anticholinergic substance is obtained and the patient shows altered mental status, delirium or hallucinations. However, in cases with no history and unknown exposure, the diagnosis of anticholinergic intoxication is considered when clinical signs and symptoms caused by mental status disorder and anticholinergic effects are detected on physical examination. A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of slurred speech, altered consciousness and facial shifting that started about 2 hours ago. On physical examination, the patient was incoopere and disoriented, GCS:12 eyes were spontaneously open, obeying orders but making unintelligible sounds, nuchal rigidity was suspiciously positive, bilateral babinski reflex was positive. On admission vital signs were blood pressure 144/72 mmHg, pulse 98/min, temperature 37 °C, SO2 94%, fingerstick blood glucose 104 mg/dl and ECG was in normal sinus rhythm. There were no acute pathologic findings on both brain CT and brain MR imaging. In the control physical examination, both pupils were mydriatic, IR -/- and the patient had dry mouth. According to the anamnesis obtained from another relative of the patient, it was learned that they ate spinach in the evening and speech disorder started afterwards. The patient was diagnosed with anticholinergic intoxication considering that the spinach eaten by the patient with clinical findings might have been mixed with the beautiful hawthorn weed. In this case report, we aimed to emphasize the importance of detailing the anamnesis and the necessity of a complete systemic examination in patients presenting with confusion and speech disorder.",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

En sus trastornos subyacian muchas veces ideas de persecucion y de referencia. Habia tambien frecuentes intentos de suicidio vinculados con breves periodos depresivos en los que verbalizaba un gran sufrimiento afectivo, que el explicaba esencialmente por dificultades relacionales familiares y por acontecimientos traumaticos (maltrato parental, accidentes). Dos anos despues, el cuadro clinico se agravo con la aparicion de sintomas esquizofrenicos constituidos por un delirio paranoide, alucinaciones con automatismo mental, retraccion social, desorganizacion afectiva y comportamental que se sustituyeron totalmente en sus pasos al acto autoagresivos. Luego se han vuelto mas complejos con la observacion psicoterapica que abre la problematica sexual e identitaria del paciente.La observacion consistio en una escucha atenta durante las entrevistas psicoterapicas regulares que han permitido recorrer la historia evolutiva de esta patologia, al mismo tiempo que su estabilizacion. Nuestro objetivo era despejar una perspectiva clinica y evolutiva que tomara en cuenta la progresion de los sintomas en funcion del tiempo hasta la constitucion de una psicosis propiamente dicha. Limitado por la exploracion neurobiologica (balances, EEG, IRM cerebral) sin resultado aparente, el analisis semiologico de los sintomas del paciente, de sus escritos y de sus simbolos nos ha permitido investigar diferentes fases precoces de la enfermedad, asi como el analisis psicopatologico de sus sintomas.Resultados: Esta experiencia personal nos ha permitido determinar el primer sintoma, conocer el periodo inicial de los trastornos y sus relaciones con los factores de vulnerabilidad (trauma parental y genetico), describir su evolucion segun la edad y reconstituir los sintomas de transicion psicotica. El fin de este articulo es subrayar el papel preventivo de la atencion precoz de los trastornos prepsicoticos. Sin embargo, sigue en pie el interrogante sobre el impacto de la angustia en el desarrollo neuropsiquico del paciente y sobre el origen genetico de la enfermedad. Conclusion: Insistimos en el enfoque preventivo que consiste en detectar los sujetos con riesgos de transicion psicotica y pensar en realizar una psicoterapia adaptada.",

Akathisia is a state of restlessness and motor agitation, which includes subjective feelings of inner tension, emotional unease, anxiety, a constant need to move, restless motor activity, and an inability to tolerate inactivity or rest. 2. Akathisia is often unrecognized or misdiagnosed as agitation or anxiety of psychiatric origin; this often leads to inappropriate increases in the antipsychotic dosage, which then potentiates its severity, or to the misuse of antianxiety agents, which masks symptoms. 3. Akathisia can be easy to recognize by simple clinical observation of the patient's behaviors, especially if the symptoms worsen after increases in antipsychotic dosages or the frequent use of as needed medications. Assessment must also include the patient's own report.",

Mainly, these psychedelic drugs have been used since ancient times. The most famous psychedelics that were used abundantly were magic mushrooms, mescaline, and DMT, which people used for smoking, swallowing, or inhaling. Mushrooms were usually eaten fresh, cooked, or mixed with tea. Occasionally, people of the ancient period used to take it with tobacco or cannabis. The common forms of NBOMe are inactive when swallowed; the most common methods of taking them are under the tongue, held on the cheek, or snorted.

      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

      "title": "Recurrent cannabis-induced catatonia: a case report and comprehensive systematic literature review",
      "abstract": "Background Catatonia presents itself as a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome, giving rise to various motor, speech, and behavioral challenges. It is noteworthy that approximately 10% of psychiatric hospital admissions can be attributed to this condition. It is imperative to note that cannabis-induced catatonia, while infrequent, has been linked to the use of marijuana. This connection has the potential to disrupt neurotransmitter systems, necessitating further research for a comprehensive understanding and effective treatment, particularly given the evolving trends in cannabis use. In this context, we shall delve into a unique case of recurrent cannabis-induced catatonia. Case presentation A 23-year-old gentleman, who has previously struggled with substance use disorder, experienced the emergence of mutism, social isolation, and a fixed gaze subsequent to his use of cannabis. Remarkably, despite the absence of hallucinations, he exhibited recurrent episodes of catatonia. These episodes were effectively addressed through a combination of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and lorazepam administration. Notably, when the lorazepam dosage was gradually reduced to below 2 mg per day, the catatonic symptoms resurfaced; however, they promptly abated upon reinstating the medication. The diagnosis of cannabis-induced catatonia was established, and its management primarily involved a therapeutic approach encompassing ECT and lorazepam. It is pertinent to underscore that this catatonic condition can be directly linked to the individual’s cannabis usage. Conclusion The connection between cannabis and catatonia is intricate and not entirely comprehended. Although cannabis possesses therapeutic advantages, it can paradoxically trigger catatonia in certain individuals. Multiple factors, such as genetics, cannabinoids, and neurotransmitter systems, contribute to this intricacy, underscoring the necessity for additional research.",

      "title": "Cognitive Effects and Sedation",
      "abstract": "Cognitive effects and sedation (CES) are prevalent in chronic nonmalignant pain populations receiving long-term opioid therapy and are among the most common reasons patients discontinue opioid use. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

Its use is associated with several short- and long-term side-effects such as changes in mood, impaired memory, impaired attention, depression and anxiety, and it is correlated with schizophrenia. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is characterized by chronic cannabis use, cyclic intractable nausea and vomiting, and compulsive hot bathing. Patients are typically diagnosed with CHS only after multiple medical evaluations. Recent research has identified type 1 cannabinoid receptors in the intestinal nerve plexus that have an inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal motility. This effect may explain hyperemesis in cannabis users. The thermoregulatory role of endocannabinoids may be responsible for compulsive hot bathing. We describe the cases of two young men seeking repeated emergency room care with recurrent nausea and vomiting. Abstinence from cannabis led to resolution of vomiting symptoms and abdominal pain.",

Report of Case A 64 y/o male, with history of ongoing complex movements occurring during his sleep, with no history of strokes or neurological deficits. Had extensive neurologic workup (all negative) including routine electroencephalogram (EEG), prolonged inpatient EEG (12 hours), and MRI of the brain. Home sleep study showing moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) AHI 24/hour successfully treated with CPAP therapy (residual AHI 1.7/hour) with improved nighttime symptoms initially. Wife recalls events as happening only at night while sleep, as patient often confused upon waking up in the morning, at times appear to sit up and smack his lips. No nighttime hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or acting out dreams were reported. Had two episodes associated with tongue biting and loss of bladder control. Another episode happened after a daytime nap, patient went outside and was mowing his lawn, went “completely blank “, appeared confused. No daytime or nighttime seizures were ever noticed. Patient do not recall any of the above events. Repeat EEG was normal. MRI/MRA of the head /neck showed small tiny focus in left frontoparietal lobe, suggesting remote cortical ischemic injury. Polysomnography (PSG) with seizure montage showed Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) foci recorded in the frontal/frontopolar leads without accompanying body movements. Interictal spike and wave activity seen during stage N2. Initially treated with carbamazepine (had skin reaction) switched to levetiracetam with complete resolution of his symptoms.

Methods:The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was data-mined for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Drugs were included if there were >10 reported adverse events and if the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score ≥ 2. Molecular Health's MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) reports Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions and was cross-referenced to improve detection sensitivity.Results: Using FAERS, the highest EBGM scores by class were reported as: pegloticase and α-1antitrypsyn (enzymes), iron dextran and ferric gluconate (electrolytes and nutrients), infliximab and gemtuzumab (immunomodulators), and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin (antimetabolites).Using MASE, the highest PRR scores were reported as: idursulfase and galsulfase (enzymes), iron dextran and phytonadione (electolytes and nutrients), gemtuzumab and infliximab (immunomodulators), mercaptopurine and azathioprine (antimetabolites).Amphotericin and vancomycin had the highest scores for the antimicrobial class for both FAERS and MASE. Conclusions:Using the two statistical methods EBGM and PRR, both specificity and sensitivity were preserved.However, neither system detected several drugs with established relationships to infusion reactions, including protamine and nitroglycerine.Reactions caused by these drugs were possibly underreported because the effects have been well established or due to evolution of administration with slower administration.We hope this analysis encourages further research into overlapping mechanisms for infusion reactions.",

      "abstract": "Normal conscious behaviour means awareness of self and the environment and depends on intact brain function.'Changes in the level of consciousness reflect an abnormal function of the brain.The degree, depth, and duration of altered consciousness may vary from drowsiness to brain death, and \"coma\" or un- consciousness is best defined as an inability to obey commands, utter recognisable words, or open the eyes.2Pathological conditions associated with this state are brain injury from trauma; cerebrovascular accidents; hypoxia; hypotension (low perfusion states); uncontrolled epilepsy; and disorders of metabolism, such as hepatic and renal failure and drug overdose.As well as managing the primary cause of the coma, energetic treatment is needed to prevent the complications of unconscious- ness, the most serious of which are hypoxia and hypotension.All unconscious patients run the risk of an obstructed airway from the tongue falling back into the oropharynx.The inability to cough or swallow leads to an accumulation of secretions in the mouth, pharynx, trachea, and bronchi.Vomit and regurgitated gastric contents may be inhaled giving rise to the acid-aspiration (Mendelson's) syndrome in the lungs.The already damaged brain cannot withstand any further insults that may occur from inadequate cerebral oxygenation and perfusion due to a low arterial Po2 or low blood pressure.3The unconscious patient may need total care for days, weeks, or months, the problems being those of maintaining vital functions (adequate ventilation, circulation, and nutrition) and general nursing care.Anaesthesia is a pharmacologically induced state of uncon- sciousness and the well-trained anaesthetists of today, with their skill in care of the airway, endotracheal intubation, intravenous cannulation, ventilator management, and knowledge of applied pharmacology and respiratory physiology, are particularly able to care for these patients.The skills and lessons learnt in the operating theatre have enabled them to take part in the development, organisation, and management of patients in immediate care schemes and intensive treatment units and to teach these skills to other doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, and ambulance men.",

      "abstract": "An obvious preliminary to the discussion of models of \"drug addiction\" is to consider what we mean by that term. Over the past several decades, a number of definitions of drug addiction have been used. Although some of the historically earliest definitions of addiction or drug dependence relied in part on the consequences of protracted drug exposure as defining characteristics, contemporary definitions generally recognize that use of a psychoactive drug itself is the central element in the process of addiction (see review in ). For example, the recent report of the US Surgeon General on Nicotine Addiction used three primary criteria in defining addiction (): 1. Drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior is driven by strong, often irresistable urges and can persist despite a desire to quit or even repeated attempts to quit; 2. The drug has psychoactive or mood-altering effects in the brain; and 3. The drug is capable of functioning as a reinforcing agent that directly strengthens behavior leading to further drug-taking.",

This hallucinogenic effect is caused by Psilocybin, ahallucinogenic substance often found within Psilocybe mushroom. This substanceaffects mental state of the consumer and has similar effect to those of LSD andMescaline. Aside from its effect to cause mental disturbance, consumption of thismushroom may cause acute renal injury which leads to a fatal and life-threateningsituation.Case presentation: A case of Psilocybe intoxication had been reported in a22 years old male with a confirmed history of consuming Psilocybe mushroom. Patientfirst came with a symptom of disorientation and restlessness. Patient also often shookhis head off, laughed out, screamed, and continuously making bizarre movements.Psychiatric examination confirmed a sign of auditory hallucination, unstable mood,and stereotypical behavior experienced by the patient.

Its use has been consistently associated with several health problems, many of which have in common an impairment in the cognitive processes of behavior, including the memory, attention, emotion and decision making. There is evidence suggesting that cannabinoids, marijuana´s primary psychoactive substance, have a negative effect in short-term memory, working memory, and decision making. It has also been found that cannabinoids affect attention and the interaction between cognitive events and emotion. This information can be used as an argument of biological plausibility to assess clinical and epidemiological research findings that show that marijuana`s use is associated to problems such as traffic accidents, psychosis, depression and poor academic records, among others.",

Because of their widespread prescription and the continued social use of alcohol, it is necessary to test for interaction between these agents. Drug-induced atropine-like effects in humans (including dry mouth, constipation and paralytic ileus) are described and related to animal experiments. Radiological investigations in mice indicate that alcohol delays the passage of barium along the gut, and this effect is enhanced by psychotropic drugs. Related drug interactions may result in prolonged or delayed adverse reactions. Late (delayed) deaths, recently recorded in humans and animals, may be associated with the inhibition of gastro-intestinal motility by ethical psychotropic agents, particularly when taken together with alcohol.

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

      "abstract": "Background Dizziness and imbalance are common symptoms which can cause an important impairment of the ability of the patients affected to perform their daily activities. Diseases affecting posterior labyrinth can explain these symptoms. Ototoxicity is a quite common etiology of simultaneous damage of both labyrinths. The aim of this study is to present and analyze a series of patients with chronic dizziness and imbalance induced by vestibulotoxic pharmaceuticals administration. Methods A prospective study in patients diagnosed by chronic imbalance due to drug-induced vestibulotoxicity was performed, along 12 years. The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect.

      "title": "Clinical Relevance of Cannabis Tolerance and Dependence",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Psychoactive drugs are often widely used before tolerance and dependence is fully appreciated. Tolerance to cannabis‐induced cardiovascular and autonomic changes, decreased intraocular pressure, sleep and sleep EEG, mood and behavioral changes is acquired and, to a great degree, lost rapidly with optimal conditions. Mechanisms appear more functional than metabolic. Acquisition rate depends on dose and dose schedule. Dependence, manifested by withdrawal symptoms after as little as 7 days of THC administration, is characterized by irritability, restlessness, insomnia, anorexia, nausea, sweating, salivation, increased body temperature, altered sleep and waking EEG, tremor, and weight loss. Mild and transient in the 120 subjects studied, the syndrome was similar to sedative drug withdrawal. Tolerance to drug side effects can be useful. Tolerance to therapeutic effects or target symptoms poses problems. Clinical significance of dependence is difficult to assess since drug‐seeking behavior has many determinants. Cannabis‐induced super sensitivity should be considered wherever chronic drug administration is anticipated in conditions like epilepsy, glaucoma or chronic pain. Cannabis pharmacology suggests ways of minimizing tolerance and dependence problems.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Mental illness and substance use co-occur at an alarmingly high rate. Causes of this comorbidity may include self-medication, genetic vulnerability, environment or lifestyle, underlying shared origins, and/or a common neural substrate. The consequences of dual diagnosis include poor medication compliance, physical comorbidities and poor health, poor self-care, increased suicide risk or aggression, increased sexual behavior, and a higher risk of incarceration. Appropriate screening, assessment, and integrated (mental health and addiction) services for dual diagnosis are key components of care for this complex patient group.",

      "abstract": "The stability of sleep was examined in two kinds of induced insomnia, namely after caffeine administration and after hypnotic drug withdrawal. The duration of each episode of any one sleep stage or any episode of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness was determined. After caffeine there was an increase in longer episodes of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but no significant change in the episode duration of any of the sleep stages. In the case of drug withdrawal there was no change in the episode duration of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but there was a significant shortening of episode duration in sleep stages 2 and 3+4, with a similar trend for REM sleep episodes. Caffeine 'insomnia' thus seems characterized by increased stability of wakefulness, and hypnotic withdrawal 'insomnia' by decreased stability fo sleep. The type of analysis undertaken in this study could increase understanding of other types of insomnia.",

Some psychotic reactions, such as visual or hypnagogic hallucinations, have been reported to be associated with zolpidem use. Case Report: A young female experienced three episodes of hallucination associated with the use of zolpidem. The visual or hypnagogic hallucination happened after she had stopped zolpidem and then restarted it 2 days later. Conclusion: We postulate that hypnagogic or visual hallucinations associated with zolpidem use may be related to rapid withdrawal and restarting of zolpidem. The possible mechanism may be associated with the changes in the GABAA receptor. Avoiding “as needed” use of zolpidem and using the lowest effective dose may prevent these adverse effects.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

According to this hypothesis,<sup>1</sup>drug abuse begins as a partially successful attempt to assuage painful feelings. This does not mean seeking \"pleasure\" from the use of drugs. Rather, individuals predisposed by biological or psychological vulnerabilities find that drug effects corresponding to their particular problems are powerfully reinforcing. For example, clinical observations suggest that persons who have difficulty regulating mood may be particularly vulnerable to abuse of cocaine or other stimulant drugs, persons who have difficulty controlling anger to abuse of heroin and other opioids, and persons who have high anxiety levels to abuse of alcohol and other sedatives. Many drug abusers report that their drug helped them to feel \"normal,\" even before they developed physiological dependence with continued drug use necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms.<sup>1</sup> Such clinical observations are supported by the recent",

      "title": "Communicating Auditory Impairments Using Electroacoustic Composition",
      "abstract": "Changes in human sensory perception can occur for a variety of reasons. In the case of distortions or transformations in the human auditory system, the aetiology may include factors such as medical conditions affecting cognition or physiology, interaction of the ears with mechanical waves, or stem from chemically induced sources, such the consumption of alcohol. These changes may be permanent, intermittent, or temporary. In order to communicate such effects to an audience in an accessible, and easily understood manner, a series of electroacoustic compositions were produced. This concept follows on from previous work on the theme of representing auditory hallucinations. Specifically, these compositions relate to auditory impairments that humans can experience due to tinnitus or through the consumption of alcohol. In the case of tinnitus, whilst much is known about the causes and symptoms, the experience of what it is like to live with tinnitus is less explored and those who have acquired the condition may often feel frustration when trying to convey the experience of ‘what it is like’ for them. In terms of impairment from alcohol consumption, whilst there is much hearsay, little research exists on the immediate and short-term effects of alcohol consumption on the human auditory system, despite over half of the UK population reported as consuming alcohol in 2017. The methodology employed to design these compositions draws upon scientific research findings, including experimental and explorative studies involving human participants, coupled with electroacoustic composition techniques. The pieces are typically constructed by mixing field recordings with synthesised materials and incorporating a range of temporal and frequency domain manipulations to the elements therein. In this way, the listener is able to experience the phenomenon in a recognisable context, where distortions of reality can be emulated to varying degrees. It is intended that these compositions can serve as easily accessible and understood examples of auditory impairments and that they might find utility in the communication of symptoms to those who have never experienced the underlying causes or conditions. This presents opportunities for pieces like these to be used in scenarios such as education and public health awareness campaigns.",

Éste puede inducir a trastornos psicóticos de larga duración, observándose una relación clara entre dosis-respuesta, así como precursor de enfermedad en población adolescente con inicio temprano de consumo. CASO CLÍNICO Varón de 26 años sin AP somáticos de interés. Diagnosticado de trastorno psicótico no especificado a evolucionar Esquizofrenia. Historia toxicológica: consumo de tóxicos desde los 18 años : cocaína inhalada y heroína , abstinente y cannabis frecuencia diaria 2-3 cigarrillos al día) . Refiere que inicia la clínica con alteraciones de conducta a los 18 años en contexto de consumo de politóxicos así como retraimiento social , ideas de autolisis y gestos autolesivos. Consta con 3 ingresos por alteraciones de conducta y episodios de heteroagresividad asociados a síntomas psicóticos. Ha recibido diferentes diagnósticos: Trastorno Esquizoide +Consumo de Tóxicos, Psicosis Tóxica entre otros. En el momento actual mantiene importantes síntomas de embotamiento afectivo, tendencia al aislamiento, apatía, escasa funcionalidad. Mantiene el tratamiento sin resistencias, aunque sin conciencia de enfermedad y evolución hacia la defectualidad. DISCUSIÓN Existe una sorprendente escasez de información y falta en el manejo de pacientes con patología dual. El tratamiento temprano del primer episodio de psicosis y la prevención del consumo de sustancias podría reducir la mortalidad por suicidio en la psicosis temprana. El consumo de sustancias se asocia con la aparición de síntomas psicóticos transitorios sin embargo, durante años el paciente estuvo orientado hacia un consumidor de sustancias sin tener en cuenta los síntomas negativos de la enfermedad dado que sólo se orientaba hacia un paciente con psicosis tóxicas en vez de valorar el inicio de un trastorno de mayor entidad .",

      "abstract": "Drugs have been used, misused and abused throughout the course of human history. Addiction is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by compulsive drug seeking behaviour and consumption, loss of control in limiting consumption and drug dependence typified by withdrawal symptoms when access to the drug is denied. An overviewof the background and our current understanding of the mechanisms that underpin substance abuse and addiction is provided in this chapter. The findings from neurobiological studies suggest that the initial response to addictive substances activate both 'liking' (hedonic) and 'wanting' hotspots in the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum, provoking both the pleasurable effects and the desire to continue taking such agents. People who are dependent on alcohol will display withdrawal symptoms on abrupt cessation of drinking or significant reductions in intake. The withdrawal symptoms include nausea, emesis, tremor, tachycardia, restlessness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares and transitory hallucinations.",

According to this hypothesis, 1 drug abuse begins as a partially successful attempt to assuage painful feelings. This does not mean seeking pleasure from the use of drugs. Rather, individuals predisposed by biological or psychological vulnerabilities find that drug effects corresponding to their particular problems are powerfully reinforcing. For example, clinical observations suggest that persons who have difficulty regulating mood may be particularly vulnerable to abuse of cocaine or other stimulant drugs, persons who have difficulty controlling anger to abuse of heroin and other opioids, and persons who have high anxiety levels to abuse of alcohol and other sedatives. Many drug abusers report that their drug helped them to feel normal, even before they developed physiological dependence with continued drug use necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms. 1 Such clinical observations are supported by the recent",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is characterized by unilateral or bilateral involuntary movements. Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

      "title": "The clinical toxicology of cannabis.",
      "abstract": "Cannabis is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the psychoactive principal constituent of the cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa). It is taken either orally or by inhalation, resulting in sedation, euphoria, relaxation and loss of social inhibition. Adverse effects from higher doses can include fear, distrust and a profound state of unease, hallucinations, ataxia, stupor and seizures. Long-term use can result in respiratory and cardiovascular toxicity and has been associated with a range of psychiatric conditions. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome can occur with chronic use. Driving under the influence of THC is associated with approximately double the risk of motor vehicle crashes. The intensity and duration of symptoms is proportional to the concentration of THC in the blood. Following acute use, THC only remains in the blood for several hours before it is converted into a carboxylic derivative of THC and this partitions into the fat, from where it leaches out and can be detected in urine for weeks after use. Treatment of acute intoxication mainly consists of appropriate symptom-directed supportive care. Children are more susceptible to cannabis toxicity, particularly seizures and coma, and therefore may require additional supportive care for these potential symptoms. The aim of this narrative review is to provide a brief overview of the acute and chronic effects of cannabis, its pharmacokinetics, toxicity and the medical management of intoxication.",

      "title": "Postcardiotomy Delirium: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

Following inpatient detoxification and induction on disulfiram, to which he was compliant and maintaining totally abstinent, he developed an acute delirious state 6 weeks after disulfiram. It was characterized by fluctuating disorientation, marked inattention, affective lability, increased psychomotor activity, irrelevant speech, social disinhibition, at times staring, talking to self and gesturing in air, and sleep-wake cycle reversal with evening worsening of symptoms. He was re-hospitalized and symptoms subsided by 72 hours after stopping disulfiram.

SS can be a life-threatening condition and occurs acutely due to markedly increased serotonin levels in brain, often following a coprescription or overdose of serotonergic drugs. These drugs can increase serotonin levels by inhibiting metabolism (such as MAOI), increasing formation (such as l-tryptophan), inhibiting reuptake (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)), increase release (such as amphetamines) or increasing postsynaptic receptor sensitivity (such as lithium). Overdose with a SSRI alone results in mild SS in about 15% of people but does not usually lead to severe toxicity [Isbister et al. 2007]. The occurrence of the syndrome is highest with a combination of SSRIs and MAOIs, though it is also reported with other serotonergic drug combinations.\r\n\r\nSternbach described criteria to diagnose SS (Table 1) and highlighted the importance of identifying it since it is usually reversible following discontinuation of the offending drug(s), supportive treatment and addition of a serotonin antagonist (such as cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine) in more severe cases [Sternbach, 1991]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\nSternbach’s criteria [Modified after Sternbach 1991].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been previous case reports of patients who experienced an SS when a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) has been introduced after the traditionally recommended 2-week washout from an irreversible MAOI [Sternbach, 2003]. However, we have been unable to identify any instance in the literature where a patient has been rechallenged with a SRI (such as an SSRI, SNRI or a TCA) after a further period of washout following the occurrence of SS.",

      "title": "Benzodiazepine Hypnotics and Insomnia",
      "abstract": "In summary, it is proposed that the more frequent or severe side effects associated with the newer triazolo-benzodiazepines are related to an interaction of several factors, including rapid elimination, high receptor-binding affinity, and unique chemical properties. Among benzodiazepine hypnotics, triazolam has a unique side effect profile for CNS adverse reactions in regard to type, frequency, and severity. All of the three factors mentioned contribute to this side effect profile: rapid elimination (the shortest half-life among benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics); high receptor-binding affinity (the highest among benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics); and unique chemical properties as a triazolo-benzodiazepine. Given these three factors, the drug's side effects can be understood as follows: Hyperexcitability states (daytime anxiety during drug administration and rebound insomnia following withdrawal) are related primarily to its rapid elimination and secondarily to the other two factors, whereas cognitive impairments (amnesia, confusion, and psychiatric symptoms) are related to the high binding affinity and unique chemical properties as well as to its rapid elimination. In contrast, benzodiazepines that are slowly eliminated and have only relatively moderate receptor-binding affinity (flurazepam) are unlikely to produce daytime anxiety and rebound insomnia and CNS adverse reactions such as cognitive impairment. The most common side effect, daytime sedation, is easily recognized and can be managed by dose reduction and/or intermittent use. This safety profile combined with the drug's high degree of efficacy both initially and with continued use provides a high benefit-risk ratio in using the drug in the adjunctive pharmacologic treatment of insomnia. Similarly, temazepam, which has relatively weak receptor-binding affinity produces very few CNS adverse reactions. Furthermore, temazepam (15 mg) is more efficacious than triazolam (0.25 mg). However, temazepam is not as effective as flurazepam, because it is slowly absorbed and therefore has limited efficacy for sleep induction. On the other hand, triazolam's safety profile of frequent and severe adverse reactions combined with the lack of efficacy for the current dose of 0.25 mg limits the drug's usefulness. In fact, the 0.25-mg dose has such a poor benefit-to-risk ratio that there is a real question as to whether the drug should remain on the market.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Manusia tidak secara tiba tiba menjadi tua, tetapi berkembang dari bayi, anak-anak, dewasa dan akhirnya menjadi tua. Masa tua merupakan masa hidup manusia yang terakhir atau periode penutup dalam rentang hidup seseorang, masa ini di mulai usia enam puluh sampai meninggal yang di tandai dengan adanya perubahan fisik, psikologis, sosial dan spiritual yang semakin menurun. Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis. Gejala-gejala kemunduran fisik antara lain kulit mulai mengendur, timbul keriput, mulai beruban, pendengaran dan penglihatan berkurang, mudah lelah, gerakan mulai lamban dan kurang lincah masalah tersebut akan berpotensi pada masalah kesehatan baik secara umum maupun kesehatan jiwa adalah satu kesehatan jiwa yang terganggu adalah mengalami kecemasan. Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas.

Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex disorder signified by both positive and negative symptoms that include delusion, apathy, and cognitive dysfunction. Adolescence is the most affected age group. Cannabis consists of two active agents namely cannabidiol and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The consumption of cannabis has repeatedly been linked to the occurrence of psychosis and subsequently, conversion into schizophrenia. The factors that affect the relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia are dose, age of onset, gender, genetic predisposition, environmental risk, and comorbid substance use. Many structural and functional alterations occur in the central and peripheral tissues because cannabinoid receptors are stimulated that are found all over the central nervous tissues and in some peripheral tissues. Schizophrenia patients who smoke cannabis have a greater chance of recurrence and extended hospital stays, and exhibit extreme positive manifestations. On the other hand, consumption of cannabis has demonstrated a reduction in negative symptoms and improvement in cognitive performance. It diminishes psychotic symptoms and has lesser adverse effects as compared to other antipsychotic drugs. Current evidence suggests that the consumption of high potency cannabis carries a higher chance of onset and progression of schizophrenia. It is recommended to develop preventive programs to avoid the harmful impact of cannabis use in the community.",

      "title": "Cannabidiol Induced Manic Episode: A Case Report.",
      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating compound derived from Cannabis sativa, has gained widespread popularity for its proposed therapeutic effects in conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD is often perceived as safe, with minimal psychoactive properties. However, its psychiatric safety profile, particularly in relation to mood disorders, remains poorly understood. We report the case of a 31-year-old male with no prior psychiatric history who developed a manic episode characterized by irritability, decreased need for sleep, hyperactivity, and aggression. These symptoms emerged after three months of escalating daily CBD use via vaping, reaching high doses shortly before admission. Toxicology screening was negative for other substances, and the patient showed clinical improvement with mood stabilizers and antipsychotics following the discontinuation of CBD. This case raises concerns about the potential of high-dose CBD to induce manic symptoms in certain individuals. While CBD has been proposed to have anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects, its influence on mood regulation may be complex and dose-dependent. The variability in commercial CBD product composition, including possible contamination or mislabeling, further complicates risk assessment. Current evidence from clinical trials on CBD's effects in mood disorders is limited and inconclusive. Clinicians should remain alert to the psychiatric effects of CBD, particularly in patients presenting with new-onset mood symptoms. This report underscores the need for controlled studies to assess the safety of CBD in psychiatric populations and calls for stricter regulation of cannabinoid products.",

The clinical picture is quite variable: aggressive reactions, anxious agitation, agitation associated with confusion: sometimes, the agitation occurs in episodes, especially during the night. These types of agitation have two basic causes: confusion and dementia. In some cases, they are the clinical expression of an angry, hostile or excited state. In agitation associated with confusion, one must eliminate an intoxication, a neurological disorder, an infection, and notably a past head injury which may have gone undetected.

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

Esta droga se consumía en muchas ocasiones para afrontar las largas jornadas de trabajo debido a que te permite estar despierto durante días sin reducir el rendimiento laboral. El Shabú es una metanfetamina fumada y una vez llega al cerebro produce una liberación de dopamina, adrenalina y serotonina. Las consecuencias de esta peligrosa droga de síntesis son notorias entre quienes la consumen produciendo insomnio, alto grado de excitación y palpitaciones. Esta droga altamente adictiva produce efectos tanto a nivel orgánico, como psiquiátrico: Psicosis(23%), depresión, ansiedad... Se expone el caso de un varón de 45 años de nacionalidad Filipina residente en España que acude al servicio de urgencias psiquiátricas tras conducta suicida (trepanación abdominal) en el contexto de un episodio depresivo con síntomas psicóticos secundaria al consumo de shabú. El paciente sin antecedentes personales ni familiares previos en salud mental, inicia consumo de shabú desde hacía seis meses con la finalidad de aguantar jornadas maratonianas en el trabajo. En consecuencia comienza con ánimo hipotímico, apatoabulía y perdida de capacidad hedónica con importante repercusión funcional. Posteriormente comienza con clínica autorreferencial y alucinaciones auditivas de carácter imperativo que le llevan a realizar dicho acto suicida, trepanándose con un taladro a nivel abdominal. Tras la valoración del caso se procede a un internamiento involuntario en unidad de hospitalización iniciando tratamiento con Sertralina a dosis progresivas hasta 200mg/24 h y Olanzapina 20 mg/24 h con adecuada respuesta tras varias semanas de ingreso. En conclusión, el shabú es una metanfetamina muy peligrosa y adictiva con efectos notorios no solo a nivel orgánico si no también psiquiátricos sobre la cual debemos de extremar las precauciones.",

      "abstract": "Typically, long-term administration of opiates leads to a reduction in the magnitude and duration of effects produced by a given dose (tolerance) and to physical dependence, a state manifested by withdrawal symptoms when drug taking is terminated or significantly reduced. Addiction or psychological dependence implies the compulsive self-administration of the drug, caused by both its reinforcing or rewarding effects and the unpleasant experience (i.e., abstinence syndrome) produced by the sudden interruption of its consumption. In contrast to tolerance or physical dependence, addiction is not simply a biological phenomenon. Psychological, environmental, and social factors can strongly influence its development. All these factors could explain the important variability of the clinical syndrome of addiction, and the various approaches that have been proposed to help addicts to stop their drug use. Nevertheless, these methods do not work equally well for all types of addicts.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Smoking is slow poison which could be the cause of death for all its users.\r\nThe cause of dependence to smoking is due to the presence of nicotine other then nicotine\r\ncommercially marketed cigarettes contain many chemical compounds which results in\r\nvarious diseases like cancer, COPD, ischemic cardiac disorders, renal and hepatic\r\ndysfunction ,oxidative stress and also causes impairment of memory and condition\r\nprogresses additional cognitive abilities or impact. Abstinence syndrome is major cue for\r\nsmoking\r\nAs per the previous studies of plant materials(active constituents )used in the\r\nformulation of Banico Emulsion conclude that the active constituents can deplitiate the\r\nsomatic and non-somatic signs appeared in abstinence syndrome and indirectly decreease\r\nthe dependence to nicotine. The somatic signs are assessed observing the animals directly\r\nduring the dependence and abstinence syndrome period and concluded whether the animals\r\nare recovered by the treatment with Banico Emulsion. The non-somatic signs are assessed\r\nby using various different parameters namely actophotometer, elevated zero maze, marble\r\nburying method , morris water maze and rotarod\r\nOverall withdrawal symptoms appeared to meetall the stated criteria for nicotine\r\nabstinence syndrome. signs appeared far more frequently after 16-24 hours after the\r\ntermination of both NHT and CS in their respective methods. The frequency of signs were\r\nfar greater in previously induced rats than in contol animals. Abstinence signs were\r\nsignificantly decreased with the treatment of banico emulsion.sharp transient decrease in\r\nactivity provide additional evidence to differentiate the dependence, absitnence and\r\nrecovery period.\r\nActophotometer is the parameter to assess the locomotor activity and anhedonia\r\nduring the Dependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period. Normal rat are\r\nexpected to exhibit an locomotor percentage of 60-70. The induced rats are expected\r\nproduce increased locomoter activity due to euphoria during the dependence period\r\nfollowed by decreased locomotor activity during withdrawal period due to the decrease in\r\ndopamine, nor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain. According to the animals which were either NHT or CS induced increased depression due to the termination of nicotine in\r\nwithdrawal period. but animals treated with Banico Emulsion produced a significant\r\ndecrease in a depression which was comparable to the untreated control which in turn\r\nindicates the increased locomator activity and decreased stress of the animals.\r\nElevated zero maze is the parameter to assess the conditioned fear during the\r\ndependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period. The ability to alternate requires\r\nthat the rat know which arm they have already visited.Normal rat are expected to exhibit an\r\nalteration percentage of 60-70. The induced rats are expected produce increased due to\r\neuphoria during the dependence period followed by decreased alteration during withdrawal\r\nperiod due to the decrease in dopamine, nor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain.\r\nAccording to the animals which were either NHT or CS induced increased depression due\r\nto the termination of nicotine in withdrawal period. but animals treated with banico\r\nemulsion produced a significant decrease in a conditioned fear which was comparable to\r\nthe untreated control which in turn indicates the increased alteration and decreased\r\nirritability or confusion of the animals.\r\nMorris water maze task represents more specific for spatial learning and memory.\r\nThe essential feature of this technique is that rats are placed into large circular pool of\r\nwater and can escape into a hidden platform. Thus, the platform offers no local cues to\r\nguide escape behavior and the rat can escape from swimming by climbing on to the\r\nplatform apparently learns the spatial location of the platform any starting position at the\r\ncircumference of the pool. The only spatial cues are those outside water tank are primarily\r\nvisual cues. Thus, the versatility of the task makes it a widely acceptable experimental\r\nmodel for the assessment of cognitive tests. Typically, the induced animals exhibited a\r\ndecrease time for escape latency during dependence period followed by an increase time\r\nfor escape latency indicating loss of visual cues to escape n to the platform during\r\nwithdrawal period. Such a diminished cognition was reversed by the administration of the\r\nBanico Emulsion at the specified dosage levels and exhibited escape latency (EL),\r\nindicating the well- developed spatial memory in spite of NHT or CS induced abstinence\r\nsyndrome. Marble burying behavior is the parameter to assess the anxiety related behavior\r\nduring the dependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period. Normal rat are\r\nexpected to bury marble upto percentage of 60-70. The induced rats are expected produce\r\nincreased burying of marbles due to euphoria during the dependence period followed by\r\ndecreased burying of marbles during withdrawal period due to the decrease in dopamine,\r\nnor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain. According to the animals which were either\r\nNHT or CS induced increased burying of marbles due to the termination of nicotine in\r\nwithdrawal period. but animals treated with Banico Emulsion produced a significant\r\ndecrease in a depression which was comparable to the untreated control which in turn\r\nindicates the increased burying of marbles and decreased anxiety of the animals.\r\nRotarod is the parameter to assess the muscle contraction property and\r\ntremors(somatic sign) during the dependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period.\r\nNormal rat are expected to exhibit an musle fall off time 50-60 seconds . The induced rats\r\nare expected produce increased fall off time due to euphoria during the dependence period\r\nfollowed by decreased fall off time during withdrawal period due to the decrease in\r\ndopamine, nor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain.According to the animals which\r\nwere either NHT or CS induced increased fall off time due to the termination of nicotine in\r\nwithdrawal period. but animals treated with banico emulsion produced a significant\r\ndecrease in a depression which was comparable to the untreated control which in turn\r\nindicates the increased fall off time and decreased tremors of the animals.\r\nnAchr's receptors are involved in cognitive and memory functions and several\r\nstudies have suggested their roles in dependence. Marked cholinergic deficit is a hallmark\r\nof the pathogenesis of smoking dependence and various drugs including NRT and nicotine\r\nblockade therapy have designed to target abstinence syndrome but failed to delpetiate\r\ndependence to either nicotine or other drugs. There was a significant elevation in the level\r\ndopamine, nor-epinephrine and serotonine\r\nPrevious studies concluded that anti oxidant property like SOD and GSHPx\r\n(glutathione peroxidase) in the animals treat the dependence and abstinence syndrome of\r\ncigarette smoking . It has been suggested that antioxidant might contribute to the prevention of dependence and abstinence syndrome. The superoxide dismutase (SOD)\r\nconstitutes a mutually supportive team of defense against reactive oxygen species. The\r\nmost remarkable effect of banico emulsion is increased activity of SOD in hippocampus.\r\nTreatment with banico emulsion preserved the reduced SOD to that of the normal control.\r\nGlutathione (GSH) is the major non-protein thiol antioxidant in mammalian cells\r\nand is considered the main intracellular redox buffer. GSH protects cellular protein thiols\r\nagainst irreversible loss, thus preserving protein function The administration of banico\r\nemulsion significantly preserved the activity of GSH, GPx in the hippocampus to similar\r\nlevel observed in normal control mice. The restoration of activities of GSH, GPx banico\r\nemulsion might promote scavenging of free radicals using recycled GSH from GSSG .CONCLUSION: The new methodology of inducing the cigarette smoke induced similar dependence\r\nand abstinence Syndrome when compared with the standard method of NHT induce\r\nDependence and abstinence Syndrome method. The new method induced the other\r\nCarcinogenic and Oxidative stress effects on all Body Parts.\r\nThe selected dose 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg of banico emulsion showed significant\r\naction on nicotine dependence and abstinence Syndrome but higher dose 400mg/kg showed\r\nbetter action than lower dose 200mg/kg.\r\nThe present study relieved the action of Banico Emulsion on nicotine hydrogen\r\ntartarate and cigarette smoke induced Nicotine Dependence and Abstinence Syndrome in\r\nSD rats. From the results it can be concluded that Banico Emulsion had remarkable effect\r\nin Abstinence Syndrome which is followed by reduced Nicotine Dependence. Further\r\nstudies are required for the identification of molecular level action and individual\r\nphytoconstitutent on depletion action.",

Caffeine is an adenosine antagonist. An antagonist of adenosine can lead to the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft, which can induce psychotic symptoms in vulnerable individuals. The patient had consumed caffeine in the form of up to eight energy drinks daily. She experienced persecutory delusions alongside auditory and visual hallucinations. She did not have a history of psychotic disorder but did have a history of generalized anxiety disorder. Upon cessation of caffeine, her symptoms resolved within five days. She remained caffeine-free and symptom-free 18 months later when reviewed in the community. This case highlights the potential psychiatric consequences of excessive caffeine consumption and identifies the need to screen for excessive consumption of caffeine in individuals presenting with new psychotic symptoms or worsening of pre-existing psychotic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder is the clinical situation in which one or more symptoms can present deficits that affect motor or sensory function and suggest a neurological or organic condition. Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "abstract": "Cocaine dependence has long been thought of as a psychological addiction without a physiological withdrawal syndrome. In animals, chronic cocaine administration produces multiple neurophysiological adaptations that may decrease activity in brain reward pathways. Recent clinical research suggests that cocaine abstinence symptoms include anhedonia, which is consistent with the decreased reward in preclinical studies. Thus, severe cocaine abuse appears to produce a neurophysiological addiction having a primarily psychological clinical expression. Recent research has produced encouraging preliminary data on general pharmacological therapies for cocaine abuse and on specific agents for treating cocaine abusers who have coexisting axis I psychiatric disorders.",

Most often, intermittent forms of alcohol abuse or dependence are observed in patients who present, between the acute ingestions of alcohol, a chronic consumption. Intermittent ingestions of alcohol can also be present among subjects presenting a pathological personality (antisocial personality) and a past or present dependence syndrome to heroine.

      "abstract": "With the recent legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada and 11 states of the U.S., the interest surrounding cannabis use is increasing. However, many people and even clinicians in Korea do not have exact knowledge about the psychiatric consequences of cannabis use. In this narrative review, the characteristics of cannabis, the endocannabinoid system, and the psychiatric consequences of cannabis use were provided. Cannabis contains more than 80 cannabinoids in the native plant. Psychotropic properties of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol are most well studied. The two main receptors are cannabinoid-1 receptor and cannabinoid-2 receptor. Several endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, act on the receptors as the endogenous ligands. Cannabis influences mood, cognitive functions, and psychomotor functions in acute phase responses, increasing the odds ratio for motor vehicle crashes. Long-term cannabis use is associated with various psychotic outcomes, including the development of schizophrenia, although there is interindividual variability. Cannabis adversely influences learning, memory, and attention. More frequent, persistent, and earlier onset cannabis use is associated with greater cognitive impairment. The chronic cognitive effects of cannabis are complex and controversial. Cannabis has addictive potential, and cannabis use disorder is common. Clinicians should have evidence-based knowledge about the consequences of cannabis use and communicate accurate information about cannabis use and its associated risks to the public.",

      "title": "Mutism as a Complication of Total Intravenous Anesthesia by Propofol",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: We read with interest the recent case report by Kati et al. (1). The authors describe a 56-year-old woman who developed somnolence and mutism for 11 days postoperatively, after total intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl, propofol, and vecuronium for a femur fracture fixation. The authors concluded that this neurologic complication may be attributed to an unknown effect of propofol. We think another possible explanation for the symptoms described in the case may have been a presentation of central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS). The signs and symptoms of CAS are similar to those described with atropine overdose and consist of somnolence, confusion, amnesia, agitation, hallucinations, ataxia, delirium, stupor, or coma in addition to tachycardia, dry mouth, dry skin, visual disturbances, and dysarthria (2). CAS occurs when drugs occupy central cholinergic sites leading to insufficient release of acetylcholine (2). CAS has been linked to many drugs including atropine sulfate, hyoscine, promethazine, benzodiazepines, opioids, halothane, and ketamine (3). CAS has also been described after propofol anesthesia (4) and even after nitrous oxide withdrawal (5). In animal studies, it has been shown that fentanyl has strong affinity for muscarinic receptors, whereas morphine and alfentanil do not exhibit any affinity for muscarinic receptors (6). Since the patient in the presented case received propofol, fentanyl, and atropine during anesthesia, we feel that CAS is a distinct possibility. CAS symptoms may last from hours to days (7). The diagnosis of CAS is made by exclusion, after ruling out other causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia and by a positive therapeutic response to physostigmine, a centrally active anticholinesterase agent. The incidence of CAS during the postoperative period has been reported to be up to 9.4% after general anesthesia and 3.3% after regional anesthesia with sedation (2). In a prospective study of 962 patients by Link et al. (8), 18 patients developed the syndrome, all of whom responded promptly to physostigmine administration. Katsanoulas et al. (9), reported two cases in which a delay in diagnosis of CAS resulted in unanticipated intensive care admission and acute lung injury. We suggest that the diagnosis of CAS should be considered in all patients, including the one in the case report by Kati et al. (1), who demonstrate abnormal postanesthetic awakening. Additionally, physostigmine should be readily available (10) and administered perioperatively in situations where the possibility of this diagnosis is considered.

In some individuals, EIAn characteristically occurs after a meal suggesting that the anaphylactic reaction is provoked by both exercise and ingestion of a foodstuff to which the patient has become sensitized. Two representative cases of severe food-dependent EIAn are described, which emphasize the need of performing a careful allergological evaluation in sportsmen with unexplained cardiovascular and/or respiratory symptoms during effort, especially when associated with other allergic manifestations and/or occurring in the post-prandial period.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis is the most widely consumed illicit substance worldwide, with rising use particularly among adolescents and young adults. Accumulating evidence indicates that chronic cannabis use may negatively impact several domains of cognition, yet findings across studies remain varied and fragmented. This comprehensive review synthesizes current knowledge on the long-term cognitive consequences of cannabis use, focusing on attention, executive functioning, learning, memory, language, motor coordination, and social cognition. Consistent impairments have been observed in domains such as attention, executive function, memory, and learning; however, most evidence derives from studies of acute or residual effects. Evidence of long-lasting deficits after extended abstinence remains more limited and methodologically heterogeneous. Acute motor coordination deficits are well established, but persistent impairments in this domain lack conclusive evidence. Effects on language remain inconclusive, and findings regarding social cognition, though limited, suggest potential deficits in emotion recognition and mental state inference. Early onset and high-frequency use are critical risk factors for more severe and enduring cognitive effects. Some deficits may partially reverse with abstinence, although many persist long after cessation. Overall, cannabis use is associated with widespread and lasting cognitive impairments. These findings underscore the need for targeted prevention strategies, especially among youth, and point to future longitudinal and mechanistic research to better understand the nature, persistence, and potential reversibility of these cognitive effects.",

The often fatal or disabling neurologic syndromes have only recently been recognized but are now well documented. Cocaine use is a significant cause of stroke in young adults, and the full, long-term ramifications of maternal cocaine use on the fetus will not be known for years to come.

      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "abstract": "The use of steroids and supplements can complicate the clinical picture in a young man with mood swings, anxiety, and depression referred for psychiatric evaluation by his primary care clinician and a psychologist. Identifying information: A 20-year-old single man was referred by his primary care physician and a psychologist for medical management of mood swings, anxiety, and confusion. Chief complaint: The patient reported unremitting sadness that had lasted more than a year, and said that he generally felt dead inside or like a zombie. He was often ruminative and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. History of present illness: The young man's sadness and disagreeable sensations were relieved only for periods of 3 to 4 days when he felt more worried than sad. It was during these intervals of worry that he grew more ruminative, tired, and irritable, and said he could not sort out his thoughts. The patient could not recall when he last felt well enough to have fun with friends. He ruminated about the past, often trying to change it in his mind and thereby causing himself to become confused about what was real and what he might have imagined to be real. In particular, he was preoccupied with the recent loss of a relationship with a girl, which began in high school. He blamed the loss on his moodiness. However, he also acknowledged that he briefly dated her younger sister, a short time after which the girlfriend abruptly stopped returning his calls, telling him it was payback for dating her sister. The patient spent a great deal of time online looking at his ex-girlfriend's MySpace social-interaction page, which only caused him to feel worse. He blamed himself for everything that was wrong in his life and struggled with thoughts that people were talking and thinking about him negatively. Because he believed he was physically too small, he exercised regularly to stay in good shape. Medications and allergies: The referring primary care physician and psychologist had prescribed sertraline 100 mg/d for 3 weeks. They then switched him to venlafaxine 225 mg/d, which he took for 4 to 5 weeks. However, the patient stopped taking both drugs on his own initiative because they made him feel numb, and he also thought they made him feel more depressed. In the week before the initial psychiatric evaluation, his father had given him some sleeping medications because he was often tense, keyed up, and unable to relax in the evenings and around bedtime. They did not help. Otherwise, this young man had not been taking any medications during the previous 6 months. Psychiatric history: The patient had never been hospitalized and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. As mentioned, he sometimes thought he could undo the past by some ritualistic rnental action. The young man was an only child and spent a lot of time talking about this. He denied any history of childhood trauma. However, he held an unusual suspicion that his parents were hiding a birth defect from him, and that this defect was in some manner related to his current issues and difficulties. He did not give any more details about this suspicion, saying, Every time I ask them about it, they tell me I'm crazy and just make a joke about it. His mother reported that it took about 10 years to conceive, but there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. The patient received no intervention during the first 6 months of the current episode, when his family doctor was contacted. The doctor referred the patient to a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist quickly referred him back to the doctor, believing that the young man needed a prescription for antidepressant medication. His mother said he was drinking alcohol more regularly while on his medications, and that he was probably not fully compliant with the antidepressant regimens. He was never prescribed benzodiazepines for his anxiety and tension, apparently due to concern about abuse potential. …",

      "abstract": "Definition of stroke In epidemiological studies, stroke is defined by clinical findings and symptoms [1]: rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent cause other than a vascular origin. This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

Serta gejala lainnya berupa merasa pesimis atau putus asa, merasa bersalah, gagal, dan sendirian, berbicara atau bergerak dengan lamban, sulit berkonsentrasi, mengingat, maupun mengambil keputusan, tidur yang lebih sedikit atau lebih banyak daripada biasanya, nafsu makan dan perubahan berat badan yang meningkat atau menurun dari biasanya, adanya pikiran atau percobaan bunuh diri minimal dalam waktu 2 minggu. Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang.

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n“An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and symptoms resulting from abnormal excessive synchronous neuronal activity of the brain.” The word seizure is of Greek origin, the root word being “seiein” which means “to shake”. “Epilepsy is a disease of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures.” It is also characterized by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of the\r\ncondition. Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the three:\r\n1. Two or more unprovoked seizures which occurs >24 h apart.\r\n2. One unprovoked seizure and a chance of occurrence of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years.\r\n3. Diagnosis of an electro clinical syndrome.\r\nEpilepsy is said to be resolved in those children who had an age specific epilepsy syndrome but now have crossed that age group or children who have been seizure-free for the past ten years, with no antiepileptics for the past five years.\r\nOBJECTIVE:\r\nThe aim of the study was to identify the pattern of abnormalities in MRI and EEG in developmentally normal children presenting with new onset seizures.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThe study was a prospective observational study conducted in our hospital, Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children for a period of six months. The study included children who presented with new onset seizures in the age group 2 months to 12 years. Children with simple febrile seizures, acute CNS infection, trauma, toxin, metabolic seizures, chronic neurological illness were excluded. All the children underwent complete neurological examination, MRI brain and EEG.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe study included 100 children from 2months to 12 years. The results were statistically analyzed. The most common age group of children presenting new onset seizures was 6 to 12 years, mean age being 5.4 years. The commonest seizure type was generalized tonic clonic seizures. Eleven percent of the children presented with status epilepticus as the first episode of new onset seizures. MRI abnormalities were seen in 29% of the children most common finding being Ring enhancing lesion(65.5%). EEG abnormalities were seen in 38% of the children, commonest abnormality being generalized spikes(63.2%).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nRing enhancing lesion is the most common abnormality in neuroimaging detected in children presenting with new onset seizures. Generalized epileptiform activity is the commonest EEG abnormality noted in children with new onset seizures.",

Case presentation A 17-year-old Dutch Caucasian male lost the ability to understand and speak Dutch for 24 hours after an orthopedic surgery, combined with a brief confused state including disorientation of place and the inability to recognize his parents. During the period, he communicated in English, which he had learned during school classes but had never spoken outside of school. Further follow-up, including neuropsychological examination, revealed no indication of cognitive impairment. Conclusions The exact pathophysiology of foreign language syndrome remains unclear, most specifically whether it is a syndrome of its own or a phenotype of emergence delirium. There is still much to be learned, and further research is needed.",

      "title": "Acute dystonic reaction due to a combination of chloroquine and doxycycline in an emergency psychiatry setting",
      "abstract": "Sir, Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects that are seen after the initiation or a rapid increase in the dose of neuroleptic drugs, mainly typical antipsychotics, and have a varied presentation, such as torticollis, trismus, “mouth opening” dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.[1] They frequently present to clinicians in an emergency setting and may sometimes be tricky to handle. Drug-induced movement disorders usually have a clear temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset (some typically occurring with first dose).[1] They are also dose – dependent, and with the exception of tardive syndromes, have a complete resolution after discontinuation of the offending agent.[1] Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation, or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.[1] Chloroquine is a drug commonly used for the treatment of malaria and has been reported to have gastrointestinal problems, headaches, blurring of vision, and itching as the common side effects.[2] Dystonia induced by chloroquine, although rare, is not really new and is mentioned in patient information leaflets.[2] However, such incidents are rare and mainly have been reported with the first dose. No case reports on acute dystonic reactions with a stable dose of chloroquine or with doxycycline are available. In view of current coronavirus disease pandemic, several combinations of antibiotics and antivirals are being tried and this report necessitates an exercise of caution for possible adverse drug reactions. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man presented to an emergency psychiatry setting with the complaints of difficulty in lowering his gaze, up-rolling of eyeballs, and difficulty in jaw opening for the last 2 h. On examination, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. He had difficulty in opening his mouth and lowering his gaze. He appeared to have an acute dystonic reaction presenting with trismus and oculogyric crisis. Other aspects of his general examination were unremarkable. His systemic examination, which included an exhaustive neurological examination, was normal. All baseline investigations, including complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, and random blood glucose, were within normal limits. His resting electrocardiogram was also normal. There was no past history of similar complaints or of any transient ischemic attack, and he had neither a family history of dystonia nor a history of alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking, or use of illicit drugs or history of taking psychotropic medications. On enquiry, the patient yielded that he had fever for the past 3–4 days, for which he was taking some medications from a physician. All his blood parameters were normal, and he had tested negative for dengue and malaria. However, as it is a common practice in India to empirically start a patient on antibiotics, he had been started on chloroquine (500 mg once daily dosing) and doxycycline (100 mg twice a day). It was after his third dose that he had developed an acute dystonic reaction. Immediately, an injection of promethazine 50 mg was administered intramuscularly. After 15 min, there was some relief in his symptoms. Later on, after giving an injection of intravenous diazepam 5 mg, the patient's symptoms improved considerably. He was kept was observation for 2–3 h and later discharged on oral diazepam 5 mg once daily for 3 days. He was asked to discontinue the antibiotics, and on follow-up, the patient had no further complaints and reported 100% improvement. DISCUSSION Rampant use of antibiotics and their amalgamations has concerning effects such as antimicrobial resistance and higher occurrence of adverse side effects. While most side effects appear nonchalant, there are a few which could be life-threatening, such as acute dystonic reaction. Oculogyric crisis is the only form of acute dystonia that may occur, while the patient is receiving a stable dose of an antipsychotic drug; it may be provoked by alcohol, emotional stress, fatigue, or suggestion.[3] Given the paucity of literature on chloroquine- and doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, we report a case of an acute dystonic reaction presenting as oculogyric crisis with trismus in a patient who was on a stable dose of chloroquine and doxycycline, being empirically treated for fever with a combination of antimalarial and broad-spectrum antibiotic. At a standard dose for malaria treatment, the common adverse effects of chloroquine include gastrointestinal problems, headaches, nightmare, blurring of vision, and itching. Using the Naranjo algorithm, the patient appeared to have probable adverse drug reaction when chloroquine was considered as a cause (score = 6). If doxycycline is considered as a cause alone, the score would be 5 indicating probable adverse drug reactions due to it. The difference of scoring occurs only on the first question of the algorithm as no report mentions dystonia due to doxycycline. This also sheds light on the importance of the first question of the Naranjo algorithm and the need to report such possible adverse reactions. Acute dystonic reactions usually result due to dopamine receptor-2 (D2) blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, which results in an excess of striatal cholinergic output.[1] The pathophysiological mechanism underlying chloroquine-associated acute dystonic reaction suggests a reduction in the forebrain catecholamine levels and an inhibition of neuronal calcium uptake.[4] Gamma aminobutyric acid has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of acute dystonic reactions, and this is supported by the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in reducing chloroquine-induced acute dystonic reactions.[1] This also explains why our patient improved with diazepam and promethazine had minimal effect on him. There is no available literature on doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, and whether this drug had a contribution in the development of oculogyric crisis in our patient is uncertain. The combination of chloroquine and doxycycline has been shown to be synergistic in the treatment of malaria with increased efficacy of chloroquine on addition of doxycycline.[5] This could perhaps also predispose patients on this combination to develop rare side effects such as dystonia. Doxycycline has been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons and increase levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain and can theoretically lead to dystonia.[6] Hence, we advocate an index of suspicion for oculogyric crisis whenever these drugs are being prescribed, especially in combination.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in knowledge about cannabinoid receptor function have renewed interest in the association between cannabis and psychosis. Converging lines of evidence suggest that cannabinoids can produce a full range of transient schizophrenia-like positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Cannabinoids also produce some psychophysiological deficits also known to be present in schizophrenia. Also clear is that in individuals with an established psychotic disorder, cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness. Increasing evidence suggests that early and heavy cannabis exposure may increase the risk of developing a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. The relationship between cannabis exposure and schizophrenia fulfills some, but not all, of the usual criteria for causality. However, most people who use cannabis do not develop schizophrenia, and many people diagnosed with schizophrenia have never used cannabis. Therefore, it is likely that cannabis exposure is a \"component cause\" that interacts with other factors to \"cause\" schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, but is neither necessary nor sufficient to do so alone. In the absence of known causes of schizophrenia, however, and the implications for public health policy should such a link be established the role of component causes such as cannabinoid exposure should remain a focus of further study. Finally, further work is necessary to identify the factors that underlie individual vulnerability to cannabinoid-related psychosis and to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying this risk.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a cognitive (appraisal and coping), interactive (person x situation interaction) and multidimensional (three response systems) perspective of anxiety, stress and emotions is presented. According to it, anxiety is conceptualized as a negative or unpleasant emotion characterized by subjective distress, high physiological activation, unadapted motor responses; at the same time, anxiety is linked to individual differences in certain situational areas (specific traits). Anxiety reactions appear due to subject perceives that a certain situation seems threating (situation's appraisal), with no apparent solution due to a lack of resources (coping abilities). For somebody, certain consummatory behaviors such as eating, alcohol consumption, smoking, or drug abuse could relieve distress symptoms or reduce physiological activation producing by anxiety. However, such consumption behaviors could become more and more necessary in order to alleviate anxiety symptoms or avoiding the withdrawal, which is a clinical syndrome including intense anxiety manifestations. The possibility to stop the consumption is interpreted as a threatening situation which provokes more anxiety; the only coping response available is to maintain consumption. Regarding addiction treatments, there are significant interactions between type of treatment x type of patient. Anxiety is on of the variables evaluated in order to design more effective treatments matched with the characteristics of the patient.",

      "title": "Amphetamine Use as a Risk Factor for Low-Dose Risperidone–Induced Acute Dystonia",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia is defined as sustained abnormal postures or muscle spasms that develop within 7 days of starting or rapidly raising the dose of an antipsychotic medication.1 Risk factors include young age, male sex, previous instance of acute dystonia, use of psychoactive substances, rapid titration, and use of high-potency antipsychotics.2 Although second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have a lower risk than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) to induce acute dystonia, significant differences exist between SGAs in their ability to induce extrapyramidal symptoms.3,4 The following case report describes a young male patient abusing amphetamine who, shortly after initiating low-dose risperidone, developed acute dystonia that did not occur with olanzapine use.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A, a 24 year-old man, was admitted because of paranoid delusional thinking and agitation following daily use of amphetamine. He had no other medical history. A few months earlier, he had been hospitalized in the exact same circumstances and was treated successfully with olanzapine 10 mg daily without presenting any motor anomalies. Olanzapine was prescribed after discharge from the hospital, but Mr A stopped the medication a few weeks later. When he was readmitted more than 4 months later, risperidone orally disintegrating tablet 2 mg was introduced at bedtime. The following morning, the patient developed a sensation of thick tongue, had difficulty swallowing his saliva, and experienced neck and jaw rigidity. No respiratory difficulty was noticed. Within 30 minutes following the administration of diphenhydramine 25 mg intramuscularly, the dystonic symptoms diminished and resolved completely within the next few hours. Risperidone was replaced by olanzapine 10 mg at bedtime, and complete resolution of the psychotic symptoms was obtained without recurrence of dystonic symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe exact pathophysiology of acute dystonia remains unknown but probably involves blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum. It has been proposed that by blocking serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, SGAs increase dopamine release by substantia nigra neurons in the basal ganglia, which would explain the lower risk of dystonic reactions compared with FGAs. Psychostimulant drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, are considered a precipitating factor for acute dystonia.5,6 Although these substances may initially enhance release of dopamine in the striatum,7 their long-term use is associated with striatal dopaminergic down-regulation.8 In our case report, amphetamine abuse appears to increase the risk of an acute dystonic reaction with risperidone but not with olanzapine. One could argue that the blood concentration of amphetamine had decreased by the time olanzapine was prescribed and this could reduce the risk of dystonia. However, on the first hospitalization the patient did not have a dystonic reaction when treated with olanzapine although he was taking similar quantity of amphetamine on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nAlthough both risperidone and olanzapine have similar binding affinities to dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, only olanzapine has significant anticholinergic properties.3 In our patient, the addition of the anticholinergic drug diphenhydramine to risperidone significantly reduced the dystonic symptoms, suggesting that acetylcholine is involved in some way in the etiology of this motor side effect. In a recent study, patients at risk for acute dystonia used anticholinergic drugs more often when treated with risperidone than with olanzapine.9 Therefore, blockade of 5-HT2 receptors alone by an SGA may not be sufficient to prevent a dystonic reaction in high-risk patients. In our patient, the induction of dystonic symptoms by risperidone was not likely due to an increase in dopamine D2 blockade by risperidone, as dose equivalence studies suggest that risperidone 3 mg is equivalent to olanzapine 10 mg.10,11\r\n\r\nThis case report suggests that low-dose risperidone, but not olanzapine, can induce an acute dystonic reaction when amphetamine abuse is present. We propose that the anticholinergic activity of olanzapine, in addition to its serotonin 5-HT2 blockade, contributes to the lower risk of dystonic reaction compared with risperidone. Therefore, an SGA having both anticholinergic and anti–serotonin 5-HT2 activity might be a better choice to prevent acute dystonia in high-risk patients.",

The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

The caffeine withdrawal syndrome and the headache associated with it may also mimic anxiety. Patients with caffeinism will generally be identified only by routine inquiry into their caffeine intake. The psychiatrist should especially suspect caffeinism in patients who do not respond to psychopharmacological agents or who have psychophysiological complaints and recurrent headaches, chronic coffee-drinking patients on inpatient psychiatric services, and hyperkinetic children.

This paper reviews research into long-term effects on cognition which are likely to represent neurotoxicity. Research is hampered by numerous confounds and methodological difficulties. With recent cannabis use there is both an acute and a residual effect on cognition, making it important to have a significant abstinence period from cannabis when studying effects of MDMA in recreational users of both substances. It would appear that MDMA does indeed have subtle long-term effects on complex memory and executive functions that are independent of cannabis and may remain with abstention. This is consistent with evidence of disruption of the serotonin system in animal and human studies. Chronic effects on cognition due to cannabis are less consistently demonstrated, but more sensitive tests including electrophysiological measures have revealed long-term deficits in attention.",

Desde hace aproximadamente un año, el paciente refiere percepciones visuales de pequeños animales (“bichos”) que asocia con palomas o gallinas, así como sensaciones táctiles compatibles con formicación. Estas percepciones son interpretadas como infestación corporal, llegando a relacionarlas con la ingesta alimentaria o vía nasal. No se evidencian lesiones dérmicas ni signos objetivos de infestación. El uso de insecticida ha sido reforzador de la convicción delirante. La sintomatología se presenta en el contexto de pérdida visual severa, sin evidencia de psicosis activa ni trastorno del ánimo mayor, aunque se detecta componente afectivo reactivo vinculado al duelo prolongado por fallecimiento de su esposa. Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social. Este caso ilustra la complejidad diagnóstica de los trastornos perceptivos en el adulto mayor, así como la interacción entre déficits sensoriales, factores afectivos y creencias delirantes en el contexto geriátrico5.",

There have been reported several signs and symptoms that are considered to have a predictive value in a first psychotic episode, namely in the mood or anxious spectrums. However, these symptoms are not specific and can overlap with other disorders that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Aim. We report the case of two young subjects who developed an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during a heavy use of ecstasy. After several months of discontinuation of the drug, major depression with psychotic features developed in one subject and a psychotic disorder in the other individual. No mental disorder preceded the use of ecstasy in any subject. Findings. A familial and personality vulnerability for mental disorder was revealed in one subject, but not in the other, and all physical, laboratory and cerebral NMR evaluations showed normal results in both patients. Remission of OCD and depressive episode or psychotic disorder was achieved after treatment with a serotoninergic medication associated with an antipsychotic. Conclusions. The heavy long-term use of ecstasy may induce an alteration in the brain balance between serotonin and dopamine, which might constitute a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the onset of obsessive-compulsive, depressive and psychotic symptoms. The heavy use of ecstasy probably interacted with a vulnerability to psychiatric disorder in one subject, whereas we cannot exclude that an “ecstasy disorder” ex novo affected the other individual.",

      "title": "Recommendation for a definition of acute symptomatic seizure",
      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

The amorphous nature of this experience has made identifying its etiology challenging, but recent advances in neurology and understanding of implicit memory and attention are helping to clarify this cognitive illusion. More specifically, déjà vu may result from (a) a brief change in normal neural transmission speed causing a slightly longer separation between identical messages received from two separate pathways, (b) a brief split in a continuous perceptual experience that is caused by distractions (external or internal) and gives the impression of two separate perceptual events, and (c) the activation of implicit familiarity for some portion (or all) of the present experience without an accompanying conscious recollection of the prior encounter. Procedures that involve degraded or occluded stimulus presentation, divided attention, subliminal mere exposure, and hypnosis may prove especially useful in elucidating this enigmatic cognitive illusion.",

      "title": "Benzodiazepines abstinence syndrome with psychotic symptoms: Case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Several studies point to the importance that the complex formed by GABA and the benzodiazepine receptor play for cerebral dopaminergic transmission and, hence, to the pathophysiology of psychotic symptoms. The decrease in GABA neuratransmisión or the hypofunction of the system in the hippocampus, cortex and other limbic prefrontal or subcortical regions has consequences as emotional dysregulation, cognitive impairment and development of positive psychotic symptoms. Objectives We intended to show an additional practical example to the limited literature available based on a case linking the emergence of psychotic symptoms due to acute benzodiazepine withdrawal. Methods We present the case of a 21 year old man who was sent to the emergency room of our hospital after an episode of aggressiveness on the street. The patient showed a psychotic schizophrenic syndrome with significant emotional and behavioural impact with aggressive and bizarre movements. In parallel, restlessness, sweating, tremor, increased blood pressure and tachycardia were observed. Symptoms had started abruptly two hours earlier. The patient companion explained that he usually took Alprazolam at an of over 40 mg per day. He had decided to give up this consumption abruptly four days earlier. Discussion GABAergic deficits cause the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission that may relate the pathophysiology of psychotic symptoms. The dysfunction of the GABAergic cortical interneurons could affect to the modulating response from the association cortex, which, could also relate with the appearance of these symptoms. Conclusion This case could relate a decrease in GABAergic transmission with the appearance of psychotic symptoms.

Symptoms commonly include hallucinations, mostly of the auditory type, and affective disturbances, in a background of clear consciousness. In this case series, four subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption were evaluated for hallucinatory symptoms after chronic alcohol intake. All of them had auditory hallucinations, with an anxious affect and no cognitive deficits. Only one case had visual hallucinations. The psychotic symptoms in all the patients were completely remitted with antipsychotics. Resumption of alcohol consumption increases the risk of relapse. The pathophysiology of alcoholic hallucinosis is not yet established and needs to be studied further for better diagnosis and management.",

The aim of this paper is to present two cases of psychotic symptoms (bipolar and paranoid disorder) induced by chloroquine. Case 1: Severe depressive episode with psychotic features appeared in the context of third SLE exacerbation and chloroquine treatment. Hydroxychloroquine was used instead and symptoms resolved. Later, manic episode (with psychotic features) emerged several days after chloroquine was prescribed for concomitant arthritis. Since that time, chloroquine has been withdrawn. Currently the patient is undergoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and psychiatric drugs with good response. Case 2: The second patient started to suffer from headaches and being lightheaded three days after chloroquine administration and within next few days feeling of derealization and poorly defining persecutory delusions accompanied by strong anxiety with occasional visual illusions occurred with clear consciousness. After eighteen days chloroquine was withdrawn and after two days all the symptoms resolved. Clinicians should be vigilant for possible psychiatric disorder when using chloroquine in patients with SLE. Such cases are probably rare and may include both paranoid and bipolar spectrum disorders. Studies on interactions of chloroquine with brain neurotransmitter systems are needed. Hydroxychloroquine may represent lower risk considering psychiatric complications. Mechanism of the difference is currently not known.",

Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

Fortunately, these complications have occurred less frequently in recent years, probably due to the usage of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy. We report an 8-year-old boy who developed late psychiatric disturbances 2 days after full recovery of consciousness from initial CO intoxication. His neuropsychiatric symptoms included consciousness disturbance, motor dysfunction, chorea, aphasia and agnosias. He received HBO therapy at 2.0 barr for 60 minutes once a day for 7 consecutive days. Three weeks later, he was functioning normally with no neuropsychiatric symptoms. A literature review concluded that HBO may be effective in treating neuropsychiatric sequelae. Moreover, immediate administration of HBO during acute CO intoxication may prevent these complications.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic drug commonly used in treating movement disorders.[1] The widespread use of trihexyphenidyl has led to the exploration of its abuse potential due to its anxiolytic, euphoriant, hallucinogenic, and sexual stimulant effects.[2] It is a popular drug of abuse among the thrill-seeking adolescent male population, used either orally or smoked in a powdered form mixed with tobacco.[3] The prevalence of trihexyphenidyl abuse has been reported to vary from 6.5% to 34% among schizophrenia patients, with doses of trihexyphenidyl abuse varying from 28 mg/day to as high as 200 mg/day.[4] The risk factors for trihexyphenidyl abuse are male gender, unemployment, concomitant use of other illicit substances, family history of substance dependence, long-term use of trihexyphenidyl, and severe mental disorders.[4] The most common aim of abuse is anxiolysis, sedation, or a mood-enhancing euphoric effect to alleviate depressive and negative symptoms.[4] Even though trihexyphenidyl dependence has been previously described, the literature is scanty as it may mimic a primary psychiatric illness leading to misdiagnosis further compounded by a lack of awareness about the drug's abuse potential. We describe a case where prescribed trihexyphenidyl use gradually progressed to a use disorder, leading to social, financial, occupational, and biological dysfunctions. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old male with a history of possible dissociative episodes of unresponsiveness associated with anxiety, currently in remission and off all medications, presented to the psychiatry outpatient department with the inability to stop consuming trihexyphenidyl tablets. For the past 4 years, the patient has had bilateral fine hand tremors, for which tablet trihexyphenidyl was initiated for possible essential tremors, titrated to 4–5 mg per day. After 2 years of regular use, he noticed that his tremor completely resolved after the trihexyphenidyl dose and would aggravate after 4–5 h of the last dose of trihexyphenidyl, along with slurring of speech. Over the next year, the use frequency increased to more than 6–8 mg per day as the duration of relief from tremors decreased with each dose. He started experiencing other difficulties whenever the effect of trihexyphenidyl wore out, such as a generalized feeling of the slowness of movements, stiffness in body parts, difficulty walking, and difficulty in writing. Patient's writing samples, with and without consumption of trihexyphenidyl are attached in Figure 1. Simultaneously, he also noticed that trihexyphenidyl ingestion made him feel energetic, increased his self-confidence, and made him happier. He would get a high with its consumption and described it as if \"everything was possible\" for him. He took trihexyphenidyl first thing in the morning to get out of bed and start his day. He would also spend more money under the effect of trihexyphenidyl than his usual self, would at times be involved in activities that caused him financial harm, such as lending money to people recklessly and also experienced substantially increased libido. Over the next few months, he noticed that after the effects of THP waned off, he would start to experience low mood, reduced interest in carrying out activities, would feel that life is vain, had to struggle with all the movements and started to have suicidal ideations. Later, he started using trihexyphenidyl without prescription at about 10–12 mg per day in divided doses, sourcing it from his workplace pharmacy. He experienced side effects of the medication, like dry mouth, but chose to ignore it to alleviate the depressive symptoms. A representation of illness graph of the patient is given in Figure 2.Figure 1: Handwriting samples of the patient before and after taking a dose of trihexyphenidyl. The image is not reused from any source or copyrightFigure 2: Illness graph of the patient. THP: Trihexyphenidyl, TDS: thrice dailyOn examination, he had fine bilateral hand tremors, the speech was slurred, facial expressions were reduced, gait with a forward stooped posture and bradykinesia. On mental status examination, depressed affect and decreased self-esteem were present. He had taken trihexyphenidyl 4 h before this examination. Various differential diagnoses were considered and ruled out systematically. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was ruled out due to nonspecific motor symptoms and symptom onset only after trihexyphenidyl withdrawal. Drug-induced Parkinson's was ruled out as the current symptoms from the past 4 years have been without the use of any neuroleptics. Vascular Parkinsonism was ruled out due to prominent upper limb involvement and a normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Wilson's disease evaluation was negative. With a provisional diagnosis of trihexyphenidyl use disorder based on tolerance, craving, and use despite harm and withdrawals, he was started on tablet escitalopram 5 mg and up-titrated to 10 mg to counter the depressive and anxiety symptoms during withdrawal; tablet propranolol 20 mg was started to manage the tremors, and trihexyphenidyl tapered slowly over 6 months. At the follow-up, he had decreased trihexyphenidyl dose gradually to 2 mg per day without any withdrawal. He maintained well without any tremors. Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication as a case report. DISCUSSION DSM 5 recognizes the antiparkinsonian drugs (including trihexyphenidyl) abuse under the \"other (or unknown) substance use disorder\" category. ICD 10 did not clarify any such category, and ICD 11 describes \"disorder due to use of other specified psychoactive substances including medications.\" However, it does not describe the classes of medications. Hence, whether nonprescription misuse of trihexyphenidyl should be regarded as psychoactive substance use is still questionable. The euphorigenic effects of trihexyphenidyl can be explained by the inhibition of dopamine reuptake and storage consequent to the strong muscarinic receptor blockade[4] as well as its increased affinity for dopamine receptors in the limbic area at higher dosages. Thus, it stimulates the central nervous reward system leading to a \"high.\"[5] Similar stimulant effects have been described with other anticholinergics, such as biperiden and procyclidine.[6] However, tolerance to these effects also develops fast, compelling the patient to increase the doses, which may lead to exaggerating its adverse effects and psychosis-like behavior alterations.[4] This anticholinergic abuse has also been associated with withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs in Parkinson's disease often markedly exacerbates Parkinsonian symptoms, movement disorders,[7] depressive or dysphoric mood symptoms, and even results in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[8] This could be due to acetylcholine receptor hypersensitivity in response to long-term anticholinergic use. The sudden anticholinergic withdrawal might worsen the severity of the symptoms than the initial presentation.[9] A similar phenomenon was observed in our patient, who developed motor symptoms following the discontinuation of trihexyphenidyl. Ruberg et al.[10] in 1982 reported increased acetylcholine receptor densities in the frontal lobes of patients on anticholinergics; similar changes are expected to be seen in nigrostriatal cholinergic receptors.[9] The hypersensitive cholinergic receptor state is similar to the cholinergic excess stage in Parkinsonism, leading to various movement dysfunctions. However, it is essential to mention that going by this mechanism of action, all anticholinergics would have an abuse potential, which is not evident. Therefore, the exact pathophysiological mechanism is yet to be elicited. An image representing possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal is given in Figure 3.Figure 3: Possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal effects. Ach: Acetylcholine, DA: Dopamine, \"rec\": ReceptorsIn this case, evidence suggesting trihexyphenidyl withdrawal-induced movement and mood disorders is the presence of a temporal relationship between trihexyphenidyl dosing and symptom onset which appears to be very similar to the \"on-off\" phenomenon seen with levodopa use in patients of Parkinson's disease. Among various management options, one study suggests tapering 1 mg of trihexyphenidyl every 2 weeks. Another deprescribing guideline by the University of Sydney and Macquarie University recommends a relatively slow tapering, reducing 25% of the daily dose in 1–4 weeks, depending on the nature and severity of withdrawal symptoms, and ending the treatment 2 weeks after giving the lowest dose. Nonpharmacological support such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, exercise, and social support should be given. If tapering is ineffective, consider switching to another anticholinergic agent, with minimal side effects. Tapering off trihexyphenidyl within 3 months of starting has been recommended.[5] Therefore, in light of such reported cases, it is essential to realize that easy affordability, availability, and prolonged prescription would lead to easy escalation of trihexyphenidyl doses leading to potential misuse among patients and this needs to be dealt with caution.

Patients may use nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine or other drugs of abuse in order to overcome symptoms associated with schizophrenia itself or with the side effects of the antipsychotic medications used to treat the underlying illness. The impact of substance abuse for comorbid substance abusers compared with nonabusing schizophrenia patients includes a lower quality of life, increased tardive dyskinesia, increased psychosocial problems, more relationship difficulties, cognitive deficits and even suicide. Patients with a dual diagnosis also tend to have higher relapse rates, higher rates of hospitalization, and by inference, increased healthcare costs.

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive substance, and caffeinated beverages enjoy immense popularity around the world. Temporal abstinence from caffeine in habitual users results in the well-characterized withdrawal syndrome, consisting mainly of headache, fatigue, tiredness and decreased alertness. The formal diagnostic criteria for caffeine-withdrawal headache (CWH) were given in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition (ICHD-II). According to these criteria, the headache is bilateral and/or pulsating, occurs when intake is interrupted or delayed in person with caffeine consumption of C200 g/day for [2 weeks, develops within 24 h after last caffeine intake and is relieved within 1 h by 100 mg of caffeine. The obligatory criterion, as for the other secondary headaches, is the improvement or resolution of headache after relief from the causative disorder, e.g. that this headache resolves within 7 days after total caffeine withdrawal. There is a comment on the possibility of this syndrome in patients on dialysis who consume large quantities of caffeine [1, 2]. We report a case of patient on hemodialysis (HD) with CWH.

Objectives We present the case of a 22-year-old patient, who has been following up for just over a year. The patient refers that two people inhabit her body, talk to each other, exchange opinions and both have control over the body, one giving the turn to the other depending on the circumstances. To this is added delusional symptoms of grandeur and sensorial-perceptual symptoms. In turn, depressive symptoms have appeared that have led the patient to have several suicide attempts throughout the follow-up time. Methods During this time, the patient has required hospital admission on two occasions due to the autolytic ideation. Treatment with neuroleptics and antidepressants has been established that have helped control delusions and thoughts of death, but not the dissociative clinic. Results Dissociative Identity disorder 300.14 (F44.81) Conclusions The different symptoms presented by the patient, as well as the social and occupational deterioration that he presents, make this an extremely complicated case, both in diagnosis and in treatment. Dissociative identity disorder has been very controversial, changing its diagnostic criteria over time. More studies are needed and perhaps future research can give us more clues about this disorder.

One 13-year-old subject with male sex has the symptom, where the subject's behavior resembles autistic behavior such as being very hyperactive, experiencing tantrums (biting his own hand or throwing things if his desire is not fulfilled), losing language skills and speech, ability to intertwine poor social interaction, as well as developmental deterioration or abnormality after experiencing the normal phase at the age of two years, followed by a real loss of trained skills. The method used for children who have disintegration syndrome is by motion therapy with the aim that the subject can maximize concentration and focus in order to be able to survive in an activity or activity and be able to use fine and rough motor skills with flexibility.

El consumo de cocaína se asocia a la presentación, transitoria o persistente, de síntomas psicóticos por su potente acción como inhibidor de la recaptación de dopamina. Se presenta un caso clínico de una paciente con TLP y psicosis inducida por cocaína que se ensaya tratamiento con cariprazina. Los criterios diagnósticos para el trastorno psicótico inducido por sustancias según DSM-V son: delirios o alucinaciones, examen físico compatible y resultados analíticos en orina positivos a tóxicos, con síntomas durante o inmediatamente después de la intoxicación o abstinencia de la sustancia psicoactiva. La cariprazina difiere de otros antipsicóticos por su actividad agonista parcial y su mayor afinidad por los receptores D3. Este perfil exclusivo parece tener consecuencias beneficiosas sobre los síntomas negativos, la disforia y el deterioro cognitivo. Estudios realizados apuntan a que la cariprazina reduciría el efecto gratificante de la cocaína sobre el sistema de recompensa y reduciría la necesidad de su consumo. Material y métodos: Descripción de un caso clínico y revisión de la literatura. Resultados y conclusiones: Se presenta el caso clínico de una mujer con antecedente de trastorno límite de la personalidad y trastorno por uso de sustancias (cannabis y cocaína) que consulta por síntomas psicóticos en contexto de consumo de cocaína. Se realiza tratamiento ambulatorio inicialmente con olanzapina y diazepam, siendo su evolución parcialmente favorable, presentando hiperfagia y aumento de peso, por lo que se cambia a cariprazina, mejorando la hiperorexia, el craving a cocaína y manteniéndose abstinente y en remisión de la clínica psicótica.

Medication etiology should be particularly suspected when the symptoms begin with the initiation of a new medication and resolved with discontinuation of the same medication. Case Reports: Presented are two cases demonstrating that it is prudent to be aware of medications capable of inducing oculomotor dysfunction. Each case reveals instances of acute oculomotor dysfunction after the initiation of a central nervous system affecting medication. Case 1 details a partial pupil sparing third nerve palsy after initiating the anti-anxiety drug, buspirone. Case 2 accounts the addition of zolpidem (Ambien), a sedative, and the subsequent new onset nystagmus and hypertropia. Conclusion: In each case, no organic etiology was found, and the oculomotor dysfunction resolved following discontinuation of the recently added CNS affecting medication. Specific drug interactions are also considered as contributing factors to the oculomotor dysfunction in both cases.",

      "abstract": "A syndrome seen in four Jamaican patients is described in which increased use of marihuana followed the onset of symptoms of a hypomanic nature. At the time of admission to the hospital the patients exhibited persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, withdrawal, and thought disorder. Within three to four days after admission, manic or hypomanic symptoms emerged. It is suggested that these patients had mania and that excess marihuana usage was symptomatic of their illness, leading to a transient, marihuana-induced, schizophreniform phase of their manic illness. A plea is made for a broader approach to the psychiatric implications of marihuana use.",

Culture filtrate (0.22 microns porosity filters, > 250 toxic flagellated cells/ml) induces formation of open ulcerative sores, hemorrhaging, and death of finfish and shellfish. Human exposure to aerosols from ichthyotoxic cultures (> or = 2000 cells/ml) has been associated with narcosis, respiratory distress with asthma-like symptoms, severe stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and eye irritation with reddening and blurred vision (hours to days); autonomic nervous system dysfunction [localized sweating, erratic heart beat (weeks)]; central nervous system dysfunction [sudden rages and personality change (hours to days), and reversible cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss (weeks)]; and chronic effects including asthma-like symptoms, exercise fatigue, and sensory symptoms (tingling or numbness in lips, hands, and feet; months to years). Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal, and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P enrichment (> or = 100 micrograms SRP/L), suggesting a stimulatory role of nutrients. Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates have been tracked to fish kill sites in eutrophic estuaries from Delaware Bay through the Gulf Coast. Our data point to a critical need to characterize their chronic effects on human health as well as fish recruitment, disease resistance, and survival.",

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

      "abstract": "La patología dual se define como la concurrencia en un mismo individuo de un trastorno psiquiátrico y un trastorno por abuso de sustancias; siendo la patología mental predominante la esquizofrenia y las sustancias más consumidas son la nicotina, el alcohol, el cannabis, la cocaína (y otros estimulantes) y opiáceos; sin embargo, lo más común es el policonsumo. En concreto el consumo de cannabis iniciado durante la adolescencia temprana se asocia a un mayor riesgo para la aparición de cuadros psicóticos en adultos entre los que se encuentra la esquizofrenia, de manera dosis dependiente. A su vez, el consumo de cannabis a corto plazo se ha asociado a su vez con la aparición de síntomas de rango psicótico, como son las alteraciones de la percepción. Nuestro objetivo es actualizar y reforzar nuestros conocimientos acerca del abordaje en Patología Dual; para lo que realizamos una búsqueda bibliográfica en PubMed, utilizando como palabras clave: “Psychosis” “Drugs Abuse” y presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 32 años con diagnóstico de Esquizofrenia Paranoide y Consumo Perjudicial de Cannabis de inicio en la adolescencia. Actualmente sin adherencia al tratamiento farmacológico, acude al Servicio de Urgencias por intensa angustia. A la exploración psicopatológica destaca ideación delirante de perjuicio en primer plano con gran resonancia afectiva. Manifiesta conciencia parcial de enfermedad, aceptando la realización de un ingreso y reintroducción de tratamiento para estabilización. La presencia de patología dual empeora gravemente el pronóstico del paciente psiquiátrico, de ahí que sea fundamental poder contar con abordajes farmacológicos que consigan una reducción de la angustia y tensión psíquica propias de la crisis, de una manera más rápida y eficaz, así como mayor adherencia.",

Induction of mania in our patient is keeping with the literature regarding induction or worsening of hypomanic or manic symptoms at a lower dose of quetiapine. Hypomanic or manic symptoms at a low dose of quetiapine are brief and seem to reverse the effect by either discontinuing the causing agent or increasing it dose. Quetiapine being an atypical antipsychotic possess antidepressant property at low doses as well as mood stabilizer at higher doses. At lower dose, due to its serotonergic antagonism property, quetiapine appears to induce or worsen hypomanic or manic symptoms. As the dosage increases its dopamine antagonistic activity become more prominent and the medication acts as a mood stabilizer. This is one of the possible explanations of disappearing of manic or hypomanic symptoms at a higher dose.",

In particular, the presence of persistent visual hallucinations of persons with Parkinson's disease predicts dementia, rapid deterioration, permanent nursing home placement, and death. Hallucinations in persons with Alzheimer's disease are often associated with serious behavioral problems and predict a rapid cognitive decline. Theories of the etiology of hallucinations include (1) stimulation, e.g., neurochemical, electrical, seizure, and ephaptic, and (2) inhibition, e.g., destruction of normally inhibitory functions, resulting in disinhibition as in the Charles Bonnet and phantom limb syndromes. Functional neuroimaging procedures suggest anatomical associations for hallucinations.

Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects.DefinitionThe American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

      "abstract": "Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the world, with the highest rates of use seen in New Zealand, North America and Australia. There is evidence of a decrease in the age of commencement of cannabis use in some developed countries, and a prolongation of risk of initiation to cannabis use beyond adolescence in more recent cohorts of users. Early initiation of cannabis use and regular use during adolescence are particular risk factors for later problematic cannabis and other drug use, as well as mental health problems, delinquency, loss of cognitive capacity and educational achievement, risky sexual behavior and criminal offending. Cannabis use with tobacco complicates treatment for each condition and should be addressed concurrently. Cannabis users often have a long history of use before seeking treatment, and early screening, assessment and treatment are recommended. There are a number of valid and reliable screening and assessment tools now available. Severity of withdrawal is a factor that increases relapse, and pharmacotherapy for withdrawal management is developing rapidly and showing great promise. Finally, a combination of motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive–behavioral therapy alone or within a family systems model are the proven treatment protocols for cannabis use disorder.",

Our patient was experiencing persistent symptoms of visual, tactile, and auditory hallucinations after cessation of methamphetamine. He has a medical history of a substance use disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, nicotine dependence and major depressive disorder. Previously, he received a wide range of antipsychotic drug treatment regimens at other psychiatric facilities, all with some degree of effect, but never with complete symptom relief. At the time of admission to our inpatient clinic, he was started on cariprazine and reported a significant decrease in visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations with complete cessation for a period of two weeks. There appears to be a unique ability of cariprazine's mechanism of action to reverse symptoms of the presumable diagnosis of MAP that is unable to be achieved with other antipsychotic medications.",

      "title": "New psychoactive substances—Synthetic stimulants",
      "abstract": "The expression “New Synthetic Stimulants” include classes of psychoactive compounds that share subjective effects in humans such as boosted mood or euphoria, feelings of empathy or compassion, increased sociability and sex drive, perceived increased ability to learn and focus, increased energy and alertness, with unpleasant outcomes like increased blood pressure and heart rate, paranoia or aberrations, decreased appetite, raised body temperature, clenched jaw or grinding teeth, dry mouth, insomnia, hallucinations, and aggressive or violent behavior. Synthetic stimulants act in the brain by increasing concentrations of neurotransmitters, mainly dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine is involved in attention, reward, and motivation whereas serotonin is involved in generating feelings of happiness and pleasure. Synthetic stimulants act on the two brain systems to different extents, accounting for their range of effects. Noradrenaline release is also stimulated by these compounds, but to a minor degree. In any case, long‐term use of synthetic stimulants exhausts dopamine and serotonin systems in the brain. The nerve cells become desensitized to the drugs, which makes them resistant to the brain's own signaling molecules. This leads to tolerance and dependence, which can easily turn into addiction. Like classic stimulants (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine), new synthetic stimulants can be highly addictive. This article is categorized under: Toxicology &gt; New Psychoactive Substances",

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

Both cases had a prior history of cannabis dependence and current tobacco dependence. In both cases patients reported the presence of visual disturbances when smoking SCS and staring at stationary and moving objects. Both patients discontinued SCS use abruptly after suffering from a panic attack under the influence of SCS. Despite cessation of SCS, both patients continued to suffer from HPPD which was accompanied by significant anxiety. Following clonazepam treatment, both subjects reported significant improvement in symptoms and remained with a residual focal visual disturbance which was not accompanied by significant anxiety. To the best of our knowledge these are the first reports of HPPD following SCS use. In light of the increasing use of SCS, clinical psychiatrists should be aware of these perceptual side effects.",

Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape.

En estados donde destaca la desinhibición, como la manía en el Trastorno Bipolar, es posible que un paciente no consumidor realice consumos de sustancias adictivas que pueden influir en el curso de la enfermedad. En algunas ocasiones éste consumo puede limitarse únicamente al episodio, sin cristalizar en un trastorno adictivo o sin implicar una recaída. Bajo esta premisa presentamos el siguiente caso clínico. Descripción del Caso: Paciente mujer de 52 años con diagnóstico de Trastorno Esquizafectivo tipo Bipolar ingresada en Hospital de Día de Salud Mental de Mataró por episodio maníaco en remisión parcial. Durante el ingreso se objetiva un consumo de 3 paquetes diarios de tabaco en contexto de episodio maníaco, con abstinencia previa de 6 años de evolución. Una vez resuelto el cuadro la paciente detiene el consumo de forma brusca y sin craving objetivable. Pruebas complementarias: Se realiza analítica completa con hemograma, bioquímica, perfil hepatorenal, lipídico y tiroideo, vitamina B12 y folato sin alteraciones significativas. Tratamiento: Previamente la paciente había mantenido estabilidad con Palmitato de Paliperidona 150mg/mes en monoterapia. Durante el ingreso se añade Valproato sódico hasta 1000mg (valproemia 80.28) y Lormetazepam 1mg. Discusión: Las sustancias adictivas generan cambios neurológicos que predisponen al reinicio del consumo si se expone al paciente nuevamente al tóxico a pesar de haber mantenido una abstinencia prolongada. En este caso observamos como la paciente es capaz de detener el consumo de tabaco de forma abrupta y sin craving una vez resuelto el cuadro, a pesar de haber sido una consumidora importante en el pasado. Dada la gran prevalencia del tabaquismo en pacientes con patología mental grave, podría ser relevante conocer esta posibilidad para establecer un tratamiento más o menos enfocado a prevenir una recaída.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The core problem of addicts is addiction and not the other mental disorders that may be present. This is because the addictive thinking, feeling and acting is the dominant defense that blocks success in therapy. The therapist and the patient therefore externally symbolize with chairs 1. The patient’s healthy adult thinking, 2. His self-protection through his addictive thinking and feeling, and 3. His symptoms in everyday life. They develop further his addictive thinking and feeling in the as-if mode of play and paradoxically work out the positive meaning of this defense within the framework of his self-regulation. The patient’s self-development initially should take place in the symptom production. This is because metacognitive confusion prevents patients with addiction from adequately processing deeper conflicts. The patient should first gain ego control over his addictive self-regulation. This disorder-specific approach is indicated for harmful use or dependence on alcohol or drugs, and also for non-substance-related addictions such as eating disorders, internet addiction, sex addiction, and other addictions. It makes the experiences of Alcoholics Anonymous fruitful in digested form for depth psychological, behavioral, and systemic therapy.",

Most are of obscure nature while some illustrate features of syncope that deserve further scrutiny. The cases are divided into six groups: 1) Resembling cardiac syncope (30 cases); 2) vasovagal syncope (22 cases); 3) features of both cardiac and vasovagal syncope (12 cases); 4) orthostatic hypotensive (29 cases); 5) akinetic seizure? (12 cases); and 6) miscellaneous (5 cases). Some groups are subdivided according to the circumstances surrounding the spells, for example, seated eating, nocturnal, associated with bowel movement, response to anticonvulsant therapy, etc. The following conclusions seem warranted: 1) The evidence favors the existence of a type of akinetic seizure resembling cardiac syncope; 2) loss of consciousness while seated eating (prandial syncope) may comprise a syndrome; 3) syncope related to bowel movement or abdominal pain is a striking association; 4)sporadic nocturnal syncope due to temporary hyp or e activity ofbaroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hy-poreactivity of baroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hypotension.

      "title": "Use of cannabis components in the treatment of mental disorders",
      "abstract": "Introduction There is evidence that supports the increased risk of developing psychosis or psychotic like symptoms in vulnerable populations after use of cannabis. Cannabis’ main psychoactive component, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), induces acute psychotic effects and cognitive impairment. But there is also evidence to suggest that molecules in the cannabis plant could have an antipsychotic affect. Aims In this review we are trying to explore the possibilities of cannabis use as a therapeutic agent in mental disorders. Methods Thorough research of the main databases, and web search engines for relevant studies, using appropriate keywords. We scrutinize them independently, before reaching consensus about appropriateness. Results In animal models repeated treatment with cannabis constituent cannabidiol CBD or the atypical antipsychotic clozapine attenuates or reverses the schizophrenia-like behavioral disruption. In humans there are data that CBD counteracts psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment associated with cannabis use. Also CBD may lower the risk for developing cannabis use associated psychosis. There are opposite effects of CBD and THC on brain activity patterns in key regions implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, such as the striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Conclusions The possible mechanism of action of GBD is not fully clarified, as it may involve anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective properties. These initial clinical studies with CBD treatment of psychotic symptoms argument the potential of CBD as an effective antipsychotic compound. Mechanisms responsible for these effects need to be further investigated. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "A Little Dab Will Do: A Case of Cannabis-Induced Psychosis",
      "abstract": "A patient presented to the emergency department with his brother due to recent onset of paranoid behavior that escalated over the past month. The patient endorsed paranoid delusions of people watching him and following him in a black truck. The patient admitted to being unable to sleep for the past two weeks and to having hypervigilant behavior whenever he leaves the house. Due to the patient’s presentation, the differential diagnosis included schizophrenia, substance-induced psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder with mood incongruent psychotic features. Upon interview, the patient stated he was using marijuana to decrease his self-reported anxiety and other social stressors since the age of 13 years. Over the past month, the patient says he has been “dabbing,” which is a highly concentrated form of cannabis mainly consumed by experienced users. These “dabs” have an extremely high tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content (up to 80%), which is the main psychoactive component in cannabis products. Since the patient began using this potent form of cannabis, he has had increasing difficulty functioning at work and worsening symptoms of psychosis. After eliciting this information and noting the patient had a positive urine drug screen for cannabis, a diagnosis of cannabis-induced psychosis along with severe cannabis use disorder was made. There is a trend towards increasing THC concentrations in cannabis products. This case highlights the importance of being aware of these highly potent cannabis products and their potential harms. Patients should approach these products with caution, as they are not only more dangerous to manufacture but also have the potential to induce psychosis in susceptible populations.",

      "title": "Critical Review of Alcohol, Alcoholism and the Withdrawal Symptoms I. Mechanisms of Addiction and Withdrawal Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Alcoholic beverages are socially accepted around the world, consumed mostly to socialize, celebrate, and relax. The pleasant effects of alcohol are attributed to (i) an increase in GABAergic (inhibitory signals), OPergic and 5HTergic (euphoric effects) neuronal activities and (ii) a decrease in DAergic ('want' signal or craving), Gluergic (excitatory signals), NEergic (stress signals) neuronal, and the HPA axis (stress hormones) activities. If alcohol drinking continues, the receptors are sensitized, resulting in development of tolerance when alcohol drinking must be increased to achieve desired effects. In genetically/Environmentally predisposed subjects, chronic alcohol drinking results in the development of addiction, characterized by a condition when alcohol caseation results in rapid onset of withdrawal symptoms including, but not limited to, alcohol craving and moderate to severe discomfort. Because pharmacotherapy alone or in combination with behavioral approaches is only modestly effective in treating alcoholism symptoms, there is an urgent need to development effective and safe therapies. At present, a lack of clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying addiction hinders possible development of new treatment strategies. Therefore, the aim of this article is to discuss the mechanisms underlying (i) the euphoric, relaxing and adverse effects of alcohol drinking and (ii) addiction and the withdrawal symptoms.",

But anger is more complex than these words imply. Anger is an emotion, but it also affects your physical state, your thoughts, and your behavior, though you may not always be consciously aware of it. Understanding the experience of anger will provide you insight into the role anger may play in your life and that of your child. Certain of these reactions typically accompany acute (intense, short lived) anger. Other reactions, such as sleep difficulties, digestive problems, cynicism, and loss of faith may occur with the development of chronic (long-lived) anger. Here are some of the adverse ways anger can impact us.",

      "title": "Cannabinoids as Potential Molecules for Addiction Disorders",
      "abstract": "Background: Addictions are a group of chronic and recurrent diseases of the brain characterized by a pathological search for reward or relief through the use of a substance or other action. This situation implies an inability to control behavior, difficulty in permanent abstinence, a compelling desire to consume, decreased recognition of significant problems caused by behavior and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. The result is a decrease in the quality of life of the affected person, generating problems in their work, academic activities, social relationships, or family or partner relationships. Unfortunately, there are not enough pharmacotherapeutic solutions to treat addictions due to the complexity of their physiopathology and signaling pathways. Therefore, it is an imperative search for new pharmacological alternatives which may be used for this purpose. Purpose of Review: This review summarizes the main recent findings of the potential therapeutic effects of different cannabinoids on treating several addictions, including alcohol, opioids, methamphetamine, cocaine, and nicotine use disorders. Highlights Standpoints: It has been demonstrated that many phyto, synthetic, and endogenous cannabinoids may act as therapeutic molecules in this psychiatric pathology through their action on multiple cannabinoid receptors. To highlight, cannabinoid receptors, types 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2) have a crucial role in modulating the anti-addictive properties of these compounds.",

The peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) after a single amount of alcohol is reached 30-45 minutes after ingestion, depending on the rate of absorption and whether food has been taken. Alcohol is a pharmacological intoxicant that suppresses the brain and the rest of the central nervous system. Alcohol interferes with the ability to form new memories, particularly when it is taken in intoxicating amounts. Mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced memory impairments include disruption of neurotransmission in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new memories. A common consequence of clinically significant alcohol intoxication is memory loss for events that occurred while the person was intoxicated—a form of anterograde amnesia.",

Briefer (4 days or more), mild episodes of mood elevation define bipolar II disorder; lengthier (7 days or more), more severe episodes (or those requiring hospitalisation), with or without psychotic features, define bipolar I disorder. Depressive periods are more common and lengthier than manic or hypomanic states, and are the main cause of disability. Bipolar depression may respond poorly to antidepressants and these medications may destabilise the illness. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be considered when a patient with depression is treatment resistant. Irritability is a common symptom in bipolar disorder, particularly during mixed states (during which patients have features of mood elevation and depression concurrently) or when there is rapid cycling of mood (more than four episodes of mood disorder per year). Alcohol misuse and use of illicit drugs may simulate mood changes in bipolar disorder. Accurate diagnosis and assessment of bipolar disorder is essential for clinical decision making and determining prognosis and treatments.",

      "title": "Fourth Generation of Synthetic Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists: A Review on the Latest Insights",
      "abstract": "Over the past few years, an emerging number of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) entered the illicit market. NPSs are designed to resemble the effects of classical drugs of abuse, reinforcing their effects and duration. Among the most abused NPS, synthetic cannabinoids are cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) that mimic the effect of the main psychotropic phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).We herein reviewed the international literature to provide available information on the newest SCRAs generation.Compared to the previous SCRAs generations, the structures of the last generation result in increased affinity for and efficacy at cannabinoid CB1 receptors, which are thought to be mainly responsible for the psychoactive effects of THC and its analogues. Accordingly, these more potent cannabimimetic effects may increase the number of adverse reactions such as neurological disorders (e.g., psychosis, agitation, irritability, paranoia, confusion, and anxiety), psychiatric episodes (e.g., hallucinations, delusions, self-harm), other physical conditions (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmia, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever) and deaths. In the last decade, more than a hundred SCRAs from different chemical classes emerged on the illicit web market. SCRAs have been thoroughly studied: they were physico-chemically characterized, and pharmaco-toxicological characteristics were investigated. The last SCRAs generations include increasingly potent and toxic compounds, posing a potential health threat to consumers.From November 2017 to February 2021, at least 20 new \"fourth-generation\" SCRAs were formally reported to international drug agencies. Our understanding of the neurotoxicity of these compounds is still limited due to the lack of global data, but their potency and their toxicity are likely higher than those of the previous generations.",

      "abstract": "Both depression and conduct disorders are relatively prevalent and are related to poor long-term outcomes. Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Among drivers, cannabis and opiates are the most common illicit drugs, while benzodiazepines are the most common medicinal drugs. Drivers regularly combine illicit and medicinal drugs, and drugs with alcohol. Cannabis, benzodiazepines and alcohol are found in combination most often. Based on current knowledge, cannabis use is considered to be dangerous for traffic safety, at least during the first hours after use. Cocaine, heroin and hallucinogens are incompatible with safe driving. Not all studies find increased risks among drivers using amphetamines and ecstasy. This could be partly explained by the use of lower doses in experimental studies. The prescription medicines most associated with their influence on driving performance and traffic accidents are benzodiazepines (especially those with long halflife), cyclic antidepressants and opioid analgesics. Hypnotics, sedatives and anxiolytics (including benzodiazepines) impair driving performance and are associated with increased accident risk. Most beta-blockers and central stimulants have no or only a limited detrimental effect on driving performance. There is a serious lack of information concerning the effects of neuroleptics on driving performance, but based on the general effects of neuroleptics, it can be assumed that there is an effect on driving performance. Especially the first and second generation antihistamines have a significant detrimental effect on driving performance. Concerning the effects of analgesics and antitussives on driving performance and accident risk, the results of the different studies are inconsistent. Effects may be expected, but administration of stable doses would cause few effects on driving performance. Problems during driving are mainly to be expected at onset of the treatment, when changing the dose and when other substances are co-ingested. Antidepressants have the ability to influence driving performance negatively, especially at onset of the treatment, and are associated with higher accident risk. This potential is highest among sedative antidepressants. Epilepsy and diabetes patients should be allowed to drive only under strict conditions, taking into account the important detrimental effects on driving performance. Combination of drugs with alcohol should be avoided, as well as combinations of illicit and medicinal drugs, as they are associated with increased traffic accident risks and with increased responsibility in responsibility analysis studies. Moreover, the risks seem to increase with polydrug use. Benzodiazepines and cannabis in combination with alcohol deserve special attention at policy level, due to their high risk and prevalence.

      "abstract": "Abstract Many of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal are similar to those of other drug withdrawal syndromes: anxiety, awakening during sleep, depression, difficulty concentrating, impatience, irritability/anger and restlessness. Slowing of the heart rate and weight gain are distinguishing features of tobacco withdrawal. Although nicotine withdrawal may not produce medical consequences, it lasts for several weeks and can be severe in some smokers. Like most other drug withdrawals, nicotine withdrawal is time‐limited, occurs in non‐humans, is influenced by instructions/expectancy and abates with replacement therapy and gradual reduction. Unlike some other drug withdrawal syndromes, protracted, neonatal or precipitated withdrawal does not occur. Whether nicotine withdrawal is associated with tolerance, acute physical dependence, greater duration and intensity of use, rapid reinstatement, symptom stages, cross‐dependence with other nicotine ligands, reduction by non‐pharmacological interventions and genetic influences is unclear. Whether nicotine withdrawal plays a major role in relapse to smoking has not been established but this is also true for other drug withdrawal syndromes.",

      "title": "Lithium for Bipolar Disorder: A Re Emerging Treatment for Mood Instability: Low Dosage, Slow Titration Might Mitigate Side Effects",
      "abstract": "Lithiwn is among the most effective therapies for bipolar disorder (BD), and enthusiasm for this simple molecule is waxing. The history of lithium is fascinating, (1) and recent considerations include that this element, the third on the periodic table, has few, if any, industry champions. The recent renaissance is caused by a groundswell of appreciation for the clinical efficacy of lithium and an increasing number of providers who are willing to manage patients with lithium. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Target: Bipolar disorder The target illness for lithium is BD, a spectrum of mood disorders with characteristic features of unstable mood and affect. Shifts in mood include recurrent episodes of mania, which are pathologically energized states with misguided volition and behavior with intoxicating euphoria (or irritability).(2) Psychomotor activity is elevated and out of character; speech and body movements are revved up, with a diminished need for sleep. The social, personal, and vocational consequences often are disastrous. The most common mood state of BD is depression. Depressive episodes consist of pathologically compromised energy and volition with a slowing of bodily functions, most prominently cognition and concentration; a pervasive depressed or sad mood is common but not always present. Presence of mixed states, when features of depression and mania are present simultaneously, is one of the many challenges of treating BD; an elevated volitional or energized state may occur with a depressed, dysphoric mood. Evidence for lithium Efficacy studies of lithium have focused on managing mood disorders, treating mania and depression, and prevention or maintenance care. (3) Most were performed during the 1970s and 1980s, (3) but recent studies have been comparing lithium with other mood stabilizers (4-7) and searching for a genetic basis for lithium response.(8-10) Other researchers have examined the use of lithium to prevent suicide. (11) Some have suggested a neuroprotective effect of lithium, which may have profound implications for neuropsychiatry if valid. (12-14) Results of additional studies, which are at different stages of completion, will clarify lithium use, (15), (16) and characterize the genetic makeup of individuals who respond to lithium. (17) The primary evidence for lithium, however, is for maintenance treatment of BD and for preventing manic and depressive episodes. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Biochemistry and physiology of lithium. rhe biochemical and physiological effects pf lithium are complex, wide-ranging, ind likely to affect hundreds, if not thou-;ands, of genes and gene products. The mechanisms of action remain a focus of aca-lemic pursuit (for a review of hypotheses 7elated to these mechanisms see Goodwin and Jamison(2) and Can et al (18)) Lithium is involved in cell signaling pathways that involve complex molecular mechanisms of inter- and intracellular communication; (19) some neural receptors are down-regulatee (20) and others show inhibition (21) which is thought to be a mechanism of lithium. The hypothesized neuroprotective effect of lithium (22) may be mediated through an increased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in brain tissue. (14) Recently, investigators using induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons have shown that patterns of calcium-related cell signaling in bipolar neurons are affected specifically by lithium in the culture media. (23) There likely are many mechanisms through which lithium's effects are mediated, including a series of dynamic pathways that vary over time and in reaction to the internal and external environments of the cell and person. The lithium renaissance In the past decade, there has been an increase in interest and use of lithium because clinicians recognize its efficacy and advantages and can monitor serum levels and gauge the patient's response and side effects24 against the lithium level. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

Although cannabis use is associated with serious health consequences including cognitive dysfunction, memory problems, psychosis, and hyperemesis, and there is scant clinical evidence to support its use as a medicine, it is nevertheless being widely promoted to treat a wide range of health conditions including chronic pain. Currently, the body of clinical research taken together does not support the use of cannabis in any dosage form for treating any pain, particularly given the potential adverse effects. Certain cannabinoids have the potential to treat many clinical conditions, including perhaps specific pain conditions, but current research is insufficient to support their use for treating pain. More clinical research in compliance with regulatory guidelines is needed to consider approval of cannabis and related products as therapeutics for treating pain. If asked about the use of cannabis and related products for treating pain, providers should exercise caution and engage in evidence-informed discussions with patients to engage in shared decision-making. The lack of evidence supporting efficacy, with the potential of considerable adverse effects associated with the use of high-potency products of cannabis often being consumed currently, should be considered.",

      "abstract": "Facts box There are good theoretical reasons why cannabis may be a contributor to the development of schizophrenia. There is compelling evidence that cannabis use and psychosis are associated, and the debate is on whether cannabis use is a cause of psychosis. There is strong evidence from longitudinal studies that cannabis use may precipitate schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals. The vulnerability to cannabis-induced psychosis may be genetic, but further research is needed to support the preliminary evidence. There is also reasonable evidence that cannabis use exacerbates symptoms of psychosis in persons with a psychosis who continue to use cannabis. The evidence does not rule out the possibility that persons with psychosis use cannabis to control some of their symptoms or to improve their mood, but the self-medication hypothesis is unlikely to wholly explain the relationship observed between cannabis use and psychosis. Cannabis may promote psychosis directly through the cannabinoid system or indirectly through the dopaminergic system. More biological research on these mechanisms is necessary. Introduction There are good reasons for suspecting that regular cannabis use may be a contributory cause of schizophrenia. First, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive ingredient in cannabis preparations, can produce euphoria, distorted time perception, cognitive and memory impairments. Under controlled laboratory conditions, normal volunteers using THC in high doses have reported visual and auditory hallucinations, delusional ideas, and thought disorder.",

Eighty percent of these fatalities in New York are attributed to “immediate acute reactions” following administration (usually intravenous) of narcotics. In Dade County (Metropolitan Miami), Florida, 86 of 87 narcotic-related fatalities, excluding 13 violent deaths in the reported series, “collapsed and died following the injection of a narcotic”. The mechanisms of sudden death in this circumstance are complex and have not been elucidated completely. Several possible explanations include narcotic overdosage with respiratory depression, narcotic induced postural hypotension, hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction, idiosyncratic reaction to unspecified material(s), adverse response to intravenous injection of colloid or particulate material (“colloidoclastic crisis”), or adverse reactions to adulterants in narcotic packets which are purchased “on the street”.",

      "abstract": "The irritable bowel syndrome is one of a group of functional gastrointestinal disorders within the Rome classification system that is characterized by abdominal discomfort or pain associated with a change in stool habit. It is a multidetermined biopsychosocial disorder in which physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors may contribute to the clinical expression of the disorder. These can include: (1) early life (e.g., genetic or environmental) factors; (2) physiological factors including increased motor reactivity, visceral hypersensitivity, which may be enabled by postinfectious events, and dysregulation of brain–gut communication (e.g., altered central pain control mechanisms). In addition, psychosocial factors including psychiatric co-morbidity, major trauma (e.g., abuse history), and maladaptive coping may amplify the clinical expression of the disorder and its outcome. Currently, clinical outcome has become understood in terms of global symptom relief and health-related quality of life.",

      "abstract": "One of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia is changes in individual behavior which always assess themselves and others negatively, or undervalue their abilities which is called low self-esteem. Hallucinations are mental disorders in which the client experiences changes in sensory perception, feeling false sensations in the form of sound, sight, taste, touch or smell. The patient says that he often hears whispers like the voice of the devil mocking him, the client says he often feels anxious, daydreaming. During the assessment process, the nurse uses therapeutic communication and builds a trusting nurse-client relationship. In Mr.C's case, it was found that the client experienced hallucinatory symptoms such as hearing voices, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, looking tense, pacing, unable to maintain eye contact, sad, embarrassed, hopeless, withdrawn, irritable and etc. Nursing diagnoses that appeared in the Tn.C case: Auditory hallucinations, social isolation, ineffective individual coping, spiritual deficits, low self-esteem. But in practice, the authors focus on the problem of auditory hallucination sensory perception disorder. The purpose of writing is to provide nursing care to Tn.C. The writing method used is observation writing making observations by seeing, hearing and noting certain activities related to the client. The subject to be used is the case of one patient with sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations. The results of the analysis show that nursing interventions with implementation strategies (SP) can reduce signs and symptoms of auditory hallucination sensory perception disorders in patients after being given nursing actions.",

      "title": "The Adverse Psychiatric Consequences of Recreational Stimulant Drugs Such as Methamphetamine, Cocaine, Ecstasy/mdma, and Mephedrone: a Unified Psychobiological Explanation.",
      "abstract": "Stimulant drugs such as amphetamine, nicotine and Ecstasy/MDMA, are taken for positive reasons such as mood enhancement. Yet their repetitive use can lead to a range of psychobiological deficits and psychiatric distress. There are several underlying neurobiological factors for this. Their acute subjective effects are typically positive, with greater alertnessand emotional engagement. However during the post-drug recovery period the opposite states predominate, with feeling of tiredness and sadness. Every recreational central nervous system (CNS) stimulant drug causes this mood fluctuation. They are most evident in drugs with a very rapid onset and come-down, such as cocaine or nicotine. Hence regular smokers report good moods immediately after smoke inhalation, followed by poor moods 30-60 minutes later. This rapidity of these mood changes with nicotine and cocaine, helps explain why they are also the most addictive. Parallel fluctuations occur across many other psychological functions, with impoverished cognitive skills when off-drug. CNS stimulant drugs also adversely affect the HPA axis, impairing sleep and disrupting homeostasis. These core psychobiological problems help explain their adverse psychiatric effects, since fluctuating mood states and disrupted homeostatic stability, can exacerbate any prior psychiatric susceptibilities (for anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, or other disorders). In summary, the repetitive stimulation of the CNS by recreational drugs can be very damaging to the organism, both acutely and chronically.",

Alcohol addiction encompasses a three-stage cycle that becomes more intense as alcohol use progresses: <italic>binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect</italic>, and <italic>preoccupation/anticipation</italic>. These stages engage neuroadaptations in brain circuits that involve the basal ganglia (reward hypofunction), extended amygdala (stress sensitization), and prefrontal cortex (executive function disorder). This chapter discusses key neuroadaptations in the hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic stress systems and the critical role of glucocorticoid receptors. These neuroadaptations contribute to negative emotional states that powerfully drive compulsive alcohol drinking and seeking. These changes in association with a disruption of prefrontal cortex function that lead to cognitive deficits and poor decision making contribute to the chronic relapsing nature of alcohol dependence.",

The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of psychiatric disorder is well established for the non‐learning‐disabled population. In clinical practice, medication seems to be broadly as effective for people with learning disabilities. The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of challenging behaviours is less well established, although evidence for effectiveness is accumulating for some types of problem behaviour. When treating behavioural problems, medication is often used in combination with other management strategies. Knowledge of side effects is important, because people who have difficulty communicating may not be able to Report problems before they become severe. When using medication, it is important to try to achieve the best benefit: risk ratio, taking into account the person's other health problems and disabilities. It may be necessary to measure treatment effects, using standardised assessments or individual measures of target symptoms or behaviours.",

Above the psychotropic threshold, ingestion of cannabis causes an enhanced well-being and relaxation with an intensification of ordinary sensory experiences. The most important unwanted acute psychical effects are anxiety and panic attacks. Acute somatic effects are increased heart rate, changes of blood pressure, conjunctival injection and dry mouth. Properties that might be used therapeutically comprise analgesia, muscle relaxation, sedation, increase of mood, stimulation of appetite, antiemesis, lowering of intraoccular pressure and bronchodilation. Chronic use may lead to dependency and to a mild withdrawal syndrome. The extent of possible long-term damage on psyche and cognition, immune system, fertility and pregnancy remains controversial. Marijuana can induce a schizophrenic psychosis in vulnerable persons presumably without increasing the incidence of the disease. Disturbance of immunological and hormonal functions and long-term impairment of memory, attention, and complex cognitive processes are low and do not preclude a legitimate therapeutic use.",

Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

      "abstract": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consumption of alcohol excessively causes dependence and leads to psychological discomfort. Motivation to drink is influenced by a variety of neurobiological and environmental variables. The proclivity of an individual to imbibe is thought to reflect a balance between alcohol&rsquo;s positive reinforcing (i.e., rewarding) effects, such as euphoria and anxiety reduction (i.e., anxiolysis), and the drug&rsquo;s aversive effects, which are typically associated with negative consequences of alcohol consumption (e.g., hangover or withdrawal symptoms). Neuroadaptive alterations caused by continuous alcohol use and abuse (such as tolerance and physiological dependence) are regarded to be critical in the shift from regulated alcohol use to more frequent and excessive, uncontrollable drinking which induces cerebellar degeneration considered as common type of acquired toxic ataxia. Excessive use leads to degeneration of the midline cerebellum. Progressive trunk and gait ataxia is characteristic, with little involvement of upper limbs, eyes or speech (a corollary of relative cerebellar hemispheric sparing). Abrupt termination of alcohol use after a period of heavy drinking may result in alcohol withdrawal seizures. Generalized tonic&ndash;clonic seizures are the most common and severe form of seizure in this conditions. Current case report presents complaints of astasia and slurred speech with few episodes of seizures. The diagnosis indicated Mild cerebellar atrophy.

      "abstract": "Addiction is a mental and physical condition caused by the interaction of drugs and the organism characterized by a compulsion for occasional or regular enjoyment of substance of abuse, to create a feeling of pleasure or to avoid discomfort due to the absence of substance of abuse. There is an increasing proportion of addict in the population. Most commonly used addictive substances are tobacco and alcohol. Substance of abuse cause changes of tissues inside the mouth and the doctors of dental medicine are first who can note that, which makes it necessary to educate them about the various changes that has the use of various addictive substances. Substance of abuse are tobacco, alcohol and drugs.\r\nTobacco causes malignant and non-malignant changes in the oral cavity, has a vasoconstrictive effect and is a major risk factor in the development of malignant lesions of the oral cavity together with alcohol. Alcohol acts dehydrating to the mucous membranes of the oral cavity, has negative interactions with 150 different kinds of medications which requires caution when prescribing medications. Psihodepressing drugs mask the pain and make it difficult to anesthetizing addicts, psychostimulant drugs cause a feeling of euphoria. Cocaine can lead to perforation of the nasal septum and palate, while methamphetamine results in a meth-mouth which includes extensive caries lesions. Cannabinoids may cause the development of oedema uvula, hallucinogens complicate management with patients due to the phenomenon of hallucinations and delusions, and the consumption of inhalatory addictive substances are diagnosed by finding the wounds and stains around the mouth.\r\nIt is necessary to have individually and empathetic approach to each patient in order to develop a sense of confidence and better cooperation, identify changes occurring on the oral mucosa, to make a differential diagnosis of thelesions and to start the treatment timely.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Food addiction is a topic that has received attention in the psychological literature in part because of the role that it potentially plays in binge eating, obesity, and eating disorders. Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

      "title": "Cannabis, cannabinoids and psychosis: a balanced view",
      "abstract": "The laws legalizing recreational cannabis use, the increasing strength of cannabis and cannabis derivatives, and the growing availability and commercialization of cannabis call attention to the possible implications for mental health, and specifically for the incidence of psychosis. Several lines of evidence suggest that exposure to cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids may contribute to the risk for psychosis1. The spectrum of psychosis outcomes linked to cannabis and cannabinoids range from short-lived psychotic states to chronic psychotic disorders. In addition to observational data, experimental laboratory studies provide compelling evidence that cannabis, its principal psychoactive constituent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, and synthetic cannabinoids induce acute brief psychotic states characterized by positive, negative and cognitive symptoms resembling the symptoms of schizophrenia2. Cannabis may induce a psychotic disorder (cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, CIPD) lasting days to weeks, that often requires clinical intervention, resolves with the termination of use, and recurs with re-exposure. In Denmark, the increasing potency of cannabis has been associated with an increased incidence of CIPD3. Interestingly, up to 50% of patients diagnosed with CIPD are re-diagnosed years later with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, suggesting that CIPD may be a harbinger of a chronic psychotic disorder4. Furthermore, the rate of \"conversion\" to schizophrenia seems greatest for CIPD relative to other substance-induced psychoses. However, whether CIPD evolves into schizophrenia, or whether CIPD and schizophrenia are related yet distinct, remains unclear. Beyond the above brief syndromes, epidemiological studies link cannabis exposure to a higher risk (2- to 4-fold) for schizophrenia. The dose-response relationship is linear, such that more frequent and heavier use, and use of higher potency cannabis, carries a greater risk. Other moderating factors include an earlier age of exposure, childhood trauma, and exposure to other drugs. Whether the relationship between cannabis and psychosis is causal should be considered separately for the psychosis outcomes in question. The tight temporal relationship between exposure to cannabinoids and the emergence of psychotic states observed in experimental studies provides strong evidence to support a causal relationship. Likewise, with CIPD, the emergence of psychosis with exposure to cannabis, its resolution with abstinence, and its recurrence with resumption, also make a compelling case for causality. In contrast, the evidence linking cannabis and schizophrenia is mostly from epidemiological studies, which are not without limitations. While these studies attempt to adjust for confounders, including other drug use, latent psychosis, pre-existing cannabis exposure, and other psychiatric disorders, any accurate estimate of causality is limited, and dependent on capturing and measuring all relevant known and unknown confounders. The relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia fulfills, to varying degrees, a number of the classic Hill criteria of causality, including the strength, consistency, specificity, temporal characteristics, direction, biological gradient, coherence and plausibility of the association and supporting experimental evidence. Regarding the strength of the evidence, there is a linear dose-response relationship (2- to 9-fold) driven by the frequency, amount of use and potency of cannabis5. For perspective, cigarette smokers are 15-30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than non-smokers, and ~85% of cases of lung cancer are linked to smoking. In terms of specificity, while cannabis use increases the risk of depression, the evidence is strongest for psychosis. Furthermore, while other drugs (e.g., amphetamines) are associated with psychosis, the risk of psychosis seems greatest with cannabis. The fact that the endocannabinoid system is involved in neurodevelopmental processes supports the biological plausibility for cannabis exposure during adolescence to disrupt neurodevelopmental processes and, in doing so, increase the risk for schizophrenia. However, regarding temporality, the reverse causation hypothesis has been proposed, according to which the risk for schizophrenia confers risk for cannabis use rather than the risk for cannabis conferring risk for schizophrenia. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide evidence for a bidirectional causal relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia, but suggest a larger contribution of reverse-causal mechanisms and common genetic risk for both schizophrenia and cannabis use (genetic confounding)6. The classic criteria for causality have limitations, especially when applied to multifactorial disorders. Schizophrenia, or the \"group of schizophrenias\" as termed by Bleuler, is likely heterogenous in etiopathogenesis. Perhaps cannabis exposure might be linked to a specific psychosis subtype that is buried within the group of schizophrenias. Furthermore, in line with a multifactorial etiopathogenesis, cannabis is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause schizophrenia. More likely cannabis is partly causal, interacting with other factors such as genetic liability to confer greater risk for schizophrenia. If cannabis confers a higher risk for developing psychosis, then changes in the cannabis landscape should be accompanied by increased rates of psychosis. Indeed, some studies suggest increasing rates of psychosis linked to cannabis7. However, it may be too early for the public health impact of the changes to be fully realized. In this regard, the history of cigarettes and lung cancer may be instructive. While suspected, it took half a century to recognize that cigarettes cause lung cancer. Despite compelling epidemiological data, evidence from animal studies, cellular pathology and chemical analyses was necessary to establish that cigarettes cause lung cancer. In contrast, schizophrenia has no signature pathology and is likely heterogenous, and the risk for psychosis with cannabis is lower than that of lung cancer with smoking. Therefore, at the present time it may be unrealistic to expect the same level of evidence and/or certainty that cannabis causes schizophrenia. More likely, evidence may accumulate linking cannabis to a subtype of schizophrenia. While the spotlight has been on whether cannabis causes new cases of psychosis, we risk overlooking the impact of cannabis on those with established psychotic disorders. The high rates of cannabis use by individuals with schizophrenia have been attributed to \"self-medication\", but there is little evidence to support that hypothesis8. In contrast, there is clear evidence of cannabis having a negative impact on the course of schizophrenia, with greater positive symptoms, relapse rates, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, homelessness and legal problems. Schizophrenia ranks amongst the top fifteen leading causes of disability and is financially burdensome. Therefore, additional costs from the consequences of comorbid cannabis use may be substantial. To conclude, it is tempting to speculate what impact reducing or eliminating cannabis exposure in adolescents might have on the rates of psychosis. For example, the EU-GEI study found that, if high-potency cannabis was no longer available, depending on the region, a substantial proportion (12-50%) of first-episode psychosis cases could be averted5. Reducing the rates of psychosis by just 10% is well worthwhile. Towards that end, we need to identify factors that place individuals at greatest risk for developing psychosis in the context of exposure to cannabis. Furthermore, the public needs to be educated about the contribution of cannabis use to the risk of psychosis. Likewise, greater efforts are necessary to educate patients with psychosis about the negative impact of cannabis on illness course, to discourage their use of cannabis, and to develop effective treatments. In what may be an ominous development, as cigarette sales decline worldwide, the tobacco industry, with its vast experience in mass-production, advertising, marketing, lobbying and legal defense, is investing in the cannabis industry! With the cannabis landscape continuing to evolve, we must remain concerned about the risk of psychosis outcomes related to cannabis.",

      "abstract": "Medications with cognitive effects and/or side effects also affect sleep and dreaming. The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

      "title": "Ketamine for Depression, 1: Clinical Summary of Issues Related to Efficacy, Adverse Effects, and Mechanism of Action",
      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

      "abstract": "Background. The cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) was first described in 2004. It is considered as a functional gastrointestinal syndrome characterized by the presence of nausea, severe and cyclic morning vomiting, epigastric abdominal pain, hot water bathing for symptom relief, in patients that use cannabis regularly and has a resolution of the syndrome after cessation of cannabis consumption. Clinical Case. Report of a 29 year old male, with daily consumption of cannabis, with history of intense epigastric abdominal pain and recurrent vomiting that partially responded to the use of antispasmodics. After 4 visits to the emergency department he was hospitalized for study and treatment. Laboratory and image exploration are carried out without positive results for organic disease. Therefore, a functional gastrointestinal syndrome is thought, and a cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome was suspected. A psychiatric evaluation is carried out, diagnosing a cannabis use disorder. Discussion and conclusion. CHS is a syndrome that has been described recently and is not usually considered as a differential diagnosis for patients with hyperemesis. However, the current high prevalence of cannabis consumption, will probably lead to a more frequent presentation of the syndrome at different health providers. Therefore, it is important to diffuse and update the knowledge about this syndrome to recognize it and develop a timely treatment, avoiding medical complications from invasive exploratory methods and the use of unnecessary resources.",

It is characterized by acute onset symptoms, fluctuating course, impaired attention, unorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. Delirium, as a manifestation of acute nicotine withdrawal syndrome has been reported in the reviewed literature only in eight cases. We report the case of a heavy smoker admitted because of a reagudization of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. At the third day of nicotine abstinence, he developed delirium with a rapid improvement of his symptoms after treatment with a transdermal nicotine patch. This description suggests that in hospitalized heavy smokers who develop delirium with agitation, a simple trial with a nicotine patch can offer a dramatic therapeutic response in a few hours, constituting additionally a confirmatory test. The recognition of delirium as a manifestation of nicotine withdrawal could allow to determine the origin of symptoms and to apply the appropriate therapy, in certain complex cases that now remain undiagnosed.",

They both occurred during administration of phenothiazine tranquilizing drugs, and were relieved by changing or stopping the drug and by adding an anti-Parkinson drug. No attempt was made to determine the necessity for adding the anti-Parkinson drug when the tranquilizer was changed, though Kruse(4) reports that \"these reactions . . . were always controllable\" by anti-Parkinson drugs alone. 3. Akathisia is a syndrome which occurs during the administration of high doses of tranquilizing drugs. Whenever a patient fails to respond to the administration of high doses of these medicines or when he seems to have a paradoxical effect from them, the possibility of akathisia should be considered and appropriate treatment instituted. 4. Appropriate treatment of the condition appears to be, at this time, a reduction or change in the tranquilizing drugs used, plus the addition of an anti-Parkinson drug such as Cogentin, Pagitane, or Kemadrin.",

The interview not only is diagnostic, but it can also be therapeutic. Use open-ended questions, such as, “Tell me about your headaches,” “Tell me in your own words how headaches affect your life,” or “What else can you tell me about your headaches?” After presenting the patient with a list of therapeutic options described here, always ask, “What do you think about these options? Do you have any questions about them? And which ones do you want to pursue?” Establishing the correct diagnosis is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Not having a biological marker or a test for primary headaches and relying on the clinical picture for diagnosis require constant vigilance and reappraisal, particularly when headaches change in character or worsen in severity or frequency. A migraine sufferer may develop other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, brain tumor, cervicogenic headaches, or magnesium deficiency, which in the beginning may only worsen the typical migraines without any additional signs and symptoms. Typical migraine, tension, or cluster headaches have been reported to occur with the majority of intracranial pathologies, such as vascular abnormalities, tumors, and infections.",

Importantly, the occasional but limited use of addictive substances is clinically distinct from escalated substance use, loss of control over substance intake, and the emergence of chronic compulsive substance-seeking that characterizes addiction.

      "abstract": "Material y métodos: descripción de un caso clínico. Objetivos: Describir el cannabis como agente precipitante de psicosis y empobrecimiento del desarrollo cognitivo sobre un cerebro adolescente. Introducción: El cannabis es la droga ilegal más consumida en España, y su relación con las enfermedades mentales se encuentra en continua revisión, especialmente en psicosis. Las consecuencias del THC son mayores cuando es consumido por niños y adolescentes. El consumo crónico desde temprana edad puede disminuir el potencial intelectual y funcional del paciente. Resumen: Varón de 19 años. No antecedentes salvo consumo de cannabis desde los once años. Acude a urgencias con sintomatología delirante de corte paranoide, autorreferencialidad y fobias de impulsión centradas en auto y heteroagresividad. Se procede al ingreso en la Unidad de Hospitalización. Presenta sintomatología psicótica pobremente estructurada y rendimiento cognitivo inferior a la normalidad, con dificultad de elaboración psíquica que conlleva interpretaciones autorreferenciales. Se pauta 20 mg de Olanzapina/día y 5 mg Lorazepam/8h. Los familiares perciben desde hace unos años un deterioro global, respecto a un funcionamiento cognitivo previo ajustado a su edad. La evolución resulta favorable, con mejoría progresiva a nivel conductual. Tras 12 días en la unidad el paciente es dado de alta con seguimiento por la Unidad de Salud Mental Comunitaria. Se le ofrece recurso específico para apoyar abstinencia a tóxicos, sin embargo el paciente lo rechaza por el momento. Conclusión: El consumo de cannabis puede precipitar la aparición de psicosis, la cual remitirá con mayor facilidad si el consumo cesa. En un cerebro en maduración el consumo puede ser aún más dañino, pudiendo desembocar en una falta de desarrollo cognitivo, no solo por el efecto químico de la sustancia sino también por síndrome amotivacional asociado que, a esta edad, puede conllevar un desinterés por la adquisición de recursos propios.",

Although the term \"addictive\" has been used loosely with many behaviors, it may be an appropriate term to describe compulsive shopping. Increased accessibility, hyperstimulating marketing techniques, a loss of the protective delay between impulse and purchase, and overvaluing of the shopping process and objects purchased may all contribute to the potentially addictive nature of shopping.",

The patient was admitted to the neurology service, where he was worked up with an MRI with epilepsy protocol and an EEG. During admission, the patient was admitted to daily synthetic marijuana use. He did note that he had started to decrease the amount of mojo he used daily in an attempt to stop. His last use was at 9 am the day of his admission. He was trying to decrease his use; his girlfriend of difficulty word-finding noted periods. Synthetic marijuana (SM) or \"mojo\" use has been increasing in the past decade for two reasons; It is considered an herbal product and has been legal. A withdrawal syndrome of SM use has been characterized chiefly as tachycardia, irritation, anxiety, and mood swings. These withdrawal symptoms are usually seen with chronic use. Some early results in the literature also show that SM use can lead to functional and structural neuronal changes. This manuscript discusses a case of a first on-set seizure as a possible withdrawal symptom in chronic SM use.",

Insomnia also involves daytime consequences such as fatigue, lack of energy, concentration difficulties and irritability. Psychiatric disoders are a common cause of chronic insomnia. In recent years studies have suggested the emergence of changing perspective on the management of chronic insomnia in psychiatric patients. The article review the advantages and disadvantages of medications employed to promote improved sleep. Special emphasis is given to use of the newer - generation benzodiazepine receptor agonist hynotics.",

      "abstract": "Substance use disorders commonly co-occur with mood disorders (major depression, bipolar disorder) and may be due to the direct effects of illicit substances, such as intoxication and withdrawal, or due to effects stemming from chronic use, including substance-induced mood disorders. Self-medication of mood disorders with legal or illicit substances is highly prevalent. Careful assessment of patients is necessary to determine whether a co-occurring disorder is due to substance use or a separate diagnosis that requires independent treatment. Many depressive symptoms may resolve with treatment of the substance use disorder. Independent mood disorders can be treated with behavioral therapy and standard pharmacological therapy. Some mood disorder medications are also effective for substance use disorders. Some substances that have historically been used recreationally are being studied as possible treatments for mood disorders.",

Consumidor de cannabis desde hace 5 años, con aumento en el ultimo año a 6 unidades al día, presentando de forma puntual fenómenos de autorreferencialidad e ideas de perjuicio en contexto de consumo así como cierto aislamiento. En primero de ingeniería consulta en psiquiatría por animo bajo, dificultad en la concentración y procrastinación. Se inicia tratamiento con metilfenidalto de liberación prolongada hasta 36 mg con parcial respuesta y buena tolerancia. Al aumentar a 54 mg al día el paciente comienza de forma instalada con soliloquios y risas inmotivadas, fenómenos autorreferenciales e ideas delirantes de perjuicio centrada en vecinos. Además presenta movimientos corporales repetitivos y desorganizados que el paciente justifica “como si estuviera imitando a personajes de videojuegos”, por lo que se ingresa en unidad de hospitalización breve. Se suspenden los estimulantes, sin mejorar los síntomas por lo que se inicia paliperidona hasta 18 mg al día con buena respuesta y remisión de la sintomatología psicótica. El paciente es derivado a hospital de día para mejoría funcional en todas las esferas Discusión La psicosis inducida por estimulantes es un cuadro atípico (1/660) que remite en general a las 72 horas tras la retirada del fármaco. La presencia de síntomas psicóticos en el pasado al consumir cannabis y la permanencia de éstos al retirar el estimulante obligar a ampliar el diagnóstico diferencial a trastornos de esfera psicótica a confirmar en evolución y donde es imprescindible una abstinencia completa a sustancias y supone un reto para el tratamiento de TDAH en estos pacientes.",

Cannabinoids are often utilized for their antiemetic properties, so CHS can be a puzzling condition, and the diagnosis of CHS may be disputed by patients. Unlike other cyclic vomiting syndromes, CHS can be relieved by hot showers or topical capsaicin. Abstinence from cannabinoids causes CHS to resolve, sometimes in a matter of days or hours. Marijuana users as well as many clinicians are not aware of CHS, and patients may undergo unnecessary tests, scans, and other procedures to get an accurate diagnosis. Symptoms may be severe enough to require hospitalization. With liberalization of marijuana laws and favorable public opinion about the healing properties of cannabis, CHS may be more frequently observed in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania and major depressive episodes. The diagnostic criteria for mania require the presence of distinct periods of abnormal mood characterized by euphoria, expansiveness, or irritability. The change in mood is accompanied by increased activity or energy as well as other symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased sleep, increased speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, agitation, and increased involvement in risky behaviors. The assessment of bipolar disorder should include a detailed psychiatric history ascertaining the presence of current or previous mood symptoms. Children and adolescents are more likely to present with either rapidly fluctuating or a mixed mood state. Bipolar disorder is associated with high relapse rates, even among those receiving treatment. The first-line medication class is second-generation antipsychotics. Additional psychosocial treatments such as psychoeducation, psychotherapy, and community engagement can also be helpful.",

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

This definition includes failure to resist an impulse, drive or temptation to perform some act that is harmful to the person or others; an increasing sense of tension or arousal before committing the act; and an experience of immediate pleasure, gratification or release when the act is initiated or completed. Compulsive behaviours such as compulsive buying or compulsive gambling also share many characteristics with drug dependence as well as with obsessive-compulsive disorders. However, in order to justify the use of the term compulsive behaviour rather than excessive, impulsive or addictive behaviour, there is a need to explain the use of the term compulsive.KeywordsAnorexia NervosaEating DisorderPathological GamblingCompulsive BehaviourSouth Oaks Gambling ScreenThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "title": "A Case of Withdrawal Psychosis from Internet Addiction Disorder",
      "abstract": "Similar to substance use disorder, patients with Internet addiction disorder (IAD) show excessive use, tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. We report a case of a patient with withdrawal psychosis who showed persecutory delusion and disorganized behaviors in addition to common withdrawal symptoms such as agitation and irritability. A 25-year-old male developed a full-blown psychotic episode within one day after discontinuing an Internet game that he had been playing for at least eight hours a day for two years. Upon admission, he had no abnormal brain imaging findings and laboratory tests. With antipsychotic medication (quetiapine up to 800 mg), his psychotic symptoms rapidly subsided and after four days of treatment, he no longer showed any signs of psychosis. This case report suggests that brief psychosis can develop during withdrawal from long-term excessive use of an Internet and the central pathology beneath the IAD is more likely a form of addiction than impulse control.",

      "title": "Lacosamide induced aggression in a patient with seizure disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, The commonest psychiatric side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are aggression and irritability.[1] There are serious behavioral and psychological repercussions caused by the changes in the Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA)-ergic and glutamatergic activity caused by AEDs on certain regions of the brain such as the amygdala, frontal cortex, and hypothalamus.[2] There are modifications in the GABA receptors and GABAergic neurons in an epileptic brain, which cause medications that enhance GABA neurotransmission to potentially trigger or exacerbate aggression, as opposed to their effect of decreasing aggression in subjects without epilepsy.[2] A 23-year-old male patient was admitted to the psychiatry ward with complaints of laughing inappropriately, irrelevant talk, overfamiliarity, over-talkativeness, inappropriate behavior towards women, irritability with the use of abusive language without provocation, and decreased sleep. These complaints have been present intermittently for the last 3 years. The patient was diagnosed with a seizure disorder at 6 months of age. His last seizure was 10 months before admission, after which a significant worsening of symptoms was noted, especially inappropriate laughter, irrelevant talk, and inappropriate behavior with women. Physical examination was unremarkable. Mental Status Examination showed a kempt, cooperative patient, in touch with reality, who laughed without provocation and behaved inappropriately with the examiner, by attempting to undress. During treatment in the hospital, the patient suffered a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in the ward. The neurologist also prescribed a tab of lacosamide (LCM) 100 mg twice daily. After 2 days of starting the patient on LCM, a sudden increase in aggressive behavior was noted, in a patient who previously showed no aggressive behavior in the ward or before admission apart from intermittent irritability. The patient broke the railing of a bed and attacked his mother and doctors in the ward, threw a metal stool in an attempt to injure another patient, and was verbally and physically abusive towards relatives, doctors, and other ward staff, requiring chemical and physical restraint. No such aggressive behavior was observed when the patient was previously on carbamazepine (CBZ) and lamotrigine. The aggression was therefore attributed to the addition of LCM and the same was stopped. Following this, the patient's aggression decreased and then stopped within 72 hours. The patient was discharged on: T. Oxcarbazepine 450 mg twice daily, T. Divalproate 750 mg twice daily, T. Risperidone 2 mg twice daily, and T. Clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily. On review after a month, his mother reported no aggressive behavior. While the exact mechanism behind behavioral problems that are seen in seizure disorders is still unclear, its occurrence can be attributed to many factors such as the neuropathology of epileptic syndromes, functional damage caused by the seizure, comorbid developmental disorders, anti-epileptic drugs, etc.[3] The changes that occur in the central GABAergic activity due to LCM play a contributory role in drug-induced behavioral changes.[2] The effects of the CBZ, levetiracetam (LEV), perampanel (PER), and LCM on aggression were studied using the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire in 266 consecutive outpatients with epilepsy. The LEV group had a significantly higher aggression score as compared to the CBZ and LCM groups. Based on these results the authors concluded that LEV increased aggression, while CBZ and LCM reduced aggression.[1] Our patient, however, showed the opposite findings. A thorough psychiatric history and any history that indicates a propensity for aggression must be taken from patients and their caregivers. While this may not stop the prescription of anti-epileptic drugs, drugs that are more likely to result in such behavior may be regulated, while also looking out for these side effects that are considered rare. There is limited knowledge on aggression and personality changes caused by using LCM, requiring further investigation to prescribe appropriate anti-epileptic drugs.

Neuropsychological assessments revealed deficits on visual processing tasks. Neuroimaging, electroencephalography and ophthalmological evaluation revealed no abnormalities. The multimodal sensory distortions responded to antipsychotic treatment, paralleling improvement in other schizophrenia psychopathology, over a period of one month.Prominent and persistent multimodal sensory distortions like metamorphopsia and paracousis in the presence of psychotic symptoms warrant a detailed neurological and general medical work-up. These symptoms presenting in the absence of neurological or substance use disorders may be a component of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Smell Loss and Onset of Phantosmia are Critical Aspects of Head Injury Cognition",
      "abstract": "Head injury is a common event occurring in 1–2 million people in the U.S. yearly. Head injuries may cause minor inconvenience or it may induce major cognitive changes such as memory loss, concentration difficulties, headache, hearing loss, and visual difficulties, associated with or without loss of consciousness. Two of the major events occurring after head injuries which are not commonly recognized but which significantly alter behavior are loss of smell acuity and subsequent onset of smell distortions or phantosmia. Most patients are unaware that these two events can occur but they are present in most patients who experience head injury of any severity. Initially, patients recognize that they cannot recognize any odors and subsequently recognize that they cannot obtain any flavor from any food or drink. Over time they recognize that they experience a peculiar, usually unpleasant, odor in their nose in absence of any external odor. These odors may be persistent or transient, usually unpleasant, and may be described as fecal‐like, burned, chemical‐like, or metallic. The phantom, if persistent, can be severe enough to initiate loss of appetite with subsequent weight loss and depression. We have evaluated over 200 patients with smell loss and phantosmia after a head injury at The Taste and Smell Clinic in Washington, DC over the past 40 years attempting to understand their cognitive changes in smell function. We have found that the mechanism for these cognitive changes relate to metabolic changes mainly in biochemical changes in both sensory and brain function in which specific growth factors which maintain olfactory function have been diminished and specific brain neurotransmitters, mainly gamma‐aminobutyric acid, have also been diminished. Correction of these abnormalities commonly corrects the smell loss, inhibits the phantosmia and improves cognition.",

      "abstract": "What is cannabis?The cannabis plant contains over 100 cannabinoid compounds, chemical substances that can activate cannabis receptors in the body.Cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are used to treat various psychiatric and medical conditions.They can be inhaled or ingested for a more slow-release effect, and are two of the most widely studied cannabinoids.However, our understanding of the public's beliefs regarding the effects of these compounds is limited.CBD is commonly used for therapeutic relief such as pain neutralisation, as an anti-inflammatory, an anti-cancer drug, as well as to treat seizures.It does not appear to result in the mindaltering effects that can be induced by THC.THC has not gained as much therapeutic traction, largely due to its power to alter sensory and time perception and its potential to cause psychosis.THC gives more of a mental high in addition to the effects on the body, with users reporting a state of calm or elation and enhanced creativity.People in extreme pain, for example post medical surgery, report significant benefits from THC use.The harm versus benefit remains an area of debate for both THC and CBD, even though CBD does not induce mind-altering effects to the extent that THC can.One reason for this is that the factors influencing its effects are not limited to the chemical constituents of the plant, but largely depend on one's opinion of it, according to Barrett, a world-leading expert on cannabis use.These opinions or beliefs tend to come from whether they are a regular user or non-user.",

Systemic complications include vomiting, sinus tachycardia, myocardial infarction, and acute kidney injury. Seizures are common; however, status epilepticus is not widely reported. In this case report, we describe a patient who developed acute psychosis and new-onset refractory status epilepticus necessitating emergent neurological life-support and prolonged admission to an intensive care unit following abuse of synthetic cannabinoids.

      "abstract": "Abstract Withdrawal-emergent adverse effects of antipsychotics are an infrequently identified condition which can appear during antipsychotic dose reduction and medication change. In this paper, we present the case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms after a dose reduction of risperidone is presented. A patient, 23 years of age, was admitted to a health care facility due to an unexpected change in his behavior, with paranoid delusions, incoherent thinking, and significant anxiety. An initial risperidone treatment was soon changed to zuclopenhixol. Subsequently, severe extrapyramidal symptoms appeared, after which the medication was switched back to resperidone. Following this treatment, the patient left the health care facility and stopped the medication of his own volition. Psychotic symptoms and massive extrapyramidal symptoms again occurred. These symptoms subsided only slowly during a subsequent treatment with olanzapine. The development of adverse neurological effects together with a worsening of productive psychotic symptomatology may be explained by withdrawal of antipsychotic medication. These symptoms are often attributed to new medications, which are prematurely discontinued after the appearance of an adverse effect, but which are potentially beneficial to a patient, provided that enough time for a spontaneous subsidence of withdrawal-emergent effects is given. Any change in antipsychotic treatment should be carefully considered and thoroughly planned.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, methamphetamine, and cathinones. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmia, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Regular users may experience dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation with abstinence. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected users; these include individual or group counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. Long-acting amphetamines have been shown to reduce other stimulant use, but not complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

At first, we regarded all the symptoms as alcoholic hallucinosis, by a clinical standpoint, in spite of no auditory hallucination in this case. However, taking the overall clinical course into consideration, withdrawal syndrome could have been affected by some factors. One of the possibilities is that delusion might have been induced by aripiprazole. There still may be some other unknown influential factors on withdrawal, which are indicated by previous papers.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, overdose of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs, It is most commonly reported with combinations of serotonergic medications. Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction. methamphetamine is a psycho stimulant drug which produces increased wakefulness and focus in association with decreased fatigue and appetite. A methamphetamine overdose is rarely fatal but can lead to a number of different symptoms, including psychosis, chest pain, and hypertension. It is among agents with moderate potency to produce Serotonin syndrome. Here we present the first reported case of serotonin syndrome after a single ingestion of high dose methamphetamine (body staffer of 2gr amphetamine) in 28 year-old previously healthy man without any drug history, 2 hours prior to admission. Clinical manifestation included hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, dilated pupil, agitation, overactive reflexes (greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs) and clonus. complete blood count was normal except for severely elevated white blood cell count of 22.3 ×103/µL (22.3 ×10 9 /L) with 74% neutrophils and 24% lymphocytes. His serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, and electrolytes were normal. Mildly elevation in Serum creatinine kinas was seen. Coagulation studies and Urine analysis were normal. Serum glucose was 210 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas shows respiratory alkalosis. We intubated him by Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) method and then took an emergent abdominal CT scan for any need for surgical intervention; we admitted him in ICU ward and did supportive care including the control of agitation, hyperthermia and autonomic instability. After 2 days we could extubate him and after 5days he discharged from hospital. clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hyper vigilance and agitation (1). Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia (1,3).",

      "title": "Alcohol Abuse",
      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects. Definition The American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

      "title": "REVIEW: Behavioural assessment of drug reinforcement and addictive features in rodents: an overview",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Some psychoactive drugs are abused because of their ability to act as reinforcers. As a consequence behavioural patterns (such as drug‐seeking/drug‐taking behaviours) are promoted that ensure further drug consumption. After prolonged drug self‐administration, some individuals lose control over their behaviour so that these drug‐seeking/taking behaviours become compulsive, pervading almost all life activities and precipitating the loss of social compatibility. Thus, the syndrome of addictive behaviour is qualitatively different from controlled drug consumption. Drug‐induced reinforcement can be assessed directly in laboratory animals by either operant or non‐operant self‐administration methods, by classical conditioning‐based paradigms such as conditioned place preference or sign tracking, by facilitation of intracranial electric self‐stimulation, or, alternatively by drug‐induced memory enhancement. In contrast, addiction cannot be modelled in animals, at least as a whole, within the constraints of the laboratory. However, various procedures have been proposed as possible rodent analogues of addiction’s major elements including compulsive drug seeking, relapse, loss of control/impulsivity, and continued drug consumption despite negative consequences. This review provides an extensive overview and a critical evaluation of the methods currently used for studying drug‐induced reinforcement as well as specific features of addictive behaviour. In addition, comic strips that illustrate behavioural methods used in the drug abuse field are provided given for free download under http://www.zi‐mannheim/psychopharmacology.de",

      "title": "New Clinical Implications of Opiate Maintenance Treatments",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor\r\n\r\nOpiate addiction is a chronic mental illness with severe repercussion in personal and public health. Various medicaments have been subjected to research in order to find a proper treatment, methadone is the most and wide used drug, buprenorphine/naloxone is the most recent ones, but other choices have been proposed such as prescribing heroin (1). The mentioned treatments, are considered as maintenance ones, because, the chronic illnesses need a longtime approach. Other possibilities have been studied, for example the detoxification (conventional or ultra-rapid) as well as the use of opiate antagonist as naltrexone. On the other hand, a long period of dis habituation or relapse prevention is required after detoxification of all sorts of addictions, including opiate dependency.\r\n\r\nOn this second phase, psychological therapies are very important, as well as social and family support. Most patients need during dis habituation (of heroin addiction) a preliminary period of opiate maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone (2).\r\n\r\nSide effects, as well as notwell-known effects, of drug and treatments are a very interesting goal of research. The hypogonadotrophic effect of opioids can be observed even after the administration of a single opioid dose, both in laboratory animals and in humans (3). Other studies have reported that methadone and buprenorphine are opioids with effects on spermatogenesis (4) and secondary sex organs. It seems probable that these drugs could affect testes volume.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, those effects have quantitative differences depending on the opiate as showed in the paper titled “A quantitative and qualitative study of rat testis following administration of methadone and buprenorphine” (5).\r\n\r\nHeidari et al. observed Buprenorphine treatment is more appropriate for treating opiate addiction in male rats since it does not affect normal testicular structure and function (5). Those results should be considered by all the professionals involved in addictions and their co-morbidities (dual pathology) research projects and treatment, not only because of the consequences of this side effect on sexuality or reproduction, but also how the testosterone deficiency is related to the not well-known effects of opioid maintenance treatments, as its antipsychotic properties or its influence on personality dimensions as reward dependence on opiate dependents type II or antisocial (6).",

One of the symptoms of schizophrenia is sensory perception disorder, namely hallucinations which are typical of mental disorders in individuals characterized by changes in sensory perception, by feeling false sensations in the form of sounds (hearing), sight, taste, touch, or smell. Mental disorders are syndromes or patterns of behavior that are clinically significant that are associated with distress or suffering and pose obstacles to one or more functions of human life. One that includes mental disorders is schizophrenia. Hallucinations are false perceptual distortions that occur in maladaptive neurobiological responses, sufferers actually experience sensory distortions as real things and respond accordingly.

      "title": "Olanzapine-induced akathisia treated with clozapine",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Akathisia is probably the most troublesome side effect of antipsychotic medications. The onset of akathisia may be acute, chronic, tardive, or delayed, or may occur when switching or stopping antipsychotics. While its mechanism is poorly understood, the current hypothesis is low dopaminergic tone, with studies showing interactions in mesolimbic, mesocortical, and spinal dopamine/norepinephrine pathways and the involvement of multiple other neurotransmitter systems.[1] Second-generation antipsychotics such as olanzapine have a very low propensity to cause akathisia but are not entirely free of such side effects.[2] A 32-year-old woman presented with an 11-year history suggestive of prominent delusion of infidelity, hallucinatory behavior, aggression toward her husband, forgetfulness, and poor personal hygiene. She was diagnosed with psychosis not otherwise specified with a differential diagnosis of schizophrenia, with no history of prior psychiatric treatment. The patient was started on increasing doses of Tab. Risperidone up to 6 mg/day. She developed extrapyramidal side effects, which were treated with Tab. Trihexyphenidyl up to 4 mg/day, which she was not able to tolerate due to its side effects of excessive dryness of mouth and constipation. Risperidone was cross-tapered with olanzapine, which was gradually increased to 10 mg/day. Although with 10 mg olanzapine, her symptoms improved, the patient reported subjective restlessness, with the patient complaining of the urge to move around. She was observed to be fidgety, tapping her feet, and difficulty sitting still. This warranted a diagnosis of olanzapine-induced akathisia. The patient was prescribed Tab. Propranolol 20 mg with only minimal improvement in symptoms of akathisia. Olanzapine was cross-tapered with increasing doses of clozapine with which akathisia completely resolved and psychotic symptoms also improved considerably. The patient on the last follow-up was in full remission on clozapine 200 mg/day. Drugs such as clozapine and quetiapine, which have a weak dopaminergic action and a more potent serotonergic effect, may rarely cause akathisia in the absence of another antipsychotic.[1] Treatment of akathisia must ideally start with prevention, psychosocial methods, and modifications in the treatment such as careful cross-tapering of potent with less potent antipsychotics with close monitoring of psychotic symptoms.[1] In our patient, the change in medication from Olanzapine to Clozapine showed significant improvement in her psychotic symptoms as well as ameliorated the akathisia. Other pharmacological interventions include beta-blockers such as propranolol, which was the first-line treatment for akathisia. Anticholinergics and benzodiazepines have some therapeutic value as well but their effects may not be sufficient to reduce akathisia. Newer treatments include Mianserine and Cyproheptadine, which have the potential to counteract psychotropic-induced D2 receptor blockade. Another new intervention is the use of low-dose Mirtazapine.[3] Akathisia may also develop due to drug-drug interactions between psychotropic medications and other drugs such as antimicrobials. Therefore, it is important to take a detailed medical history in order to identify and/or prevent side effects that may be caused by such drug interactions.[4] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms. In the form, the patient has given her consent for her images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal. The patient understands that her name and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal her identity, but anonymity cannot be guaranteed.

Despite the widespread use of cannabis among young people little research attention has been given to the development of pscyhometrically sound measures specific to cannabis related problems. The laws governing cannabis are evolving worldwide are associated with changing pattern of use. Patients with a serious mental illness often use cannabis at higher rates than the general population. Cannabis may induce or exaberate a number of mental health problems. The main psychoactive drug in cannabis is ?9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Cannabidiol, a non-toxicating cannabinoid found in some forms of cannabis, may offset some of these acute effects. Chronic use of cannabis is associated with psychiatric, respiratory, cardiovascular and bone effects. It also has oncogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic effects, all of which depend upon dose and duration of use.

      "title": "Refining cause of death attribution among opioid, opioid‐stimulant and stimulant acute toxicity deaths",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Deaths attributed to a combination of opioids and stimulants have risen dramatically in recent years, largely attributed to fentanyl, yet little is understood about which drug class is primarily responsible. Attributing death to acute substance toxicity is complex and lacks clear standards. We aimed to determine whether additional causes of death and other significant conditions among deaths attributed to fentanyl were similar regardless of stimulant involvement, and distinct from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. Design Cross‐sectional analysis using records from the California Electronic Death Registration System. Setting and cases Unintentional acute toxicity deaths involving fentanyl or stimulants (methamphetamine or cocaine) occurring in San Francisco, USA, during 2013–2023. Measurements We compared demographic characteristics and causes of death or other significant conditions (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical cause, or no other additional cause) among five mutually exclusive groups of deaths: stimulants without opioids (stimulant‐only), fentanyl with stimulants (fentanyl‐stimulant), fentanyl without stimulants (fentanyl‐only), other opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone) with stimulants (“other opioid‐stimulant”), and other opioids without stimulants (“other opioids‐only”). We conducted separate unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models for each outcome (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical, or no additional cause). The primary analysis included results for the fentanyl groups. Findings Of 4475 deaths attributed to acute opioid and/or stimulant toxicity, 24% involved stimulants‐only, 45% fentanyl‐stimulants, and 12% fentanyl‐only; the remaining 20% involved other opioids. Stimulant‐only decedents were the oldest (mean age 54 years), followed by fentanyl‐stimulant (47 years) and fentanyl‐only (44 years; p &lt; 0.001 for all). The adjusted odds of having cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or other medical causes of death (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] from 0.03 to 0.52, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs] from 0.01 to 0.68) were lower and the odds of no additional cause of death (aORs from 2.53 to 3.31, with 95% CIs from 2.00 to 3.40) were higher for both groups of deaths involving fentanyl compared with deaths attributed to stimulants‐only. There were no statistically significant differences in causes of death when comparing fentanyl‐only with fentanyl‐stimulant deaths. Findings were similar for other opioid deaths. Conclusion In San Francisco, USA, causes of death and other significant condition characteristics among deaths attributed to fentanyl appear to be similar regardless of the involvement of stimulants, but are markedly different from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. When reporting on drug‐related mortality and developing interventions, deaths attributed to a combination of fentanyl and stimulants may be appropriately considered in the context of opioid overdose prevention, while deaths attributed to stimulants without opioids may require a response focused on preventing and treating underlying chronic medical conditions.",

Further to the existing reports of adverse reactions to zolpidem, throughout the current manuscript, another case of zolpidem-induced loss of consciousness is going to be presented. The case had taken 100 mg of zolpidem and afterwards, went into an unknown status of narcolepsy, faint, seizure or transient coma. Overdosing zolpidem and being affected by its central effects, he performed risky actions such as cooking by a gas oven and eating meal while intoxicated.

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

First, epileptiform discharges not presenting as obvious seizures may nevertheless affect cognition and/or behaviour. Second, the actual seizures may be obvious but the way they affect cognition or behaviour may not be. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the epileptiform discharges in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes can affect behaviour and cognition. The focal discharges in other forms of epilepsy can also be associated with behavioural change. The Landau‐Kleffner syndrome, the CSWS syndrome, transitory cognitive impairment and transient epileptic amnesia provide further examples of cognitive and behavioural manifestations resulting from subtle manifestations of the epilepsy. Prompt, effective antiepileptic treatment with medication or surgery can improve behaviour and cognition in at least some cases.",

      "abstract": "inal symptoms at the same intensity as before treatment, entailing a return of the same episode and a new episode of illness, respectively [6, 9] . When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ).

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by spontaneous and unexpected occurrence of panic attacks, the frequency of which can vary from several attacks per day to only a few attacks per year. Panic disorder is usually qualified with the presence or absence of agoraphobia. Panic disorder with agoraphobia is an anxious disorder where repeated attacks of fear and anxiety appear at places and situations out of the family surrounding, places where the escape is difficult and where someone would be helpless, as for an example crowded places, passing over bridges, traveling by public transport, walking in an open space. Depressive episodes, as well as obsessive-compulsive procedures, can also follow this condition. A female person aged 25 years presents with a classical panic disorder with an agoraphobia and a classic and secure behavior. She also suffers from dysthymia and a chronic fluctuating mood and low self-confidence. The patient gets panic attack when traveling by public transport in the morning when going to work, in a restaurant, in a supermarket, in a disco, when walking in an open space. The symptomatology started half a year before going to the psychiatrist, after several close persons died. A short description of CBT. CBT is based on the cognitive model of an emotional answer and aspects of stoic philosophy. CBT is based on an idea that our thoughts cause emotions and different behavior, so that we can change the way of thinking, and after that feelings/behavior unchanged situations. CBT uses Socrates' method and some techniques from psychodrama, as well as relaxing techniques. Giving «homework» and keeping a diary is also a very important part of this therapy. Seven therapeutic sessions of a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy in a combination with the antidepressants (one session weekly) were performed. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a leading therapy in dealing with agoraphobia and panic attacks. In combination with SSRI, it gives excellent results in reduction of the symptomatology. At the end of the treatment, the mental state was significantly improved. The patient came in contact with her beliefs and the basic models developed in childhood, and learned how to cope with negative thoughts, feelings and maladaptive behavior.",

      "abstract": "The acute use of alcohol and several other licit and illicit drugs can affect mental state and cognitive function. The chronic use of certain drugs may also increase the risk of cognitive impairment and perhaps dementia in later life. This paper focuses on the long-term cognitive consequences of using alcohol, benzodiazepines, tobacco and cannabis. Currently available evidence indicates that mild to moderate alcohol consumption is not associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and may in fact have a protective effect against dementia, although heavy, long-term consumption is likely to have a negative impact on cognitive function. The degree that alcohol-related cognitive impairment must reach to be classified as dementia is currently obscure. Longer-term smoking is associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and possibly dementia. The chronic use of benzodiazepines has been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment but information relating to dementia remains inconclusive. The chronic use of cannabis may impair intellectual abilities but data on this topic remain sparse and difficult to interpret. In conclusion, there is evidence that some drugs contribute to the causal pathway that leads to the development of cognitive impairment but currently available data do not support the introduction of a separate diagnostic category of drug-induced dementia (such as alcohol-related dementia). Health promotion programs designed to decrease tobacco smoking and \"harmful\" alcohol use (and possibly other drug use) may decrease the burden of cognitive impairment and perhaps dementia in later life.",

The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in Australia. Regular use has been associated with increased risk for a range of harms, including the development and exacerbation of mental disorders.This article reviews current evidence relating to the neuropharmacology of cannabis and its impact on mental health, as well as strategies related to the assessment and management of cannabis and co-occurring mental disorders within the primary care setting.Early and heavy use of cannabis has been associated with the onset of psychosis and depression, while chronic use results in poorer treatment outcomes among those with co-occurring mental disorders. Effective management involves the development of therapeutic engagement and an ongoing relationship, with monitoring of cannabis use and mental health problems. Standard pharmacotherapeutic treatment of the mental disorder may be associated with a reduction in cannabis use, although adjunctive psychological intervention is also likely to be required.",

However, reports of physical dependence, as characterized by significant withdrawl symptomatology upon cessation of chronic cannabis exposure, has not been well established or clearly defined in any species. The abuse potential of cannabis is more readily observed in humans than in experimental animal investigations. This may be due to the physiochemical characteristics of cannabis or delta 9-THC, which complicates this type of animal experimentation. It is more likely that the greatest dangers of cannabis abuse involve the pharmacological effects of the drug upon the central nervous system and other organs, rather than the development of dependence.",

Most troublesome of these are psychotic states and aggressive behavior, but a large variety of undesirable changes in cognition and affect can be induced. Adverse effects occur more frequently with higher dosages and long-term use. They can subside over time but some persist long-term. Multiple alterations in the gray and white matter of the brain assessed as changes in tissue volume or metabolism, or at molecular level, have been associated with amphetamine and methamphetamine use and the psychiatric adverse effects, but further studies are required to clarify their causal role, specificity, and relationship with preceding states and traits and comorbidities. The latter include other substance use disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. Amphetamine- and methamphetamine-related psychosis is similar to schizophrenia in terms of symptomatology and pathogenesis, and these two disorders share predisposing genetic factors.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual dysfunction, usually involving short-term memory, abstract reasoning, visuomotor coordination, intellectual flexibility, and spatial reasoning, is a well-documented finding among alcohol imbibers of various drinking styles. Despite the diversity of groups examined and the attempted control of variables other than alcohol consumption, little concensus has been reached with regard to the chronology of dysfunction (as related to lifetime drinking style, duration of alcoholism, quantity consumed per session, or type of potable). In many instances, diet, age, and even sex have outweighed the relative influence of alcohol in the degree of intellectual dysfunction. Morphologically, brain changes tend to be in the anterior/basal areas and may involve the third ventricle, diencephalic areas, and other focal variations. Cerebellar changes also are not uncommon yet may reflect a subgroup of alcoholics rather than a generalised trend. Generally, many intellectual deficits partially rebound rapidly within the first two or three weeks after cessation of drinking, with perhaps modest further improvement if sobriety is sustained for several months. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the alcoholic population and the potent effect of ancillary variables upon measures of intellectual functioning, control and matching of demographic factors is a paramount consideration. Demographic variables of primary concern include age, sex, socio-economic status, education, duration of alcoholism, quantity of alcohol consumed per session, diet, psychotropic medications, secondary psychiatric diagnoses, secondary medical diagnoses, exact duration of abstinence, and prior exposure to psychometric instruments.",

      "abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\") is a unique drug, sharing properties of hallucinogens and stimulants. The acute effects of empathy, euphoria, and excitement for which it is used recreationally can make it overwhelmingly distracting for the user in the context of driving. This review considers the chemistry, synthesis, analysis, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and documented effects of MDMA on cognitive and psychomotor skills important to driving. Laboratory studies show that users do experience cognitive impairments, and may also act more impulsively while under the influence of the drug's sympathomimetic effects. Psychomotor impairment may occur with elevated doses or after repeated administration, and residual psychomotor impairment during the \"coming-down\" phase may be compounded by fatigue, dehydration, combined drug use, or other confounding factors. There is growing anecdotal information providing evidence of MDMA-impaired driving, and it is evident that many users recognize and attempt to mitigate the effects by delaying driving until the acute affects have dissipated. The drug inevitably may affect a subject's judgment and ability to properly assess their fitness to drive also. Blood concentrations in MDMA-impaired drivers suggest that this impairment can be caused by normal patterns of recreational use, and MDMA use should be considered inconsistent with safe driving immediately following ingestion, and for up to a day or longer following use.",

Evidence suggests that these comorbidities may be explained by a limited capacity of individuals to exert cognitive control on thoughts, emotions, or behaviors. A decrease of this capacity of control could contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain and its associated symptoms. Benefits of the cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of chronic pain may be explained by learning efficient and less costly pain coping strategies in terms of cognitive control capacity.",

With some drug like cocaine, stroke appear to be the result of a direct effect. In young subjects without other risk factors provide persuasive evidence for causality . OPIATES: Heroine is the most abused opiate drug, which is administered by injection, by snorting or by smoking. Stroke affects heroin users by diverse mechanisms,. Injectors are at risk of infections endocarditis, which carries risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage usually occurs after rupture of a septic (mycotic) aneurysm. Heroine users can are also at risk for hemorrhagic stroke secondary to liver failure with deranged clotting and to heroin nephropathy with uremia or malignant hypertension. In some heroin users the drug it self is directly causal due to vasculitis, hypersensitivity and immunologic changes. Embolization of foreign material to brain due to mixed of heroine with quinine can cause cerebral embolism. AMPHETAMINE AND other psychostimulants: In abuser of amphetamine hemorrhagic stroke can occur, oral, intravenous, nasal, and inhalational routes of administration have been reported. Most were chronic user, but in several patients, stroke followed a first exposure. Some of amphetamine induced intracranial hemorrhages are secondary to acute hypertension, some to cerebral vacuities, and some to a combination of two. Decongestants and diet pills: Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), an amphetamine – like drug, in decongestants and diet pills, induce acute hypertension, sever headache, psychiatric symptoms, seizures and hemorrhagic stroke. Ephedrine and pseudo ephedrine are present in decongestants and bronchodilators and induce headache, tachyarrhythmia, hypertensive emergency, and hemorrhagic and occlusive stroke. Ecstasy, 3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamin (MDMA) with amphetamine like can induce ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Crack cocaine: medical complication of crack cocaine is stroke. Parenteral cocaine users are at risk of stroke related to infectious endocarditis and also experience stroke caused directly by the drug itself.",

During the last decade a chain of research has led to a new insight into the causes and potential alleviation of alcohol craving: Recent discoveries indicate that the brain has receptor sites for naturally occurring opiate-like substances (endorphins and enkephalins) which are produced by the nervous system. Opiates such as morphine or heroin, and some of the metabolic products of alcohol (tetrahydroiso-quinolines), can also attach themselves to these receptors. It has been further discovered that the craving for alcohol is related to a deficiency of the naturally occurring opiate-like substances as well as other neurotransmitter substances. This deficiency can occur genetically or as a result of prolonged stress or long-term heavy drinking. The neurochemical imbalance may be treated chemically, leading to a possible alleviation of the craving for alcohol, especially in conjunction with psychotherapeutic and counseling regimens.",

Llegando a negativa para ingerir alimentos y permanencia en posición fija de sedestación, como elementos clave para la sospecha clínica y el diagnóstico oportuno. Descripción del caso: Masculino de 57 años, con historia de síntomas afectivos, quien ingreso a urgencias diagnosticado con episodio depresivo mayor de características catatónicas, el cual mejoró con el inicio de midazolam y luego titulación de Lorazepam. Pasadas cinco semanas de estancia hospitalaria fue dado de alta con antidepresivos y dosis estándar de benzodiazepinas, las cuales se retiraron ambulatoriamente, sin recurrencia de los síntomas durante un año de seguimiento. Conclusiones: Un episodio catatónico puede ser causado por trastornos afectivos. La catatonía secundaria a trastornos afectivos es rara en la práctica clínica, lo cual causa que pase inadvertida, por lo cual el conocimiento de esta alteración genera un manejo oportuno de pacientes reduciendo el gasto de los recursos del sistema de salud y mejorando la calidad de vida de la persona. En el presente caso clínico resaltamos la importancia de la cianocobalamina en la evaluación de los pacientes con síntomas catatónicos.",

      "abstract": "Given data showing that cannabis (herbal drug from the Cannabis sativa plant) can impair cognition in healthy subjects, the possibility that it may also do so in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) should be cause for concern. Approximately 20% of people with MS inhale or ingest cannabis for a variety of symptoms, or as a lifestyle choice. In addition, pharmaceutically manufactured cannabis (in capsules or spray) is prescribed most often for pain and spasticity; however, there is a dearth of literature on the cognitive effects of cannabis. Furthermore, methodological limitations introduce a cautionary note when interpreting the data. The evidence, which must therefore be considered preliminary, suggests that smoked cannabis may further compromise information processing speed and memory, with magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) demonstrating more inefficient patterns of cerebral activation during task performance. The findings related to pharmaceutically manufactured cannabis are equivocal. There is a pressing need for further research to inform clinical opinion, which at present reflects a combination of uncertainty and dogma.",

      "abstract": "espanolEn la actualidad, la alucinosis y la celotipia, antes consideradas entidades propias, se recogen en las clasificaciones diagnosticas mas reconocidas dentro de la categoria de trastornos psicoticos inducidos por el alcohol (con predominio de alucinaciones o de delirios). La alucinosis es una forma infrecuente de psicosis organica subaguda que sigue al alcoholismo cronico. Consiste en alucinaciones auditivas con un nivel de conciencia normal, y generalmente tiene buen pronostico con el tratamiento adecuado. Es primordial diferenciarlo del delirium tremens y otros cuadros psicoticos mas graves. En la celotipia el sujeto sufre delirio de celos, siendo fundamental determinar el riesgo de agresividad hacia la pareja y poder actuar consecuentemente. Los diferentes estudios de comorbilidad realizados senalan la alta probabilidad de que un alcoholico padezca a lo largo de su vida algun tipo de trastorno mental. Se revisan aqui las distintas posibilidades de relacion entre los trastornos comorbidos y el trastorno por uso del alcohol, la prevalencia de las distintas patologias coexistentes posibles, asi como la importancia, impacto y consecuencias de la patologia dual en estos pacientes. EnglishNowadays, alcoholic hallucinosis and jealousy delusion, not so long ago considered as independent entities, are now dealt with, in the majority of the most acknowledged diagnostic classifications, in the category of alcohol missuse induced psychotic disorders (with a prevailing presence of hallucinations or delusion). On the one hand, hallucinosis is an infrequent type of subacute organic psychosis following chronic or ingrained alcoholism, consisting of auditory hallucinations while in normal levels of consciousness. It generally has a good prognosis with the appropiate treatment. It is absolutely essential to distinguish and differenciate this disorder from delirium tremens and others with a more serious prognosis, and also another psychotic episodes. On the other hand, in jealousy delusion the patient experiences or suffers from episodes of pathological and irrational jealousy – being fundamental to establish potential risks of physical agressive behaviour towards his or her couple in order to be able to cope and act in accordance -. Surveys on the issue of comorbidity show that there is a high degree of probability for an alcoholic to suffer from some type of mental disorder in lifetime. Finally, this paper aims to review the different possibilities of interrelation between comorbid disorders and alcohol dependence; the prevailing importance of the different coexisting pathologies that may be possible; and also the importance, impact and consequences of the dual pathology in these patients.",

      "abstract": "The negative symptoms of schizophrenia comprise a range of deficits in communication, emotional responsiveness, socialisation, capacity for experiencing pleasure, and motivation. Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

My disabilities after the strokes lay not only in the mechanical execution of commands and the ability of contraction of muscles, but also in mental processes like perception, attention, memory, and thought. These impediments have meant drastic changes in my living conditions and social status. My disability was multifaceted and involved my whole person. Its expression was somatic, psychic, and behavioural. I suffered from loss of appetite, disturbance of sleep, psychic anxiety, depression, anguish, aggressive reactions, communication difficulties, disorganization of conduct, and so on. My personality no longer matched up to my own expectations. I was trapped in a situation of impossibility of living, despair, and hopelessness.

      "title": "Cannabidiol Effects on Post‐Seizure Neurogenesis",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a complex disorder characterized by a propensity to generate repetitive seizures with molecular and cognitive consequences. Many pharmacological treatments for epilepsy target neurotransmitters or ion channels, leaving nearly 30% of patients resistant to current medications. The recent approval of cannabidiol (CBD), a non‐psychotropic component of Cannabis sativa , has demonstrated the ability to lessen seizure severity and curb neuroinflammation in experimentally induced seizures in animal models. While CBD has been shown to effect multiple pathways and targets, its complete mechanism of action is still not understood. Current models of induced seizures mostly utilize treatments before or during epileptic events, though this practice does not normally occur in the clinic. Here we utilize a more translational model where CBD treatment is administered after the first seizure event. An inciting seizure increases the likelihood of secondary seizures due to epileptogenesis, where seizure susceptibility is increased due to molecular and structural changes within the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma. The epileptogenic process includes changes in axonal sprouting, cell death, neurotransmitter release, and in the hippocampus aberrant granule neural network reorganization and neurogenesis. Microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, are involved in hippocampal neurogenesis, controlling apoptosis of the newborn neurons and ultimately the numbers of granule cells. The objective of this study is to investigate whether CBD modulates microglial involvement in neurogenesis post seizure. Methods Following seizure induction in 8–10 week old mice, mice are given BrdU for 7 days post seizure to monitor cell proliferation and survival. Newly generated neurons are assessed using NeuN and DCX, to identify differentiated neuroblasts and mature neurons, respectively. BrdU+ cells are used for quantification and assessment of differentiation and survival of new cells in the dentate gyrus. Neural stem cell (NSC) levels in the hippocampus are also compared using SOX2/GFAP co‐staining. Results Our data suggest that CBD affects the number of new neurons after seizure. Mechanisms contributing to neurogenesis will be explored. Conclusions CBD contributes to microglia‐mediated changes in the numbers of granule cells and neurogenesis in a model of epilepsy.

[2]Also, types of abuse are related to specific psychiatric comorbidity.Sexual abuse is more associated with posttraumatic stress disorder than other kinds of abuse. [3,4]otional intelligence is the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning, problem-solving, and enhancing cognitive activities.Emotional intelligence is comprised of four skills: emotion regulation, emotion recognition in self and others (e.g.reading mind and alexithymia), understanding of emotion, and utilization of emotion to facilitate thinking. [5]Evidence in studies suggests that traumatic experience can rapidly alter brain activation associated with emotional intelligence such as emotion processing. [6]Children with early-life trauma exposure show altered connectivity in brain systems relevant for detecting and processing emotional information and early-life adversity is associated with reorganization of neural circuits in ways that enhance processing of salient emotional stimuli.Altered processing of emotional Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effects of child sexual abuse on emotional intelligence in children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Also, there is no study assessing the effects of incest on emotional intelligence in children with PTSD after sexual abuse.The current study aimed to assess the effects of incest on emotional intelligence.Methods: This study included 30 female children with sexual abuse, 20 female traffic accident victims with PTSD, and 25 female healthy volunteers as controls.All participants in the study were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the reading mind from eyes test (RMET) for children.Results: It was found that the TAS-20 total score was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls.Difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales scores were higher in the incest group.When the groups were compared regarding total DERS scores, it was found that it was found that the DERS total scale was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls while no difference was detected between the CSA victims without incest and the incest group.RMET score was significantly lower in the incest group than in the CSA victims without incest.Conclusion: Sexual abuse disrupts emotional processing in female children.It is important to consider the clinical features of emotion processing that could contribute to PTSD treatment in children with sexual abuse.",

      "title": "A Review of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol is often undiagnosed and untreated. Physicians are often unaware or have negative attitudes regarding these patients, such as the perception that treatment is ineffective. Addiction--psychological dependence with or without tolerance and withdrawal--is essentially compulsive uncontrolled substance use despite physical, psychological, or social consequences. We now have an understanding of the 2 major neurological pathways involved in addiction. First, the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is essential for survival, can be physically altered by drug abuse to result in uncontrolled cravings. Second, the decision-making prefrontal cortex, which suppresses inappropriate reward response, can also be altered by drug abuse. Thus, accelerated \"go\" signals and impaired \"stop\" signals result in uncontrolled use despite severe consequences. Further, addicts can be predisposed to addiction by genetic defects in reward pathway neurotransmission and stress-related developmental brain abnormalities. Relapse to drug use can occur because of stress or cue-related reward pathway stimulation or even by a single drug dose. Individualized treatment of addiction, including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions, can be as successful as treatment of other chronic diseases. Several pharmaceuticals are available or under study for these disorders. Waiting for the addict to \"be ready\" for treatment can be dangerous and detoxification alone is often ineffective. The physician's role in treating addiction includes prevention, diagnosis, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, referral, and follow-up care. An understanding of the biological reality of addiction allows physicians to understand addicts as having a brain disease. Further, the reality of effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for addiction allows physicians to be more optimistic in treating addicts. The challenge to the physician is to embrace the reality of addictive disease and fulfill his or her role in its treatment.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "The term stands for suicides committed by using more than one method. A distinction can be made between planned and unplanned complex suicides (primary/secondary combinations). In planned complex suicides 2 or more methods are applied simultaneously in order to make sure that death will occur even if one method fails. In unplanned complex suicides the mode of performance is changed after the first method chosen failed or was working too slow or proved to be too painful. In planned complex suicides typically two of the generally common methods of suicide (e.g. ingestion of medicines, hanging, use of firearms, drowning, fall from a height) are combined. But also unusual combinations have been described such as the simultaneous firing of two guns, self-immolation in combination with other suicide methods or shooting oneself while driving a car. In unplanned complex suicides self-inflicted injuries by sharp force, especially cuts of the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases the suicide switches from cuts to stabs (mostly to the heart region). Other methods often used after the first phase of suicide are hanging and jump from a height. In the literature the use of up to 5 suicidal methods applied one after the other have been described.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Substance use disorders commonly co-occur with psychiatric disorders. Recognition of psychiatric symptoms, especially suicidal ideation, is essential. Factors such as substance use or withdrawal, related psychosocial stressors, and co-occurring somatic health problems complicate the diagnostic process. Addressing psychiatric symptoms is essential to optimizing treatment of substance use disorders. Medications can help but may be unnecessary once substance use is stabilized. Other approaches include counseling, psychotherapy, case coordination, and inpatient or residential care. There are additional issues that arise with specific psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders (depression and bipolar), anxiety and trauma-related disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), psychotic disorders, personality disorders, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

Though tinnitus is subjective, for clinical purposes it is subdivided into subjective and objective tinnitus, the latter describing those few incidents in which the sound is detected or potentially detectable by another observer. Tinnitus is a manifestation of malfunction in the processing of auditory signals involving both perceptual and psychological components and should as such be differentiated from auditory hallucinations, which are generally considered to be a symptom of psychiatric or neurological disorders.\n\nThe characteristics used to classify tinnitus depend on the purpose of the classification (box).1 Furthermore, distinctions should be made between acute and chronic tinnitus and between chronic tinnitus occurring after an acute tinnitus and chronic tinnitus of insidious onset.2 Tinnitus is considered to be chronic when is has been present for more than three months without signs of spontaneously resolving.\n\n### Box 1—Classification of tinnitus\n\nMost people experience tinnitus occasionally, and most experience it in silent soundproofed rooms. The British national study of hearing found that 10% of adults had prolonged spontaneous tinnitus—that is, tinnitus “usually lasting for longer than 5 minutes”; 1% experienced severe annoyance due to tinnitus, and in 0.5% of adults tinnitus severely reduced the ability to lead a normal life. The same study ascertained that 7% of the population in the United Kingdom present to their general practitioners with tinnitus and 2.4% are referred to hospitals.3 A largescale Swedish study4 reported somewhat higher figures: for 2.4% of adults “tinnitus plagues me all day,” and 14.2% suffered …",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "Lifestyle medicine for depression",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of depression appears to have increased over the past three decades. While this may be an artefact of diagnostic practices, it is likely that there are factors about modernity that are contributing to this rise. There is now compelling evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these factors can potentially be modified, yet they receive little consideration in the contemporary treatment of depression, where medication and psychological intervention remain the first line treatments. “Lifestyle Medicine” provides a nexus between public health promotion and clinical treatments, involving the application of environmental, behavioural, and psychological principles to enhance physical and mental wellbeing. This may also provide opportunities for general health promotion and potential prevention of depression. In this paper we provide a narrative discussion of the major components of Lifestyle Medicine, consisting of the evidence-based adoption of physical activity or exercise, dietary modification, adequate relaxation/sleep and social interaction, use of mindfulness-based meditation techniques, and the reduction of recreational substances such as nicotine, drugs, and alcohol. We also discuss other potential lifestyle factors that have a more nascent evidence base, such as environmental issues (e.g. urbanisation, and exposure to air, water, noise, and chemical pollution), and the increasing human interface with technology. Clinical considerations are also outlined. While data supports that some of these individual elements are modifiers of overall mental health, and in many cases depression, rigorous research needs to address the long-term application of Lifestyle Medicine for depression prevention and management. Critically, studies exploring lifestyle modification involving multiple lifestyle elements are needed. While the judicious use of medication and psychological techniques are still advocated, due to the complexity of human illness/wellbeing, the emerging evidence encourages a more integrative approach for depression, and an acknowledgment that lifestyle modification should be a routine part of treatment and preventative efforts.",

Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident).

A major difficulty in appraising the adverse health effects of chronic cannabis use is a dearth of good epidemiological evidence on the long-term health consequences of cannabis use. Cannabis exerts its most prominent effects on the central nervous system where it acts on an endogenous cannabinoid system that is involved in regulating mood, emotion, memory, attention, and other cognitive functions. The findings from both human and animal research suggest that prolonged use of cannabis alters the functioning of the brain's cannabinoid system but that this does not translate to serious impairment. The most consistent physiological effect of cannabis in humans and animals is to increase heart rate. This change parallels the experienced \"high\" and is related to amount of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the blood.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "title": "1699 – Long lasting personality changes after the onset of dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Across various cultures, dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage (as detected by conventional structural brain imaging). In a substantial number of cases, the memory impairment follows a chronic course. Sometimes dissociative amnesia occurs on a background of a personality disorder (narcissistic or borderline). Other times, amnesia itself triggers long lasting personality changes. This work's objectives are establishing greater recognition among health care providers of the spectrum of the personality changes that may accompany chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. We review data from own patients with chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically, neuropsychologically and and neuroradiologically. Changes in personality dimensions occur after the onset of amnesia. These may involve affectivity, perception (e.g. impaired self face or face-emotion processing), cognition (e.g. social cognition) and behaviour (e.g. changing in eating, smoking, drinking or working habits). The observed personality changes may represent a consequence of amnesia. Functional imaging studies show metabolic changes in dissociative amnesia in brain areas involved in conscious mnemonic processing. Several structures engaged in processing within episodic-autobiographical memory system were also implicated in self and reward-related processing. Alternatively, the personality changes may be viewed as being pivotal in the development and maintenance of dissociative amnesia; this personality shift may subsequently lead to enduring changes in ways of cognitive processing, self-processing, perception and affect.",

The pathway to the diagnosis of alcoholism may be considerably compromised in the often comorbid or multimorbid patient. To live up to an advanced age seems to be a good argument against chronic substance abuse. Elderly people and their relatives are often still more reluctant to report about socially stigmatizing disorders. On top of that, the amount of social control is reduced after the end of employment and upon entering retirement. Yet, if alcohol-withdrawal symptoms occur, e.g., following an admission of the addicted patient to a hospital, the missed diagnosis of alcoholism means a delay of the correct interpretation of such complications and of the necessary treatment. Aged patients with reduced physical and mental reserve capacity are at special risk of developing further serious complications. Progressive, sometimes irreversible decay of the cognitive functions in long lasting delirious states or, as an aftermath of withdrawal, epileptic seizures are of particular importance.",

      "title": "The acute effects of cannabis on human executive function",
      "abstract": "Cannabis remains the most frequently used illicit drug worldwide. It produces a broad range of acute effects, such as euphoria, increased heart rate and perceptual alterations. Over the last few decades, a substantial number of experiments have been conducted to provide insight into the acute effects of cannabis on cognition. Here, we systematically review studies that investigated the impact of administration of cannabis or ∆ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, on human executive function, in particular, on the three principal domains of inhibition, working memory and reasoning/association. Our findings suggest that cannabis use results in acute impairment of inhibition, with the strongest effects after pulmonary administration of higher doses of ∆ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol. Results from neuroimaging studies indicate that these effects are predominantly modulated through neural processes in the inferior frontal gyrus. Working memory and reasoning/association are less clearly affected by cannabis administration, possibly because of compensational neural mechanisms to overcome the effects of cannabis intoxication on performance accuracy. Factors that may account for the variation in results are the extent to which a paradigm involves attentional processes, differences between studies in administration methods and variation in the patients’ history of cannabis use.",

In the course of a test program for medicinal therapy of this syndrome we studied the efficacy of a vincamine containing formulation (Pervincamin forte retard or Pervincamin ampoules, respectively) on the symptoms of a chronical brain disturbance. The study was randomised double-blind. We found that under the influence of the vincamine formulation the subjective symptoms, such as lack of interest, apathy, aggressiveness, raging, psychomotoric retardation, lack of concentration, dysmnesia, decreased with a statistical significance (p less than or equal to 0.05). Also the subjective symptoms, reported by the patients, such as tinnitus and vertigo decreased significantly under the treatment with the vincamine preparation. Therefore some of the parameters important for resocialisation and revitalisation of old patients could be influenced in a favourable way. Basing on the good results of our investigations, the treatment of psychiatric disturbances in old patients with vincamine containing drugs seems to be justified.",

An impressive aspect of this phenomenon is that, during the meditation, the intense emotional affect that would ordinarily accompany this ideation, e.g., when obtained by free association, seems to be markedly reduced or almost absent. During meditation, thoughts and ideas may appear that are ordinarily repressed, such as intense hostile-aggressive drives, murderous impulses, and, occasionally, libidinal ideation. Evaluation of electroencephalogram records in patients and subjects using the relaxation techniques reveals remarkable periods of intrahemispheric alpha and theta synchrony at times, even for inexperienced subjects. In a Transcendental Meditation meditator who has been meditating for more than 4 years, there occurs synchronous alpha activity upon closing the eyes, even before starting to meditate on the temporal, central, and occipital cortical areas.",

      "title": "Some Psychosomatic Aspects of Food Allergy",
      "abstract": "Summary Some patients experience untoward idiosyncratic reactions when they eat certain wholesome foods. Such illness may be caused by psychogenic or allergenic mechanisms, or by both. The relative importance of psychogenic and allergenic factors in the production and continuance of food-induced illness must be estimated correctly in order to plan a correct program of therapy. This paper reports some of my experiences with the treatment of about 600 patients (seen in the past ten years) who had certain food-induced syndromes, with or without associated primary neuropsychiatric disturbances. Foods become endowed with various dynamic emotional meanings according to the person's upbringing, cultural and religious training, and personal life experiences. Psychogenic food reactions may include anger, anxiety, anorexia, depression, euphoria, feelings of security, guilt, hostility, passive-dependent attitudes, pleasure, syncope, and relaxation. The most common untoward idiosyncratic psychosomatic reactions to food include nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort or pain, intestinal cramps, aerophagia, belching, and rarely diarrhea--all being part of the riddance reaction. The symbolic supportive values of certain foods are such that a person may overeat these foods when he is subjected to unusual emotional stresses. Such categories of foods include the \"security,\" \"reward,\" and \"pleasurable association\", foods. An individual may eat excessive amounts of these foods during times of emotional stress, even though they may be the very ones which produce his allergic illness. The fixed food allergy is very well known, but relatively uncommon. The variable food allergy is very common, but not very well known. In the variable food allergy, tolerance for a given food may vary so that at some times small amounts of the offending food will cause an allergic reaction. But at other times the amount of this food which must be ingested to cause an allergic reaction may be very much greater than any amount that the patient would ordinarily eat. Allergic reactions following the ingestion of offending foods have certain characteristics: there is a latent period between ingestion of the food and the appearance of signs and symptoms; the allergic syndrome has a certain pattern of development and regression of signs and symptoms; it has intensity and duration. These properties in part determine the nature of allergic reactions to repeated ingestion of subthreshold and threshold doses of offending foods. With brief postcibal allergic reactions, each ingestion of a threshold dose of offending food is followed by a discrete reaction. Usually there is no summation of subclinical effects produced by ingestion of repeated subthreshold doses. Repeated daily ingestion of threshold doses of foods which give prolonged postcibal allergic reactions will cause a clinical pattern of allergic reaction resulting from summation, fusion, and adaptation to each individual allergic insult, until finally many patients may develop a steady state of allergic reaction. The daily ingestion of subthreshold doses of such foods is capable of causing a clinically obvious allergic reaction through virtual summation of clinically inapparent allergic reactions caused by ingestion of each subthreshold dose. Each primary allergic reaction set off by ingestion of an unknown allergenic food actuates a secondary postnoxious pattern of behavior which becomes an important part of the patient's reaction to the offending food. But if a patient knows he is eating an allergenic food which will make him sick in a specific way, he does not develop the secondary postnoxious behavior pattern. Recurrent episodes of spontaneous food-induced allergic illness occurring at unpredictable intervals cause certain patterns of conditioned responses in humans. Not knowing when he will be well or sick acts as a frustrating cue, in response to which a patient develops the human counterpart of the non-problem-solving behavior described by Maier for frustrated rats. These secondary reaction patterns of behavior often become so prominent and extensive a part of the patient's complaints to the doctor that even an astute allergist at first glance may consider mistakenly that the patient's problems are purely psychiatric. But further careful clinical study of such a patient will show that he is experiencing a primary allergic reaction to an offending food, which in turn sets off a chain of behavior patterns which are the patient's unconscious response to his allergic illness. Sometimes the secondary behavior patterns engendered by intermittent allergic episodes may become so incapacitating to the patient that they constitute his chief health problem. The food-induced allergic mental, fatigue, and pain syndromes are described. These may occur singly or in any combination, and may be associated with any other allergic syndromes. The patient's response to combined allergic and psychological therapy is illustrated by three case reports. As a result of psychotherapy alone, a patient may unconsciously modify his diet so that he includes less of the security, reward, and pleasurable association foods. If he is also allergic to these foods, he will have a remission in his illness as an indirect consequence of psychotherapy. Many patients are relieved of allergic ill health when they abstain from known offending foods. However, some of these patients will have conscious or unconscious needs at certain times to eat allergenic foods which they know will make them sick. The subtle nature of food-induced self-injury readily escapes the attention of the patient's family and friends--and even, sometimes, of his unsuspecting physician. Self-inflicted, food-induced allergic illness can become a recurrent problem until the physician can understand the basic psychodynamics of such self-injurious behavior, and can then help the patient to make better adjustments to life problems. The best management of all patients with food allergies requires both expert allergic therapy and expert psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Cannabis and psychotic experiences",
      "abstract": "Hamilton 1 outlined the past three decades of research connecting cannabis use to schizophrenia. We add to this narrative by mentioning the value of examining the relation between cannabis use and subthreshold regions of the psychosis continuum. Psychotic experiences are manifestations of psychosis that resemble frank hallucinations and delusions found in psychotic disorders, but are generally less intense, impairing or persistent 2. In the United States, psychotic experiences are 10 times as prevalent as schizophrenia 3, and these experiences are not merely prodromal signs of psychotic disorder. Some individuals who have them will develop schizophrenia, but most will not 4, 5. Therefore, in recent years, researchers and clinicians have begun to grapple with what to make of these experiences. Studying cannabis use and psychotic experiences is useful, because it can help us make a stronger inference about causal direction. Hamilton points out that cannabis use can possibly be a form of self-medication to cope with prodromal symptoms of psychosis or the side effects of anti-psychotic medications. This is less of an issue when studying psychotic experiences, as they are often fleeting and do not necessarily cause significant distress or disruption in and of themselves; many people prove to be unfazed by psychotic experiences, depending on how the experiences are interpreted 6, and psychotic experiences typically do not warrant anti-psychotic medications. That said, cannabis use as a form self-medication is not entirely out of the question. While most people who report a psychotic experience will not develop schizophrenia, they are still at risk for non-psychotic psychiatric disorders 3, chronic health conditions 7, 8, suicidal behaviors 9 and perceived need for help 10, 11. In other words, psychotic experiences indicate the presence of a broad range of mental and physical health problems, and so it is certainly possible that cannabis can be used to self-medicate the underlying stress associated with these problems. Hamilton rightly points out that studying cannabis and psychosis is complicated because of the several confounding factors that interact over time 12. These confounding factors persist when studying psychotic experiences. For example, illicit drug and alcohol use have been associated with life-time psychotic experiences 3, obfuscating the unique correlation between cannabis and psychotic experiences. Social risk factors such as urbanicity 13, as well as childhood trauma and adversity 14, continue to confound any associations that emerge, and can even have interactive and synergistic relationships with cannabis use, resulting in heightened vulnerability to psychotic experiences. Unraveling the relation between cannabis and its potential role in the etiology of psychosis is imperative now more than ever as the prevalence of marijuana use grows in the United States 15. Studying psychotic experiences can not only help us understand psychosis, but can inform strategies to prevent a wider array of mental and physical health problems. None.

Tramadol has been most commonly found to be the causative factor, with only two cases where codeine was implicated. However, there is limited literature on opioid induced mania in patients with anxiety disorder. We present the case of a 54-year-old man with past history of alcohol and tobacco dependence syndrome. He consumed codeine containing cough syrup as a self-medication for panic disorder. Subsequently, he had a manic episode, although he had no past or family history of bipolar disorder. He was treated with olanzapine and withdrawal of codeine, which resulted in rapid improvement in manic symptoms. Understanding and differentiating substance-induced mood disorder from independent mood disorders is crucial. Similar to mood disorders, past history of anxiety disorders may also predict increased risk of opioid induced mania. Hence, past history of mood or anxiety disorders should be enquired before prescribing medications containing opioids and risk of self-medication with opioids should be explained to users.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in knowledge about cannabinoid receptor function have renewed interest in the association between cannabis and psychosis. Converging lines of evidence suggest that cannabinoids can produce a full range of transient schizophrenia-like positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Cannabinoids also produce some psychophysiological deficits also known to be present in schizophrenia. Also clear is that in individuals with an established psychotic disorder, cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness. Increasing evidence suggests that early and heavy cannabis exposure may increase the risk of developing a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. The relationship between cannabis exposure and schizophrenia fulfills some, but not all, of the usual criteria for causality. However, most people who use cannabis do not develop schizophrenia, and many people diagnosed with schizophrenia have never used cannabis. Therefore, it is likely that cannabis exposure is a “component cause” that interacts with other factors to “cause” schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, but is neither necessary nor sufficient to do so alone. In the absence of known causes of schizophrenia, however, and the implications for public health policy should such a link be established the role of component causes such as cannabinoid exposure should remain a focus of further study. Finally, further work is necessary to identify the factors that underlie individual vulnerability to cannabinoid-related psychosis and to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying this risk.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety pervades every aspect of human activity and experience. It is a normal state and a spur to action, but readily exceeds normal limits in intensity, duration and appropriateness to the stimulus or situation. Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

The panic attack is the most common complication. The link with psychosis is narrow that leads to increased prevention for vulnerable populations.

      "abstract": "IntroductionInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased prevalence of depression when compared to the general population. Studies have suggested that depression may be more pronounced in the early period of diagnosis, with the strongest association occurring within one year of diagnosis. It has also been documented that depression can amplify symptoms, decrease medication compliance, alter self-perception and worsen individuals' adaptation to their disease. It is recommended that all IBD patients be screened for depression. We present 2 cases of patients with IBD who were hospitalized with suicidal ideation at the time or shortly following their IBD diagnosis. These cases emphasize the need to screen for depression with assessment for severity.Case 1: A 45 year old man was hospitalized with depression and suicidal ideation with a plan. His psychiatric interview revealed that he was profoundly depressed as a result of ‘years' of chronic, frequent (50-60 times daily) diarrhea with blood, urgency, nocturnal awakening and fecal incontinence which had worsened in recent months. He had no history of depression or psychiatric disorders and a previous history of cocaine dependency was not thought to contribute to his depression. Gastroenterology consult was obtained and following an evaluation he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Treatment with 6-mercaptopurine, mesalamine, and tapering steroids (with discontinuation) resulted in clinical improvement of his gastrointestinal symptoms and resolution of his depression.Case 2: A 37 year old woman without significant past medical history transferred her care to our institution and presented to Gastroenterology clinic for a second opinion of rectal pain and bleeding following a hemorrrhoidectomy. Medical records revealed that she presented to an outside surgeon with complaints of hemorrhoids. Rectal fissures and a large hemorrhoid complex were noted and she underwent a fissurectomies and a hemorrhoidectomy which resulted in chronic fecal drainage and incontinence. A rectal exam under anesthesia revealed rectal ulcerations and a large nonhealing wound in the posterior midline which extended through her internal and part of her external sphincter. A colonoscopy revealed pancolitis with biopsies demonstrating chronic active colitis and noncaseating granulomas. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Two weeks following the diagnosis she was hospitalized with depression and suicidal ideation. Psychiatric interview revealed that her depression was related to her gastrointestinal symptoms and new Crohn's diagnosis. Improvement of her symptoms with oral and topical mesalamine, 6-mercaptopurine and tapering steroids has resulted in improvement of her depression. The psychiatrists did not believe that her steroid therapy precipitated or exacerbated her depression. She is not maintained on antidepressants.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

      "title": "Marihuana \"High\": A Model of Senile Dementia?",
      "abstract": "MARIHUANA \"HIGH\": A MODEL OF SENILE DEMENTIA? ADAM SULKOWSKI* The evidence for marihuana-induced brain atrophy [ 1] and \"amotivational syndrome\" [1,2] has not been convincing so far [3-8]. There are, however, some striking similarities between certain features of acute marihuana intoxication and the clinical syndromes of presenile and senile dementia (Alzheimer's disease). These similarities become puzzling and thought provoking when one compares the experimental psychological , neurophysiological, neuropathological, and pharmacological studies of these two, apparently so different, phenomena. Psychological studies of acute intoxication with marihuana of mild to moderate potency have shown no effects on sensory acuity and simple reaction time tests [9-11]. Psychogeriatric literature provides no evidence for motor and/or sensory deficits in early stages of Alzheimer's disease [12, 13]. Careful studies of attention, psychomotor speed, memory and learning in our laboratory [11, 14] have not shown marihuanainduced impairment except for the subjects' ability to use effectively already memorized task-relevant information. We called this deficit a failure in information processing. The same finding has been repeatedly described by many authors in the aged and demented populations [15, 16]. Another intriguing similarity is in self-evaluation regarding one's performance. Under the influence of marihuana—and in contrast to alcohol effects—people tend to perceive their performance as much worse than it is in reality (i.e., they overestimate impairment) and as the result they exercise considerable caution and restraint (Sulkowski, unpublished data). As a matter of fact, in real life, marihuana users are said to occasionally endanger safety by driving too slowly. One needs only to observe daily traffic to see how exasperatingly \"cautious\" elderly people can be. This age-related psychological characteristic has been dealt with extensively by psychologists of old age [17-19].»Bedford VA Medical Center GRECC, 200 Springs Road, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730 and Boston University School of Medicine.© 1980 by The University of Chicago. 0031-5982/80/2302-0139$01.00 Perspectives in Biology andMedicine · Winter 1980 \\ 209 A unique and reliable effect ofmarihuana is alteration in time perception which has been seen especially clearly in \"time production\" paradigm (e.g., a subject is asked to signal the limits of a 10-second interval of time) [14, 20, 21]. It has been speculated that the drug alters our internal psychological clock. Identical defects in this hypothetical clock have been described in the elderly and have been considered responsible for decrements on many behavioral tests [22, 23]. Some experts contend that the left (dominant) hemisphere functions are more affected by marihuana than the right (nondominant) hemisphere functions [24, 25]. This reportedly results in disinhibition of the right hemisphere and leads to an altered state of consciousness. Recently published neurological theories postulate that this interhemispheric imbalance is responsible for clinical symptoms of dementia [26]. Rigorous tests of these theories are difficult to design [27] and supportive experimental data are very scant. On the psychosocial (interpersonal) level marihuana produces a quiet detached withdrawal from social environment which might be an analogue of so-called gradual social disengagement typical of very old and demented individuals [28]. It is possible that the failure to actively process information when \"high\" reinforces marihuana use through the mechanism of negative reinforcement by protecting the user from stressful cognitive overload with multiple and contradictory messages typical of modern society. Neurophysiological data from EEG studies of marihuana's acute effects show nonspecific and generalized slowing of alpha rhythm and slight to moderate increase in amplitude [29, 30]. These also happen to be the most common findings in very old subjects and patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease [31, 32]. Psychophysiological theorists ofaging have provided some experimental data to support their theory of autonomic nervous system overarousal in the aged and demented [33, 34]. This hyperarousal has been held responsible for interoceptive sensory overload which in turn interfered with CNS adaptive functions. Powerful sympathetic activation is a characteristic and dose-related effect of marihuana. Difficulties with theoretical interpretation notwithstanding, the decrease in cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease has been well documented. Again, there are some preliminary data (L. Miller, personal communication) suggestive of diminished blood supply to the brain in intoxicated marihuana smokers. Pharmacologic studies seem to indicate...",

They also are used to control anxiety and agitation whenever minor tranquilizers (eg, benzodiazepines) would be inappropriate. Development of akathisia as a parkinsonian side effect is confirmed in the use of these drugs. Akathisia is a condition that gives rise to the subjective desire to be in constant motion, with a feeling of inner agitation and muscle tension. The patient cannot sit still and paces constantly.<sup>1</sup> To my knowledge, however, the literature does not contain reports that the development of akathisia can precipitate violence, resulting in the behavior the drug was meant to alleviate. <h3>Report of a Case</h3> A 29-year-old man had a diagnosis of sociopathic personality and transvestism and a long history of drug abuse, including amphetamines, marijuana, alcohol, LSD, mescaline, benzodiazepines, and narcotics.

Dushivisha is any low potency toxic substance which vitiates the Dhatus when favorable condition occurs. It produces different symptoms in different people according to their age, habits and place of residence. In the Ayurveda context the poison has been divided into sub types and there is no separate classification of Dushivisha, But Ayurveda defines it as Sthavara, Jangama or Kritimavisha after its treatment, when it becomes less potent its effects are doesn’t nullifies radically because of which it resides in the body, that particular less potent part of above said poison is called Dushivisha. Dushivisha produces sense of intoxication after meals, indigestion, anorexia, eruption of circular patches on the skin, urticaria, mental confusion, Dhatukashya, oedema on the face and extremities, ascites, vomiting, diarrhoea, discolouration, fainting, intermittent high grade fever and unquenched able thirst. Some poisons produce insanity, abdominal distension, Shukra Kshaya, muffled voice while other causes Kustha and respective disorders of various type.

It contains toxic alkaloids, the principal alkaloid being Nicotine present in one to eight percent. Tobacco is the highly consumed psychotropic drug worldwide. Tobacco can be consumed in various forms that is- sniffing, chewing, smoking or dipping. It is more addictive than cocaine and heroin and acts as a mood leveler, resulting in emotional dependence. Tobacco poisoning can occur by absorption either through intact or broken skin,by inhalation or ingestion. Nicotine first stimulates, then depresses, and later paralyses autonomic ganglia, brain and skeletal muscles. According to Ayurveda the properties of tobacco are similar to poison. The adverse effects or overdosing effects are noted as- Bhramaka (Induces vertigo), Madakarit (narcotic), Drishtimandyatwa (blindness). The Circumstances of tobacco poisoning mainly occurs through accidental poisoning while suicidal and homicidal poisoning is rare. Tobacco consumption gradually blocks economic, personal and social development. In order to quit this habit it is recommended to gradually reduce tobacco use instead of abruptly stopping. An organized plan for de-addiction includes three phases Assessment, Intervention and Follow up. It is the duty of every Physician, National authorities and a Responsible citizen to create awareness about the destructive effects of tobacco consumption.",

MHs are characterized by perception of melodies, music, or songs. AHs/MHs can be associated with hypoacusis, psychiatric or neurological diseases, intoxication and adverse reactions of different medications (e.g., propranolol, amantadine, voriconazole).The authors present a case of a 77-year-old male with advanced heart failure, recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillations and moderate hypoacusis, who mistakenly overdosed oral amiodarone (6 pills 200 mg each daily within 3 days). After administration of 12 pills during 2 days, he started hearing music and songs not heard by others. One day later, when the number of ingested pills increased to 18, he decided to discontinue amiodarone and consulted a cardiologist; no signs of physical, ECG or laboratory deterioration were observed. MHs disappeared next day and returned only as a single episode when he tried to restart amiodarone at a dose of 1 pill daily 2 weeks later. Finally, following complete removal of the medication, he experienced no MHs whatsoever. Amiodarone is known to seldom cause neurological or mental complications; however, MHs after the drug have never been reported so far.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Background : Sedative drugs are important in many ways in medicolegal practice. They are used to subdue or alter the mind of a victim and also such drugs themselves can cause death. These drugs are used in robberies as well as in murder cases. Case Report: Two averagely built healthy parents were found dead on bed with deep cut injuries to neck, with minimal evidence of volitional activities and defense injuries. An involvement of a poison was suspected. The elder daughter had felt a bitter taste of the dinner and kept it in the refrigerator at that night. The dinner was sent for toxicological investigations. Causes of deaths were cut injuries to neck. At the same time, the investigators found out that the younger daughter had mixed diazepam to dinner and her boyfriend and 4 others killed the parents. A film they had watched had influenced them to initiate this incident. Conclusion: Two well-built conscious adult victims in sober state should have received at least few defense injuries or leave evidence of volitional activities. In such circumstances, intoxication with drugs or incapacitated with other means should be considered by the forensic pathologist.",

They encompass many drugs, some of which are highly susceptible to abuse and others which are rarely associated with excess usage. A straightforward definition of a \"stimulant\" is \"a drug which stimulates some bodily function.\" Cocaine and amphetamine addicts often consume 10 to 50 times as much drug as would be indicated for novice. Also, for both agents there are no prominent physical withdrawal symptoms, except for depression. Almost all addicts become psychotic on one or more occasions. The psychosis is very similar for amphetamine and cocaine and difficult to distinguish from paranoid schizophrenia. A differential neurochemical mediation of euphoria and the psychotic effects of amphetamine and cocaine is hinted at by differences in the clinical features of the two phenomena. Low doses of amphetamine produce moderate euphoria and increased alertness in adults.",

It has anxiolytic and sedative properties, but in some individuals, it can precipitate panic. There is an association between cannabis consumption and depression, but cohort studies suggest the association is mostly reverse causality. Cannabis can produce psychotic phenomena, notably in individuals with psychosis proneness. It appears to ‘bring forward’ the onset of schizophrenia, and it may act as a cumulative causal factor for schizophrenia. Acute cognitive effects of cannabis are well described, as is an amotivational syndrome with heavy prolonged use. Some evidence suggests enduring neurocognitive effects in heavy users. There is particular concern regarding use of high-potency cannabis in youth, as it appears that its effects on cognition and its potential contribution to depressive and psychotic disorders are particularly marked during this developmental phase.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

      "title": "CHRONIC HYPERCALCEMIA AS A REVERSIBLE CAUSE OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT: IMPROVEMENT AFTER A SINGLE ADMINISTRATION OF PAMIDRONATE",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Persistent elevations in serum calcium levels secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism cause neuropsychiatric symptoms, including confusion, alterations in mental status, delirium, and dementia.1–3 In fact, hypercalcemia has been considered a reversible cause of dementia2 that can be corrected after parathyroidectomy.1 Although recent reports support the medical approach toward primary hyperparathyroidism as an alternative to surgery,4 there are no reports that demonstrate cognitive improvement after medical correction of this disorder. The case of a 79-year-old woman with known primary hyperparathyroidism (adjusted serum calcium levels of 2.80–2.87 mmol/L for at least 3 years) who presented with a 6-month history of progressive cognitive impairment, self-isolation, confusion, and generalized functional deterioration, including severe limitations in performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) is reported. Upon admission, the patient was found to be anxious and disoriented as to time and space; no focal neurological deficits were found. Her general physical examination was otherwise normal. Chronic hypercalcemia was considered to be the likely cause of her clinical findings. The patient was prescribed 60 mg intravenous pamidronate to be administered monthly. No other medications that might have modified her cognitive status were administered. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clock-Drawing Test (CDT) (Figure 1) were administered 1 day before and 7 days after the initial pamidronate dose. Furthermore, occupational therapy conducted a global functional assessment using the global Structured Assessment of Independent Living Skills, a standardized assessment of functional motor, cognitive, instrumental, and social performance.5 Free-drawn clocks before and 7 days after administration of 60 mg of intravenous pamidronate. The clock drawings were assessed using the 10-point score,5 which was found to be 2 points before and 8 points after treatment. Serum calcium levels declined to within normal limits (2.80 mmol/L at baseline, 2.69 mmol/L immediately after pamidronate administration, 2.46 mmol/L 3 days after pamidronate administration). The only adverse effect of the treatment was paresthesias in the fingers and toes, likely due to the relatively low serum calcium levels after a prolonged period of elevated serum calcium. MMSE score improved from 15 out of 30 before to 23 out of 30 1 week after pamidronate administration, and CDT was substantially improved, as measured using the 10 o'clock draw analysis6 (Figure 1). In addition, the patient's functional status (IADL) as determined by her performance on the Structured Assessment of Independent Living Skills, showed improvement from 44 to 125 points (possible score 0–145). In summary, correction of elevated serum calcium levels with one dose of intravenous pamidronate led to immediate improvement in MMSE, CDT, and functional capacity in a 79-year-old woman with long-standing primary hyperparathyroidism. In some cases, dementia can be reversible, and blood tests could be indicated to detect potential reversible causes. Because primary hyperparathyroidism is not an uncommon disease in older people, calcium levels should be tested in patients with cognitive impairment. In conclusion, this case supports the notion that, in some cases, reversibility of dementia is possible with subsequent gain in the patient's independence and function.

      "abstract": "Depressive Storungen konnen neben den Erstrangsymptomen „depressive Stimmung“, „Verlust von Interesse oder Freude“ und „erhohte Ermudbarkeit“ mit einer grosen Anzahl an weiteren Symptomen einhergehen. Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

      "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to describe the different neuropsychological deficits associated to the consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'), as well as the growing evidence that attributes these deficits to the selective axonal damage to serotoninergic cells brought about by this substance.MDMA is an amphetamine derivative that, like its precursor, has properties as a stimulant. Part of its chemical structure is similar to that of the hallucinogen mescaline with which it shares the capacity to alter perception. Nevertheless, the primary pharmacological effect of this substance, which is what usually leads to its use and abuse, is chiefly linked to an intense positive emotional state. This effect on the individual's mood is also usually accompanied by numerous feelings of empathy, sociability and closeness, which turn this drug into a powerful entactogenic agent (a term used in psychotherapy to describe a state of wellbeing, closeness and emotional self-awareness produced by certain compounds). The antidepressant and entactogenic effects induced by an acute dose of MDMA can be accounted for by the notable increase in serotonin bioavailability triggered by the drug. Repeated consumption of MDMA, however, ends up affecting many functions that have been related to the serotoninergic systems, such as sleep, appetite, attention and memory, or one's emotional state.Most of the neuropsychological disorders found in individuals who take ecstasy on a regular basis can be explained by the selective neurodegeneration processes that the drug appears to produce in the serotonin terminals of the brain in the long run.",

What has been learned about the role of electrolytes in heart disease, and more recently in surgery, now sheds valuable light on this problem. In brief, every patient who undergoes major surgery experiences an electrolyte disturbance that may cause a psychotic or delirious reaction. Whether it does or not will depend on three factors: (1) the severity of the disturbance; (2) the treatment provided to control it, and (3) the presence of other factors which contribute to clouding of consciousness, such as sedation, hypoxia, fever, toxins, and circulatory collapse or impairment.

Her postconcussive symptoms are affecting her school performance and social and family life. Clinical Outcomes Assessment: Concussion is typically evaluated via symptoms, cognition, and balance. There is no specific patient-oriented outcomes measure for concussion. Clinicians can choose from a variety of generic and specific outcomes instruments aimed at assessing general health-related quality of life or various concussion symptoms and comorbidities such as headache, migraine, fatigue, mood disturbances, depression, anxiety, and concussion-related symptoms. Clinical Decision Making: The data obtained from patient self-report instruments may not actively help clinicians make return-to-play decisions; however, these scales may be useful in providing information that may help the athlete return to school, work, and social activities. The instruments may also serve to identify issues that may lead to problems down the road, including depression or anxiety, or serve to further explore the nature of an athlete’s symptoms. Clinical Bottom Line: Concussion results in numerous symptoms that have the potential to linger and has been associated with depression and anxiety. The use of outcomes scales to assess health-related quality of life and the effect of other symptoms that present with a concussion may allow clinicians to better evaluate the effects of concussion on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, school, and family issues, leading to better and more complete management.",

      "title": "Chronic Caffeine Consumption Prevents Memory Disturbance in Different Animal Models of Memory Decline",
      "abstract": "Caffeine, the most widely consumed psychoactive drug, enhances attention/vigilance, stabilizes mood, and might also independently enhance cognitive performance. Notably, caffeine displays clearer and more robust beneficial effects on memory performance when memory is perturbed by stressful or noxious stimuli either in human or animal studies. Thus, caffeine restores memory performance in sleep-deprived or aged human individuals, a finding replicated in rodent animal models. Likewise, in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), caffeine alleviates memory dysfunction, which is in accordance with the tentative inverse correlation between caffeine intake and the incidence of AD in different (but not all) cohorts. Caffeine also affords beneficial effects in animal models of conditions expected to impair memory performance such as Parkinson's disease, chronic stress, type 2 diabetes, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, early life convulsions, or alcohol-induced amnesia. Thus, caffeine should not be viewed as a cognitive enhancer but instead as a cognitive normalizer. Interestingly, these beneficial effects of caffeine on stress-induced memory disturbance are mimicked by antagonists of adenosine A2A receptors. This prominent role of A2A receptors in preventing memory deterioration is probably related to the synaptic localization of this receptor in limbic areas and its ability to control glutamatergic transmission, especially NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity, and to control apoptosis, brain metabolism, and the burden of neuroinflammation. This opens the real and exciting possibility that caffeine consumption might be a prophylactic strategy and A2A receptor antagonists may be a novel therapeutic option to manage memory dysfunction both in AD and in other chronic neurodegenerative disorders where memory deficits occur.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Inappropriate use of benzodiazepines is an important public health problem. In clinical practice benzodiazepine misuse is generally encountered in one of the three following situations: as part of a complex presentation of polysubstance dependence, in patients who have been prescribed therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and have difficulty stopping use, and rarely, dependence on benzodiazepines as the primary drug of abuse. Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300). Misuse is used to describe patients who use higher than prescribed doses, or obtain medications from a friend or relative for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "Summary Twelve psychotic reactions are reported in 11 patients with various somatic illnesses treated with ACTH and/or cortisone. Two major patterns occurred: (a) A primarily affective disorder, either manic or depressive; and, more frequently, (b) an organic reaction (toxic psychosis) with associated paranoid-hallucinatory and/or affective (usually depressive) components. No consistent correlation could be obtained with regard to drug dosage and onset, duration, or type of psychosis. Suicidal tendencies were present in several cases. After the ACTH or cortisone was discontinued, termination of the psychosis occurred spontaneously in the organic reactions. The affective disorders required electroconvulsive therapy. A comparison is made between these states and psychoses appearing in naturally occurring hyperadrenalism or Cushing's syndrome. The following factors involved in the production of these psychotic reactions are considered significant: The physiological effects of the hyperadrenal state on the central nervous system. The influence of the underlying disease process. The premorbid personality. Only in a few cases were recognizable psychotic trends present before treatment. It is felt that in most instances the previous personality pattern determined the psychological content of the psychosis, but not its onset. A complete understanding of the interrelationships of all of these physiological and psychological mechanisms is not possible at the present time.",

      "abstract": "The decrease in deaths from the inhalation of toxic fumes may be related to the gradual effect of legislation in some countries on the banning of toxic substances in furnishing items.The continued substantial death rate from carbon monoxide poisoning is disappointing but may be related to the fact that although smoke alarms are more readily found in dwellings, they are often non-functional.The decline in mortality from drug poisoning may be due both to more effective treatment and possibly to the more widespread use of less toxic antidepressant drugs. Accidental poisoningThis is usually a problem of the young child or toddler, with a mean age of presentation of 2.5 years.Accidental poisoning usually occurs when the child is unsupervised, and there is an increased incidence in poisoning following recent disruption in households, such as a new baby, moving house or where there is maternal depression. Intentional overdoseSuicide or parasuicide attempts are usually made by young people in their teens; however, sometimes they may be as young as 8 or 9 years old.These children or adolescents should undergo psychiatric and social assessment. Drug abuseAlcohol and solvent abuse are among the commonest forms of drug abuse in children. Iatrogenic drugsThe commonest offender is diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil).This combination is toxic to some children at therapeutic doses.The most frequently fatal drug is digoxin. Deliberate poisoningRarely, symptoms are induced in children by adults via the administration of drugs.A history of poisoning will often not be given at presentation. F.2 Primary assessment and resuscitation in poisoningz Respiratory rate: the rate may be increased in poisoning from amphetamines, ecstasy, salicylates, ethylene glycol and methanol z Acidotic sighing respirations: this may suggest metabolic acidosis from salicylates or ethylene glycol poisoning as a cause for the coma z Heart rate: tachycardia is caused by amphetamines, ecstasy, β-agonists, phenothiazines, theophylline and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); bradycardia is caused by β-blockers, digoxin and organophosphates z Blood pressure: hypotension is commonly seen in serious poisoning; hypertension is caused by ecstasy and monoamine oxidase inhibitors z If heart rate is above 200 beats/min in an infant or above 150 beats/min in a child, or if the rhythm is abnormal, perform cardiac monitoring.QRS prolongation and ventricular tachycardia are seen in TCA poisoning z Depression of conscious level suggests poisoning with opiates, sedatives (such as benzodiazepines), antihistamines and hypoglycaemic agents z Pupillary size and reaction should be noted.Very small pupils suggest opiate or organophosphate poisoning; large pupils suggest amphetamines, atropine and TCAs 10.",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

Alcohol dependence is the last of several stages which begin with drinking on \"social occasions\" during adolescence or even childhood, which may lead to certain people drinking excessively in certain social surroundings; this may easily become a habit if the subject moreover suffers from psychological problems inducing him to consume greater quantities more frequently to overcome inhibitions or to escape. This increased consumption leads in turn to psychological dependence, and toxicomania becomes apparent since if drinking is suddenly stopped, giving rise to neuro-vegetative disorders, these only disappear when further alcohol is consumed. This vicious circle is completed by psychological problems affecting personal relationships and professional activities. Thus for the alcoholic, for whom at the outset drinking was usually merely a social habit, the consumption of alcohol has become an escape from the reality of his situation, often drinking solely to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and therefore the appropriate therapy in these cases is detoxication.",

      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration. He is the youngest of 3 sibs emanating from nonconsanguenious monogamous family with no genetic load of neuropsychiatric disorders. Unremarkable developmental trajectories. Distinguished scholastic achievement. No history of smoking or illicit drug use. No medical comorbidities.

He was faring well following this accident, as reported by parents, apart from occasional complaints of low-grade headaches and giddiness. Lately, he started to voice out non-sensical talk that the man who hit him by the car is disguising and morphing in the bodies of neighbours, doorkeeper and servants, stalking him in order to kill him. He was panic-stricken by the idea. Fragmented sleep. Lost appetite. Dropped from school attainment.

      "abstract": "The title of this contribution involves two consecutive questions: have the effects of medication in autism indeed been disappointing? And if so, why? The answer to the first question depends on whether one focuses on the core social and communicative deficits of autism, or on various complicating behaviour problems. Attempts over the past decades to develop drugs that specifically improve social and communicative functioning have failed. Among the most ambitious attempts were medical interventions in the endogenous opioid system that were motivated from animal models on the involvement of this system in various aspects of social behaviour. By contrast, medications such as the newer antipsychotics, psychostimulants, presynaptic noradrenergic blocking agents (clonidine and guanfacine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were shown to reduce impairing complicating symptoms of affective instability, irritability, hyperactivity and inattentiveness, aggression, self-injury and stereotypies. The explanation for the medication-refractory status of social and communicative deficits should be sought in at least two related factors: (1) the as yet unidentified neurochemical basis of autism, and (2) the obvious lack of involvement of the main neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin) in the pathophysiology of social and communicative behaviour.",

RAPOPOPiT* and ALAN FISKEf Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disease in which thoughts and habits run wild. Obsessive thoughts such as unreasonable doubts (am I a bad person? did I lock the door? do I have AIDS? did I harm someone?) or compulsive habits (praying, repeating, ordering, checking, cleaning, or washing) consume hours of the patients' time [I]. Typically, sufferers are aware that these symptoms are \"crazy\" but cannot control them. The ritualistic nature of OCD symptoms is striking. Repetitive counting or washing is accompanied by a sense that these behaviors are necessary to ward off discomfort or danger. Some OCD patients have commented on the similarity between their new and peculiar thoughts and behaviors and religious rituals or magical practices of other cultures. If the epidemiological studies are correct, as many as 2 million people in the United States have this disorder [2]. Until recently, most sufferers kept their disorder secret because of the embarrassment over the bizarre and irrational nature of their thoughts and rituals. The public awareness of the probable neurological nature of the disorder and the availability of effective treatments has increased recognition and referral of OCD patients . The last two decades of research have greatly advanced our understandCorrespondence : National Institute of Mental Health, Child Psychiatry Branch, Building 10, Room 3N202, fO Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892. *National Institute of Mental Health, Child Psychiatry Branch. \"(\"Department of Anthropology, University of California at Los Angeles, Box 951553.© 1998 by The University of Chicago.

Diverse lines of evidence indicate that dysfunction of cortical-basal ganglia circuitry underlies OCD. This raises important questions about the evolutionary basis for neural control of these behaviors. The existence of such specificity in the \"hard wiring \" of human behaviors as basic to everyday functions as cleaning, checking , and ordering, or concern about dangers to self or others, suggests a biological basis for universal categories of certain thoughts and rituals. The notion of psychiatric disorder asjust another part of medical biology is nothing new. However, some of the symptoms ofOCD—such as excessive prayer, ordering and counting, over-scrupulous concern about acceptable behavior, pollution, and purity, and rituals resembling imitative magic— are generally assumed to be culturally mediated and not thought to be so closely tied to specific brain circuitry. If there is a strong biological component , then the identity of these categories, their breadth, and how their mediating circuitry came to exist are exciting and researchable questions. The debates over such conceptualizations extend beyond psychiatry and medicine to touch linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology. The recent advances in the neurobiology ofOCD, with converging evidence from genetics, brain imaging, immunology, and epidemiology, now suggest empirical research on the universality of fundamental types of human action, and on the joint role of biology and culture in shaping such complex actions. This paper will review recent biological and anthropological studies of OCD in order to suggest ways in which the study of disease may illuminate some fundamental issues in the social and behavioral sciences. Biological Research on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder PHARMACOLOGY The new look at OCD began with studies showing that clomipramine, a tricyclic drug with average antidepressant and antianxiety effects, had unique efficacy in treating OCD [3, 4] . This medication, and the four others to date that are equally effective anti-obsessional treatments, have in common their ability to block the reuptake of serotonin by brain neurons, with relatively little effect on norepinephrine reuptake. More recently, more selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become the drugs of choice for this disorder because a large percent of patients can tolerate their side effects [5] . The efficacy of these serotonergic drugs (and lack of efficacy of antidepressants that block reuptake of norepinephrine) inspired a \"serotonin hypothesis\" of OCD [6]. However, the...",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "title": "Withdrawal from long‐term use of caffeinated drinks can cause schizophrenia‐like symptoms: A case report",
      "abstract": "In recent years, energy drinks containing large amounts of caffeine have become popular among young people, and various health problems caused by caffeine have become a major issue.1 Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system and has been associated with some risk of dependence.2 We report on a male adolescent who presented with schizophrenia-like symptoms after abruptly ceasing long-term use of energy drinks. A 16-year-old Japanese boy with no history of manic/hypomanic, major depressive, or psychotic episodes reported perceiving ‘another self’ in his head. He had no history of illegal drug use or family history of psychiatric disorders. Some reports have described caffeine-induced psychotic symptoms,3 but to the best of our knowledge, no report has indicated the occurrence of psychotic symptoms during caffeine withdrawal. This is the first reported case of temporary psychosis-like symptoms during caffeine withdrawal. At age 14 years, the patient had developed a nightly practice of drawing and would use energy drinks to stay awake after midnight. His intake of energy drinks had gradually increased to 3550 mL per 24 h, equivalent to 1280 mg of caffeine per day. When he was in junior high, he had sometimes had the urge to kill someone, and, to distract himself from this urge, he had resorted to self-harm by injuring his own arm using a ballpoint pen. By age 16 years, his high school homeroom teacher had become concerned that he was drinking energy drinks too often and appearing lethargic during class. He was strongly persuaded to discontinue consuming energy drinks, and he stopped abruptly. For the next several days, he felt intense fatigue and had difficulty in concentrating. Ten days after ceasing energy-drink consumption, he began having thoughts of the ‘other self.’ This ‘other self’ ordered him to write down his conversations with it on a piece of paper. Four days later, during a class, he had an urge to kill someone. His body felt like it was being controlled by his ‘other self,’ and he actually picked up a knife; however, he thought better of it. He was scared and shaking, and consulted his health teacher. Hence, accompanied by a concerned teacher and his mother, he visited a psychiatrist at our hospital. At the first interview, however, the ‘voice’ had weakened and the urge to hurt others was gone. He was slightly fatigued during the daytime but no longer craved energy drinks. Brain computed tomography revealed no abnormalities. His score on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition, was 93, within normal range. In this case, long-term use of caffeine had been suddenly discontinued, and delusions had developed several days later. We tentatively diagnosed ‘caffeine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during withdrawal,’ on the basis of the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5. He did not take any antipsychotic drugs. The delusions gradually disappeared, and the patient regained a sense of self-control over his thoughts within 1 month. In the more than 2 years since, the symptoms have not recurred. The relationship between caffeine interruption and symptom appearance suggests a caffeine-related disorder rather than another diagnosis, such as a brief psychotic disorder. It is rare for schizophrenia-like symptoms to occur during caffeine withdrawal, and the exact mechanisms by which they do occur are unknown. Caffeine is a competitive antagonist of the adenosine receptor and is not directly involved in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, which plays a critical role in drug dependence; thus, symptoms of withdrawal from caffeine are generally considered mild and transient. However, results of a study in rats suggested that high doses (10 mg/kg) of caffeine may have the potential to activate the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex4; therefore, psychiatric symptoms might occur when high caffeine intake is abruptly discontinued. If caffeine is a psychostimulant, psychotic symptoms may develop in the withdrawal phase because of a reverse tolerance phenomenon or flashback.5 In these cases, however, schizophrenia should also be considered part of the differential diagnosis. Many young people stay up late to study or play video games and then become sleep deprived. To stay awake, they may form a habit of consuming large quantities of caffeinated drinks.6 According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, the number of emergency 911 calls related to energy drink overdose doubled between 2007 and 2011.7 Energy drinks are readily available and are used inappropriately as ‘study drugs’; thus, dependency on caffeine is possible. Because of recent increases in the consumption of energy drinks, the inappropriate use of highly caffeinated beverages should be investigated closely. Signed releases from the patient and legal guardian authorizing publication have been obtained. The authors thank Enago (www.enago.jp) for the English-language review.

      "abstract": "Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide including India. The role of Cannabis in the causation of psychiatric disorders, especially psychosis remains debatable. Cannabis use has been reported to present with symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder. The distinction between Cannabis-induced psychoses and primary psychotic disorder is important from management perspective as it would determine the need and duration of antipsychotic medications, as well as relative focus on the management of substance use. At times, however, such a distinction may be difficult to make. We present a case where we were faced with difficulty labeling the origin of psychotic symptoms in a patient who was otherwise a heavy user of Cannabis. Management options considered in the presence of insoluble diagnostic problem have also been discussed.",

      "title": "Hyponatremia With Anticonvulsant Medications: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "Hyponatremia is an adverse effect of many antiseizure medications (ASMs). It occurs with interference with the normal balance of electrolytes within the body. Various risk factors associated with the development of hyponatremia in patients taking these medications include age, gender, dosage, and combinations with other drugs. ASMs such as carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine (OXC), and valproic acid have a higher risk of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia induced by an antiseizure medication can occur through various mechanisms depending on the drug's specific mechanism of action. Hyponatremia can be a potentially fatal side effect. Patients taking these medications need to be monitored closely for the signs and symptoms of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia, defined as developing in <48 hours, is more likely to show symptoms than chronic hyponatremia. Signs of acute hyponatremia include delirium, seizures, decerebrate posturing, and cerebral edema with uncal herniation. Chronic hyponatremia, defined as developing in >48 hours, can cause lethargy, dizziness, weakness, headache, nausea, and confusion. Hyponatremia is associated with longer hospital stays and increased mortality. Treatment varies based on the degree of severity of hyponatremia. Choosing a treatment option should include consideration of the drug causing the electrolyte disturbance, the patient's risk factor profile, and the severity of symptoms as they present in the individual patient. Healthcare providers should be aware of hyponatremia as a potential side effect of ASMs, the signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, the different treatment options available, and the potential complications associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia.",

      "abstract": "210 patients with acute psychotic disorder in a state of alcohol withdrawal were examined. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium. These patients had more expressive aff ective (mostly anxiety) and psychomotor agitation. Productive psychotic symptomatology (delusion, hallucinations) had a more signifi cant eff ect on the behavior of patients with a drunken form of alcohol abuse. In patients with permanent alcohol abuse, visual hallucinations were more often associated with tactile hallucinations. In this group, a prolongation of the psychotic disorder occurred more frequently due to the exacerbation of somatoneurological diseases, which often had at these patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep disorders can be the result of psychiatric or neurological conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorders, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease. At the same time, changes in sleep, known as sleep disorders, are closely related to various metabolic dysfunctions, which in turn are the result of the generation of reactive oxygen species, or otherwise known as oxidative stress. For this reason, cannabinoid derivatives are increasingly used for this purpose. Among the most used are delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). These agents interact with the endogenous endocannabinoid system, either by direct action on specific receptors, or by increasing the availability of endocannabinoids, modifying particular mental states (anxiety, depression). The results of the studies specified in this article provide promising evidence regarding the positive effects of CBD, which extend beyond the scope of sleep disorders, with possible applications also in the case of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.",

      "title": "Toxic encephalopathy after an overdose of cocaine : a case serie",
      "abstract": "Introduction cocaine is a widely used illegal drug, known for its fast ability to induce euphoria and arousal. However, cocaine exposure can contribute to several mental and physical effects. Cocaine induced brain damage can be divided into 3 mechanisms: direct effect leading to toxic encephalopathy, secondary to vascular damage causing vasculitis, stroke and vasospasm, and tertiary effect due to hypoxia through a cardiovascular collapse. Objectives Here, we report 2 young men who developed a subacute encephalopathy with different clinical and radiological presentation after a cocaine overdose Methods a case serie Results we present two men aged respectively of 28 (P1) and 42 years-old (P2). Both had a history of alcohol consumption and toxicomania (mainly cocaine) during the past year. They manifested, 2 weeks following a cocaine overdose, with gait disorder and confusion. On examination, P1 was apathic and confused. He had a subcortical frontal syndrome with gait apraxia and grasping reflex, along with a quadri-pyramidal syndrome. While patient P2 developed a cognitive decline, parkinsonism with dystonic posture of the trunk and the right limbs, and a pseudobulbar syndrome. Brain MRI was performed in both patients and showed a bilateral multifocal leukoencephalopathy (P1) and the presence of bilateral hyper T2 and FLAIR weighted images affecting basal ganglia, the mesencephalon and the periventricular cerebral white matter. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed no pleocytosis and normal proteinorrachia. Electroencephalogram was also normal. Infectious differential diagnosis including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and syphilis were excluded and metabolic screening including copper analysis, serum and CSF lactate were normal. The urine toxic screening, performed 20 days following the drug overdose, was negative. Both patients were treated with benzodiazepine and fluids without significative improvement. They were discharged with major cognitive and motor impairment. Conclusions cocaine toxicity is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Usually, cocaine abuse can lead to cardio-vascular, pulmonary and nervous complication. Neuropsychiatric sequelae are uncommon with less recovery potential. To date, there is no drug to prevent or cure cocaine addiction. The key is to educate the patient when he or she presents to the emergency department. Patients should be urged to seek drug counseling. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

The drugs that addicts select are not chosen randomly. Their drug of choice is the result of an interaction between the psychopharmacologic action of the drug and the dominant painful feelings with which they struggle. Narcotic addicts prefer opiates because of their powerful muting action on the disorganizing and threatening affects of rage and aggression. Cocaine has its appeal because of its ability to relieve distress associated with depression, hypomania, and hyperactivity.",

Inadequate sleep may impact children's development, mood and behaviour and in consequence the wellbeing of their parents and caregivers. In a prospective, randomised, multicenter, open, comparative clinical trial the effectiveness of homeopathic ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (Cypripedium pubescens D4, Magnesium carbonicum D10, Zincum valerianicum D12) in children with sleep disorders and restlessness was evaluated. <h3>Methods</h3> Children aged≤6 years, suffering from sleep disorders for≥1 month, were randomised to receive either ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (intervention) or the aminoacetic acid glycine (control) for 28 days. Effectiveness endpoints included the change of 7 sleep related complaints (SRC; time to sleep onset, difficulties maintaining sleep, sleep duration, troubled sleep (somniloquism), physical inactivity after awakening, restlessness for unknown reason, sleep disorders frequency; total score = maximum 11 points) and parent's treatment satisfaction. Safety parameters were the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the tolerability of the treatments. <h3>Results</h3> The SRC total score decreased from baseline median 7.0 points in both groups to 2.0 points in the intervention group (n=89 children) and 4.0 points in the control group (n=90 children) after 28 days of treatment. Children of the intervention group had overall significant higher odds of getting lower SRC total score (odds ratio: 4.45 (95%-CI: 2.77–7.14), p&lt;0.0001; ITT). First clinical differences between both groups were seen already after 14 days. At day 28 significantly more children in the intervention group showed absence of individual complaints (Chi<sup>2</sup>-test: all P values≤0.0475; ITT). More parents were either 'very satisfied' (n=33) or 'satisfied' (n=49) with ZinCyp-3–02 treatment compared to the number of parents with 'very satisfied' (n=10) and 'satisfied' (n=28) ratings in the control group. Only few ADRs occurred (ZinCyp-3–02: n=2 (nervousness, excitability); control: n=1 (excitement)) and almost all parents and physician (&gt;93% out of 179) rated the tolerability of both treatments as 'very good' or 'good'. <h3>Conclusions</h3> ZinCyp-3–02 showed to be a safe and effective treatment option for paediatric sleep disorders and restlessness.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

      "abstract": "Sleep anxiety is feeling stressed or afraid to sleep. Anxiety is the most common mental health disorder in US research. Research shows that most people with mental disorders such as anxiety also have some kind of sleep disorder. Hypomania is an abnormal state of mind that affects your mood, thoughts, and behavior and is a potential symptom of bipolar disorder, especially type II. A hypomanic episode is usually characterized by unusual happiness, flashy excitement, or agitation, along with other features such as inflated self-esteem, excessive talkativeness, increased distractibility, decreased need for sleep, and racing thoughts.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a complication that may occur during treatment with neuroleptic drugs, or after abrupt cessation of dopaminagonists. Although the condition is relatively rare, it has a high mortality of about 20% when untreated. The first symptoms can appear the first day after initiation of treatment with neuroleptic drugs. The syndrome manifests itself in the form of a tetralogy composed of extrapyramidal symptoms, a change in the level of conciousness, elevated body temperature and autonomic instability. It is also associated with secondary laboratory findings such as increased creatine kinase and leucocyte count. Treatment includes stopping the neuroleptic drugs, application of dopaminagonists, benzodiazepines and fluid replacement. If the patient, after an episode of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, has a psychotic relapse, neuroleptica can be recommended after a break of one to four weeks. Two cases are described to demonstrate the picture.",

      "abstract": "Many patients experience difficulty swallowing pills, for I various reasons: * discomfort (particularly pediatric and geriatric patients) * postsurgical need for an alternate route of enteral intake (nasogastric tube, gastrostomy, jejunostomy) * dysphagia due to a neurologic disorder (multiple sclerosis, impaired gag reflex, dementing processes) * odynophagia (pain upon swallowing) due to gastroesophageal reflux or a structural abnormality * a structural abnormality of the head or neck that impairs swallowing. (1) If these difficulties are not addressed, they can interfere with medication adherence. In those instances, using an alternative dosage form or manipulating an available formulation might be required. Crushing guidelines There are limited data on crushed-form products and their impact on efficacy. Therefore, when patients have difficulty taking pills, switching to liquid solution or orally disintegrating forms is recommended. However, most psychotropics are available only as tablets or capsules. Patients can crush their pills immediately before administration for easier intake. The following are some general guidelines for doing so: (2) * Scored tablets typically can be crushed. * Crushing sublingual and buccal tablets can alter their effectiveness. * Crushing sustained-release medications can eliminate the sustained-release action. (3) * Enteric-coated medications should not be crushed, because this can alter drug absorption. * Capsules generally can be opened to administer powdered contents, unless the capsule has time-release properties or an enteric coating. The accompanying Table, organized by drug class, indicates whether a drug can be crushed to a powdered form, which usually is mixed with food or liquid for easier intake. The Table also lists liquid and orally disintegrating forms available, and other routes, including injectable immediate and long-acting formulations. Helping patients find a medication formulation that suits their needs strengthens adherence and the therapeutic relationship.

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

Increased energy intake and diminished satiety signalling can be seen in the case of overweight and obesity. On the other hand, decreased energy intake and increased satiety can be seen in the ageing population, also known as anorexia of ageing. Furthermore, abnormal sensations such as recurring pain, stress, and anxiety can influence energy intake and satiety signalling. This in turn can result in food intake disorders such as avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Administering tastants, especially bitter tastants, in the gastrointestinal tract can result in decreased energy intake. Intragastric administration of lidocaine did not result in increased energy intake. A novel tool was developed in order to provide more insight in the disrupted sensing and signalling of satiety seen in the disorder functional dyspepsia.",

It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief. These psychological disorders frequently underlie medical care needs.",

      "title": "Overview of Anxiety and the Anxiety Disorders",
      "abstract": "Anxiety can be a confusing term because it can have several different meanings and apply to different experiences and behaviors. According to Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary [1], anxiety is a vague, uneasy feeling of discomfort or dread accompanied by an autonomic (self-controlling) response. Anxiety alerts individuals to changes, both within them and in the world around them, as part of an internal signal system [2]. Anxiety consists of a range of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and is influenced by biological, psychological, and genetic factors [3]. Anxiety is a normal but at times unpleasant emotion. The subjective experience of anxiety differs, but familiar presentations include symptoms such as apprehension, uneasiness, “butterflies in the stomach,” anticipation, and dread. Objective behavioral manifestations include looking strained and tense, hypervigilance, shakiness, muscle tension, sweaty palms, rapid pulse, difficulty breathing, restlessness, and avoidance. Equivalent anxiety experiences may be described as nervousness, tension, worry, restlessness, irritability, agitation, and somatization [4]. Table 1.1 lists common subjective and objective symptoms and descriptors associated with various states of anxiety [2]. Although primary care practitioners are well aware of the many and varied presentations of anxiety symptoms and signs, they can present as true diagnostic dilemmas at times. Individuals experience anxiety as a normal emotion at different times in their lives, and the source may be known, unknown, or nonspecific. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress and can help one to cope. Anxiety involves anticipating future danger, and the response can actually help us to avoid potential danger—the “fight or flight” response. Triggers for the anxiety response include psychological threats, the unexpected, novelty, social/performance situations, cognitive mechanisms, and conditioned associative memories [4].",

Blood alcohol measurements are a vital test in the comatose patient as the clinical picture may be caused, or temporarily significantly worsened, by severe alcohol intoxication. The preservation of pupillary light reflexes in the presence of deep coma with decerebrate posturing should alert the clinician to a possible metabolic cause for the coma, including alcohol. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of alcoholic coma should not be made unless the blood alcohol concentration is grossly elevated and other causes of coma have been excluded by careful physical examination, blood glucose and electrolyte measurement, skull radiography and, in the absence of a rapid improvement, computerized tomography.",

      "abstract": "Regarding the treatment of insomnia, it is said that a considerable degree of advancement has been made to date in terms of controlling toxicity, preventing the development of tolerance and avoiding addiction, which were often observed when administering barbiturates. Nevertheless, the majority of hypnotics used today, which are benzodiazepines, still retain certain side effects such as hangover effects, development of dependence, rebound insomnia as a withdrawal symptom, muscular atonia resulting in falling down and causing bone fracture, inhibition of respiratory system, negative interaction with alcohol, etc. The current trend of selecting hypnotics is to use short-half-life agents. However, there are yet other problems such as cognitive disorders including amnesia, rebound insomnia and increased anxiety during the daytime. In order to cope with these problems, three new hypnotics have recently been developed. They are non-benzodiazepine derivatives and considered to be safer than the others, because they are supposed to cause less side effects than conventional hypnotics. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these new hypnotics can be summarized as follows: 1) these hypnotics have selective affinity to benzodiazepine receptor omega-1 subtype although the agent itself does not belong to the benzodiazepine derivative family; 2) the half-life-time in the serum is extremely short, namely 1-2 hours; 3) they increase the level of slow waves (delta-wave) during sleep; 4) they have a lesser effect toward atonic muscle and amnestic thought and behavioral disturbance as compared to conventional hypnotics; and 5) the risks of developing drug tolerance and reciprocal negative effects with alcohol are smaller. Consequently, we can expect that these new hypnotics will bring a certain advantage, especially regarding the avoidance of hypnotics-induced side effects in the course of clinical treatment of insomnia in the future.",

      "title": "The effect of alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity on sleep, brain and cognition",
      "abstract": "Abstract In alcohol use disorder, drinking cessation is frequently associated with an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Early in abstinence (within the first 2 months after drinking cessation), when patients do not exhibit physical signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome anymore (such as nausea, tremor or anxiety), studies report various brain, sleep and cognitive alterations, highly heterogeneous from one patient to another. While the acute neurotoxicity of alcohol withdrawal syndrome is well-known, its contribution to structural brain alterations, sleep disturbances and neuropsychological deficits observed early in abstinence has never been investigated and is addressed in this study. We included 54 alcohol use disorder patients early in abstinence (from 4 to 21 days of sobriety) and 50 healthy controls. When acute physical signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome were no longer present, patients performed a detailed neuropsychological assessment, a T1-weighted MRI and a polysomnography for a subgroup of patients. According to the severity of the clinical symptoms collected during the acute withdrawal period, patients were subsequently classified as mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome (mild-AWS) patients (Cushman score ≤ 4, no benzodiazepine prescription, N = 17) or moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome (moderate-AWS) patients (Cushman score &amp;gt; 4, benzodiazepine prescription, N = 37). Patients with severe withdrawal complications (delirium tremens or seizures) were not included. Mild-AWS patients presented similar grey matter volume and sleep quality as healthy controls, but lower processing speed and episodic memory performance. Compared to healthy controls, moderate-AWS patients presented non-rapid eye movement sleep alterations, widespread grey matter shrinkage and lower performance for all the cognitive domains assessed (processing speed, short-term memory, executive functions and episodic memory). Moderate-AWS patients presented a lower percentage of slow-wave sleep, grey matter atrophy in fronto-insular and thalamus/hypothalamus regions, and lower short-term memory and executive performance than mild-AWS patients. Mediation analyses revealed both direct and indirect (via fronto-insular and thalamus/hypothalamus atrophy) relationships between poor sleep quality and cognitive performance. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity, which reflects neurotoxic hyperglutamatergic activity, should be considered as a critical factor for the development of non-rapid eye movement sleep alterations, fronto-insular atrophy and executive impairments in recently detoxified alcohol use disorder patients. The glutamatergic activity is involved in sleep-wake circuits and may thus contribute to molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-related brain damage, resulting in cognitive deficits. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity and sleep quality deserve special attention for a better understanding and treatment of brain and cognitive alterations observed early in abstinence, and ultimately for more efficient relapse prevention strategies.",

Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

Results: A 44-year-old woman with borderline personality traits and severe drug dependence developed a protracted drug-induced psychosis related to chronic high-dose crystalline methamphetamine use. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred with antipsychotic medication and abstinence from methamphetamine. Rapid recurrence of symptoms occurred at a time of high stress associated with minimal methamphetamine use and cessation of low-dose quetiapine. Symptoms rapidly resolved with abstinence, quetiapine and reduction of stressors. Conclusions: A drug-induced psychosis resembling paranoid schizophrenia can occur with repeated or high-dose use of methamphetamine. While this generally resolves rapidly with cessation of stimulant use, some cases of protracted drug-induced psychosis in vulnerable individuals have been documented. Behavioural sensitization can also occur, and neuroleptics may prevent the recurrence of further psychosis triggered by ongoing low-dose methamphetamine use.",

      "abstract": "A 30-year-old male patient developed a hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) after smoking cannabis laced with phencyclidine (PCP) or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) 10 years prior to hospital admission. Clinically, he reported seeing vivid, saturated colors and caricature-like objects. The patient described perceiving objects or people in motion as moving faster than normal. He reported living in a dream-like state and feeling numb and detached from other people and his surroundings. Upon pharmacotherapy initiation, facility transfer, and subsequent discharge from an acute psychiatry unit, he ultimately committed suicide. Although hallucinogen abuse is common in the United States, this case suggests that HPPD maybe significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated. In some cases, this oversight may perpetuate years of unnecessary patient suffering and can ultimately lead to severe depression and suicide.",

It is associated with loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the hypothalamus, hypocretin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid below 110 pg/ml, and the HLA genotype DQ B1*0602. A less common form of narcolepsy without cataplexy probably has a different, as yet unknown, pathogenesis. Once established, narcolepsy is lifelong; spontaneous recovery does not occur. Symptomatic treatment—which is essential for school performance, work, driving ability, and quality of life—is with stimulant (e.g. amphetamine) and anticataplectic (e.g. clomipramine) drugs. More recently, sodium oxybate, an anaesthetic, has been used to induce deep sleep overnight, resulting in improvements in all symptoms.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews the current studies on the mechanism of nicotine dependence. In the process of nicotine dependence, there are four major determinants: reinforcing effects, tolerance, craving and withdrawal. 1) The positive reinforcing effects of nicotine are important especially for the initiation of nicotine self-administration. These effects are considered to be induced by the ability of nicotine to promote the release of catecholamines, acetylcholine, beta-endorphine, glucocorticoid, and other kinds of hormones. 2) However, tolerance gradually develops to the positive reinforcing effects of nicotine, as nicotine is repeatedly self-administered. 3) Craving is defined as the uncontrollability of the urge to take drugs, which is a core aspect of recent ICD-10 or DSM-IV descriptions. Craving for nicotine is caused and enhanced by the following three factors; psychic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, depression and dysphoria, conditioning processes leading to the association of nicotine effects with environmental stimuli, and memory of the reinforcing effects of nicotine. 4) Neither somatic withdrawal symptoms nor mental disorders related to nicotine dependence is significant. 5) As for the neurobiology of nicotine dependence, the reward system is focused as a putative responsible region involved not only in the reinforcing effects of nicotine but also in the psychic withdrawal symptoms. The amygdala-nucleus accumbens connection may be intimately involved in the association between nicotine effects and environmental stimuli. And neuronal circuits involved in memory function may be implicated in the manifestation of craving and relapse, but the details remain to be solved.",

Psychiatric disturbances usually take the form of euphoria or elation in mood. Depression is less likely, and irritability or aggressiveness may occur. In about 5 per cent of cases the alteration in mood may be accompanied by clouding of consciousness, delusions, hallucinations and disorientation. This picture of an organic confusional state is said to result from high doses and prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and ACTH. The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959). Disturbances may appear within six to seven hours of initial therapy (Goolker and Schein, 1953), after prolonged administration, or even after complete withdrawal of the hormone therapy.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews what causes clinicians to overlook or underdiagnose akathisia. The causes are considered to be related to both the patient's symptoms and the clinician's attitude toward akathisia. The patient factors include mild severity of akathisia, lack of apparent motor restlessness, no voluntary expression of inner restlessness, no clear communication of inner restlessness, restlessness in body parts other than the legs, atypical expressions of inner restlessness, other prominent psychic symptoms, and absence of other extrapyramidal signs. The clinician factors include emphasis on objective restlessness, failure to consider akathisia during antipsychotic therapy, failure to fully implement antiakathisia treatments in ambiguous cases, and strict adherence to research diagnostic criteria. Akathisia is likely to be overlooked or underdiagnosed when both patient and clinician factors are present. Currently, there may be two major problems with underdiagnosis: (1) symptoms that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for akathisia are overlooked, and (2) conditions that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria but can still benefit from antiakathisia measures are underdiagnosed.",

Second, Δ9-THC intoxication is also responsible for significant changes in nocturnal sleep with disappearance of REM stages and a decrease of slow sleep.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa – reciprocal relationships. A literature review",
      "abstract": "Although schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa are seemingly very distinct psychiatric disorders, their symptoms are connected by various types of relationships. The present article reviews the literature and recapitulates the views of various authors on the links between these two disorders. Symptoms of anorexia may 1) precede the onset of psychosis; 2) evolve in its active phase or more rarely manifest in remission; and, conversely, 3) psychotic symptoms may occur transiently in the course of anorexia nervosa. When anorexia precedes the manifestation of psychosis, symptoms of anorexia can be treated as a component of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Another possibility of co-existence of a psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia) with anorexia is when the eating disorder syndrome manifests at the same time as the full-blown psychotic syndrome. In such cases, when the symptoms of the two disorders occur simultaneously, it is often difficult to say whether the patient is suffering from schizophrenia, in the course of which anorexia has arisen secondary to psychotic symptoms or whether he/she is suffering from anorexia during which he/she has developed psychotic symptoms, usually thematically associated with eating. Studies published so far, mainly case reports, point to the complex nature of the interrelationships between schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to conclusively explain the relationships between psychotic disorders and anorexia nervosa, which would allow physicians to use more effective methods of treatment in this group of patients.",

Cases of psychotic disorder induced by synthetic cannabinoid use are becoming increasingly more reported. Capgras syndrome is a psychotic disorder characterized by a delusion that a specific person or object has been replaced by an identical one. It has been reported to occur rarely in pure form, but generally accompanying schizophrenia or organic psychosis. Herein we aim to report an adolescent case presenting with Capgras syndrome developed after use of synthetic cannabinoids and to draw attention to psychotic symptoms and to this uncommon psychotic syndrome which may occur after synthetic cannabinoid use. Seventeen years old male, who reported using \"bonzai\" for about 10 days, was brought to the emergency room by his family. Capgras syndrome, defined with delusion that his mother and father have been changed and replaced by others, has been detected. In adolescents who admit with psychotic symptoms, synthetic cannabinoid use should be considered and detailed history should be taken, even laboratory tests were negative. Adolescents, as a vulnerable population, should be informed about negative effects of synthetic cannabinoids which are easily accessible and distributed as \"herbal\", \"natural\" and \"legal\", as well as their parents and institutions such as schools which may guide them. Thus, it might be possible to prevent psychotic disorders which will be induced by this substances.",

      "abstract": "Patients with cancer typically experience multiple symptoms related to cancer and cancer treatment. These symptoms can include physical (e.g., pain, shortness of breath), cognitive (e.g., delirium, memory problems, impaired concentration), and affective (e.g., depression, anxiety) experiences associated with the disease and its treatments (1). Symptoms are the side effects and ''toxicities'' of treatment, as well as the direct product of the disease process itself. Symptoms are what patients report to clinicians as the subjective negative feelings of physical and mental changes produced by both disease and treatment. Symptom severity is related to the extent of disease and the aggressiveness of therapy. Common symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment significantly impair the daily function and quality of life of patients. Symptoms that are unrecognized by treatment teams may also become so severe that emergency room visits or hospitalization are required for management, adding substantially to the cost of treatment and to the disruption of the patients' routines and those of their families. Untreated symptoms may also negatively influence treatment effectiveness by interrupting treatment (2). Multiple and severe symptoms present a significant challenge to the resources of those who care for and managecancer patients. For example, intensive cancer therapies produce severe and sometimes life-threatening side effects, resulting in patients' inability to care for themselves and in total dependence on caregivers (3). Undertreatment of symptoms has become a major health problem in its own right.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background The use of electronic cigarettes (e‐cigarettes) is very common worldwide. To date, an increase of nicotine intoxication following an accidental or intentional ingestion/injection of refill solution (e‐liquid) has been detected. Case A 23‐year‐old man presented with sudden loss of consciousness, bradycardia, and respiratory muscle paralysis after intentional ingestion of e‐liquid. Early clinical data, brain computed tomography, and neurophysiological tests (electroencephalogram [EEG] and somatosensory evoked potentials [SEPs]) did not show features with a poor neurological prognostic meaning of an hypoxic encephalopathy. After 4 days, the patient showed bilateral loss of the pupillary reflex, and severe and cytotoxic edema was detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging. SEPs showed a bilateral loss of cortical responses and EEG a suppressed pattern. Nine days after the onset of coma, the patient evolved toward brain death (BD). Discussion Because nicotine intoxication might cause respiratory muscle paralysis, without cardiac arrest (CA), it would be important to understand the mechanisms underlying brain damage and to take into account that the current neurological prognostic evidence for hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy, based on data from patients who all experienced CA may not be reliable. Reporting cases of nicotine intoxication through e‐liquid is relevant in order to improve regulatory parameters for e‐liquid sale.",

Neuroimaging characteristics: T2 hyperintense lesions with little to no enhancement, edema, or hemorrhageh. Prognosis 1) Survival is variable (at least 3-5 years is expected) 2) Most low-grade astrocytomas undergo malignanttransformation with time 3) Risk factors for malignant transformation: tumorsize, gemistocytic pathology, presentation in first decade or after age 50 years, increased enhancement2. Anaplastic (WHO grade III) astrocytoma a. Associated with mutations of the tumor suppressor genep53 on chromosome 17p13.1 (as with the low-grade astrocytomas), mutation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 13q14 in 1/3 of cases, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 19q (the latter two are involved in transformation from a low-grade to an anaplastic astrocytoma)b. Presentation is often between 40 and 60 years of age (younger patients have longer survival)c. Mascroscopic features 1) Diffusely infiltrating heterogeneous neoplasm 2) Tumor may appear cystic and/or contain hemorrhagicfoci d. Microscopic features1) Cellular proliferation is more prominent than in lowgrade astrocytomas2) Often, frequent mitotic figures and endovascular proliferation3) No necrosis e. Seeding of the neuroaxis by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)dissemination and ependymal spread may occur but are rareoverexpression of proto-oncogene encoding plateletderived growth factor (PDGF)b. Occur typically in either first decade or between third and fourth decadesc. Usually hemispheric location, with predilection for temporal and posterior frontal lobes more than anterior parietal lobed. Tends to be infiltrative, with no well-defined borders e.

WHO Classification and St. Anne/Mayo Grading of Astrocytic TumorsWHO St. Anne/Mayo_______________________________ ________________________________________________________ Designation Classification Grade (based on criteria)* Criteria*f. Median survival: usual estimate, about 2 to 3 years after presentation3. Glioblastoma multiforme a. Most common primary brain tumor, 50% of all gliomas b. Presentation: typically after age 50 c. With the aggressive nature and rapid progression,presenting symptoms include increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and focal neurologic symptomsd. Genetics 1) Secondary glioblastomas (malignant transformationof lower grade glioma to glioblastoma) can be associated with mutation of gene encoding PDGF-α, loss of tumor suppressor gene PTEN (LOH at chromosome 10q)2) Primary (de novo) glioblastomas a) Have no apparent antecedent low-or intermediate-grade tumor history b) Are often associated with amplification of theproto-oncogenes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MDM2, loss of tumor suppressorgene PTEN, LOH at chromosome 10, and mutation involving the RB genee. Most common locations: deep white matter and deep gray matter, including thalamus and basal gangliaf. Macroscopic and neuroimaging features 1) Heterogeneous-appearing mass with foci of necrosis,hemorrhage, and peritumoral edema (Fig. 16-3) 2) Neuroimaging often confirms the heterogeneousappearance, with central area of necrosis and a ringenhancing rim3) Despite the circumscribed gross appearance, thetumor is highly infiltrative and may also spread to opposite hemisphere through the corpus callosum (“butterfly gliomas”)4) Glioblastoma multiforme tumors may arise from malignant transformation of separate regions of the tumor and appear multifocal5) Contrast enhancement and vasogenic edema occur from disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB)6) Treatment with corticosteroids assists in reestablishment of BBB and can yield almost immediate improvement of symptomsg. Microscopic features 1) All the features of anaplastic astrocytomas in additionto prominent endothelial proliferation and/or necrosis, surrounded by pseudopalisading of cells (Fig. 16-4)2) Neovascularization and endothelial hyperplasia may be due to production of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)h. Natural history and spread 1) Typical: spread of tumor along white matter tractsand around the ependyma 2) Atypical: CSF dissemination through neuroaxis(occurs in 10%-20% of cases), may include pachymeningeal spread3) Almost never occur: invasion of dura mater and metastasis outside of CNS4) Meningeal invasion is sometimes called “meningeal gliomatosis,” occurs more frequently with malignant gliomasi. Treatment 1) Usually includes surgical debulking aimed at relievingmass effect and increasing effectiveness of adjunctive therapy (also sometimes to obtain pathology specimen)2) Complete resection is not possible because tumor is diffusely infiltrative and multifocal3) Stereotactic biopsy: reserved for deep and inaccessibletumors and comorbidities precluding general anesthesia 4) Most effective adjunctive therapy: external beamradiotherapy administered to limited field, up to 60 Gy given in conjunction with temozolomide chemotherapy-median survival, about 14 months; 2-year survival, about 27%4. Gliomatosis cerebri (Fig. 16-5) a. Diffuse, infiltrative glial tumor (usually astrocytoma)causing diffuse expansion of a portion of or entire cerebral hemisphere; may spread to one or both cerebral hemispheresb. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-6) 1) Resembles low-grade glioma 2) Mild increase in cellularity and pleomorphism 3) Rare mitotic figures 4) No hemorrhage or necrosis 5) Neoplastic glial cells cluster around neuronsc. Treatment 1) Some benefit from chemotherapy (as with PCV ortemozolamide) 2) No role for surgery because of infiltrative nature oftumorg. Brainstem gliomas: likely to be solid, diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas (rarely pilocytic tumor arising from fourth ventricle with “dorsally exophytic” growth, which may portend better prognosis)h. Macroscopic features: unencapsulated, but well-circumscribed (there may be limited degrees of infiltration) heterogeneous mass; may have a mural nodule associated with a cysti. Microscopic features 1) Compact pilocytic arrangements of elongated (some-times stellate) cells admixed with microcystic areas 2) Classic feature: abundant Rosenthal fibers, may beslight nuclear pleomorphism and rare mitoses j. 5-Year postoperative survival: 85% to 100% (95%-100% for cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas) k. Cerbellar pilocytic astrocytomas have the best prognosisof all primary brain tumors l. Treatment1) Maximal surgical excision of tumor 2) Surgical excision of the mural nodule may be3) Marginal benefit from radiotherapy d. 2-Year survival after treatment, 5% to 10%E. Circumscribed Astrocytomas 1. Pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Usually occur in first or second decade of life b. Better prognosis than diffuse astrocytomas c. Common locations: cerebellum (hemispheres &gt; vermis),optic chiasm, hypothalamus, and periventricular area of third and fourth ventricles (Fig. 16-7 A)d. Less common locations: spinal cord (Fig. 16-7 B and C), brainstem, cerebral hemispheres (temporal lobe is most common hemisphere site); tend to occur in older age group (young adults)e. Cerebellar hemisphere tumors: often large cystic, fluidfilled masses appearing hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with strongly (but somewhat heterogeneously) contrast-enhancing mural nodulef. Optic and hypothalamic gliomas: tend to be solid, pilocytic tumorsadequate and cystic wall need not be removed 3) With increasing thickness or enhancement of nodulewall, the cystic wall also needs to be removed 4) Nonresectable tumors or recurrence with malignanttransformation may require adjuvant radiotherapy 2. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (WHO grade II orIII) a. Occur in second or third decade of life (average age atdiagnosis, 26 years) b. Often a history of seizures c. May originate from subpial astrocytes d. Macroscopic features1) Well-encapsulated tumor frequently containing a mural nodule within a cyst2) Often located superficially in temporal lobe e. Microsocopic features1) Large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, some containing lipid droplets2) Nuclear pleomorphism 3) Rare mitosesf. Neuroimaging: well-circumscribed cystic lesions appearing isointense or hypointense to brain parenchyma on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images,often with intense contrast enhancement of nodule g. Treatment1) Often includes complete resection 2) Radiation and chemotherapy often reserved forrecurrent or malignant tumors h. Postresection survival rates: 81% at 5 years, 70% at10 years; relatively benign prognosis 3. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Very slow-growing tumors, always associated with tuberous sclerosis (found in up to 14% of patients with tuberous sclerosis)b. Presentation: usually in first or second decade of life c. Usually originate near foramen of Monro, blocking CSFoutflow and causing hydrocephalus d. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, lobulated redmass (vascular tumor), often calcified and cysticLarge cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilic granular bodies are a characteristic feature of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, which is a low-grade gliomae. Microscopic features 1) Large, oval cells with abundant eosinophilic cyto-plasm and large, eccentric nucleus; often surround blood vessels in this vascular tumor2) Pleomorphism is often present 3) Mitoses and necrosis are unusualf. Neuroimaging: isointense or hyperintense on T2weighted images; intense, heterogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted imaging with contrastg. Definitive treatment for symptomatic patients (i.e., hydrocephalus) or extensive tumors: surgical resectionh. Unless symptomatic, patients are only followed with periodic neuroimagingF. Special Considerations 1. Optic gliomas (Fig. 16-8)a. 3% to 5% of all childhood brain tumors b. 2% of gliomas in adults c. Female predominance (female:male = 2:1) d. More common in children: 50% of patients presentbefore age 5, 90% before age 20 e. Tumors involving optic nerve alone have a betterprognosis than those involving optic chiasm (which have better prognosis than hypothalamic gliomas, although aggressive tumors involving optic chiasm may spread to involve hypothalamus)f. Associated with NF1 1) Occur in 1% to 7% of children with NF1 2) As many as 50% of patients with optic gliomas haveNF1 3) Almost all patients with bilateral optic nerve tumorssparing optic chiasm have NF1 g. Slow-growing tumors; malignant histologic features oraggressive behavior are rare (reported in cases of optic chiasm and hypothalamic gliomas)h. Usually pilocytic astrocytomas causing either diffuse expansion without subarachnoid involvement or primary subarachnoid spread with minimal involvement of optic nervei. Symptoms unique to optic nerve gliomas 1) Visual loss, visual field defects, painless proptosis, andsymptoms related to increased intracranial pressure 2) Symptoms of hypothalamic involvementa) Endocrinopathies: precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus, other related endocrinopathiesb) Gelastic seizures: characterized by involuntarylaughter, more common with hypothalamic hamartomasc) “Diencephalic syndrome”: emaciation, cachexia and loss of subcutaneous fat, emesis, pallor, hyperactivity, inappropriate behavior, euphoriaj. Treatment 1) Considered for tumors with aggressive behavior, espe-cially for patients presenting with visual deterioration 2) Radiotherapy considered for patients older than 5years presenting with tumors in locations other than intraorbital (intracranial locations such as chiasmal or retrochiasmal) and when total resection is not possible3) Chemotherapy considered for patients younger than 5 years4) Surgical excision may be limited to biopsy, especially for tumors involving optic chiasm2. Brainstem gliomas a. Account for 10% to 15% of brain tumors in children(&lt;5% of gliomas in adults) b. Age at diagnosis: often between 5 and 10 years c. Heterogeneous group of neoplasms: all grades of pathol-ogy observed, but most are malignant, with poor prognosisd. Symptoms: usually related to ataxia and other cerebellarfeatures, long tract signs, or cranial nerve deficits e. Neuroimaging (can predict prognosis better than patho-logic features) 1) Lesions appear as a high T2 signal with variabledegrees of enhancement 2) May contain a cystic component (Fig. 16-9) 3) Diffuse pontine gliomas: all are malignant 4) Most gliomas involving cervicomedullary junction arelow-grade gliomas 5) Tumors of midbrain usually have a better prognosisthan those involving medulla or pons 6) Dorsal exophytic tumors tend to have betterprognosis f. Prognosis1) Best for focal lesions, dorsal exophytic tumors, low histologic grade, longer period from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, adult age group, and in context of neurofibromatosis2) 5-Year survival: 5% to 30% g. Treatment1) Best: radiotherapy 2) Surgical resection usually involves stereotactic biopsy;is best performed on focal, cystic, or exophytic tumorsG. Rare Astrocytic Variants 1. Gliosarcomas: high-grade gliomas admixed with sarco-ma (variant of glioblastoma multiforme, with same prognosis)2. Gliofibroma a. Glioma admixed with population of cells resemblingfibroblasts b. Usually present in the first decadeH. Oligodendroglioma 1. From cells of oligodendroglial origin (O2A progenitorcells)2. Genetics a. Development of low-grade oligodendrogliomas: associ-ated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p, 19q, and 4qb. Development of high-grade oligodendrogliomas from the low-grade tumors: associated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 9p and 10qc. Both are associated with overexpression of EGFR 3. Account for 5% of all primary brain tumors and 30%of all intracranial gliomas 4. May be a male predominance (male:female = 3:2) 5. More often presents in adults: usually present betweenthird and fifth decades 6. Small earlier peak in childhood between 6 and 12 years;thalamic location at presentation is common in children7. Seizures are often the initial presentation in up to 75% of patients because tumor commonly involves cerebral cortex8. Most common location: frontal lobe, followed by temporal and parietal lobes; rarely brainstem or spinal cord9. Slow-growing, infiltrative gliomas: may start in subcortical white matter, tend to spread along white matter tracts and corpus callosum10. Better prognosis than astrocytomas 11. 5-Year survival rate, 75% 12. Mean postoperative survival, 4 to 11 years13. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, unencapsulated mass with cystic degeneration and calcification (necrosis and hemorrhage are rare)14. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-10) a. Variable b. Homogeneously appearing cells with sparse cytoplasmand round, uniform nuclei c. Cells may appear elongated, with a displaced nucleus;because of fixation artifact, there may be artifactual clearing of the cytoplasm, resembling fried eggsd. There may be mucin-rich microcystic spaces e. Capillaries interposed between uniform-appearing cellsmay form a delicate vascular “chicken-wire” pattern f. Pleomorphism and endothelial hyperplasia (less commonly,necrosis) indicate high-grade oligodendroglioma 15. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous appearing T2hyperintense mass often involving cerebral cortex with variable, heterogeneous enhancement pattern, cystic component, and calcification (in up to 90% of cases)16. Classified into high-grade and low-grade tumors 17. Features associated with high-grade tumors and lessfavorable prognosis a. Contrast enhancement b. Endothelial proliferation c. Mitotic figures d. More than 5% of MIB-1 staining e. Astrocytic component (with oligoastrocytomas, asdiscussed below) 18. Treatmenta. Gross total resection when possible (because tumor is infiltrative, microscopic infiltrates always remain)b. Primary adjuvant therapy: chemotherapy with alkylating agent such as temozolomide (before development of temozolomide, procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine [PVC] were used)c. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 1p or combined loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p and 19q (50%- 80% of cases) portend better prognosis, prolonged survival, and better response to chemotherapyd. Although intermediate-grade oligodendrogliomas are often chemotherapy-responsive (e.g., 1p/19q deleted tumors), radiation (often in combination with chemotherapy) is still the mainstay of treatment to achieve maximal survival advantageI. Oligoastrocytoma 1. Composed of different populations of cells, someresembling astrocytes, some oligodendrocytes, and some indeterminate2. A common progenitor cell that differentiates into two different cell lines is likely3. Glial tumors with predominant oligodendrocytic population of cells are often interpreted as oligodendrocytes4. Increasing proportion of oligodendroglial component generally portends better prognosis (chromosome 1p and 19q deletions signify greater sensitivity of tumor to chemotherapy)J. Ependymoma 1. Epidemiologya. 5% to 8% of all primary intracranial tumors b. Age at presentation often in the first decade, with asecond peak in the fourth decade (prognosis worse for patients younger than 3 years)c. Third most common brain tumor in children d. Location (pediatric population): intracranial (90%) orspinal cord (10%) e. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occuring in childrenare infratentorial and about 1/3 supratentorial f. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occur in children (mostlyinfratentorial), and more than 90% of spinal cord ependymomas occur in adults (mostly myxopapillary ependymomas)2. Symptoms at presentation (depend largely on tumor location) a. Intracranial tumors often occur on floor (more frequentthan roof or lateral recesses) of fourth ventricle (medul-loblastomas tend to arise most frequently from roof of fourth ventricle)b. May present with obstructive hydrocephalus and associated symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, vertigo, nystagmus3. Potential for CSF dissemination: because of close contact with CSF, there may be “drop metastasis” in 5% of cases4. Myxopapillary ependymomas a. Well-encapsulated, indolent, slow-growing vasculartumors arising from filum terminale b. Occur most often in adults c. Associated with good prognosis5. Posterior fossa ependymomas a. Well-demarcated tumors that tend to fill fourth ventricleand extend through foramen magnum b. Appear as T2 hyperintense masses with heterogeneoussignal that may represent tumor vascularity (or necrosis) c. Often a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement6. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-11) a. Sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei and variablecytoplasm among perivascular anuclear fibrillary processes: “pseudorosettes” (fine cellular fibrillary processes that radiate toward blood vessel)b. Myxopapillary ependymomas are characterized by sheets of uniform columnar or cuboidal cells admixed with pools of mucin often bordered by tumor cells and containing a central blood vesselc. Cytologic pleomorphism, necrosis, mitotic figures, and giant cells often signify anaplastic ependymomas7. Treatment: surgical resection and/or adjuvant radiotherapy (optimal outcome with doses between 5,000 cGy and 5,500 cGy) a. Higher survival with gross total resection: goal is toobtain maximal possible resection b. For low-grade ependymomas of spine parenchyma orfilum terminale (myxopapillary ependymoma): surgical resection is mainstay of treatment, radiation is considered if residual tumor is present postoperativelyc. Extensive craniospinal radiation to entire neuroaxis required for patients presenting with CSF disseminationd. Response to chemotherapy is suboptimal; this treatment modality is considered for patients with contraindications to radiation (e.g., children younger than 3 years or patients with recurrent disease )8. Prognosis: generally favorable, especially adults with myxopapillary ependymomas (except for 10%-20% of cases that have CSF dissemination)9. Reduced survival has been associated with young age at onset and anaplastic histopathologic features, and higher risk of recurrence with partial resectionsK. Subependymoma 1. Slow-growing large firm masses most often occurring infourth ventricle, arising from medulla or lateral ventricles attached to septum pellucidum2. Age at presentation: usually between 40 and 60 years 3. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-12): cells with roundnuclei and sparse cytoplasm; admixed with microcystic clusters and foci of calcification on a fibrillary background4. Neuroimaging characteristics: mildly hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images often with heterogeneous appearance and little to no enhancementA. Ganglion Cell Neoplasms 1. Rare, slow-growing, benign well-circumscribed firmtumors often occurring in temporal lobes, sometimes with cystic or calcified foci2. Age at presentation: first 3 decades 3. Most common presentation: seizures (oftenintractable) 4. Predilection for temporal lobes (followed by frontal andparietal lobes); much less common, cerebellum and spinal cord5. Neuroimaging characteristics: classically appear as well-circumscribed cystic mass (hyperintense on T2weighted images) with a mural nodule with variable enhancement6. Microscopic features a. Presence of both neuronal (ganglion) and glial neoplasticcells b. Gangliocytoma: tumors with predominance ofneoplastic ganglion cells without an obvious astrocytic componentc. Ganglioglioma: tumors containing neoplastic glial cells that often outnumber ganglion cellsd. Some neoplastic ganglion cells are binucleated or multinucleated (unfortunately not always present, but quite helpful when present) (Fig. 16-13)7. Treatment a. Resection b. Radiotherapy: reserved for recurrent tumor or thosewith anaplastic histopathologic features 8. Prognosisa. Most carry benign prognosis with total or subtotal resectionb. Anaplastic histopathologic features: less favorable prognosisB. Central Neurocytomas 1. Neoplasms of neuronal differentiation 2. Rare (about 0.5% of all primary CNS tumors), occurprimarily in young adults between second and fourth decades3. Commonly present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (most commonly, headaches)4. Most commonly an intraventricular location, often at foramen of Monro: 50% of all intraventricular tumors in adults5. Microscopic features: sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei; immunoreactive for synaptophysin6. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous signal (isointense or hyperintense on T2-weighted images) with heterogeneous enhancement (Fig. 6-14)7. Treatment often involves resection (total, if possible) 8. Benign prognosis with total or subtotal resection, withlong survival ratesC. Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor (DNET) 1.

Commonly presents as slow-growing cerebellar mass with increased intracranial pressure2. Commonly presents in the fourth decade 3. Associated with Cowden’s disease (about 50% ofpatients with dysplastic gangliocytoma have clinical stigmata of Cowden’s disease)4. Macroscopic features: hypertrophied, thickened cerebellar folia (Fig. 16-15)5. Microscopic features a. Enlarged ganglion cells (neurons) replace granule cells,atrophy of granular layer b. Loss of Purkinje cells c. Reduction and cavitation of cerebellar white matter6. Neuroimaging: laminated increased T2 signal without enhancementE.

      "abstract": "Objective: To report a case of delirium involving a drug interaction of the antidepressant phenelzine in combination with an opiate and to discuss the exacerbation of delirium secondary to a withdrawal syndrome caused by the abrupt discontinuation of phenelzine. Case Summary: A 67-year-old white woman with a history of major depression and chronic anxiety developed delirium shortly after the postsurgical administration of opioid analgesics. In addition, she was taking the antidepressant phenelzine and had been maintained on this medication for approximately 20 years. Her presenting symptoms included combativeness, auditory and visual hallucinations, and persecutory delusions. After development of the delirium, the patient's phenelzine medication was abruptly discontinued, introducing a withdrawal syndrome that further aggravated her condition. Discussion: This case emphasizes the importance of the potentially fatal drug interaction involving phenelzine and opiates and addresses the adverse consequences of abruptly discontinuing phenelzine during phenelzine–opiate–induced delirium. Phenelzine–opiate interactions and phenelzine withdrawal should be considered as possible etiologies of delirium in patients with a history of phenelzine use. Conclusions: Less widely prescribed antidepressants such as phenelzine may be unfamiliar to contemporary clinicians, resulting in adverse consequences for patients, such as phenelzine–opiate drug interactions and phenelzine withdrawal.",

This case appears to be an example of \"acute lethal catatonia\" or the neuroleptic \"malignant\" syndrome, both of which may be due to disturbances of dopamine function within the CNS. Such cases are rare, but may be dramatic in their presentation; however, antipsychotic drugs must be withheld during the duration of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "<ns4:p>This is a review of hypnotic drug risks and benefits, reassessing and updating advice presented to the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (United States FDA). Almost every month, new information appears about the risks of hypnotics (sleeping pills). The most important risks of hypnotics include excess mortality, especially overdose deaths, quiet deaths at night, infections, cancer, depression and suicide, automobile crashes, falls, and other accidents, and hypnotic-withdrawal insomnia. Short-term use of one-two prescriptions is associated with greater risk per dose than long-term use. Hypnotics have usually been prescribed without approved indication, most often with specific contraindications, but even when indicated, there is little or no benefit. The recommended doses objectively increase sleep little if at all, daytime performance is often made worse, not better, and the lack of general health benefits is commonly misrepresented in advertising. Treatments such as the cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia and bright light treatment of circadian rhythm disorders offer safer and more effective alternative approaches to insomnia.</ns4:p>",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dysphagia is a sensation of food being \"stuck\" up in its passage from the mouth to stomach. It is of two main types, oropharyngeal dysphagia, and esophageal dysphagia. In oropharyngeal dysphagia, there is difficulty in transferring the food from the mouth to upper esophagus. Thus, this dysphagia is also called as transfer dysphagia. It occurs within 1 st 1-2 s of the swallow. We also call this dysphagia as instant dysphagia. It is almost always associated with sinobronchial symptoms. The second type of dysphagia is esophageal dysphagia in which there is difficulty in passing the food from upper esophagus to the stomach. The two main mechanisms responsible for dysphagia are either a problem with the motor function of oropharynx or esophagus (neuromuscular causes) or mechanical narrowing of oropharynx or esophagus (mechanical dysphagia). As this dysphagia occurs a little later in the act of swallowing, we can call it delayed dysphagia. The mechanical cause of dysphagia includes benign strictures, malignancies, webs and rings, retropharyngeal abscesses, Zenker′s diverticulum, cricopharyngeal bar, and some vascular causes. We report an 80-year-old male with vascular dysphagia.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "Daniella Meytin1 1Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Academy of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Abstract Bulimia nervosa is one of the most common eating disorders. The disease manifests in episodes of binge eating, accompanied by attempts to get rid of the food eaten by vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals, along with excessive concerns, regarding weight and appearance. The disease is more common in the Western culture, among women, especially among younger aged (usually beginning in late adolescence). The onset of the disease is influenced by biological and environmental factors. Due to laxative use, hypokalemia and arrhythmias may develop; due to vomiting – enamel damage and voice changes. Bulimia nervosa is diagnosed, if, during the last 3 months, the patient had at least 1 episode of binge eating per week, accompanied by compensatory actions (vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals). Treatment is started with psychotherapy, if it does not help or the patient is additionally diagnosed with depression, SSRI or SNRI treatment is added. 80% of treated patients achieve remission of the disease. Aim: to determine the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. Methods: a systematic review of the literature was performed using the PubMed medical database. Selected articles examining the etiology, epidemiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. English word combinations were used for search: bulimia nervosa, eating disorder, bulimia, bulimia diagnostics, bulimia treatment. Conclusions: after systematic literature review was conducted, the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa were presented. Keywords: bulimia nervosa, eating disorders, bulimia, psychiatry.",

It is a result of the abrupt changes forced on travellers' sense of time, place and wellbeing, and on their internal cycles. It is manifested in its early phase by exhaustion out of proportion to the length of the flight, disorientation to time, and disruption in sense of wellbeing, memory and performance. In the later phase, profound exhaustion, constipation or diarrhea, anorexia, insomnia, headache, and limited night and peripheral vision may be experienced. Light, food, methylated xanthines (coffee, tea, etc.), physical and mental activity, alcohol and smoking affect bodily rhythms. Awareness and manipulation of these 'cues' before, during and after a flight can significantly reduce jet lag.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Cases of sudden and unexpected deaths of criminal suspects in presence of police always have special forensic medical approach. Often, such deaths are preceded by a state of extreme psychophysical activity (excitated delirium) of suspects, when they may injure themselves. Police attempts to prevent that can inevitably lead to struggle. Immediately after the struggle ends (but also during a struggle), they abruptly become unresponsive, and develop cardiopulmonary arrest and death. Presence of drugs significantly intensifies the harmful effect of such state and leads to death. Case outline. We present a case of death of a young man brought into custody during police interrogation. Autopsy showed injuries and presence of MDMA, with suspicion that death was preceded by the state of excitated delirium. After thorough analysis of the case (complete autopsy, toxicological screening, microscopic survey of all organs, circumstances of death etc.), our conclusion is that death was related to drug consumption - ecstasy. Concentration of ecstasy found in kidneys is the minimum concentration possible that could lead to heart malfunction and death. Conclusion. Our opinion is that there are no medical data by which we could determine if, and in what dosage, undesirable effects of ecstasy were enhanced by the circumstances of the case. .",

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

Those who had psychotic reactions after taking MDMA have a great chance to react in the same way when taking the drug again. Other authors present similar observations.

It rarely occurs in Postpartum Psychosis. An intriguing phenomenon with ongoing debates, particularly about its feature and prevalence, its course, occurrence, and phenomenon in the postpartum period are poorly understood. Case presentation A 26-year-old Nepalese woman presented to the emergency for abnormal behavior on her 9th postpartum day. Capgras delusion was observed for 2 days during her hospital stay. Other psychotic symptoms appeared progressively and were treated as a case of Postpartum Psychosis. Conclusion This case describes the temporal sequence of various psychopathologies during Postpartum Psychosis including Capgras delusion. We attempt to explain the occurrence of Capgras delusion in Postpartum Psychosis.",

Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

TBI-related cognitive impairment is common in veterans who have served in recent conflicts in the Middle East and is often related to blasts from improvised explosive devices. Although neurobehavioral disorders such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder commonly occur after combat, the presentation of such disorders in those with head injury may pass undetected with use of current diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological instruments.

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

The alteration of consciousness during epileptic seizures is discussed with respect to these findings: Alterations of consciousness during epileptic seizures may be produced by subcortical, i.e., reticular formation, and/or cortical dysfunction followed by excessive, hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. An impairment of consciousness during absence seizures may be due mainly to cortical dysfunction; during complex partial seizures (CPS), it may be due to dysfunctional subcortical neuronal structures. The mechanisms underlying an alteration of consciousness are defined as causing “irritative” functional disturbances and/or as having “inhibitory” effects on consciousness‐related structures.",

      "title": "Some Considerations of the Tolerability of Ketamine for ECT Anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Most anesthetic agents used for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have few intrinsic adverse effects. Ketamine, however, is well known to be associated with a variety of adverse effects including nausea, dizziness, and psychotomimetic phenomena. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous reports on the use of ketamine for ECT anesthesia, with varied assessments on how prominent these adverse effects are in the ECT situation. Ketamine has received a resurgence of interest as an ECT anesthetic of late owing to its established independent antidepressant effects and to theoretical reasons why it might lessen the cognitive adverse effects of ECT. In this case series, the author reviews the experience with 14 patients who had undergone ECT who were switched to ketamine as anesthetic from methohexital at the preference of the treating anesthesiologist. All 14 patients spontaneously reported a strong preference not to be given ketamine again due to bothersome adverse effects. The latter consisted of either vestibular-type symptoms (nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and vertigo) or psychotomimetic effects (dissociative phenomena). It is concluded that ketamine is not free of adverse effects when used as an ECT anesthetic. Electroconvulsive therapy clinicians should be vigilant about assessing for these effects when ketamine is used, and consideration should be given to using a benzodiazepine such as diazepam or midazolam at seizure termination when ketamine anesthesia is used to prevent bothersome adverse effects seen upon awakening.",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

      "abstract": "• The \"nonspecific\" and nonpharmacologic aspects of taking medication are important in several clinical situations: when patients insist on a medicine that is not clinically indicated; when they refuse an appropriate medication; when they are repeatedly troubled by side effects from a variety of drugs; and when they do not adhere to the regimen. The patient's behavior in these situations may be motivated by the psychological meanings, interpersonal communications, or social consequences of taking pills. The physician may be able to identify these psychosocial factors by learning about the patient's prior experiences with medications, by eliciting his views of physicians and medical care, and by understanding the consequences of becoming a patient.

The schizophrenic individual tries to deal with these signs that besiege him or her either by means of an interpretative attitude (a stable delusional mood) or by apathy. These two types of responses correspond with the stereotypical (and mood) processes by which the schizophrenic individual attempts to avoid the distress provoked by the enigmatic desire of the Other, while simultaneously corresponding with psychosomatic processes of the brain organ.",

Prevention should be the priority strategy for dealing with abuse. The most common psychoactive substances in abuse are: alcohol, nicotine, hemp, cocaine, heroin, medicinal drugs. Information about psychoactive substances prohibited for circulation in the state is aggressively disseminated through mass media, the Internet, films, and computer games. Abuse of psychoactive substances affects the quality of life and health, has negative physical, physiological, and psychological consequences. Forensic and pharmaceutical, criminal and legal studies indicate that the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine, under the procedural guidance of prosecutors of all levels, take operative and investigative measures and investigative actions. In the structure of polydrug addiction, the syndrome of dependence due to the use of alcohol, which develops after multiple simultaneous use of psychoactive alcohol-containing liquids, alcoholic beverages (beer, vodka, wine), psychoactive alcohol drugs, prevails. Comorbid disorders associated with polydrug addiction were systematized. Estimated that 51.6% are mental illnesses. The results of an interdisciplinary forensic and pharmaceutical, organizational and legal, clinical and pharmacological study indicate the need for further multi-stage pharmacotherapy of polydrug addiction and related comorbid disorders during drug circulation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Aims Recreational drugs are taken for their positive mood effects, yet their regular usage damages well‐being. The psychobiological mechanisms underlying these damaging effects will be debated. Methods The empirical literature on recreational cannabinoids and stimulant drugs is reviewed. A theoretical explanation for how they cause similar types of damage is outlined. Results All psychoactive drugs cause moods and psychological states to fluctuate. The acute mood gains underlie their recreational usage, while the mood deficits on withdrawal explain their addictiveness. Cyclical mood changes are found with every central nervous system stimulant and also occur with cannabis. These mood state changes provide a surface index for more profound psychobiological fluctuations. Homeostatic balance is altered, with repetitive disturbances of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, and disrupted cortisol‐neurohormonal secretions. Hence, these drugs cause increased stress, disturbed sleep, neurocognitive impairments, altered brain activity, and psychiatric vulnerability. Equivalent deficits occur with novel psychoactive stimulants such as mephedrone and artificial “spice” cannabinoids. These psychobiological fluctuations underlie drug dependency and make cessation difficult. Psychobiological stability and homeostatic balance are optimally restored by quitting psychoactive drugs. Conclusions Recreational stimulants such as cocaine or MDMA (3.4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and sedative drugs such as cannabis damage human homeostasis and well‐being through similar core psychobiological mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Chronic non-cancer pain, defined by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as lasting beyond three months, significantly affects individuals’ quality of life and is often linked to various medical conditions or injuries. Its management is complex. Cannabis, containing the key compounds Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), has garnered interest for its potential in pain management, though it remains controversial due to its psychoactive effects and illegal status in many countries. THC provides pain relief by blocking nociceptive stimuli but has psychoactive effects and may potentially induce dependency. CBD has calming and antipsychotic properties. The inhalation of cannabis offers quick relief but poses respiratory risks, while its oral administrations are safer but act more slowly. Short-term cannabis use can impair cognition and motor skills, while long-term use may lead to dependency and cognitive decline, especially if used from an early age. Adverse effects vary by gender and prior use, with addiction mainly linked to THC and influenced by genetics. Despite these risks, patients often report more benefits, such as improved quality of life and reduced opioid use, although the evidence remains inconclusive. The legal landscape for medical cannabis varies globally, with some positive public health outcomes like reduced opioid-related issues in areas where it is legalized. Cannabis shows promise in managing chronic pain, but its psychoactive effects and dependency risks necessitate cautious use. Future research should prioritize long-term clinical trials to establish optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety, aiding in the development of informed guidelines for safe cannabis use in chronic pain management. This review examines the use of cannabis in managing chronic non-cancer pain, focusing on its benefits, drawbacks, mechanisms, delivery methods, and impact on quality of life.",

She consulted to psychiatry, seven months after his father died of lung cancer, he frequently smoked tobacco and cannabis at home, had been diagnosed a year before his death. The patient described increased anxiety symptoms, with panic attacks, hypnopompic and hypnagogic hallucinations, and increased depersonalization and de-realization phenomena. She denies the use of psychoactive substances in addition to tobacco and alcohol, occasionally. Likewise, the depressive symptomatology was objectified in relation to the grief for the loss of his father. She received treatment with SSRIs and two months later, referred partial remission of symptoms, with persistence of dissociative symptoms. In addition, she presents emotional instability, feelings of emptiness, self-defeating ideas without structured suicide ideation. In recent months, he has presented avoidant behaviors and isolation with affectation in his habitual functioning. Now, in this case: are depersonalization and de-realization normal, part of the anxiety crisis, a sign of a high-risk mental state, or a prelude to a serious mental illness?

Second, they consistently demonstrate relapse to the agent of abuse; that is, they attempt to stop using the drug for varying periods of time but return to it despite a specific intent to avoid it. This treatment approach is not necessary for those abusers who can, in fact, learn to set limits on their use of alcohol or drugs; their use may be treated as a behavioral symptom in a more traditional psychotherapeutic fashion. Nor is it directed at those patients for whom the addictive pattern is most unmanageable (e.g., addicted people with unusual destabilizing circumstances such as homelessness, severe character pathology, or psychosis). These patients may need special supportive care (e.g., inpatient detoxification or long-term residential treatment).",

      "abstract": "Taking opiates for medical purposes without supervision of healthcare professionals and non-medical purposes can cause different consequences such as delirium or even injury, and may cause addiction over a longer period of time. The most common recreational opium is heroin, while opium is rarely used. Opiate groups include opium, morphine, heroin, methadone and codeine. Addiction is manifested through physical and psychological dependence. Physical or biological dependence refers to the change in the biological state of the organism, while psychic addiction implies the forced necessity of entering the substance into the organism in order to restore good mood and to avoid the suffering of certain substances. Addiction leads to acute intoxication characterized by euphoria, facial redness, pruritus, impaired breathing depth, hypotension and bradycardia. Apart from the symptoms of acute intoxication, the use of opiates can lead to serious and even lethal consequences such as neurological diseases, hepatitis, HIV and AIDS. Treatment of opiate dependence implies treatment with naloxone and clinical treatment. Very important for the treatment of overexpression is to determine tolerance to opiates to determine the required dose of the drug. In the Republic of Croatia, the legal framework for the fight against drug abuse is based on the Criminal Code and the Law on Combating Drug Abuse, while at the European Union level the National Strategy for the Suppression of Drug Abuse in the Republic of Croatia was adopted. This research was carried out in order to determine the existence of differences in urban and rural addicts with regard to social demographic characteristics.Research has shown that addicts in urban areas are equally to addicts in rural areas by the time of arrival to the drogs band that addicts in urban and rural areas relatively early start with addiction treatment. The study included 57 respondents divided by sex and area of residence. From the data on opiate abuse by observing the most addicted counties, it is represented in Zagreb and Zagreb County, followed by Istrian and Krapina-Zagorje County. Heptane is the most widely used main source consumed in the city of Zagreb.",

During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

The feeling of anxiety often recedes into the background and such patients present to nonpsychiatric physicians with mainly somatic symptoms. The consequences of frequent panic attacks, named panic disorder, are agoraphobia with impairment of psychic and social functioning, increased prevalence of alcohol abuse, depression and, in particular, suicidal attempts. It is of the utmost importance that physicians recognize the somatic symptoms of panic anxiety and plan integrated treatment. The main therapeutic resources at present include antidepressants, selected benzodiazepines and behavioral treatments and are very successful in improving panic attacks and their consequences, which may long go undiagnosed.",

      "abstract": "Abuse of alcohol (ethanol) and abuse of an increasing number of drugs (e.g. analgesics and sedatives) are among the outstanding social and medical problems of many industrialized countries including Switzerland. Since alcohol consumption has profound effects on both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of a variety of drugs, the rational use of drugs in alcoholics is an increasingly difficult task and requires a thorough understanding of the physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic and toxic actions of alcohol. Clinically the most important targets of alcohol action are the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), both of which are frequently involved in the mediation of potentially fatal interactions between drugs and alcohol. In practice the most important of these interactions include (a) inhibition of hepatic (cytochrome P450 dependent) drug oxidation by acute alcohol ingestion resulting in increased bioavailability of drugs that are predominantly excreted by hepatic metabolism, (b) inhibition of acetaldehydedehydrogenase by some drugs with production of an acute flushing reaction to alcohol, (c) increased sensitivity of the CNS to a variety of sedative drugs following acute alcohol ingestion leading to enhanced CNS toxicity of most psychoactive drugs, (d) stimulation of hepatic drug oxidation and decreased CNS sensitivity to sedatives after chronic alcohol abuse, thus explaining the \"metabolic\" and pharmacodynamic tolerance of these patients towards psychoactive agents, and (e) depressed drug metabolism and increased CNS sensitivity to sedative and hypnotic drugs in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The mechanisms and practical consequences of the clinically most important influences of acute and chronic alcohol ingestion on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic actions of drugs are outlined.",

It has been found that among the representatives of bodies and institutions of execution of punishments the most common are socially acceptable or neutral or comparatively dangerous types of addictive behavior, in particular computer or Internet addiction, workaholism, etc. Among the more socially dangerous forms of addictive behavior, chemical addictions (the use of alcohol and other psychoactive substances – cannabinoids, opiates, psychostimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, etc.), hallucinogens of natural and synthetic origin, as well as the abuse of hypnotic-sedative drugs) and non-chemical addictions (addictions), which at this time, according to researchers, there are currently more than two hundred forms (pathological tendency to gambling; ludomania – sweepstakes, lotteries, slot machines, casinos, less often – card games) are common.

Chronotype, which represents individual preferences for activity and performance, is associated with human health issues, particularly psychiatric disorders. This narrative review, which focuses on the relationship between chronotype and mental disorders, provides an insight into the potential mechanism. Recent evidence indicates that (1) the evening chronotype is a risk factor for depressive disorders and substance use disorders, whereas the morning chronotype is a protective factor. (2) Evening chronotype individuals with bipolar disorder tend to have more severe symptoms and comorbidities. (3) The evening chronotype is only related to anxiety symptoms. (4) The relationship between chronotype and schizophrenia remains unclear, despite increasing evidence on their link. (5) The evening chronotype is significantly associated with eating disorders, with the majority of studies have focused on binge eating disorders. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms or influence factors are described in detail, including clock genes, brain characteristics, neuroendocrinology, the light/dark cycle, social factors, psychological factors, and sleep disorders. These findings provide the latest evidence on chronotypes and psychiatric disorders and serve as a valuable reference for researchers.",

Experimental binges provide a valid model for examining aspects of the gradual progression from drug use to abuse, particularly when attempting to identify environmental and genetic factors that may prompt intermittent behavioral routines to become dysregulated, as exemplified during cycles of bingeing. Here we explore binge behavior in animals with a particular focus on data obtained from self-administration studies that utilize conditions that allow for both unrestricted and prolonged access to cocaine, opiates, alcohol or food. Many behavioral and neural effects of bingeing are shared between these substances, indicating that the repetitive nature of binge behavior for many types of drug abuse may be related to the dysregulation of common neural circuits. Interestingly, intense bingeing occurs with the emergence of two potential changes in behavior; an increase in the rate or an increase in the persistence of behavioral responding. These two changes indicate that control over bingeing may be determined by a number of processes, including sensitization, tolerance, and withdrawal.",

It causes various health effects such as nausea, sweating, chills, muscle cramping, etc. The effect of this drug can be seen in 3 to 5 hours in the body. A spike in body temperature can be seen in MDMA users that can be fatal as it affects the liver, kidney, and heart leading to death. Addiction to MDMA is not yet proven, however, withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue and depression are noted. MDMA is usually taken via the mouth or snorting in the form of tablets or capsules. This drug is also taken or abused along with other drugs such as LSD, alcohol, and marijuana. MDMA is a scheduled drug with no proven medical use. MDMA causes a surge of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain to regulate mood, learning, memory, stress, anxiety, etc. This chapter discusses the effects of MDMA on the human brain.",

Both showed a distinctly abnormal appearance. Clinicians attributed these symptoms to psychiatric illness, but the symptoms disappeared rapidly after drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Discussion: The only previous report of depression from olanzapine involved a medication interaction with fluoxetine. Another report described olanzapine-induced orbital-frontal syndrome, with childlike oversimplicity. If such symptoms are observed, the discontinuation of olanzapine is recommended.

Cannabis may be used to self-medicate depressive symptoms, though there is little evidence that this is effective. Whilst cannabis may also be used for self-medication in bipolar disorder, it has a number of effects on the emergence, presentation, treatment, and prognosis of the illness. Cannabis use may also increase sub-clinical manic symptoms in non-clinical populations. Future research is then suggested to resolve some of the discrepancies in the literature.",

Auditory hallucinations were also associated with dystonia and may relate to tegmental pathology. This patient also manifested panic attacks independent of dystonia, visual illusions resembling post-hallucinogen perceptions, paranoia, bipolar mood disturbance, compulsions, generailzed anxiety (GA), dystonia and parkinsonism independent of delirium and panic, and myocionus. Neuropsychological findings are also presented. The conditions are discussed in relation to midbrain structures and clinical management. These disorders may relate to pathology of midbrain structures and tracts pertaining to serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, cerebellum, reticular formation, and peripheral sensation. Carbamazepine (CBZ) improved bipolar disorder, paranola, panic, compulsions, and GA but low-dose CBZ actually exacerbated GA. Trihexyphenldyl (THP) improved dystonia and parkinsonism but worsened paranoia, panic, compulsions, and GA. THP improved dystonic frequency before reducing dystonic severity. Paroxetine improved illusions and dystonia but seemed to precipitate panic attacks, illusions resembled pannopsia and post-hallucinogen perceptual disorder and may relate to reduced stimulation of 5HT2 serotonin receptors. Careful clinical vigilance and planning are indicated when treating patients with midbrain pathology.",

Auditory hallucinations are especially likely to swiftly be considered due to psychiatric illness. An elderly patient with chronic auditory hallucinations without other significant psychopathology nor other symptoms prompted reflection and literature review. Objectives To review differential diagnosis of auditory hallucinosis. Methods Pubmed search for terms: auditory and hallucinosis. Results Hallucinations should be evaluated according to: type, onset and evolution, association with physical and /or neurological symptoms, association with other hallucinations and/or other psychopathology, characteristics. Auditory hallucinations may present along a continuum from tinnitus, simple, verbal, musical. The Pubmed search retrieved articles pertaining to auditory hallucinations associated with: 1. Sensory deprivation; 2. Hearing loss, auditory Charles Bonnet syndrome; 3. Dementia, neurodegenerative disorders; 4. Brainstem lesions; 5. Other central nervous lesions: thalamus, temporal, other; 6. Epilepsy; 7. Tic disorders; 8. Alcohol use disorders; 9. Borderline personality disorder; 10. Others. Conclusions Patients presenting with auditory hallucinosis should be carefully evaluated to exclude non-psychiatric disorders. In some patients, such as the one who prompted the review, an identifiable cause may not yet be found. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Presentation of Caffeine Intoxication in an Active Duty Service Member Originally Believed to Have a Psychotic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Caffeine has the highest use of any psychoactive substance worldwide and is highly appealing to military personnel who are required to work the long, grueling hours necessary to complete a mission. However, published reports of caffeine intoxication in the medical literature are rare. Individuals undergoing military training experience long work hours in a stressful environment. These conditions can make various caffeine supplements enticing. However, most energy drinks contain multiple serving sizes, and supplements are often packaged in large containers, increasing individuals' risk of caffeine overconsumption and intoxication. Additionally, young adults in stressful environments are the classic demographic in which the first presentation of a psychiatric illness, such as psychotic disorder, occurs. Interestingly, many of the presenting signs and symptoms, including agitation, restlessness, insomnia, tremors, tachycardia, and psychomotor agitation, are the same in both diagnoses. This stresses the importance of differentiating caffeine intoxication from a psychotic disorder. We present a novel case of an active-duty Service member who presented to the emergency room with symptoms concerning the psychotic disorder. After a more detailed history was acquired, caffeine intoxication became more likely and was ultimately treated. We discuss the overlap in presentation and thus difficulty in differentiating caffeine intoxication from a psychotic disorder.",

      "title": "Hypnodiagnostic and Hypnotherapeutic Fantasy-Evocation and Acting-out Techniques",
      "abstract": "Abstract During the past five years, we have been experimenting with a number of hypnotic techniques with which to reach patients who have little or no motivation, at least at first, for psychotherapy. For the most part, these techniques have been utilized with patients with real or apparent medical or surgical disease, who had been, so far as can be judged, medically or surgically sick for five, ten or more years. The more usual interviewing techniques frequently could give us no clues, even so far as differential diagnosis (of organic from emotional disease) was concerned. As a result, techniques were devised whereby these patients were hypnotized, sometimes without their knowledge or conscious consent, but nevertheless always with their consent implied, without at any time using the word “sleep” or suggesting eye-closure, so that, by the use of other techniques still under investigation, symptoms could be precipitated or intensified even to the point of having asthmatic or epileptic attacks reproduced, for instance, during the consultation session. By still other techniques, symptom-formation was then blocked and the inevitable, resultant anxiety reaction repressed, so that underlying fantasies could erupt into conscious awareness even to the point of being acted out. An asthmatic patient, for example, when his asthmatic attack was blocked, acted out the killing of his girl friend by knocking her to the floor and jumping over and over again on her abdomen. An adolescent, with what was thought to be probable extra-pyramidal disease, began to masturbate. Examples could be multiplied almost ad inftnitum In all cases, symptoms served more than one function, and several such functions would be acted out either concurrently or one after the other. Such reactions have been utilized for the purpose of differential diagnosis, but not in the more usual sense of the term. We cannot, for instance, say that these patients do not have asthma, epilepsy, etc. By means of these techniques, however, we have found it possible to determine, and to determine rapidly, the neurotic or psychotic functions which their symptoms serve, and, in addition, to state further that, irrespective of whether or not it be asthma, epilepsy, etc., specific patients with these diagnoses can be helped and even “cured,” after having been taken partly or completely off medication, by psychiatric treatment. This can proceed in two different ways: (a) With patients who are poorly motivated toward treatment, substitute symptoms may be set up, provided they serve the same neurotic needs, or other specifically hypnotherapeutic techniques utilized. (b) Patients who can come into a good therapeutic relationship, sometimes as a result of the hypnodiagnostic procedures listed above, can then be treated both (1) by the more usual psychotherapeutic techniques, either on non-hypnotic or hypnotic levels, and, in addition, (2) by techniques made possible only by the hypnotic interpersonal relationship. Some of these, again, are acting-out techniques. There is little in the whole field of hypnotherapy that is not controversial. This applies even to a definition of hypnosis. However, from the angle of approach of the material presented in this chapter, we tentatively incline to believe that whatever else, in addition, the hypnotic interpersonal relationship is, it seems to be a fantasy-evoking one in which the patient, on the basis of his own experiential background and with more ready access to his pre-conscious, thinks, feels, experiences, reacts and even acts-out exactly as he believes the hypnotist wishes him to, projecting his own impulses, desires and fantasies to the therapist. Or—and this is of course the same thing—his reaction may negativistically be the very opposite of this. For this reason, when techniques of this type are utilized, no direct suggestion at any time is given the patient. When treatment of this type is decided upon, calculated risks must at times be taken. These include those of suicide by the patient, of collaboration by the therapist in the fantasies of his patient, and of acting-out by the patient of the fantasies of the therapist. Such pitfalls, for the most part, so it is believed, can be avoided.",

      "abstract": "The quite diffused habit of a significant assumption of alcohol drinks, can interfere with the professional exposure to chemical substances. The interaction may result in increasing their toxicity and/or modifying the parameters of the biological monitoring. It may also act as a confounding factor, not only in epidemiologic researches but also at individual level when the assessment of the occupational exposure and/or the diagnosis of an occupational diseases, is under consideration. We review available references in the literature summarizing major scientific evidences.The interaction between the alcohol assumption and industrial chemicals may be toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic. Alcohol can interfere in the processes of biotransformation of xenobiotics and modify the doses and the effect indicators used for the biological monitoring, causing wrong interpretations of the results. The metabolism of ethanol can be altered by the exposures to toxic industrial materials, creating some clinical pictures of alcohol intolerance, like an \"antabuse syndrome\" or an \"degreaser flush syndrome\". Professional exposure to carbon sulfide or to dimethylformamides, trichloroethylene as well as to nitroglycerin and nitroglycole ethylenic can produce similar syndromes. Interactions are reported between alcohol and solvents: on toxicokinetic bases for methanol, isopropanol, glycol ether, trichloroethylene, methyl ethyl ketone and toluene; and on toxicodynamic bases for CNS. Also between alcohol and metals there can occur toxicokinetic interactions, like in the case of lead and mercury. Alcohol can also interfere with the biological monitoring of solvents, producing an over-estimation of the exposure.For the biological monitoring of reported chemical substances, it is suitable to evaluate the biologic indicators in the days in which there is not assumed alcohol. If this cannot be guaranteed, it is necessary to know at least the quantity of the alcohol consumed or at least if the subject is an alcohol abuser.",

Among the questions still to be resolved in this endeavor are questions related to the importance of the metaphysical and phenomenological aspects of the psychedelic experience. Are the hallucinatory experiences engendered by classical psychedelics necessary to their therapeutic action, or could a trip that doesn't go anywhere have the same effect on depression and other conditions? This commentary considers the value of the phenomenological psychedelic experience and asks the larger question, what are any of our phenomenological experiences for?",

The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "abstract": "Abstract olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic widely used for the treatment of mania as monotherapy. In this case, it paradoxically caused mania symptoms in a 40-year-old patient with intermittent explosive disorder. This case presents different characteristics from previous reports, suggesting a direct link between olanzapine and mania symptoms. The patient did not have any psychotic or mood disorder, and the symptoms rapidly disappeared during a medication-free period. Furthermore, there was no discontinuation of other medications, no prominent family history of psychiatric disorder, and no addiction to substances, all of which suggest a connection between manic symptoms and olanzapine. Possible receptor and genomic explanations for this phenomenon are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "To determine the nature and duration of symptoms after the headache phase of migraine, 40 migraineurs (11 with and 29 without an aura) were given a questionnaire to complete on the day after a migraine attack. The most common symptoms that remained were physical and mental tiredness, subdued or depressed mood, impaired concentration, reduced physical activities and yawning; weak or clumsy limbs, head tenderness, neck ache or stiffness, impaired sight and altered fluid balance were less frequent. The number of symptoms ranged from 2 to 11 (average 6) per patient lasting for a mean of 18 h, usually the whole of the next day. Symptoms after the main migraine attack can help to diagnose migraine particularly when there is no aura before the onset of headache. Eliciting postdromes aids patient-doctor rapport and confidence. The range of symptoms lends support to the notion that the whole of the brain is involved in the aftermath of migraine attacks.",

      "title": "ECT: An Effective Treatment in the Screaming Demented Patient",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—As a tertiary inpatient geriatric psychiatry program, we are often exposed to a common treatment dilemma, the screaming demented patient. Very little has been published in this area. The studies reporting on agitation are mostly medical descriptions and pharmacologic trials, with verbal agitation being included under the broader symptom cluster of physical or behavioral agitation.1,2 Agitation is usually poorly defined, and in no studies was verbal agitation considered as a separate variable. As a whole, the medication trials achieved only limited degrees of success. Experience dictates that these successes are often more than offset by medication side-effects and drug toxicity, thus further complicating the patient's presentation and course.3 Partly owing to this lack of effective treatment, Fogel4 suggested the need for further investigation of ECT in the screaming demented patient. Verbal agitation (needless, unstimulated screaming, yelling, moaning) occurs in many psychiatric conditions common to the elderly—delirium, dementia and depression. It is unclear whether this is the result of a common final neurochemical pathway or of differing etiologies in the different conditions.5 We wish to report on a small series of three elderly, verbally agitated patients who showed a dramatic improvement in this symptom with bilateral ECT. In none of these patients was ECT the initial treatment modality employed; neuroleptics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines were tried unsuccsssfully first. One patient clearly met the criteria for major depression and had a past history of ECT-responsive mood disorder. In the other two patients, there was no clear history of major depression either past or current; both had a substantial degree of cognitive impairment. All three patients, exhibited rapid resolution of their screaming behaviour early in their course of ECT. These pilot results suggest some interesting directions. Assuming response to ECT, this might support the hypothesis that screaming in dementia may be a presentation of depression where the other symptoms may be difficult to elicit. On the other hand, the response may suggest a specific response to electrotherapy. Irrespective of the mechanism, ECT appears to provide the possibility of effective therapy in the demented patient who screams and could provide an alternative to the more traditional approach of endless trials of progressively more toxic psychotropic drugs, singly and in combination, with poor outcome and potentially devastating toxicity.",

Another audiogram 2 weeks later showed a complete recovery in both ears accompanied by a clinical resolution in audiovestibular symptoms. Carbamazepine is used to treat partial and generalized seizures, trigeminal neuralgia, and bipolar illness. Adverse effects are not common but most frequently include dizziness, drowziness, nausea, and skin rashes; rare complications are agranulocytosis, bradycardia, and heart block.

ASD can be diagnosed if a person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which the person experiences feelings of dissociation, reexperiences symptoms, shows marked avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, and experiences hyperarousal. For the diagnosis of ASD to be given, the distress must be present for a minimum of two days and a maximum of four weeks and must occur within four weeks of the traumatic event. Other common reactions to extreme stressors include physical complaints, such as chronic pain, fatigue, stomach pains, breathing problems, and headaches, and self-destructive or impulsive behavior, such as alcohol or drug abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, suicidal impulses, and fast or reckless driving.",

Adjustment of later-life depressives after psychiatric treatment is virtually an unknown area, as is the phenomenon of depression itself with this population. This study addressed these two issues. Community adjustment of younger and older clinically depressed patients after treatment was monitored. Also, adjustment differences in self and other ratings were compared between the two age groups. Results show that there are no significant differences in posttreatment adjustment ratings between the age groups. In addition, it was found that older depressives with a longer history of depression adjust less well than expected. Lastly, older depressives (relative to younger ones), particularly neurotic ones, show the following pattern of adjustment: Less alienation, less vigor, less confidence in skills, poorer work history, less abuse of alcohol or drugs, more social constriction, more agitation, and fewer household management skills.",

Synthetic cannabinoid products have similar effects to those of natural cannabis, yet, these products are more potent and dangerous, and they have been associated with various adverse effects. Here, we review current literature on the epidemiology, acute, and chronic effects of synthetic and natural cannabinoid based drugs. Synthetic drugs contain a mixture of psychoactive compounds that most of them bind cannabinoid receptors with high potency. These synthetic drugs mimic the effects of natural cannabis and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) but they induce more severe adverse effects including respiratory difficulties, hypertension, tachycardia, chest pain, muscle twitches, acute renal failure, anxiety, agitation, psychosis, suicidal ideation, and cognitive impairment. Chronic use of synthetic cannabinoids was associated with serious psychiatric and medical conditions and even death. Given the growing popularity in the use of cannabinoid based drugs and their harmful potential, there is a need for further research in this field.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that continued excessive alcohol consumption can lead to the development of physiological dependence. When drinking is abruptly terminated or substantially reduced in the dependent individual, a characteristic withdrawal syndrome ensues. As with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of chronic alcohol use are opposite in nature to the effects of intoxication. Thus, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal include signs of heightened autonomic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremor), CNS hyperexcitability that may culminate in motor seizures, and, in its most severe form, hallucinosis and delerium tremens (1–3). In addition to physical signs of withdrawal, a constellation of symptoms contributing to psychological discomfort (e.g., irritability, agitation, anxiety, dysphoria) constitute a significant component of the withdrawal syndrome (4–7). The overall intensity of the withdrawal syndrome is presumed to reflect the degree of physiological dependence developed during the course of chronic alcohol use/abuse.",

The stimulation may be at cortical, brainstem, or spinal levels. In this article, the following cortical stimulants are analyzed and discussed: cocaine, amphetamine and related agents, caffeine, cannabinoids, and psychedelic drugs. This review is based on research done using pharmacological textbooks and Medline.The use of cocaine is associated with the occurrence of seizures. The reported frequency varies from 1% to 40% of addicted subjects, based on the typology of the considered study. Amphetamines and related drugs rarely induce epileptic seizures at therapeutic doses, but seizures may occur after the first dosing. Caffeine at high doses may induce epileptic seizures because of its adenosine receptor-antagonizing properties. Marijuana, at variance with other psychostimulants, owing to its serotonin-mediated anticonvulsant action, could have a medical use for the treatment of epilepsy. Psychedelic compounds rarely induce epileptic seizures, but the most common clinical CNS complication after ingestion of ecstasy is the occurrence of seizures.The use of psychostimulants, except for marijuana, can induce single or multiple seizures in healthy subjects.",

      "title": "Drug Addiction: Hyperkatifeia/Negative Reinforcement as a Framework for Medications Development",
      "abstract": "Compulsive drug seeking that is associated with addiction is hypothesized to follow a heuristic framework that involves three stages (binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation) and three domains of dysfunction (incentive salience/pathologic habits, negative emotional states, and executive function, respectively) via changes in the basal ganglia, extended amygdala/habenula, and frontal cortex, respectively. This review focuses on neurochemical/neurocircuitry dysregulations that contribute to hyperkatifeia, defined as a greater intensity of negative emotional/motivational signs and symptoms during withdrawal from drugs of abuse in the withdrawal/negative affect stage of the addiction cycle. Hyperkatifeia provides an additional source of motivation for compulsive drug seeking via negative reinforcement. Negative reinforcement reflects an increase in the probability of a response to remove an aversive stimulus or drug seeking to remove hyperkatifeia that is augmented by genetic/epigenetic vulnerability, environmental trauma, and psychiatric comorbidity. Neurobiological targets for hyperkatifeia in addiction involve neurocircuitry of the extended amygdala and its connections via within-system neuroadaptations in dopamine, enkephalin/endorphin opioid peptide, and γ-aminobutyric acid/glutamate systems and between-system neuroadaptations in prostress corticotropin-releasing factor, norepinephrine, glucocorticoid, dynorphin, hypocretin, and neuroimmune systems and antistress neuropeptide Y, nociceptin, endocannabinoid, and oxytocin systems. Such neurochemical/neurocircuitry dysregulations are hypothesized to mediate a negative hedonic set point that gradually gains allostatic load and shifts from a homeostatic hedonic state to an allostatic hedonic state. Based on preclinical studies and translational studies to date, medications and behavioral therapies that reset brain stress, antistress, and emotional pain systems and return them to homeostasis would be promising new targets for medication development. <h3>Significance Statement</h3> The focus of this review is on neurochemical/neurocircuitry dysregulations that contribute to hyperkatifeia, defined as a greater intensity of negative emotional/motivational signs and symptoms during withdrawal from drugs of abuse in the withdrawal/negative affect stage of the drug addiction cycle and a driving force for negative reinforcement in addiction. Medications and behavioral therapies that reverse hyperkatifeia by resetting brain stress, antistress, and emotional pain systems and returning them to homeostasis would be promising new targets for medication development.",

These symptoms resolved within 1 week of discontinuing baclofen. Rechallenge with baclofen resulted in reemergence of psychotic symptoms, which disappeared after discontinuing baclofen.Reemergence of psychotic symptoms after rechallenge with baclofen suggests baclofen-induced psychosis. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable association of baclofen with this patient's psychosis. The absence of underlying mood disorder makes this case different from previously reported ones.Baclofen may be associated with the occurrence of psychosis.

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

La resonancia magnética reveló necrosis bilateral y simétrica de los globos pálidos, así como atrofia cortical e hipocampal severa. El daño de los globos pálidos probablemente estuvo relacionado con acidosis respiratoria durante el evento. El parkinsonismo palidal debe considerarse en el diagnóstico diferencial de pacientes con trastornos progresivos del movimiento después de una lesión aguda tóxica o hipóxica del sistema nervioso.",

      "abstract": "Kratom, a non-federally regulated botanical herb, is widely growing in popularity as a naturopathic alternative for mood, anxiety, and attention deficit symptoms, along with legal recreational use as a psychoactive agent. It is predominantly sold without restriction and easily accessible over the counter at naturopathic, specialty \"vape\" or \"smoke shops\" and on the internet. Kratom's most abundant alkaloids, Mytragynine (MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-MG), have demonstrated multi-mechanistic properties via dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic, and mu-opioid-type receptors interaction in a dose-dependent manner. Given the reported association between Kratom consumption and its mood-altering and stimulant-like effects, we considered its role in the exacerbation of those predisposed to or with certain preexisting mental health disorders. In addition, Kratom's psychoactive compound derivatives are not detected in routine urine toxicology screens, which may pose a diagnostic obstacle when suspecting its use in critical settings such as acute mania or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Considering its growing availability, potential for addiction, and withdrawal, the authors aim to highlight the need for further research on the potential effects of Kratom and its use as a crucial consideration during assessment, as well as the association between Kratom use and the exacerbation of those predisposed to or with certain preexisting mental health disorders. We concluded that, on balance, there was sufficient evidence to justify the plausibility of the association between Kratom ingestion in exceeding doses and the exacerbation of certain psychiatric manifestations such as psychosis.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty of assessing the effects of mind- altering drugs on human behavior, especially conduct in real-life situations, is discussed. Problems in classification of drugs are also noted; it is emphasized that assumed drug effects are, at best, statements of probability. In considering crimes associated with drug use, it is necessary to distinguish between crimes based on drug use itself, which include all offenses for illicit acquisition, possession, and use of dangerous drugs and narcotics, and dangerous behavior resulting from use. The evidence is clearest for alcohol, revealing a distinct relationship between alcohol use and health hazard, suicide, accidents, and violence. The evidence is less clear for heroin, since most users are delinquent prior to being identified as \"addicts\" so that continued criminality after heroin use cannot be \"caused\" by narcotics. That the kind of criminality engaged in is influenced by drug use does seem a reasonable conclusion. Evidence about the degree of risk for the use of other drugs (sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, volatile intoxicants, and the like) and crime is absent. Generally, it appears that most Americans use drugs without major ill- effects—including occasional illicit use. Those likely to be engaged in drug use and in crime are likely to be urban slum- dwelling males, with an overrepresentation of minority groups. Such behavior is apt to be part of a life pattern of deficit and disorder.",

Drugs, especially those related to neurotransmitters may induce complicated symptoms in the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. Some of these symptoms are accompanied by peripheral neuropathy. Intoxication, especially alcoholism is often are combined with a malnutrition, such as avitaminosis. Dysautonomic symptoms change successively; at an early stage, drugs or toxins stimulate sympathetic or parasympathetic receptors, while the same receptors are inhibited at a later stage when the concentration of the substances rises in the blood. Frequent stimulations of the same receptor may produce change in the sensitivity of receptors, decreased metabolism or addiction. These changes suggest that a different approach towards the acute and chronic autonomic disorders caused by intoxications is needed.",

      "title": "Psychedelic Therapy: A Primer for Primary Care Clinicians—Ibogaine",
      "abstract": "Background: Ibogaine is a plant-derived alkaloid that has been used for thousands of years in rites of passage and spiritual ceremonies in West-Central Africa. In the West, it has primarily been used and studied for its anti-addictive properties and more recently for other neuropsychiatric indications, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and traumatic brain injury. Areas of Uncertainty: Ibogaine requires careful patient screening and monitoring because of significant safety issues. There is potential for cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT interval); without rigorous screening, fatal arrhythmias may occur. However, preliminary research suggests that co-administration of ibogaine with magnesium may mitigate cardiotoxicity. Additionally, ibogaine may have dangerous interactions with opiates, so patients who receive ibogaine treatment for opioid use disorder must withdraw from long-acting opioids. Other potential concerning effects of ibogaine include rare incidences of mania or psychosis. Anticipated transient effects during ibogaine treatment can include ataxia, tremors, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Therapeutic Advances: Robust effects after a single treatment with ibogaine have been reported. In open-label and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ibogaine reduces heroin and opioid cravings by upwards of 50%, up to 24 weeks after the treatment. An observational study of 30 Special Operations Forces veterans with mild traumatic brain injury reported that 86% were in remission from post-traumatic stress disorder, 83% from depression, and 83% from anxiety, one month after a single-dose ibogaine treatment. Limitations: Although there are several observational and open-label studies, there is only a single double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT on ibogaine. More RCTs with large sample sizes must be conducted to support ibogaine's safety and efficacy. Conclusions: Given the promising preliminary findings, ibogaine could potentially fill a much-needed gap in treatments for challenging conditions, including opioid dependence. Ibogaine's remarkable effects in traditionally treatment-resistant, combat-exposed individuals hints at its potential in broader populations with physical and psychological trauma.",

Carbamazepine shows psychotropic effects and seems to improve limbic pathology including aggression and poor impulse control in various psychiatric disorders. Treatment with carbamazepine was evaluated in an open study design in 29 gerontopsychiatric inpatients. Carbamazepine was efficient in treating agitated behavior disturbances in dementia and other disorders. Adverse effects of the drug showed up only in a small percentage of the patients and were reversible after discontinuation of the drug. The results suggest that carbamazepine may be effective in treating agitated behavior in gerontopsychiatric patients with different disorders.

Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

The gambling disorder is defined as a behavioral addiction, classified in the new diagnostic manual DSM-V under the new category “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” [2]. It was noted that many diagnostic criteria are common between the gambling disorder and substance abuse as: the continued exposure to the game/drugs despite the negative effects, the craving [3], the development of tolerance, withdrawal symptoms [4], repeated attempts to quit and relapse [5]. The gambling disorder is a psychiatric disorder emerging that has recently gained much attention because of its increasing prevalence and the consequences for personal, family and social relationships that cause devastating.

In the case of the latter, catatonia mostly resolves when the seizures respond to the anticonvulsive treatment. We report, to our knowledge, the first case of a patient without affective or psychotic disorder, who developed catatonia in the postictum and whose catatonia did not resolve with anticonvulsive treatment, but did so with lorazepam. We describe a 36-year-old man, with no psychiatric history, except for a possible disorder in the use of cannabis, who developed catatonia after epileptic seizures. The catatonia did not respond to the anticonvulsant therapy, but did so to lorazepam 17 mg/d. Lorazepam could be tapered slowly and stopped without reemergence of catatonic signs. Catatonia should be part of the differential diagnosis in patients with bradyphrenia and/or remarkable postictal behavior. This report shows that lorazepam should be taken into consideration (before moving to ECT), in cases of unresolved catatonia, even if the seizures are reduced with anticonvulsants.",

Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

      "title": "Consciousness disorders in schizophrenia:a forgotten land for psychopathology",
      "abstract": "The scientific study of consciousness has been boosted in the last two decades, especially from philosophical and neuroscientific realms. Before that, the topic was neglected, particularly in psychiatry in which, either out-of-consciousness experiences were emphasized (as in psychoanalysis) or consciousness was viewed as epiphenomenic to the underlying organic disorders that had to be studied. This situation has hardly improved in modern psychiatry, perhaps due to the persistence of two competing metaphors of consciousness and of psychiatric constructs (such as kraepelinian dementia praecox) from which consciousness disorders were originally excluded. Accordingly, the role of a disordered consciousness in schizophrenia, which nevertheless was contemplated by Continental psychiatry, has hardly been considered by recent psychopathology research. However, there is growing data showing that certain functions that modern science considers to be part of consciousness (sense of agency, self, episodic and autobiographic memory, executive functions, insight, monitoring) could be impaired in certain schizophrenics and that this may account for symptoms such as thought insertion, depersonalisation, auditory hallucinations, self fragmentation, disorders of episodic and working memory, passive experiences and delusions of control. In this paper the conceptual history of consciousness in psychology, neurology and psychiatry is outlined, and the most prominent recent approaches to the study of its role in schizophrenia are reviewed.",

      "title": "Cannabidiol (CBD): An Innovative Pharmacological Treatment for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)",
      "abstract": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurring and repetitious thoughts coupled to anxiety characterized by obsessive thoughts and associated compulsive behavior(s). OCD patient often fears that the anxiety will not abate and obsessional thoughts will control her/his mind or body in advocating or carrying out unwanted compulsive behaviors. Such thinking patterns or behaviors may often be frightening but usually they are quite harmless except when promoting accompanying anxiogenic activity. Confused thinking may be severe enough to cause functional impairments when obsessions or compulsions dominate mental status. In OCD, disrupted thoughts and actions may dominate the normal conduct of everyday tasks. Anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts is usually relieved by time-consuming and significant effort-requiring compulsive behaviors. Compulsive activities like diversionary counting, checking behavior (e.g., like repeatedly checking whether the stove is on or off), or excessive cleaning activity dominate the response to obsessive thoughts. Excessive hand washing (sometimes called the Pontius Pilot Syndrome) occurring as a compulsive behavior, not only relieves the causal obsession but serves as a “refresh button” (i.e., like that found on a computer)--clearing the mind of obsessions, compulsive urges, and extraneous thoughts. The major extracts of the Cannabis sativa plant are primarilydelta9-THC (causing intoxication, psychosis, often anxiety) and secondarily the non-psychotomimetic compound Cannabidiol (CBD). Studies have found multiple therapeutic actions in the uses of CBD—with anxiolytic activities (i.e., opposing the anxiogenic actions of delta9-THC), anti-psychotic activities, and lessening of the compulsions that occur with OCD and other psychiatric conditions.

Signs include poor judgment, a general negative outlook, excessive worrying, moodiness, irritability, agitation, inability to relax, feeling lonely, isolated or depressed, aches and pains, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, dizziness, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, eating too much or not enough, sleeping too much or not enough, social withdrawal, procrastination or neglect of responsibilities, increased alcohal, nicotine or drug consumption, and nervous habits such as pacing about, nail-biting and neck pains.Occupational stress stress involving work.

El síndrome de Ekbom se ha relacionado con múltiples causas, entre ellas el consumo de estimulantes y con la abstinencia al alcohol. El paciente tiene la convicción delirante monotemática de estar infectado por parásitos, lo cual puede acompañarse de otras manifestaciones como alteraciones sensoperceptivas. OBJETIVOS Analizar el papel de la cocaína en la aparición del síndrome de Ekbom. MATERIAL Y MÉTODO Descripción de un caso clínico y su revisión bibliográfica. Varón de 56 años, sin antecedentes en Salud Mental. Ex consumidor de cannabis y cocaína. Como antecedentes somáticos presenta infección por VHC curada y VIH. Recae en el consumo de cocaína tras fallecimiento de un familiar en Enero 2022, siendo derivado a la Unidad de Hospitalización en Junio 2022 por convicción delirante paranoide y actividad alucinatoria. En la exploración psicopatológica el paciente presenta delirios de infestación y zoopsias. En la exploración física observamos escoriaciones y cicatrices que se corresponden con rascado. Sin embargo, en el examen clínico no se encuentran alteraciones que justifiquen estas lesiones. Al ingreso comienza con Olanzapina 10mg desapareciendo la sintomatología en un par de días. CONCLUSIONES Es necesario hacer un correcto diagnóstico diferencial, mediante un examen clínico exhaustivo, el cual, en este caso, no pone de manifiesto ninguna patología física que justifique el cuadro, a pesar de lo cual el paciente presenta absoluta convicción. La idea delirante se ha relacionado con el aumento de los niveles de dopamina en los ganglios basales por el bloqueo del transportador de dopamina que producen los psicoestimulantes como la cocaína. De esta forma, es imprescindible el cese del consumo de tóxicos y un correcto tratamiento con neurolépticos.",

This definition is derived initially from behavioral models of learning, and in the field of addiction, most work with sensitization refers to the progressive increase in the motor stimulant effect of amphetamine-like psychostimulants that is elicited by repeated drug administration (2,3). Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4). The relative permanence of behavioral sensitization has resulted in frequent use of behavioral sensitization as an animal model of addiction, specifically the enduring changes in behavior that are associated with a diagnosis of psychostimulant addiction, such as the development of craving-mediated drug seeking and paranoia (5, 6).",

Conditions requiring urgent medical care are divided into two groups: (1) mental states leading to aggressive and autoaggressive actions; (2) critical conditions observed in the most severe period of the disease when the abilities of the body's autoregulation are exhausted and preservation of life without contemporary resuscitation measures is impossible. The latter include conditions caused by neurologic and somatic diseases, severe stages of mental disease (for example, febrile schizophrenia, delirium tremens, etc.), complications of treatment, grave vascular psychoses, and postpartum psychoses. The authors describe how a unit providing urgent psychiatric care in a mental hospital should operate.",

      "abstract": "Background In schizophrenia, patient reacts to sad news with cheerfulness or even laughter (Parathymia/Inappropriate affect). In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

He developed a cholinergic rebound syndrome including delirium and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). The delay included time spent in two different medical hospitals: one awaiting psychiatric bedspace, and secondly, when the patient's cholinergic rebound syndrome was misdiagnosed as acute alcohol withdrawal. Once the etiology was recognized, he was promptly treated with anticholinergic medication (benztropine) and retitrated to his outpatient dose of clozapine leading to the resolution of symptoms including delirium and EPS. This case will discuss the challenges of continuity of care in delirious, psychotic, or otherwise confused patients, including contributions from the COVID-19 pandemic. A medication card or other improvements in medication databases that may reduce delays in treatment are discussed.",

Most commonly, it is used to denote a condition in which stimulation in one sensory modality also gives rise to an experience in a different modality. However, conditions involving different qualities within one modality (e.g., when the sight of letter shapes evokes color) are labeled synesthesia as well. Phenomena of this sort have also been reported in patients with eye disease, brain damage, and migraines (e.g., Armel &amp; Ramachandran, 1999; Jacobs, Karpik, Bozian &amp; Gothgen, 1981; Podoll &amp; Robinson, 2002). Similar experiences have been reported in healthy individuals using mescaline and LSD (e.g., Hartman &amp; Hollister, 1963) or drinking psychoactive brews such as Ayahuasca (Shanon, 2002). Divine intervention has also been invoked as a possible trigger of synesthesia.",

      "title": "Caffeine, Mental Health, and Psychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "Caffeine intake is so common that its pharmacological effects on the mind are undervalued. Since it is so readily available, individuals can adjust their own dose, time of administration and dose intervals of caffeine, according to the perceived benefits and side effects of each dose. This review focuses on human studies of caffeine in subjects with and without psychiatric disorders. Besides the possibility of mild drug dependence, caffeine may bring benefits that contribute to its widespread use. These benefits seem to be related to adaptation of mental energy to the context by increasing alertness, attention, and cognitive function (more evident in longer or more difficult tasks or situations of low arousal) and by elevating mood. Accordingly, moderate caffeine intake (< 6 cups/day) has been associated with less depressive symptoms, fewer cognitive failures, and lower risk of suicide. However, its putative therapeutic effects on depression and ADHD have been insufficiently studied. Conversely, in rare cases high doses of caffeine can induce psychotic and manic symptoms, and more commonly, anxiety. Patients with panic disorder and performance social anxiety disorder seem to be particularly sensitive to the anxiogenic effects of caffeine, whereas preliminary data suggests that it may be effective for some patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The threshold for the anxiogenic effect of caffeine is influenced by a polymorphism of the A2A receptor. In summary, caffeine can be regarded as a pharmacological tool to increase energy and effortful behavior in daily activities. More populational (cross-sectional and prospective) and experimental studies are necessary to establish the role of caffeine intake in psychiatric disorders, especially its putative efficacy on depressive mood and cognitive/attentional disorders.",

Depression is usually secondary to alcohol dependence. It is often associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior. The best suited treatment for an association between alcohol dependence and depression is alcohol withdrawal. Antidepressant treatment should only be initiated after at least two weeks of complete withdrawal. Alcohol withdrawal is also suggested for the association between anxiety and alcoholism. Some forms of anxiety, such as social phobia, are particularly often associated with alcoholism, since alcohol is often used for its anxiolytic and disinhibition effects.",

      "title": "[Central neural mechanism of increased pain sensitivity induced by nicotine abstinence].",
      "abstract": "Nicotine is the main addictive component in cigarettes that motivates dependence on tobacco use for smokers and makes it difficult to quit through regulating a variety of neurotransmitter release and receptor activations in the brain. Even though nicotine has an analgesic effect, clinical studies demonstrated that nicotine abstinence reduces pain threshold and increases pain sensitivity in smoking individuals. The demand for opioid analgesics in nicotine abstinent patients undergoing surgery has greatly increased, which results in many side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression, etc. In addition, these side effects would hinder patients' physical and psychological recovery. Therefore, identifying the neural mechanism of the increase of pain sensitivity induced by nicotine abstinence and deriving a way to cope with the increased demand for postoperative analgesics would have enormous basic and clinical implications. In this review, we first discussed different experimental pain stimuli (e.g., cold, heat, and mechanical pain)-induced pain sensitivity changes after a period of nicotine dependence/abstinence from both animal and human studies. Then, we summarized the effects of the brain neurotransmitter release (e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, endogenous opioids, dopamine, and γ-aminobutyric acid) and their corresponding receptor activation changes after nicotine abstinence on pain sensitivity. Finally, we discussed the limits in recent studies. We proposed that more attention should be paid to human studies, especially studies among chronic pain patients, and functional magnetic resonance imaging might be a useful tool to reveal the mechanisms of abstinence-induced pain sensitivity changes. Besides, considering the influence of duration of nicotine dependence/abstinence and gender on pain sensitivity, we proposed that the effects of nicotine abstinence and individual differences (e.g., duration of abstinence from smoking, chronic/acute abstinence, and gender) on abstinence-induced pain sensitivity should be fully considered in formulating pain treatment protocols. In summary, this paper could deepen our understanding of nicotine abstinence-induced pain sensitivity changes and its underlying neural mechanism, and could also provide effective scientific theories to guide clinical pain diagnosis and treatment, which has important clinical significance.",

The history, epidemiology, botany and pharmacology of the mushroom are reviewed. Clinical pictures and treatment are described for: 1) Acute poisoning with psilocybin-containing fungi, 2) Late sequelae of consumption of psilocybin-containing fungi and 3) Poisoning with more poisonous fungi on account of incorrect identification. General practitioners, duty roster doctors, doctors in casualty departments and in acute psychiatric departments should be aware of these problems. Intoxication with psilocybin may be confused with panic anxiety or euphoria in persons with mydriasis and other sympathomimetic symptoms.

      "abstract": "this older aged population suffers from alcoholism.If prolonged, cognitive impairments in the elderly can lead to irreversible deficits that can have a dramatic impact on their quality of life.In order to prevent the adverse effects of alcohol dependence, it's imperative that elderly patients receive proper screening and treatment for substance abuse disorder [7].This paper will discuss commonly seen cognitive deficits caused by alcohol abuse and their various treatment options. Acute effects of Alcohol IntoxicationAlcohol intoxication can cause a broad spectrum of CNS acute and chronic manifestations.Acute alcohol intoxication presents with poor attention span, difficulties with abstract thinking, problem solving, anterograde amnesia, and reduces visuospatial abilities.These manifestations are often precipitated from temporary disruption of neurotransmitter activity within the brain.When used acute, these changes are mostly reversible.A few of the neurochemical systems altered during times of acute alcohol intoxication are the gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA), opiate, dopamine, and glutamine pathways.Changes in the GABA and glutamate pathways are associated with intoxication and sedation while dopamine and opiate pathways are responsible for pleasure and addiction [8].Once absorbed systemically, ethanol up-regulates dopaminergic neurons in an area of the brain known as the ventral tegmentum.Upon stimulation, these nerves release dopamine into the nucleus accumbens.This region of the brain is known as the \"reward center\" and is responsible for pleasure and addiction associated with alcohol use.Although alcohol stimulates dopamine directly, it is hypothesized that the neurotransmitter GABA is mainly responsible for the dopaminergic surge.GABA is inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps regulate the release of dopamine.However, ethanol is unique in that it inhibits GABA release.This ultimately results in the disinhibition of neurons in the ventral tegmentum and aids in the dopaminergic surge seen during alcohol intoxication.In cases of chronic alcoholism, molecular modification occurs that results in an increased number of GABA channels to compensate for decreased activity due to continuous alcohol exposure.Once these chronic changes occur, withdrawal will be seen with decreased blood alcohol",

Special attention should be given to multiple SUDs, or to the combination of SUDs and behavioral addictions, therefore the case manager should be encouraged to use screening methods for the detection of multiple disorders.",

      "abstract": "Disease processes or events that accompany acute alcohol withdrawal (AW) can cause significant illness and death. Some patients experience seizures, which may increase in severity with subsequent AW episodes. Another potential AW complication is delirium tremens, characterized by hallucinations, mental confusion, and disorientation. Cognitive impairment and delirium may lead to a chronic memory disorder (i.e., Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome). Psychiatric problems associated with withdrawal include anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. In addition, alterations in physiology, mood, and behavior may persist after acute withdrawal has subsided, motivating relapse to heavy drinking. Recent advances in neurobiology may support the development of improved medications to decrease the risk of AW complications and support long-term sobriety.",

      "abstract": "Five cases of dependence on popular analgesics containing barbiturates as the active ingredient have been presented. In all of these cases the patient developed the habit of using the drugs in the second or third decade of life in order to accomplish relief from headache. A rapid increase in tolerance took place in a few months, with most of the patients eventually requiring several times the usual dose. Symptoms of chronic intoxication were often milder than those with other habituating drugs. No antisocial acts as a result of the abuse were observed. Headaches as a manifestation of chronic intoxication may be considered to have played a role in establishing analgesic dependence. The abstinence syndrome developed a few hours after withdrawal: a generalized convulsion occurred first, followed by various disturbances of consciousness and then by a hallucinatory-delusional state. These symptoms cleared up in three days to a week, while a corresponding course was followed by the EEG findings. Withdrawal symptoms didn't appear at the time when allopyrabital as the active ingredient of popular analgesic preparations was replaced with cyclopyrabital but did appear in four cases at the very time when bromvalerylurea was substituted as the active principle of these preparations. Even at that time such a syndrome was not manifested in one case, suggesting the possibility of a cross-reaction of allobarbital and cyclo-barbital and of barbiturate and bromvalerylurea.",

      "title": "Non-essential symptoms of depression and cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) in community-dwelling elders without dysphoria or anhedonia",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Several neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in elders with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) can be part of a major depressive episode (MDE) or a “subthreshold” depressive episode. Certain neuropsychiatric symptoms of CIND are essential symptoms of MDE (e.g. dysphoria, anhedonia), while other are non-essential symptoms (NESD; e.g. fatigue, insomnia, cognitive complaint). Contrary to essential symptoms, NESD are not specific to MDE and are present in other disorders. It is unknown whether NESD are linked to CIND in absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. The present study examined the association between NESD and probable CIND in elders without essential MDE symptoms. Methods: Participants were 2028 community-dwelling individuals aged 65–96 years who had not experienced dysphoria/anhedonia during the year preceding the interview. Semi-structured in-home interviews evaluated the following NESD: alteration of appetite, sleep disturbance, psychomotor alteration, fatigue/loss of energy, worthlessness/guilt, and cognitive complaints. Probable CIND cases were defined based on the Mini-mental State Examination cut-offs (15th percentile) stratified for age, education and sex. Results: Symptoms of fatigue/loss of energy (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.42–4.09), sleep disturbance (OR: 3.04 CI: 1.69–5.46) and cognitive complaints (OR: 2.86 CI: 1.71–4.77) were significantly associated with CIND. These associations were not modified after adjustments for potential confounders (age, education level, sex, benzodiazepine use, chronic diseases, and brain disorders). Conclusion: A psychiatric symptomatology occurs in older adults with CIND in the absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. NESD encountered in the absence of dysphoria/anhedonia should receive particular attention by clinicians since they can be linked to cognitive difficulties.",

Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

This report describes a case of the jitteriness/anxiety syndrome caused by the coadministration of celecoxib with escitalopram and trazodone in a patient with depression and spondylolisthesis. The depression of a patient, a woman in her 60 s, had been in remission at least for 5 years under treatment using escitalopram and trazodone. Immediately after coadministration of celecoxib because of her buttock and limb pain, she showed anxiety, agitation, akathisia, insomnia, irritability, aggressiveness, impulsivity, and hypomania. These symptoms disappeared after the discontinuation of celecoxib. The present case suggests that coadministration of celecoxib with escitalopram and trazodone can cause the jitteriness/anxiety syndrome, presumably via a pharmacokinetic interaction of celecoxib with these antidepressants and/or the effects of celecoxib on serotonergic neurotransmission.",

      "abstract": "One of the most challenging clinical topics in psychiatry is the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar depression. The term mood stabilizer is frequently employed in the treatment of the hospitalized bipolar patient, although clinicians do not universally agree on a consensus definition of this term. Most clinicians would agree that a mood stabilizer refers to a medication that is effective for the acute treatment of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive episodes. Many experts agree that such treatment should offer efficacy against mania, should not worsen depression, and preferably should treat depression as well. In addition, the acute effectiveness in stabilization should not be at the expense of inducing alternate mood symptoms or switching the patient into the alternate phase of illness. From a maintenance standpoint, a mood stabilizer should also prevent against future relapse or recurrence of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive symptoms or episodes (Slide 1). In addition to use of mood stabilizers, there are other issues surrounding treatment of the hospitalized patient with bipolar depression, including the commonly comorbid issue of substance abuse. Hazardous drinking may more commonly occur in bipolar depression or depressive phase of illness, representing a more complex clinical picture. To facilitate understanding of this complex disorder and its appropriate treatment, this discussion centers around the case of a major depressive episode in a patient with a past history of of mania (ie, bipolar I depression or bipolar depression).",

Los ciclos circadianos se desajustan y alteran; se puede perder la noción del tiempo, presentarse insomnio o exceso del dormir, rechazo de los alimentos o alteración de los horarios de su ingesta. La co-ocurrencia de trastornos depresivos y por uso de alcohol se asocia con una mayor severidad y un peor pronóstico de los mismos, por lo que es importante que los servicios de salud implementen acciones de detección temprana, derivación y tratamiento oportuno para ambas condiciones.",

      "title": "UNDERSTANDING THE FEATURES OF MADATYAYA (ALCOHOLISM)",
      "abstract": "Alcoholism is one of the serious social problems which is rapidly increasing in every year. The fastest growth is being observed in the developing countries of Asia more particularly in India. Drinking of alcohol makes the life of a man very miserable. Alcohol not only degrades the health of the person but also affects his family and society. In A yurveda , the varieties of illnesses caused by the improper use of alcohol are grouped under one heading â€˜ Madatyaya â€™. In this contemporary era every disease is being understood by comparing it with modern parlance. Here is a small effort to understand the features of Madatyaya in terms of modern perspective. The disease Madatyaya is classified into Vatika , Paittika , Kaphaja , Sannipataja (based on Doshic predominance), Panatyaya , Paramada , Panajeerna , Panavibhrama , Dhwamsaka and Vikshaya . The different signs and symptoms mentioned in these types, complications of Madatyaya as well as the features of bad prognosis of Madatyaya can be understood based on available modern descriptions. By understanding the features of Madatyaya we can say that Madatyaya is not just an alcohol intoxication, dependence or withdrawal state, but it is the condition where multiple systemic dysfunctions are involved from immediate and acute manifestations to chronic and severe manifestations. Neurological, gastro-hepatic and cardio-pulmonary manifestations are the commonest features seen in the patients of Madatyaya which is also similar to the descriptions of alcoholism. Thus we can say that the word alcoholism which is used in broad sense can be said as equivalent to the word Madatyaya .",

      "abstract": "Abstract Internalizing disorders represent mental or behavioral conditions that are dominated by emotionality. Emotions are an adaptive tool to deal with life’s challenges. Adolescence is a developmental period when emotions can be extreme when elicited by both positive and negative experiences. The major internalizing disorders are depressive disorders and anxiety disorders; related ones in this domain include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and autism. Treatment effectiveness for teenagers with substance use disorder and a coexisting internalizing disorder is optimized when both domains are addressed. Behavioral-based treatment approaches with concurrent psychotropic medication are part of the treatment plan. One of the most common mental and behavioral disorders among adolescents in the United States is depression. For those suffering from a major depressive disorder, symptoms include a period of at least 2 weeks of a very persistent low mood accompanied with low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, and problems with sleep, energy, and concentration.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews studies that have examined associations between unusual sleep experiences (including nightmares, vivid dreaming, narcolepsy symptoms, and complex nighttime behaviors) and dissociation and schizotypy. Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

      "title": "Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology of Cocaine",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Cocaine abuse has produced a major epidemic health problem in North America in the 1980s. The abuse of cocaine is maintained by the drug's effects on brain reward systems, mediated at least in part by its dopaminergic action. The patterns and consequences of use are best understood by considering the pharmacokinetics (rapid absorption and delivery to the brain, relatively short half‐life) and the pharmacodynamics (intense central and peripheral neural stimulation). Cocaine is used therapeutically as a topical and local anaesthetic. Toxicity occurs primarily in cocaine abusers, but also occasionally after therapeutic dosing. Medical complications reflect primarily excessive central nervous system stimulation and excessive vasoconstriction, the latter resulting in severe hypertension and/or organ ischaemia with associated organ injury. Most deaths that result from medical complications of cocaine intoxication are sudden and occur before medical intervention is possible. Other complications of cocaine abuse with severe personal and social consequences include traumatic deaths and injuries, and reproductive disturbances, as well as transmission of infectious diseases, especially AIDS. Cocaine addiction is clearly a problem, although the number of addicts is unknown. Pharmacologic treatment of cocaine addiction has as yet been unsuccessful. Psychosocial approaches remain the mainstay of therapy.",

We undertook a literature review of cannabis use by patients with bipolar disorder and of the neuropharmacological properties of cannabinoids suggesting possible therapeutic effects in this condition. No systematic studies of cannabinoids in bipolar disorder were found to exist, although some patients claim that cannabisrelieves symptoms of mania and/or depression. The cannabinoids Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) may exert sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, antidepressant, antipsychotic and anticonvulsant effects. Pure synthetic cannabinoids, such as dronabinol and nabilone and specific plant extracts containing THC, CBD, or amixture of the two in known concentrations, are available and can be delivered sublingually. Controlled trials of these cannabinoids as adjunctive medication in bipolar disorder are now indicated.",

      "title": "Connection between Addictive Behavior and Investing on the Stock Market in Croatia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONNon-substance addictive behaviour, especially pathological gambling and internet addiction are becoming an increasing interest in research and health policy. Similarities and differences between these addictions and addictions to psychoactive stuff have been the subject of numerous discussions.1 Profession still disputes as whether when we talk about non-substance addiction we talk about real addiction that includes pathophysiological processes at the biological level or we talk about impulse control disorder.2Internet addiction is characterized by excessive or poorly controlled preoccupations, aspirations or behaviour associated with the use of computers and internet access, which lead to difficulties in daily functioning. This disorder usually occurs in the late twenties or in the early thirties, ten years after the beginning of the use of computer. Psychiatric co-morbid conditions are common, particularly bipolar disorder, mood disruption, anxiety, impaired impulse control and the use of resources that make addiction.3,4According to the activities and the content of Internet-based applications together with data provided by the therapists who treated them, Internet addicts can be grouped into several subcategories: information addicts, computer game addicts, on-line communication addicts (e-mail, chat applications), cybersex addicts, gambling addicts and shopping addicts.2,5Pathological gambling is classified according to DSM-IV TR classification as an impulse control disorder, even though it shows considerable biological, behavioral, clinical and epidemiological similarities with psychoactive substance addiction. Due to increasing availability of gambling, online betting opportunities, investment and trading, frequency of pathological gambling has been in a constant rise nowadays.6,7Due to the fact that pathological gambling is one of the impulse control disorders, and online stock trading hasn't still been recognized as a distinct subtype of internet addiction, the aim of this study was to determine whether the respondents who spend their time investing in the stock market meet the addiction criteria according to DSM-IV TR classification of psychiatric disorders.MATERIALS AND METHODSThis survey was conducted on an anonymous convenient sample of 111 respondents by using a modified self-made IAT questionnaire. The survey was conducted during April 2009 via web portals Poslovni.hr and Moj Novac.hr. People who invest in the stock market and trade stocks online were invited to fill out this questionnaire. The questionnaire contained 13 questions: 3 questions about demographic indicators of the respondents, 3 questions about time spent in investing in the stock market and about frequency of monitoring developments in the stock market and 7 questions composed by DSM-IV criteria by which the existence of addiction is defined. (Appendix). Answers to questions about addictions were classified into two categories: no evidence of addiction and participants exhibited addiction, while the presence of addiction is divided into milder and heavier degree of addiction.Results have been presented in total numbers and percentages.RESULTSThere were 95 men (85,6%) out of 111 respondents who fully responded to the survey. Most of the respondents belonged to the age group of 35-45 years old (49/111; 44,1%), followed by the group of 25-35 years old (40/111; 36,0%), and then by the group of 45-55 years old (14/111; 12,6%), and only 8 of them were younger than 25 years old (7,2%). By level of education the most frequent were highly educated respondents (64/111; 57,7%), 16/111 or 13,5% had college, 30/111 (27,0%) had high school, and one respondent had only primary school.Data on the duration and frequency of investment are shown in Table 1 and include the questions 4-6 from the questionnaire. Majority of them, 106 or 95,5% invested for more than one year. Likewise, most of them daily follow the events (98/111; 88,3%), out of which most of the respondents spend 1-6 hours a day in such activities (63/111; 63,6%). …",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY A new syndrome, paradoxical intoxication, has been defined in which high levels of hydantoins, and in one instance carbamazepine, produced an increase in seizures with little or no evidence of intoxication; a decrease in these levels produced an improvement in seizure control. This syndrome occurs often but not exclusively in those people who are less astute in assessing their neurologic status and therefore may experience unexpectedly higher blood levels of their anticonvulsants. Instances have been documented with serum levels above 40 jugm/ml for phenytoin or mephenytoin alone, or above 50 jugm/ml of combined hydantoins phenytoin and mephenytoin, and when the level is in the range of 20 yugm/ml and above for carbamazepine. Possible mechanisms underlying the syndrome are reviewed. Appropriate therapy is a reduction of the dose of the drug in question. RÉSUMÉ L'intoxication paradoxale est un syndrome caracterise par une augmentation des crises survenant lorsque les concentrations seriques d'hydantoine ou de carbamazepine sont elevees et le peu d'effets secondaires generalement observés a des tels taux. 9 cas sont rapportes. Les taux de phenytoine ou de mephenytoi'ne donnees seules, étaient superieurs a 40 /Ltg/ml; le taux total d'hydantoine était superieur a 50 jLtg/ml (chez les patients avec phenytoine et mephenytoi'ne associees); le taux de carba‐mazepine eta it supfrieur a 20 /ig/ml. La frequence des crises diminuait a nouveau si Ton reduisait la dose. RESUMEN La intoxicación paradojica consiste en un aumento de la frecuencia de ataques cuando la concentracidn de hidantoinas o carbamazepinas en suero es elevada. Los habituales sfntomas que se observan con tales concentraciones son escasos. Se presentan 9 casos. Los niveles sericos de fenitoina o mefenitoina administra‐das por separado fueron superiores a los 40 μg/ml; los de la hidantoina total (en pacientes tomando fenitoina y mefenitoina) fueron superiores a los 50 μg/ml y los de carbamazepina por encima de 20 /ig/ml. El aumento de los ataques se controla reduciendo la dosis. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die paradoxe Intoxikation ist ein Syndrom, das charakterisiert ist durch eine zunehmende Anfallsfrequenz bei hoher Serumkonzentration von Hydantoinen oder Carbamazepin jedoch nur geringen Nebenwirkungen verglichen mit denen, die gewohnlich bei derartigen Blut‐spiegeln zu sehen sind.

The development of neuropsychological deficits depends on the type of seizures. Particularly BNS-seizures and the Lennox-Gastaut-syndrome have generally a poor prognosis concerning the intellectual development. Not only clinically manifest seizures but also subclinical discharges could disturb the psychic condition of epileptic patients. Epileptic seizures are probably a reason for neuronal damage in the hippocampus area.

      "abstract": "Catatonia-like presentations can be precipitated by multiple organic and medication-related causes. Psychiatric causes of catatonia are typically associated with underlying psychotic or mood disorders. Recurrent catatonia without other precipitating psychiatric diagnosis is rarely described. We present the case of a man in his early 30′s with idiopathic recurrent catatonia, presented with patient consent. Our case presented in a catatonic state, having recently stopped using cannabis. No organic cause for his presentation was identified following extensive investigation and he was admitted for psychiatric assessment. During admission he slowly improved with benzodiazepine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment, alongside psychological support. Despite near complete recovery, he significantly relapsed on 2 occasions requiring psychiatric re-admission over the subsequent 6 months. Thereafter, he had multiple relapsing episodes with decreasing severity during rehabilitative care. During admission we explored extensive differentials including mood disorders, schizophrenia or psychosis, drug abuse or poisoning, as underlying triggers for his catatonia. He had a finding of FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) on his second electroencephalogram (EEG), with no clinical correlate of seizure or structural abnormality. We found no evidence of any underlying psychiatric or organic cause for his presentation. In contrast to classical descriptions of catatonia or recurrent catatonia, our case highlights the need for greater recognition of isolated idiopathic catatonia, as a diagnosis independent of mood disorder or schizophrenia. Furthermore, we evidence effective recovery with psychological support, benzodiazepines and ECT.",

A differentiation is made between neuroglucopenic symptoms (e.g., confusion, somnolence) on the one hand, and those that arise as a result of the counterregulatory response of the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., tremor, sweating), on the other. The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can cause considerable problems, in particular when only isolated single symptoms present (e.g., confusion, psychosis, seizures, coma). For the elective clarification of recurrent hypoglycemia, further diagnostic examinations (e.g., fasting with determination of hormones, measurement of insulin) are employed in addition to the patient's history. For differential diagnostic considerations not only organic causes, but also adverse drug reactions and a factitious genesis must be excluded. In the event of an emergency (e.g., hypoglycemic coma) the usual form of treatment is the administration of glucoses or glucagon.",

The relationship between epilepsy and alcohol or substance abuse is complex. Alcohol consumption and dependency is one of the top five leading causes of the global burden of disease. Alcohol abuse increases the risk of developing epilepsy. Marijuana is most commonly used as an illicit drug. Cocaine may cause temporary and permanent changes in the brain neurotransmitter system. The symptoms and sensations that heroin produces in abusers are most likely related to alteration in the endogenous opioid, beta endorphin. The use of both methamphetamine and MDMA (ecstasy) has risen sharply over the last 2 decades. Although benzodiazepines and barbiturates are prescribed for the treatment of acute seizures and for epilepsy, both classes of medicine may be used as recreational drugs.",

      "title": "Ischemic Cerebrovasular Accident, Uncontrolled Seizures and Acute Myocardial Infarction Associated with Synthetic Marijuana Abuse",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Designer Cannabinoids is a newly emerging drug of abuse that gained popularity among adolescent and young adults in the past few years. These drugs are marketed as incense or potpourri under different brand names such as spice. The potency of these drugs is variable and the range of adverse effects range from simple to severe and life threatening adverse effects such as myocardial infarction (MI), Ischemic cerebrovasular accident (ICVA) and seizures. Case report: we describe a 23 male patient who was admitted to the hospital several times suffering from severe side effects following spice abuse. In his first admission, he provided spice sample that we later confirmed to have at least two different synthetic cannabinoids. In his last admission for uncontrolled seizures he start feeling chest pain which was later diagnosed as acute MI. This appears to be the first case report where a spice abuser develops ICVA, uncontrolled seizures and MI at the same time with negative work up towards the etiology other than spice abuse. Discussion: the mechanism behind the possible proconvulsant effect of synthetic marijuana is not known, but it may be due to either their effects at the cannabinoids receptor or due to the absence of the anticonvulsant phytocannabinoids in spice products. Synthetic cannabinoids cause tachycardia and vasospasm due to their high affinity to cannabinoid receptors and this may lead to acute MI however the deep inhalation adopted by spice smokers increase carboxyhemoglobin concentrations and may also contribute to this atheromatous disease. Conclusion: given the patient negative history for thromboembolization, vasculitis, and hypercoagulable state, and the multiple admissions of this patient after smoking spice suggest an association. We hypothesize that synthetic marijuana or the herbs mixed with it might cause the ICVA, MI and seizures in his last admission. Based on extensive review of the literature this appears to be the first case report where a single spice abuser developed ICVA, uncontrolled seizures and MI with negative workup towards the etiology other than spice abuse. Screening for synthetic marijuana should be warranted in all teenagers with new onset seizure disorder. Furthermore, the possibility of MI and ICVA should be part of teenager's counseling sessions as by now it is increasingly reported in literature.",

Mittlerweile kann es als gesichert angesehen werden, dass Cannabiskonsum zu einer Zunahme schizophrener Erkrankungen führt. So konnten prospektive epidemiologische Untersuchungen zeigen, dass ein häufiger Cannabiskonsum das Risiko, an einer Schizophrenie zu erkranken, etwa verdoppelt. Bemerkenswerterweise schneiden schizophrene Patienten mit komorbidem Cannabiskonsum in neuropsychologischen Tests häufig signifikant besser ab als Patienten ohne Cannabiskonsum. Dies ist aber nicht auf einen positiven Effekt des Cannabis zurückzuführen, sondern eher auf eine cannabisbedingte Psychoseinduktion bei Personen mit einem höheren Funktionsniveau und geringeren kognitiven Störungen.

      "abstract": "Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death. The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older. Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale. Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies. Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate long-term treatment for alcohol use disorder, including pharmacotherapy, in addition to withdrawal management.",

      "abstract": "The catatonia, a clinical picture characterized by psychomotor abnormalities, was first described by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum in 1874 [1].In later periods, catatonia was evaluated as a subtype of schizophrenia.After the 1960s, the actual prevalence and other situations that may be related have been revealed [2].Gelenberg (1976) stated that there are 40 cases that could cause catatonia and many new ones have been reported since then [3].Our data suggest that catatonia is more common in mood disorders than in schizophrenia.Catatonia can also be seen in other medical conditions besides psychiatric disorders: Endocrine disorders, infections, electrolyte imbalances, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injuries can cause catatonia.Excessive doses of drugs or substances such as cocaine, ecstasy, disulfiram, and levetiracetam can also result in catatonia [4,5].Catatonia due to conversion is a rare condition and there is insufficient information in the literature to address this issue and its treatment.In 1984, Jensen published a report dealing with conversion-related catatonia and hypnosis activity [6].Dabholkar reported a case of hysterical catatonia in 1988 [7].In 2012, Shah et al. wrote an article including responses of the consultants about conversion, catatonia, and culture interaction.In this report, we present two female patients suffering from hysterical catatonia and its improvement with using electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) [8].",

      "title": "The Explosion of a New Designer Drug, Flakka",
      "abstract": "There are many challenges facing healthcare professionals. One such challenge is the continuous introduction of new synthetic drugs. Synthetic drugs pose many difficulties to providers, including identification of the drug ingested, management of symptoms, ensuring safety of the patient and his or her environment, and continual monitoring after the initial symptoms, because synthetic cathinones have many long-term effects on an individual. One such synthetic drug, flakka, is a potent second-generation synthetic cathinone. Because flakka inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, which are involved in one's perception of pleasure, it causes inflated feelings and also causes signs and symptoms of psychosis. Flakka also induces various exaggerated symptoms, such as feelings of incredible strength, disorientation, aggression, and altered thought processes, and also can cause hyperthermia, coma, and death. Healthcare professionals need to understand the nature of flakka ingestion, the various symptoms a user may exhibit, and the long-term symptoms a person may have once the acute recovery phase has ended. Once the initial phase of ingestion is over and the patient is medically stabilized, the patient may experience signs and symptoms of psychosis or other psychiatric disorders. It is paramount that healthcare professionals are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of flakka ingestion, know the steps to take to ensure safety of the patient and those around him or her, and also know how to facilitate the patient's recovery.",

EpA of different intensity and pattern could be retained for more than three weeks. Hyperactive basomedial nuclei played the role of a primary pathological determinant which caused the complex of emotional and behavioural disorders. Continuous motor depression at the early stages alternated pathologically enhanced activity at the later stages. A number of signs could be considered as the evidence of the affective disorders (motivation suppression, enhanced irritation, anxious excitation). Stereotype behaviour, immobility, rigidity, different types of vegetative disorders (ptosis, constipation, piloerection, loss of weight, respiratory arrhythmia, dystrophic symptoms) were observed in most animals. The emotional, behavioural and vegetative disorders described are compared to the manifestations of the depressive syndrome.",

In addition to physical symptoms related to nervous system hyperexcitability, withdrawal includes changes in mental state that may motivate renewed AOD consumption. The manifestations of addiction are associated with changes in nerve cell function by which the brain attempts to adapt to a drug's presence. These functional changes modulate a person's initial response to a drug, the establishment of long-term craving for the drug (i.e., addiction), and the persistent sense of discomfort that leads to relapse after abstinence has been achieved. Research is beginning to reveal how specific brain regions may be integrated to form neural circuits that modulate aspects of addiction.",

Nicotine and other tobacco constituents have significant effects on neural circuitry underlying the regulation of attention and affect. Age, sex, early environment, and exposure to other drugs have been identified as important factors that moderate both the effects of nicotine on brain circuitry and behavior and the risk for smoking initiation. Findings also suggest that the effects of smoking differ depending on whether smoking is used to regulate attention or affect. Individual differences in the reinforcement processes underlying tobacco use have implications for the development of tailored smoking cessation programs and prevention strategies that include early treatment of attentional and emotional dysfunctions.",

Background: Differentiating migraine from episodic tension type headaches is difficult if one strictly follows International classification of headache disorders- 3rd edition beta version (ICHD 3 Beta), as there are many overlapping statements. Another problem is applying criterion E, not better accounted for by another ICHD 3 beta diagnosis. Duration, presence of head pain and associated migraine diagnostic symptoms except vomiting and nausea are not mandatory to diagnose Episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine (ICHD 3 Beta code 1.6) or Periodic syndromes (ICHD2) that are commonly precursors of migraine. Methods: A retrospective chart review was done on 6,200patients. All were diagnosed as Migraine without aura, Probable migraine or Benign secondary headaches, and the following four common features were identified- recurrent headaches / activity affected / absolutely normal in between episodes/ no red flags present. History of two more additional helpful diagnostic features was also noted - Common migraine triggers precipitating these headaches and family history of migraine or its synonyms. Exclusion criteria include aura, autonomic manifestations, headaches lasting more than 3 days, headaches with migraine features that are not activity dependent, post dromal symptoms, fever and other systemic disorders. Results: 92% of patients fulfilled the four simple migraine diagnostic features. 88% had one of the common migraine triggers precipitating their headaches and 91% had family history of migraine. Conclusion: Recurrent activity affected headaches with absolute normality in between episodes and without any red flags, should lead one to consider the diagnosis of migraine without aura.",

      "title": "A case of clozapine-induced stuttering in a HIV-positive individual",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Stuttering, a speech disorder marked by disruptions in fluency, can be developmental or acquired. Acquired stuttering often stems from neurological causes, psychological trauma or certain medications, with antipsychotics such as clozapine implicated in several cases. Clozapine, particularly at higher doses, has been associated with dose-dependent stuttering although the precise mechanisms remain uncertain. While clozapine’s effects dopamine pathways and seizure thresholds are proposed mechanisms, movement disorders such as focal dystonia and prior extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSEs) are also implicated. Patient presentation: A 40-year-old man with HIV, schizophrenia and a history of previous severe dystonic reaction to typical antipsychotics, developed stuttering after initiation of clozapine. His stuttering was accompanied by involuntary oral movements. Management and outcome: The patient’s psychotic symptoms were found to be treatment-resistant, unresponsive to trials of two antipsychotics, and thus necessitating the initiation of clozapine. Following clozapine administration, the patient developed stuttering, which was unresponsive to benzodiazepine therapy and showed no abnormalities on electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment. Gradual resolution of stuttering was observed upon clozapine discontinuation and a switch to amisulpiride. Conclusion: Clozapine was identified as the likely cause of stuttering in the presence of additional risk factors such as HIV and a history of EPSEs. Contribution: This case highlights the importance of recognising clozapine-induced stuttering.",

      "title": "The pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of cannabinoids",
      "abstract": "There is increasing interest in the use of cannabinoids for disease and symptom management, but limited information available regarding their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to guide prescribers. Cannabis medicines contain a wide variety of chemical compounds, including the cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is psychoactive, and the nonpsychoactive cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis use is associated with both pathological and behavioural toxicity and, accordingly, is contraindicated in the context of significant psychiatric, cardiovascular, renal or hepatic illness. The pharmacokinetics of cannabinoids and the effects observed depend on the formulation and route of administration, which should be tailored to individual patient requirements. As both THC and CBD are hepatically metabolized, the potential exists for pharmacokinetic drug interactions via inhibition or induction of enzymes or transporters. An important example is the CBD-mediated inhibition of clobazam metabolism. Pharmacodynamic interactions may occur if cannabis is administered with other central nervous system depressant drugs, and cardiac toxicity may occur via additive hypertension and tachycardia with sympathomimetic agents. More vulnerable populations, such as older patients, may benefit from the potential symptomatic and palliative benefits of cannabinoids but are at increased risk of adverse effects. The limited availability of applicable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information highlights the need to initiate prescribing cannabis medicines using a 'start low and go slow' approach, carefully observing the patient for desired and adverse effects. Further clinical studies in the actual patient populations for whom prescribing may be considered are needed, to derive a better understanding of these drugs and enhance safe and optimal prescribing.",

Personality, likewise, is formed from a combination of inherited and acquired influences. Because selected dimensions of emotional temperament are associated with distinct neurochemical substrates contributing to specific personality phenotypes, certain aspects of abnormal emotional traits in alcoholics may be inherited. Emotions involve complex subjective experiences engaging multiple brain regions, most notably the cortex, limbic system, and cerebellum. Results of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and post-mortem neuropathological studies of alcoholics indicate that the greatest cortical loss occurs in the frontal lobes, with concurrent thinning of the corpus callosum. Additional damage has been documented for the amygdala and hippocampus, as well as in the white matter of the cerebellum. All of the critical areas of alcoholism-related brain damage are important for normal emotional functioning. When changes occur in these brain regions, either as a consequence of chronic ethanol abuse or from a genetic anomaly affecting temperament and/or a vulnerability to alcoholism, corresponding changes in emotional functions are to be expected. In alcoholics, such changes have been observed in their perception and evaluation of emotional facial expressions, interpretation of emotional intonations in vocal utterances, and appreciation of the meaning of emotional materials.",

      "abstract": "There are various types of hallucinogenic drugs that are distinguished by the psychological effects which they induce. The most familiar are the \"visionary psychodysleptics\" which produce prominent visual and somatic distortions and hallucinations. Complex emotional changes ranging from ecstasy to terror may occur, as well as alterations in thinking. Examples of such drugs are LSD, mescaline, and tryptamine derivatives such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The imagery-producing psychodysleptics such as cannabis and various coumarins (e.g., from Calea zacatechichi) potentiate visual imagery and produce characteristic distortions in time perception, body-image, and thought. Trance-producing psychodysleptics (such as lysergic acid amide (obtained from Rivea corymbosa) ololiquhqui, turbicoryn, and corymbosine), as their names suggest, produce trance-like states. Finally the deliriants (e.g., atropine) produce clouding of consciousness and amnesia, as well as hallucinatory effects.",

      "title": "Depressão e comorbilidade: Um caso clínico",
      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Sarin (GB, O-Isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate) is an organophosphate neurotoxic agent that inhibits irreversibly acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Next, the accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) in the central nervous system (CNS) causes convulsions and, in high dosage, centrally mediated respiratory failure. The ACh accumulation at peripheral vegetative synapses level leads to peripheral signs of intoxication and overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, which is described as “cholinergic crisis” (diarrhea, perspiration, salivation, miosis, bronchospasm). The exposure to high dosage of Sarin may lead to tremor, convulsions and hypothermia. More seriously, the accumulation of ACh at neuromuscular junctions’ level may also cause paralysis and peripherally mediated respiratory failure that can lead to death by breathing arrest. In addition to the main action on the cholinergic system, Sarin has other secondary effects. These involve activating some neurotransmitters including the gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) and alteration of other cellular signaling systems, such as the ionic channels, cellular adhesion molecules and inflammation regulators. The Sarin exposure is associated with symptoms of late neurotoxicity induced by organophosphates and chronic neurotoxicity induced by organophosphates. Moreover, Sarin has been involved in the toxic and immunotoxic effects such as endocrine disorders induced by organophosphates. The standard treatment for exposure to the Sarin neurotoxin is a post-exposure injection with atropine, an antagonist of muscarinic receptors, followed by oxime, an AChE reactivator, and diazepam.",

Results: A 44-year-old woman with borderline personality traits and severe drug dependence developed a protracted drug-induced psychosis related to chronic high-dose crystalline methamphetamine use. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred with antipsychotic medication and abstinence from methamphetamine. Rapid recurrence of symptoms occurred at a time of high stress associated with minimal methamphetamine use and cessation of low-dose quetiapine. Symptoms rapidly resolved with abstinence, quetiapine and reduction of stressors. Conclusions: A drug-induced psychosis resembling paranoid schizophrenia can occur with repeated or high-dose use of methamphetamine. While this generally resolves rapidly with cessation of stimulant use, some cases of protracted drug-induced psychosis in vulnerable individuals have been documented. Behavioural sensitization can also occur, and neuroleptics may prevent the recurrence of further psychosis triggered by ongoing low-dose methamphetamine use.",

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

      "title": "Isaac's Sign: Handkerchief Holding by Older Inpatients",
      "abstract": "“Beware a handkerchief in the hand, a handbag on the arm, food in the mouth, teeth in the jar, the hearing aid in the drawer and the artificial limb under the bed; all betoken a poor prognosis.” To the Editor: The persistent holding of a handkerchief or other object by older people is a common sight on hospital wards and in geriatric medicine outpatient clinics. Despite it apparently being a common observation, little has been documented about this phenomenon. The late Bernard Isaacs's observation that such behavior was associated with poor rehabilitative outcome1 is not proven but could, if true, point to physical or cognitive frailties as the underlying etiologies. Why many older people clutch handkerchiefs and other items is unclear. It may simply be due to physical symptoms such as rhinorrhea, drooling, or cough. There may be a psychological component—an association with insecurity, anxiety, or acute or chronic cognitive impairment. Handkerchief holding has a “mirror behavior” in childhood and could be considered regressive behavior in an older adult, analogous to a child with a security blanket or other attachment agent. One patient told us “I've always done it since I was a child. I had a rag then.” Local use of the term “andrexia nervosa” illustrates the possible association with anxiety or other emotional distress. (Andrex is a popular brand of toilet tissue in the United Kingdom. The late Independent UK newspaper witticist Miles Kington may have originally coined the term “andrexia nervosa.”) The prevalence and patient explanations of this behavior were studied. A point prevalence survey and single-question interview was conducted on all inpatient geriatric medical wards in the Leeds Teaching Hospitals National Health Services Trust (LTHT). The number of patients holding a handkerchief or other object and their age, sex, and handedness were recorded. Patients holding an object were asked one question: “May I ask why you hold a handkerchief [or tissue, etc.]?” Objective evidence of patients' physical explanations was sought from direct observation and case notes. Data are presented descriptively and analyzed using chi-square tests. Three hundred seventy-five of 420 beds in four hospital sites were occupied at the time of the survey. Thirty-three patients were excluded as unable to hold an item because of disability or severe illness; 332 patients were eligible to participate, of whom 11% were observed to be clutching a handkerchief or tissue (in 79% cases) or other object (mainly paper or toy). Patients ages ranged from 66 to 104; 84% were female. There was no difference between patients in beds or chairs; equal numbers were holding the item in their dominant and nondominant hand. More patients were found holding a tissue in acute wards (18%) than rehabilitation wards (7%). Of the explanations given by patients, 50% related to physical symptoms, objective evidence of which existed in only 28% cases (Table 1). Several patients gave a physical and a nonphysical explanation. Nonphysical explanations included “habit” or “for comfort.” Some patients were unable to explain their behavior. Most replies indicated that this behavior was long-standing; 55% using words such as “a long time,”“years,” or “always.” Fewer (2%) indicated that his behavior was recent, since being in the hospital. Some suggested that onset of handkerchief-holding behavior started in later life. We have often observed older patients holding handkerchiefs. This study, the first to explore this observation, found that it is common, with a prevalence of 11% of older inpatients, 84% of whom were female. Isaacs hypothesized that handkerchief holding may be associated with a poor rehabilitative outcome. Functional outcomes were not studied in this study, although patients gave several explanations for this behavior. Half of these were nonphysical, raising the possibility of a psychological association with handkerchief holding. In addition, objective evidence of physical explanations was found in only 28%, suggesting that some patients might be rationalizing the behavior. Tissue holding was more common on acute wards than postacute or rehabilitation wards (18% vs 7%). Greater anxiety in patients who are sicker or in a rapidly changing acute hospital environment may explain this. Use of attachment agents by children is associated with separation anxiety and is also frequently observed as a coping strategy in unfamiliar circumstances irrespective of children's maternal attachment status.2 There are obvious limitations to point prevalence studies; Isaac's sign may be intermittent and therefore underestimated, and short-term observation may inappropriately invalidate patient explanations. Further study is planned to investigate potential psychological and functional associations with handkerchief holding. Isaacs's original observation may prove a useful clinical eponymous sign.

      "abstract": "Psychiatrists rarely enquire about caffeine intake when assessing patients. This may lead to a failure to identify caffeine-related problems and offer appropriate interventions. Excessive caffeine ingestion leads to symptoms that overlap with those of many psychiatric disorders. Caffeine is implicated in the exacerbation of anxiety and sleep disorders, and people with eating disorders often misuse it. It antagonises adenosine receptors, which may potentiate dopaminergic activity and exacerbate psychosis. In psychiatric in-patients, caffeine has been found to increase anxiety, hostility and psychotic symptoms. Assessment of caffeine intake should form part of routine psychiatric assessment and should be carried out before prescribing hypnotics. Gradual reduction in intake or gradual substitution with caffeine-free alternatives is probably preferable to abrupt cessation. Decaffeinated beverages should be provided on psychiatric wards.",

It is usually noticed within days or weeks of either starting or stopping antipsychotic treatment or changing dosage. Its clinical presentation may resemble other conditions such as anxiety and psychomotor agitation. The management of akathisia involves three steps: prevention, antipsychotic drug adjustment, and symptomatic strategies. Risks and benefits of antipsychotics should always be weighed-in to avoid akathisia. Even though second-generation antipsychotics were considered to have reduced risk for akathisia, recent data suggest that using second generation antipsychotics with high risk of akathisia would be as harmful as using any first-generation antipsychotics. Combinations, rapid upward or downward titrations, and sudden discontinuation of antipsychotics should be avoided. Beta blockers, anticholinergics, serotonergic medications, and benzodiazepines can help control the symptoms of akathisia.",

      "title": "Behavioural effects of the newer antiepileptic drugs: an update",
      "abstract": "The negative and positive effects of the nine newer antiepileptic drugs that have received a product licence in the UK or in the US are reviewed. The importance of avoiding misinterpretation of the data because of confounding factors such as alternative psychosis, the release phenomenon or drug interactions is emphasised. Vigabatrin has been associated with both psychosis and depression. Due to the concentric visual field defects that may occur with vigabatrin, its use is now limited, although it remains the drug of choice for infantile spasms. Lamotrigine seems to be largely associated with improvement rather than deterioration of mood and behaviour. It may have a role in treating affective disorder. Gabapentin probably has relatively little effect on behaviour but may exacerbate behavioural problems in some children with pre-existing difficulties. Topiramate may precipitate both psychosis and depression, but these are less likely to occur if the currently recommended lower starting doses, escalation rates and target doses are used. The data for tiagabine are limited, but there is no clear evidence for psychosis or depression being caused by this drug. Oxcarbazepine may be of value in treating mood disorder, but the information is very limited. There are few reports of behavioural disturbances with levetiracetam, but the data suggest that there is no significant increase in psychosis or depression. There are some reports of psychosis and other behavioural disturbances with felbamate, but the use of this drug is limited by the serious adverse effects of hepatotoxicity and aplastic anaemia. There is some evidence for psychosis with zonisamide, but there is also a suggestion that this drug may be of benefit in treating psychiatric disorders. Careful individual assessment of each patient should enable the clinician to determine whether the medication or some other factor is responsible for any behavioural disturbance.",

      "title": "Impulsivity",
      "abstract": "Impulsivity is a multifaceted behavioural trait commonly linked to drug abuse and addiction involving rash or risky behaviour and a strong tendency towards spur-of-the-moment, poorly judged decisions and actions. At its core, impulsivity arises through an inability to adequately suppress or inhibit inappropriate behaviour and by a general intolerance to delayed gratification, a tendency also widely found in abstinent drug addicts. Despite intensive research, however, it remains unclear whether impulsivity arises from neural abnormalities produced by the chronic exposure of individuals to drugs such as alcohol and cocaine ('state impulsivity') potentially via interactions with medial temporal lobe and frontal cortical structures (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) or whether instead 'trait impulsivity' and brain disorders linked to it – for example, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) – predispose to drug use and addiction. This chapter considers both possibilities from a neural systems and psychological perspective drawing on evidence from animal models and clinical research.",

      "abstract": "The concept of \"soft drugs\" is unclear and refers more to the behaviour of consumers than to the specific pharmacological properties of substances. However, \"soft drugs\" is often understood as \"safe drugs.\" However, it is of major importance to underline that all drugs can induce major loss of the control of consumption, what is the crucial point of addictive behaviour. This is due to a sensitization of the so-called\" brain reward system\"; moreover, there is cross-sensitization between drugs. Only cannabis and alcohol are frequently thought to be associated to a long-term safe consumption. In our experience, this reputation is broadly usurped. Indeed, we observed that even when they do not have major health problems, cannabis consumers present major alterations of social functioning. In another way, we have shown that heavy alcohol consumers without neurological complications have frequently frontal dysfunction, clinically correlated to major alterations of executive functions.",

      "title": "Editorial: Psychological sleep studies: new insights to support and integrate clinical practice within the healthcare system, volume II",
      "abstract": "Sleep health is essential for overall physical and mental well-being. Insufficient sleep, whether in terms of quantity or quality, significantly impacts an individual's quality of life and day-to-day functioning [1]. Consequences of sleep disorders like insomnia include impaired daytime cognition, reduced work productivity, an increased risk of accidents and injuries, and have been linked to psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic health conditions. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].Sleep problems may compromise with the treatments that are currently being administered for a wide range of illnesses. When these disorders are addressed, they have the potential to enhance the patient's quality of life and adherence to therapy, as well as the intensity of the psychological symptoms that they are experiencing. It has been shown that there is a complicated association between sleep and mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress disorders. This interaction is considered to be bidirectional [2], [16], [17]. There is a growing demand in the clinical setting for psychologists who are skilled in evidence-based psychotherapy to become members of multidisciplinary health teams. These psychologists would be tasked with providing cognitive-behavioral intervention and support for patients suffering from insomnia [18], narcolepsy [19], [20], and adherence to treatment for obstructive sleep apnea [21].This volume brings together a collection of research that delves into different aspects of sleep health and its relationship with psychological well-being, offering new approaches to addressing these challenges in various populations. The findings provide critical implications for clinical practice, aiming to improve sleep health management across diverse healthcare settings.Luo et al. [22] investigate the mental health challenges, particularly anxiety and poor sleep, experienced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their study shows that Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) significantly alleviates anxiety and improves sleep quality among practitioners in high-stress environments like mobile cabin hospitals. The intervention demonstrated a reduction in both anxiety and poor sleep indices, offering an accessible and effective solution to mitigate mental health strains during pandemicrelated crises.This study highlights the potential of PMR as a non-invasive, cost-effective intervention that could be readily implemented in healthcare systems to support the mental health of frontline workers. Given the global scale of the healthcare crisis, integrating such tools into standard healthcare practice could enhance workforce wellbeing and performance.In their study, O'Regan et al. [23] explore the patient journey in managing insomnia across Europe and Canada. By mapping the phases of insomnia management, from self-initiated behavioral changes to long-term reliance on prescription medications, the authors reveal a considerable gap in the alignment of healthcare provider strategies and patient needs. Their research uncovers key points where interventions can be improved, particularly in addressing patient expectations and enhancing education around sleep hygiene and nonpharmacological treatments.Overall, the findings show that patient education is crucial to remove the stigma surrounding insomnia, helping patients recognize that chronic insomnia is a primary disorder that requires appropriate medical management, and encouraging them to seek help earlier. Additionally, healthcare provider education and training on sleep disorders are essential to increase the perception of chronic insomnia as a serious primary medical condition and to fully understand its significant impact on patients' daily lives. Furthermore, the current situation, in which many patients must settle for \"manageable\" insomnia, highlights a serious unmet need regarding the management and treatment of this condition. More comprehensive approaches are needed to ensure that patients receive effective care that goes beyond symptom management, addressing the root causes of their insomnia and improving their long-term health outcomes.Wale et al. [24] shed light on the high prevalence of insomnia among university students in Ethiopia. Their study identifies key predictors, including gender, age, mild anxiety symptoms, and excessive use of mobile devices before bedtime, which significantly contribute to poor sleep quality among students. The findings underscore the impact of lifestyle factors and mental health challenges on sleep patterns in young adults, a group particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances due to academic stress and lifestyle transitions.The study calls for targeted interventions focusing on mental health support and promoting better sleep hygiene among university students. Educational institutions should integrate sleep health education into their wellness programs, emphasizing the importance of mental health and limiting late-night screen exposure.Zambelli et al. evaluate the feasibility of delivering CBT-I through telehealth to chronic pain patients suffering from insomnia [25]. The study shows that adapted CBT-I delivered via telehealth not only improved sleep quality but also alleviated symptoms of anxiety, and depression. The research highlights the growing role of telehealth in making effective sleep interventions more accessible, particularly for populations with mobility issues or those living in remote areas.Telehealth-based interventions offer a scalable and practical solution to reach populations with limited access to in-person therapy. As healthcare systems continue to embrace digital health solutions, telehealth-based CBT-I can play a pivotal role in addressing sleep disorders, particularly in the post-pandemic era where telehealth has become more prominent.While the studies presented in this volume offer important insights, several areas remain unexplored, signaling opportunities for future research. First, the long-term effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions like PMR and CBT-I across diverse populations, including adolescents and the elderly, needs further investigation. Additionally, the impact of behavioral and lifestyle factors, such as mobile device use before bedtime, which has been shown to significantly influence sleep quality, particularly among younger populations, requires deeper examination.As telehealth becomes an increasingly central component of healthcare delivery, there is also a need to assess its broader efficacy across varying cultural contexts, socioeconomic groups, and medical conditions.Understanding how digital interventions like telehealth-delivered CBT-I can be optimized to meet the needs of different populations will be crucial for the equitable expansion of these services.The collection of research in this volume underscores the profound interconnectedness of sleep health and psychological well-being. From frontline healthcare workers grappling with anxiety during pandemics to chronic pain patients benefiting from telehealth-delivered CBT-I, these studies highlight the necessity of integrating sleep health into broader mental healthcare strategies. Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, despite their substantial repercussions on both individual and societal health.Psychologists play a crucial role in addressing sleep-related disorders, not only through therapeutic interventions such as CBT-I but also by promoting sleep hygiene and mental wellness as foundational elements of health. Academic training programs in psychology should emphasize the importance of sleep as a pillar of mental well-being, equipping future practitioners with the skills to recognize, address, and treat sleep disturbances as part of a comprehensive mental health approach.To advance a holistic approach, healthcare systems must prioritize early detection and treatment of sleep disorders, leveraging cross-disciplinary methods that integrate mental health, technology, and lifestyle interventions. This volume provides a robust foundation for understanding the significance of sleep in clinical practice, yet ongoing research and innovation will be essential to refine and expand these approaches, fostering a truly integrative model of mental healthcare that includes sleep as a central component.",

      "title": "Psychogenic dysphonia",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Dysphonia is altered vocal quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication.[1,2] A functional speech disorder is caused by an underlying psychological process in contrast to the organic type.[3] According to The Hysterical Conversion Model of Voice Loss by Freud, an intrapsychic conflict is transformed into a bodily symptom that is connected to or \"symbolizes\" the conflict.[4] A 41-year-old male clerk, having anxious-avoidant traits, after a bilateral tonsillectomy in 2008, could speak only in low volume. During this recovery phase, he was verbally abused by a superior to whom he could not reply and fainted. After waking up, his speech was further limited, and spoke in a strained, forceful manner, one to two words with abrupt pauses. He was treated as a case of spasmodic dysphonia (Adductor) with voice rest, speech therapy, vocal hydration, and one injection of Botulinum toxin. For the next 12 years, he continued with waxing and waning severity of hoarseness, worsening during evenings and winters. He interacted by writing down instructions and escaped demanding situations or direct interactions with his superiors. One of the superiors decided that he needs to be evaluated by a doctor again and he was sent for an ENT review. Hopkin's video-laryngoscopy revealed no abnormalities. Hence, he was referred for psychiatric evaluation of dysphonia. He spoke in a low tone and volume and whispered intermittently. There was occasional normal speech during emotional outbursts, lasting for four to five words. These symptoms originated as mentioned earlier and were sustained due to convenient shouldering-off of responsibilities, avoidance of conflicts, and sympathetic outlook of colleagues and family members. He was diagnosed with dissociative motor disorder (psychogenic dysphonia). Management began with self-monitoring, to discover vocal patterns. At each session, he was counseled on vocal hygiene, which is to ensure adequate hydration, voice rest, and avoid unnecessary voice stresses like shouting. In the direct technique, circum-laryngeal exercises were taught. Coughing was immediately followed by vowel sustenance of [u] and [i]. He was trained on sustained humming, pitch pattern matching, and developing words from lexical categories. Eventually, he sustained a discussion lasting more than 15 min. At times, he recovered his voice by humming and singing hymns. He had to remove the proxy or communicator. His focus was diverted from the words spoken aloud to relaxing the laryngeal muscles whenever he spoke. The psychological factors that contributed to the onset and maintenance of psychogenic dysphonia were taken into consideration when planning the therapy methods. The cognitive elements identified were personalization and discounting the positives. As part of cognitive behavioral therapy, reorganization and self-monitoring of disordered thoughts were practiced. There is a paucity of cases of psychogenic dysphonia that are successfully handled. The intra-psychic conflict could not be directly addressed by catharsis, due to the prolonged delay. Hence the primary and secondary gains were targeted. As an in-patient, he had regular vocal exercises. His improvement was demonstrated by playing old voice records. His family members reinforced practice at home and acknowledged the improvement. At the workplace, he forced himself to speak. During weekly follow-up, he spoke for nearly 3–4 min with near normal tone and volume then gradually trailed off. Required reinforcements and frequent encouragement for acceptable recovery in the next 5 months. Psychogenic dysphonia is rare in males and the long course has a poor prognosis[5]; hence prompt diagnosis, aggressive management, and frequent reviews are recommended.

In this chapter, some classic histologic findings in acute and chronic poisoning (including substance abuse) are presented. The determination of cause and manner of death in a poisoning requires a careful summation of circumstance, toxicology, and autopsy. Toxicology results are usually necessary, but alone are not sufficient for forming an opinion on cause and manner. Many variables, including postmortem redistribution, post-exposure survival, and overlap between therapeutic and toxic ranges, introduce uncertainty in the interpretation of postmortem drug levels. Gross and microscopic findings at autopsy can be supportive of acute and/or chronic substance abuse or may show unexpected sequelae of chronic substance abuse (e.g., infective endocarditis). Sometimes histology may be the first clue in a case of poisoning. An example of this is finding oxalate crystals in the kidneys of an otherwise unremarkable autopsy, as ethylene glycol is not detected by most toxicology laboratories in routine screening.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Alcoholic hallucinosis is a rare complication of chronic alcohol abuse, characterized by acoustic verbal hallucinations and delusions, mainly of a menacing content, arising in clear consciousness, that appear during or shortly after a period of heavy alcohol consumption. Objectives and aims To outline the key clinical features of alcoholic hallucinosis in order to improve differential diagnosis with other entities. Methods We studied the evolution of an outpatient followed in a Mental Health Centre of Valladolid and compared it with present data about the condition, found in a bibliographic search of articles no older than 10 years about the topic. Results Partial insight about the experience, along with clear consciousness, was key to discard other psychiatric diagnosis that also present acoustic hallucinations. Neuroimagining and functional tests in our patient showed moderate cognitive impairment and cortical atrophy, which contradicts other studies which claim that an acceptable level of cognition must be present in order to gain the necessary insight to meet the diagnostic criteria. Conclusions Alcoholic hallucinosis is a rare form of subacute encephalopathy, secondary to an abrupt stop in a previously chronic and heavy alcohol consumption. Its diagnosis is mainly clinical, and neuroleptics are the most used drug, being abstinence essential for an adequate evolution. The course is usually benign, although the acoustic phenomena may not disappear completely. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "abstract": "Antibiotics are the second most commonly prescribed class of medication in the United States. An awareness and understanding of their potential effects on the central nervous system and their interactions with psychotropic agents is important in the evaluation of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms in patients. Since the introduction of antibiotic agents in the 1930s, numerous (primarily anecdotal) reports have appeared describing psychiatric side effects ranging from anxiety and panic to major depression, psychosis, and delirium in patients with and without a premorbid psychiatric history. Risk factors have included prior psychopathology, coexisting medical conditions, slow acetylator status, advanced age, concomitant medications, and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, as well as high antibiotic dosage and intrathecal or intravenous administration. Psychiatric toxicity may result from various mechanisms of action, including antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid or pyridoxine, adverse interactions with alcohol, or inhibition of protein synthesis. Adverse pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between antibiotics and concomitant medications including lithium, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, valproate, neuroleptics, antidepressants, methadone, and disulfiram have also been reported. Because such effects are often not recognized by clinicians, accurate epidemiologic data on their incidence are not available.",

      "title": "Effects of Drugs on the Electrical Activity of the Brain: Anesthetics",
      "abstract": "The major concepts presented in this review can be summarized as follows: 1. There is a multidirectional continuum of anesthetic states—some represented by CNS excitation and others by depression. 2. The reticular activating system is influenced by all anesthetics; some inhibit its action (stage III) and some hyperexcite the system resulting in a function disorganization (stage II-C). 3. Some agents traverse both excitation and depression, diethyl ether (I, II, III). 4. Others induce only stage II—catalepsia, e.g. nitrous oxide, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-chloralose, phencyclidine, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 5. Others induce no stage II but progress directly from stage I stage III, e.g. halothane and barbiturates. 6. Cataleptic agents may induce further CNS excitation manifested by seizures, e.g. gamma-hydroxybutyrate, phencyclidine, ketamine, alpha-chloralose, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 7. The functional definition of surgical anesthesia is: a stage induced by a drug that makes the subject relatively unresponsive to painful stimuli and amnestic. Thus, the subject does not respond during surgery and cannot recall what happened afterwards. This state can be achieved by functional disruption of CNS systems by marked stimulation or depression.",

      "abstract": "Motivational processes play an important role in addictive behaviours. Craving is mainly an explicit or conscious process that can motivate individuals to continue alcohol, take drugs or smoke cigarettes. Craving also plays a role in relapse; self-reported craving has often been associated with relapse. However, craving cannot explain all addictive behaviours. In addition to craving, implicit cognitive processes play an important part in motivating individuals to become involved in substance use.To describe some of these implicit cognitive processes, namely the role of salience, attention bias, automatic memory associations and action tendencies.A description is given of recent research results and the implications of these implicit processes for clinical practice.Oversensitive/hypersensitive motivational processes and a lack of control over these processes both play an important role in addiction. This can be expressed by an uncontrollable urge to inject the drug or substance again, in spite of the fact that it is unwise for the person in question to do so. Recent research has shown that there are various very promising methods for dealing with these two problems (oversensitive/hypersensitive motivational processes and a lack of control over these processes), either separately or together. The methods involve behavioural training programmes, medication and neural stimulation.The research results are very promising, but more research is needed.",

Involuntary sound perception originating in the head Tinnitus can be caused by: Hearing loss Exposure to loud sounds Extreme stress or trauma Acoustic neuroma Injury to ears, neck or head and heart disease Neurophysiological models indicate the mechanism of tinnitus in an increase in spontaneous activity in the absence of acoustic stimuli. General notes on Tinnitus: 1- Any Tinnitus treatment must be used in connection with counseling and possible other treatment. 2- Tinnitus is a perception of involuntary sound. It must be audible to the person, it originates in the head (McFadden 1982). 3- It is most commonly referred to as ringing in the ears. 4- Produced centrally, with peripheral influences (e.g. Cochlear damage). Exact mechanism(s), or epidemiology is unknown. 5- Noise type can vary from pure tones over modulated noise to crackling sounds that varies significantly with time &amp; Large intensity variations. 6- Not a ‘phantom’ perception for the patient, it is real 7- Tinnitus can be described in many different forms, for example: Ringing, Chirping, Clicking, Pulsating, Continuous, Sudden A-Geriatric tinnitus Presby tinnitus, defined as tinnitus that accompanies the progressive hearing loss of presbycusis; is classified as: type 1 (normal aging affecting the cochlea), and type II (preexistent sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by multiple systemic complaints, especially of sensory ones). B-Pediatric tinnitus has an incidence of 13% in children who passed an audio metric screening test, and 23-60% in those with hearing loss, 44% in secretory otitis media, but only 3% complain spontaneously because that the child considers tinnitus to be a normal event. There is no significant difference between children with tinnitus and those without in terms of hearing level, age, gender, or etiology of the deafness. Despite the fact that often children do not mention it, tinnitus may incite behavioral problems.",

They range from the endless junk food we eat, to the computer games that lock our children to distraction, compulsion, and fixation on a screen. A sense of compulsion pervades addiction. For both appetite and addiction, incentives are mediated by diverse information molecules, which include CRF and dopamine. Chapter 8 explains how CRF is tied both to the ingestion of diverse drugs and to withdrawal. This process, however, is little understood. Indeed, one of the most important discoveries in the addiction research field was that for all addictive drugs that have been tested, this dual phenomenon on ingestion and withdrawal has been expressed; this included cocaine, heroin, alcohol, and cannabis, for example. The brain is active in all stages of addiction (preoccupation/anticipation, binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and psychic pain), and is differentially regulated.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome with Exposure from Tetrahydrocannabinol: a Case Report to Highlight the Side Effects of Increasing Use of CBD Products (5302)",
      "abstract": "Objective: N/A Background: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by over-activation of the serotonin (5-HT) system in the CNS. This can occur with the therapeutic use of serotonergic agents or inadvertent complex drug interactions between serotonergic agents. Clinical presentation varies widely in severity and is diagnosed by the decision rules of Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria, utilizing the three main clinical categories: altered mental status, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities. Design/Methods: A 63 year-old male with medical history most notable for restless leg syndrome (on ropinirole), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, depression on duloxetine, and chronic alcohol abuse presented with altered mental status, shaking, diaphoresis, and an inability to walk. He had initiated intake of THC-infused cheese as a neuropathic pain control measure. On examination, he was afebrile, hypertensive and mildly tachycardic, somnolent, diaphoretic, and diffusely hyperreflexic. Urine toxicology screen was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). He was treated with intravenous fluids and lorazepam with improvement of symptoms. With continued supportive therapy and discontinuation of duloxetine, the patient completely recovered within 48 hours and was discharged home without residual symptoms. Results: N/A Conclusions: The cannabinoid (CB) receptors and endogenous agonists are widely distributed throughout the CNS and are involved in the regulation of mood. This endocannabinoid system is known to regulate serotonergic system through several mechanisms: modulation of 5-HT release, receptor expression, and regulation of excitability of 5-HT neurons. With the legalization of marijuana and increasing access to cannabinoid-containing products, it is imperative to raise awareness of the serotonergic effects of these products and to educate patients to avoid use of these products if they are currently taking a serotonergic agent. Complete workup of a patient with serotonin syndrome should include a urine drug screen and comprehensive social history. Disclosure: Dr. Tschoe has nothing to disclose.

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

      "title": "Successful Treatment of Delayed Neuropsychiatric Sequelae in a Carbon Monoxide Intoxication Patient Using Hyperbaric Oxygen-A Case Report and Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication is a common event which leads to morbidity and mortality. The symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning are non-specific, and include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache or confusion, and even coma or death in patients with more serious neuronal damage. Delayed encephalopathy is another clinical problem that may occur after a recovery from the acute stage of carbon monoxide poisoning. It is clinically characterized by a recurrence of neurological or psychiatric symptoms, which are usually misdiagnosed as psychosis or drug abuse, among others. We report herein a patient who was initially misdiagnosed with psychosis. After a detailed history-taking, neurological and psychiatric examination, and imaging studies, he was diagnosed with delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) of CO intoxication. The symptoms improved significantly after hyperbaric oxygen therapy. According to our experience in the management of CO intoxication, DNS is easily misdiagnosed due to its non-specific symptoms. Hence, clinically, we should keep in mind delayed sequelae after initial recovery in acute CO intoxication, and that hyperbaric oxygen often works in such a situation.",

      "abstract": "Amphetamines are central nervous system (CNS) stimulants and belong to psychoactive drugs that affect chemicals in the brain, nerves and exert a constant contribution to hyperactivity and impulse control. The communal group of amphetamines comprises amphetamine, dextroamphetamine and methamphetamine. Amphetamines show its action on the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system by inducing release of dopamine and to some extent norepinephrine, in the synaptic clefts of the nucleus accumbens and other terminal areas. They offer not only a sense of euphoric state, but also addiction. Amphetamines are frequently prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents and adults, narcolepsy and obesity. At therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, improved cognitive control, etc. The balance of benefit/risk is the main challenge for its clinical use. When overused these medications can be highly addictive, are often diverted from the user to be used as recreational drugs. Adverse effects include anxiety, aggression, headache, insomnia, hyperactivity, palpitations, increased breathing rate, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, arrhythmia, dilated pupils, paranoia, etc. However, at large doses, these drugs may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Even higher doses may give rise to hallucinations, paranoia, psychosis and potentially lifethreatening conditions such as convulsions, stroke, kidney failure, etc. The furthermost serious health implications of amphetamine resulting from chronic use are dependence, considered by compulsive drug-seeking and drug use and a phenomenon notorious as amphetamine psychosis. Therefore the objective of this study was to explore the functions of the amphetamines as recreation drug of abuse.",

This article reviews current state of the art research on the effects of nicotine upon cognition. There are different neurobiological mechanisms involved in acute/chronic smoking and nicotine abstinence. Smoking reinforcement could be due to the initial cognitive improvement, that is, individuals can learn that smoking temporarily increases cognitive functioning (improving some components of attention and memory). These acute nicotine effects improve (i) cognitive performance above smokers' normal levels, and (ii) cognitive disruption resulting from nicotine abstinence. Both neurobiological effects act as reinforcers to nicotine use, greatly contributing to the development of nicotine dependence. However, heavy smoking is associated with cognitive impairment and cognitive decline in middle age. Future clinical research should investigate the role of positive and negative cognitive effects of nicotine in smoking cessation treatment. This is clearly an important scientific issue, with insufficient current data from which to draw definitive conclusions.",

On peut se demander si d'autres médications anti‐comitiales ne produiraient pas chez l'enfant des effets similaires. Des études comparatives objectives restent à faire. En clinique, un contrôle psychologique de l'effet des thérapeutiques s'avère utile si on veut éviter des perturbations psychiques susceptibles d'entraîner à la longue chez l'enfant de graves inadaptations intellectuelles et affectives.",

      "abstract": "An increase in the number of victims of psycho-violence, which has a traumatic effect on the personality, causing emotional stress, stress, discomfort, and depression, necessitates studying the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

In general, intravenous administration of a drug will elicit an adverse effect in a much shorter time period than oral or transdermal drug administration. Questionnaires can be furnished to assist in biological validity of complaints. Such areas of focus could include demographic characteristics, symptom development, mood states, or hazard exposures.

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

      "title": "Clinical and Electroencephalogram Correlation of Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Seizures",
      "abstract": "A 2-year-old, developmentally normal, boy presented with multiple seizure-like events over 10 days. These episodes were described as brief (20–30 s), vacant stares, associated with impaired awareness, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, tongue thrusts, and pallor of the face and body. A few episodes exhibited tonic posturing of the upper limbs [Figure 1 and https://links.lww.com/IPCR/A7]. Other aspects of history were normal. There was no dysmorphism or neurocutaneous markers. Neurological examination was normal. Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (epilepsy protocol) was normal. The drug-induced sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominance [Figure 2]. A diagnosis of Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Seizures (SeLEAS) or \"Panayiotopoulos syndrome\" was made, based on semiology and EEG findings. Seizures stopped within 72 h of starting sodium valproate.Figure 1: The seizure semiology was a vacant stare with impaired awareness associated with hypersalivation, retching, vomiting and tongue thrusting, and pallor of the face and body, lasting for 20–30 s. There was no postictal drowsinessFigure 2: The interictal sleep electroencephalogram record shows frequent sharp wave, spike and slow wave (1–3 Hz, 300–500 microvolt) discharges arising from O1 and O2 with spread to adjacent electrodes, accentuated during photic stimulation. There are independent frequent sharp wave discharges from F3, F4, P3, and FP3 suggestive of multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominanceSeLEAS is a relatively frequent, benign epileptic syndrome characterized by predominant autonomic symptoms and/or focal onset motor seizures. The former include retching, emesis, changes in color (pallor, flushing, or cyanosis), pupillary dilatation, hypersalivation, cardiorespiratory, and thermoregulatory alterations.[1] Clinicians should be aware of this entity as these events are frequently misdiagnosed as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis.[2] Interictal EEG shows occipital spikes. Multifocal spikes with high amplitude sharp-slow wave complexes can also occur at various locations. Seizures will stop in most children within 2–3 years of the first episode. The risk of developing epilepsy in adulthood is similar to the general population. Anticonvulsant therapy (oxcarbamazepine, valproate, and levetiracetam) are indicated when seizure frequency is high.

      "title": "Extrapyramidal Side Effects in a Patient with Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms: A Reflection of Quality of the Mental Health Care System",
      "abstract": "The burden of substance use disorders is increasing in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Individuals with substance use disorders (eg, alcohol use disorder) are at high risk of manifesting extrapyramidal side effects or extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during treatment of alcohol-induced mental illness symptoms especially psychosis. EPS management poses a challenge since some of the drugs used for treating EPS have addictive properties. The knowledge about EPS diagnosis and treatment is not well distributed across the health system, with health workers at lower health facilities having least awareness. The present case gives details of a patient who developed EPS during the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.Following cessation of alcohol use, a 54-year-old man with alcohol use disorder presented with a one-week history of visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations, illusions, insomnia, extreme fear and irritability. He was managed with several daily doses of intramuscular chlorpromazine 100 mg, whenever he woke up aggressive from sedation from a peripheral health facility. Four days after his admission, he became mute, stiff, immobile, triple-flexed, tremulous and was drooling saliva. He was referred to a secondary facility for further management while on antipsychotic medication. Finally, he was referred to a tertiary facility, managed with tablets of benzhexol 5 mg twice daily and intravenous diazepam 20 mg per day. Daily follow-up was done using the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS) for EPS. EPS symptoms resolved ten days after initiation of treatment.EPS among individuals with addictive disorders poses a challenge in its management, especially in countries where the mental health care system is not well developed at lower-level health facilities. The mental health system has to prepare sustainable interventions to properly manage EPS among the growing population of individuals with addictive disorders through strengthening the mental health policy by training and equipping all health providers with knowledge and skills in managing EPS, increasing finances allocated for mental health and controlling the production and use of addictive substances.",

      "title": "Sucht und Demenz",
      "abstract": "Regelmäßiger Konsum führt bei vielen Drogen zu leichten kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen, die unter Abstinenz noch einige Zeit fortbestehen können, aber zum großen Teil reversibel sind. Zum neuropsychologischen Vollbild einer Demenz wie auch zu bleibenden strukturellen Hirnschädigungen kommt es hingegen nur selten. Die größten Risiken dauerhafter struktureller Hirnschäden bergen Kokain, Amphetamine und Ecstasy, geringer ist die Gefahr bei Benzodiazepinen, Cannabis und Opiaten. Selbst beim Alkohol ist unklar, inwieweit die reine Alkoholwirkung zu irreversiblen Hirnschäden führt. Dies ist offenbar nur bei dauerhaften sehr hohen Blut-Alkohol-Konzentrationen der Fall, wahrscheinlich wirken häufig Entzugsyndrome verschlimmernd. Bedeutsamer sind die vielfältigen Alkoholfolge- bzw. -begleiterkrankungen. Dasselbe trifft für das Rauchen und Opiate zu. Beim Wernicke-Korsakoff-Syndrom und der HIV-Enzephalopathie handelt es sich nicht um direkte Folgen des Suchtmittels, sondern um indirekte Komplikationen. Die Wernicke-Enzephalopathie verläuft oft oligosymptomatisch bzw. mit „atypischen“ Symptomen, so dass sie sehr häufig nicht erkannt wird und dann unbemerkt in ein Korsakoff-Syndrom mündet. Suchtmittelkonsum und Sucht-Folgeerkrankungen können auf verschiedene Weise im Sinne der zerebralen Multimorbidität zur Entwicklung degenerativer Demenzerkrankungen beitragen. Diese Rolle des Alkoholmissbrauchs als Kofaktor ist epidemiologisch offenbar am wichtigsten, sie wird die mit zunehmendem Alter immer bedeutsamer. Geringfügiger bis mäßiger Alkoholkonsum ist nicht mit einem erhöhten Demenzrisiko verbunden. Schwerwiegender als die kognitiven Einbußen sind möglicherweise die Beeinträchtigungen der Lernfähigkeit durch chronischen Drogeneinfluss, die soziales Lernen, den Erwerb von Copingmechanismen und Stressbewältigungsfertigkeiten behindern und damit zu Persönlichkeitsveränderungen beitragen. Dies gilt bei Langzeitanwendung wohl auch für Benzodiazepine in therapeutischen Dosierungen. Die Gefahren sind umso größer, je jünger und unreifer das Gehirn ist. Außerdem besteht eine deutliche Beziehung zur kumulativen Dosis.",

      "abstract": "Official statistics indicate that during the last decade, the frequency of borderline mental disorders has rapidly increased. Among those disorders significant numbers involve neurotic and somatoform disorders, reactive depressions, disorders of adaptation, and acute, prolonged, or delayed reactions to stress. Adverse environmental conditions and the vulnerability of individual personalities are considered to play a leading role in the genesis of these disorders. The range of psychogenic factors that give rise to borderline disorders is relatively broad; they include negative macrosocial processes, changes in way of life, extreme situations in war and peacetime, interpersonal conflicts, difficult family situations, personal failures, misfortunes, losses, etc. The development of pathological symptoms is accompanied by maladjustment, disruptions in the patient's social interactions and functioning in the community, family, everyday life, and on the job, and a decrease in the value and quality of life all of which frequently lead to various behavioral deviations: suicidal behavior, aggressive and criminal acts, and/or alcoholism and drug addiction [1, 4, 5].

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "title": "The Use of Adrenal Cortical Hormone in Radiation Sickness",
      "abstract": "Radiation sickness has up to now been considered exclusively as a complication in radiation therapy. Recently this syndrome has attracted more general interest as an important effect of exposure to radiations generated during nuclear fission (atom splitting) (1). The problem of treating radiation sickness has consequently become one of great timeliness and importance. Advances in the study of clinical signs and symptoms of this condition and their etiology have opened new avenues of approach for its treatment. In the light of present-day knowledge, radiation sickness represents a symptom complex involving numerous systems of the body. The symptoms may be grouped as follows (2): General Symptoms Headaches, dizziness, weakness, and occasionally fever Gastro-intestinal Symptoms Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and tenesmus Cardiovascular Symptoms Tachycardia, arrhythmia, and fall in blood pressure Hematological Symptoms Leukopenia, thrombopenia, and increased sedimentation rate Psychic Symptoms Irritability, insomnia, and fear The symptomatology of radiation sickness points to adrenal cortical insufficiency. Further signs in this direction can be found in a study of the metabolic changes occurring in the irradiated body (3). Most prominent among these are the loss of chlorides, disturbance of the water metabolism, decrease of blood cholesterol levels with increased fat deposits in the liver (4), and a biphasic response of the blood sugar and of the hydrogen-ion concentration in blood and tissues. Radiation sickness thus represents a typical case of the “adaptation syndrome” of Selye (5), i.e., the unspecific response of the body to stress, irrespective of its causation by chemicals, bacterial toxins, or physical agents. The course of the adaptation syndrome is largely determined by adrenal cortical activity. This modern concept of radiation sickness agrees perfectly with the long-accepted view of the etiology of radiation sickness as a general intoxication due to tissue decomposition products (3). Research work of recent years has considerably clarified the nature of these toxic substances. In the light of these investigations the toxic agent might best be described as histamine-like in nature, if not histamine itself, for the following reasons: (a) Histamine is capable of producing most of the symptoms of radiation sickness, including those of salt/water metabolism and cholesterol metabolic changes (6), which are prominent in radiation sickness (8). (b) Histamine is also capable of producing fatty changes in the liver (33), as characteristic of the adaptation syndrome (5) and as seen in various animal species following irradiation (4). The accumulated evidence indicates that these fatty changes in the livers of irradiated animals are largely produced indirectly as the result of tissue decomposition products (4). It has furthermore been demonstrated that fatty infiltration of the liver does not occur in adrenalectomized animals (7).",

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

Recent studies have shown that SEPA occurred not only in schizophrenic patients but also in patients on long‐term neuroleptic medication for treating other mental disorders.

      "title": "Biological basis of addiction and alcohol use disorder",
      "abstract": "ADDICTION Addiction is a health condition characterized by extreme difficulty to stop or decrease the use of a drug despite known negative consequences to a person's health and livelihood.1 A drug of addiction is a substance that has the potential to produce addiction in a minority of vulnerable individuals who use that drug. These drugs include, but are not limited to, alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines, sedatives like benzodiazepines and barbiturates, and opioids like heroin and fentanyl. Furthermore, the route of administration plays an important role in the degree to which a drug can be considered addictive. In general, when drug use is temporally coupled to its rewarding or interoceptive effects, that type of use is more addictive than when the drug's subjective effects are temporally decoupled from drug administration. This phenomenon is best exemplified by the difference in addiction liability between oral and i.v. administration of methylphenidate.2 The biological basis of addiction has been well-studied in humans and animal models, which has resulted in a conceptual framework for which to understand the addiction process. This framework includes 3 stages that are cyclical in nature: binge/intoxication, negative affect/withdrawal, and anticipation/preoccupation. Each stage is associated with underlying brain regions and neural circuitry that contribute to the behaviors and mental phenomena characteristic of that stage.1 A person can enter the addiction cycle at any stage, not just the binge/intoxication stage. For example, a person with chronic pain may enter the addiction cycle through the negative affect stage and then transition to binge/intoxication. Others may enter the binge/intoxication stage to self-medicate symptoms associated with psychiatric comorbidities.1 It is a cruel fact that drug use to alleviate these symptoms often exacerbates these symptoms long-term, entrapping a person in the addiction cycle. Therefore, addiction must be treated as a chronic medical disease (eg, diabetes and hypertension) for which long-term treatment is needed for some individuals. While this review will focus on the biological aspects, addiction is biopsychosocial in nature, and the effects of a person's environment and experiences are extremely important and cannot be decoupled from biology. Finally, addiction is extremely heterogeneous, and individual differences play a key role in addiction research and clinical practice. While this review focuses on alcohol, at least some of the concepts that characterize addiction to 1 substance generalize to other substances of addiction. Current alcohol use disorder (AUD) is diagnosed using the DSM-5, at least in the United States (see ICD-11 for international diagnostic criteria and definition), upon meeting at least 2 out of 11 criteria regarding one's symptoms and behaviors related to alcohol use in the past 12-month period. Symptom counts are used to classify mild (2–3), moderate (4–5), and severe (6+) AUD, and alcohol addiction is most associated with moderate to severe AUD. This highlights the important concept of AUD as a spectrum rather than categorical in nature. The neurobiology of addiction is highly distributed and complex, much of which could not be discussed here. For more comprehensive reviews, see.1,3–5 STAGES OF ADDICTION: FOCUS ON NEUROBIOLOGY OF ALCOHOL AND AUD Binge/Intoxication To become addicted, a person usually must use that drug frequently and over a relatively long period of time. Use that transitions to addiction is often binge use, which is heavy intake over a short period of time. For alcohol, binge drinking is defined by the NIAAA as 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more drinks for men in a 2 h period.6 Binge drinking is linked to considerable health risks even for those people who do not transition into addiction.7 All drugs of addiction produce acute interoceptive (subjective) effects, which are usually net rewarding, within the organism.8 For alcohol, these subjective effects are stimulatory during the ascending limb of the blood alcohol concentration curve and sedative during the descending blood alcohol concentration curve. In general, people with greater sensitivity to the stimulatory effects and attenuated sensitivity to the sedative effects of alcohol are more likely to drink more and develop an AUD.9 The stimulatory effects of alcohol are mediated in part by the activation of dopamine and glutamate neurons that project from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (Acb), which is involved in the rewarding effects of nearly all drugs of addiction.1 This occurs in part from alcohol's positive allosteric effects on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA-A) receptor (and increased presynaptic GABA release), resulting in disinhibition of these ventral tegmental area→nucleus accumbens glutamate and dopamine neurons.1 The sedative effects of alcohol are produced in part by alcohol's ability to decrease N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity. Alcohol results in decreased NMDA receptors in the synaptic membrane, resulting in attenuated excitability of the neuron.10 These effects by alcohol on the GABA-A and NMDA receptors (among many other neurotransmitter systems) produce distributed effects on synaptic plasticity throughout the brain that underlie many of alcohol's subjective effects and intoxication. The tight association between drug use and the rewarding subjective effects produces a type of learning or conditioning that over time results in greater salience attribution to drug use and its associated cues (termed incentive sensitization). Again, this phenomenon is associated with the activation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system coupled temporally to drug use and cues, among other distributed processes.1 Negative affect/withdrawal Following binge intake of an addictive drug, people often experience withdrawal and negative affect to some degree, which increases in severity over the course of drug binge use and subsequent periods of nonuse.1 This is a negative emotional state characterized by sadness, anxiety, irritability, malaise, dysphoria, stress, and loss of motivation for natural rewards. The repeated neurochemical effects of alcohol produce adaptations to the nervous system that result in withdrawal during periods of nonuse. These adaptations are homeostatic in nature and reflect the nervous system's \"attempt\" to correct the supra-physiological state that alcohol induces in the nervous system, a phenomenon termed \"opponent process\" in biological systems.1 The acute effects of alcohol produce a net effect of inhibition (diminished excitability through GABA-A and NMDA receptor modifications) of the nervous system that, in an attempt to return to homeostasis, rebounds to a state of elevated excitability of the nervous system. This is the biological basis for why at least some people with AUD experience alcohol withdrawal after abrupt cessation or significant reduction; of note, alcohol withdrawal may significantly vary across people, with some patients presenting with mild symptoms (eg, anxiety and irritability) while others developing severe withdrawal complicated by seizures or delirium tremens. Neuropeptides like corticotropin-releasing factor, dynorphin, neuropeptide Y, oxytocin, and neurotensin are all involved in this stage, as well as stress response and negative emotionality in general. GABAergic, glutamatergic, and neuropeptide adaptations in the extended amygdala are most linked to this negative affect stage. Other brain regions like the habenula and hypothalamus are involved.1 Preoccupation/Anticipation The long-term use of alcohol diminishes cortical control over other parts of the brain, diminishing behavioral flexibility and the ability to choose to use or not to use a drug of addiction, especially under the backdrop of incentive sensitization of drug use and cues and negative affect during nonuse. This stage is also associated with an attentional and motivational bias towards drug procurement and use over other natural rewards. The prefrontal cortex, and its glutamatergic projections are critically involved in this stage, and long-term drug use diminishes the overall activity of the prefrontal cortex. This inability to control drug use behavior is a core component of addiction and is involved in drug relapse following nonuse periods. This stage is also associated with drug craving, which is associated with the insular cortex and many other brain regions.1 EXTRA-CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM PATHWAYS While there is empirical evidence that addiction is a brain disease,1,3 addiction is also a whole-body disease (Figure 1). For example, acute/binge alcohol use upregulates the FGF21 protein in the liver, which results in diminished mesolimbic dopamine activity and decreased alcohol consumption.11 Alcohol also impacts the peripheral and central immune system, which communicates with neurons to impact negative affect during the withdrawal/negative affect stage. Toll-like receptor 4 signaling is closely associated with the inflammatory effects of alcohol and adaptations of microglia in the central nervous system.12 Alcohol-associated changes in neuroactive steroids like allopregnanolone are also involved in the GABA-A potentiating effects of alcohol and interaction with Toll-like receptors.13 Alcohol damages the lining of the gut and disrupts the communication/signaling mechanisms underlying the gut-brain axis, including changes in the gut microbiome/metabolome. Furthermore, changes in gut hormones like ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that regulate feeding behavior based on energy needs are also involved in alcohol craving, seeking, and dependence.14,15 Finally, the vast majority of alcohol is metabolized in the periphery, and these metabolic products impact the nervous system and contribute to the biology of addiction.16 In conclusion, the biology underlying alcohol addiction is highly distributed and involves multiple systems and organs throughout the body. These interactions and mechanisms are not fully understood and highly complex, even more so given the apparent paradox that peripheral-brain connections seem to play important roles in the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of AUD and, at the same time, alcohol is a leading cause of multiple organ damage, including, but not limited to, alcohol-associated liver disease.17FIGURE 1: Addiction as a whole-body disorder. A simplified framework for understanding the key elements of the biological mechanisms underlying AUD and alcohol addiction.

      "abstract": "The current and lifetime comorbidity of depressive (i.e., major depressive disorder and dysthymia) with other common mental disorders was examined in community samples of older adolescents (n = 1,710) and adults (n = 2,060). Current and lifetime histories of depression in the adolescents were highly comorbid with several other mental disorders. The adults had a lower but statistically significant degree of comorbidity, primarily with substance use disorder. Depression in both groups was more likely to occur after the other disorder rather than to precede it. Comorbidity did not affect the duration or severity of depression. Comorbidity in the adolescents was associated with greater frequency of suicidal behavior and treatment seeking. The findings suggest that early-onset depression is associated with a greater degree of comorbidity and may represent a more serious form of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Carbon monoxide poisoning usually results from inhalation of exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, smoke from fires or fumes from faulty heating systems. Carbon monoxide has a high affinity for hemoglobin, with which it forms carboxyhemoglobin. The resulting decrease in both oxygen-carrying capacity and oxygen release can lead to end-organ hypoxia. The clinical presentation is nonspecific. Headache, dizziness, fatigue and nausea are common in mild to moderate carbon monoxide poisoning. In more severe cases, tachycardia, tachypnea and central nervous system depression occur. When carbon monoxide intoxication is suspected, empiric treatment with 100 percent oxygen should be initiated immediately. The diagnosis is confirmed by documenting an elevated carboxyhemoglobin level. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is recommended in patients with neurologic dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction or a history of unconsciousness.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

Such acts persisted for 2 to l0 minutes despite forceful external interruption in three single, white male loners. In contrast, five nonusers, with otherwise similar symptomatology, aborted their homicidal attacks on external interruption, in a previously proposed syndrome with only experiential kindling with memory revival of past hurts in limbic psychotic trigger reaction.

      "title": "Fatigue in anaesthesiology",
      "abstract": "Fatigue affects everyone. We all remember feeling as though we are jetlagged in the middle of a busy night, desperately trying to stay awake at 4 a.m. If an emergency happens adrenaline kicks in and we wake up; it's the more routine work in which we know sleep deprivation takes its toll. The nature of our work as anaesthesiologists and intensivists can make fatigue particularly problematic. Our patients are often unconscious, so conversation with them does not help keep us alert. We use potentially lethal cocktails of drugs, which we often draw up and administer ourselves, and sometimes machines or monitors malfunction. A few moments' lack of vigilance or misinterpretation of physiological parameters can very quickly have disastrous results. These problems are compounded by the increasing challenge of interpreting and responding to a changing situation when we are tired. For example, the failure to recognise a patient's allergies or the miscalculation of a drug dose can lead to adverse events for patients. Moreover, communication becomes poorer as fatigue sets in, so it can be more challenging to use the team's wisdom to resolve a clinical problem.1 Science confirms what our body tells us. After 12 h awake our empathy starts to wane, logical reasoning is harder, vigilance becomes more variable and cognitive and motor skills become worse to a point where, after 16 to 18 h of wakefulness, our performance is as bad as if we were under the influence of alcohol.2 Our mood deteriorates, we find it much more difficult to think flexibly and respond to quickly-changing situations, and are more likely to take risks. After the ninth consecutive hour of work the risk of being involved in an accident increases and after a 12 h shift we are twice as likely to crash driving home than after an 8 h shift.3 Fatigue: an occupational hazard We accept this as an occupational hazard, but other industries have a different approach. Every other safety critical industry, airline, nuclear, electrical, petrochemical, rail and road haulage are required by law to have formal fatigue risk management strategies. This is not because they have a better understanding of sleep physiology, but because they have had to make changes following several high-impact disasters (Chernobyl, Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Challenger accident).1 The European Board of Anaesthesiology (EBA) Workforce, Working conditions, Welfare (WWW) Standing Committee think it is time for European medicine to change its approach. Sleep is safety Potentially, we can capitalise on the general public's interest in our wellbeing, as patient safety is at risk while we are fatigued. It comes as a surprise to an airline pilot that their anaesthesiologist is allowed to administer an anaesthetic after working continuously for 18 h, or to a train driver that a junior doctor is allowed to drive home after a 24 h shift because there are no rest facilities or opportunities to sleep. The cultures are different in these other industries: sleep is safety. We are more likely to earn the respect of the general public, many of whom work in safety critical industries where fatigue risk management systems (FRMSs) are the norm, if we too create a culture where fatigue is seen as a risk to patients and to staff, and systems and resources are put in place to mitigate its effects. Attitudes to work are changing. Many 'generation Y' trainees have a different outlook on work than their 'generation X' and 'baby boomer' consultants. They want a good working atmosphere, a family-friendly approach, and they expect to be well treated, respected and valued as part of the team and get support in their training. They know fatigue impacts on their ability to train and learn. If they are not well managed many generation Y trainees do not stay; they have less loyalty to employers. To them, long hours and working through tiredness are not rites of passage, a sign of being an unbreakable hero or heroine. Generation Z, who will be entering training soon, will interpret such long hours as a sign that the management is out of touch and has not understood basic sleep physiology, or perhaps that management 'do not value their employees sufficiently to provide the resources needed'.4 This may be partly true, circadian physiology was not part of the curriculum 20 years ago. Our understanding of the vital role sleep has for both our safety and for patient recovery has advanced in recent years. We now know that outcomes are worse for patients operated on in the early hours and sleep deprivation in intensive care negatively impacts on recovery, but this is relatively new information.4 One of the core principles in education is to start where the learners are, so we need to ensure that circadian physiology and good fatigue risk management become a core part of the curriculum and senior anaesthesiologists and intensivists are supported in embedding this learning into their clinical work. However, attitudinal learning is not just about embedding facts in our brains, we have to integrate and demonstrate appropriate values in everything we do. Like any learning, this happens in stages. First, we have to hear what is being said and then understand this – the impacts of fatigue on thinking make more sense to us than details about the functioning of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. But only after we value the learning, do we start to put it into place when we are not being observed. Hence, attitudinal learning about fatigue must involve changes in behaviour and changes in attitudes to napping, driving and working when tired, for it to be sustained. Currently, there seems to be a difference in the way learning about sleep physiology is put into practice compared with, for instance, changes in managing ventilation in ICU. One stays only as academic learning, the other is quickly translated into clinical practice. Why is this? ICU ventilators are expensive, much more expensive than sofa beds for staff naps, so it is probably not financially driven. Someone else has to take responsibility while the doctor has a power nap. This might be problematic as we are all understaffed, but it is rare for us to be frantically busy for the whole night. However, organising someone to take the bleep involves creative thinking, planning and negotiating, skills which are much harder as we get more tired, so this may play a role. The ITU ventilator has a direct impact on patient care. In an understaffed environment where the duty to our patients is paramount, the importance of having a power nap in improving the safety of our own clinical practice may be overlooked. We can learn from other industries here, where such behaviour is expected routine practice as part of the FRMS. A change of culture and regulations Expectations of senior staff and management probably have a major influence. Safety literature describes the difference between 'work as imagined' by seniors and managers who once worked in more junior roles, 'work as done' by current junior staff (who do take naps but don't report these), 'work as prescribed' by seniors telling the juniors what is and is not allowed and 'work as disclosed' by juniors reporting to seniors what happened.5 If 'the boss' expects his or her juniors to soldier on and resist their bodies' urge to sleep, trainees are less likely to nap. Often these expectations stem from the senior's own experience when continuing to work while very fatigued was the norm: 'I managed, why shouldn't you cope?'. Moving from a culture where taking a power nap is seen as weak to one where it is regarded as safe practice, as important as checking the drugs or the machine, would help establish safer working practices. When we take a handover from the night staff, the senior should ask 'Have you had a power nap', and if not, make sure the trainee gets home safely, and review the overnight workload, organisational arrangements and support to see if the situation could be improved.5 Some changes have already happened. Efforts have been made in many countries to introduce the European Working Time Regulations to medicine but tighter regulation of working time and better rostering is difficult to achieve with inadequate workforce numbers. In the UK the British Medical Association produced the Fatigue and Facilities Charter and Good Rostering Guide and senior clinicians were appointed to the post of Guardian of Safe Working Hours in every hospital in England.6,7 This has had some positive effects for trainees, but may impact on their clinical experience and, if there are fewer doctors on call, can lead to them having a higher clinical workload. Additionally it does not address the most hazardous fatigue-related activity for doctors; driving home tired after night work.8 Instead of starting with the regulation of working time arrangements, rota design and more staff, we will be more effective if we measure staff tiredness and manage fatigue-related risk. Frequency, duration and intensity of work, individual clinical experience, level of supervision and support from the wider team all influence fatigue-related risk.8 None of this is affected by regulation, but these strategies are known to be effective in the healthcare environment. Many staff do not get the required 8 h sleep per 24 h and are already sleep deprived when they start work. We need to take this into account, ensure they have rest breaks and encourage napping. But most of all we, anaesthesiologists and intensivists, need to acknowledge that fatigue is a patient and staff safety risk, identify and implement strategies that work in our own teams and hospitals to ensure that staff can 'work safely while fatigued'. Individuals, teams and departments and the wider organisation can all play a part in improving fatigue risk management. A change of mindset and attitude at individual level is very productive. Looking after ourselves by practicing 'good sleep hygiene' (simple measures that assure a restful sleep), 'banking' sleep by spending longer than usual in bed before a more challenging session, limiting napping just before work to 30 min to reduce sleep inertia or drinking coffee about 30 min before a challenging anaesthetic case at night, can all be helpful.9 Organisational support is an important factor. Hospital or department directors should make working arrangements reasonable, give help when difficulties arise, be constantly concerned about their employees' physical and mental health, praise the efforts of the team, organise regular teamwork activities – to cultivate the sense of belonging. A good atmosphere of mutual help among doctors is known to improve morale and wellbeing.10 As a profession, anaesthesiologists and intensivists are compassionate individuals who provide support, healing and encouragement to patients. However, fatigued anaesthesiologists find it difficult to demonstrate our core values – caring for others. Fatigue risk management systems FRMSs consist of sets of procedures for the identification and management of fatigue-related safety risks based on continuous risk assessment. These include tracking sleep and work time and using strategies to mitigate the impacts of fatigue on performance.11 Should we follow the lead of other industries that use such a system and develop formal legally binding fatigue risk management regulations in healthcare? At first sight, this might seem attractive, but as Dawson and Thomas8 point out, solutions developed for other industries (e.g. tighter regulation, more staff, better rotas, enforced breaks during shifts and compulsory rest periods before or after on-call) are sometimes ill-suited to healthcare: we can't simply stop work like a lorry driver when he's done too many hours behind the wheel. Sometimes, as Dawson says 'a tired doctor is better than no doctor'.8 Translating improvements from one setting to another will be relevant only if the work setting, workload, job requirements, cultural and organisational arrangements are properly understood. To implement an intervention successfully, it must be realistic and achievable in the specific organisational context, seen as acceptable, helpful, supported and promoted by senior clinicians and managers. An idea cannot simply be imported from industry: in order to work, careful adaptation and intelligent reinvention are needed.12 Dawson suggests that we need a culture change to one where managers and senior clinicians openly acknowledge that fatigue is a patient and staff safety hazard, and put strategies in place to ensure that staff can 'work safely while fatigued'. We need to build an FRMS using multiple, overlapping layers of defence against fatigue-related incidents, such that an error can only occur when all layers of defence fail.13 This is particularly important now with several safety regulatory procedures being temporarily suspended in worldwide healthcare systems because of the COVID-19 pandemic; for example, work patterns, ICU physician–patient ratios, certification of specialisation, all due to dramatically increased number of ICU patients and shortage of personnel. Some relatively simple actions have been used in other settings for many years and may be useful to us in healthcare. In the 1980s Dinges and Rosefield showed that a 40-min nap during a long-haul night flight reduced the frequency of lapses in concentration from microsleeps in pilots. This went on to be described as a 'power nap'; other suggested terms such as 'prophylactic nap' or 'planned nap' were rejected by the American Federal Aviation Authority as not tough enough for their culture.14 Examples of such a culture also exist in medicine with free text comments from our trainee surveys noting 'lead ICU consultant tried to remove on call room', being told 'it's shift work so you shouldn't need to rest', or 'actively dissuaded trainees from resting, including by threatening disciplinary action'. We could provide quiet dark safe spaces for staff to have a power nap during breaks. Other strategies that could be introduced into the way we manage night shifts include education around driving risk, tools to assess your own fatigue level (e.g. Karolinska Sleepiness Score and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and fitness to drive home, places to sleep before going home at the end of a shift, and provision of other forms of transport, such as taxis. There should be specific initiatives to protect anaesthesiologists, intensivists and healthcare workers aged more than 55 years involved in overnight work, as the impact of fatigue can worsen with age.15 Could we institute some of these measures and start to build up an FRMS that works in healthcare settings? Measures could be introduced such as making rest facilities and their usage the norm, minimising the chance of healthcare workers becoming impaired at work through thoughtful rota planning, providing enough staffing and providing education for individuals regarding the impact of fatigue on clinical practice, and additional team effort to detect staff who are overly tried and to support them in an appropriate way. Would this start to change our culture, 'the way we do it here'? We do have opportunities. The pandemic has brought into sharp focus the difficulties of excessive workload, understaffing and poor working conditions. Much has been written about impacts on staff wellbeing, there is increased public awareness of the challenges we face and, in many countries, there has been interest in trying to improve matters.13,15 Conclusion Some will embrace the new; innovators and early adopters who welcome improvement. It only takes 20% of people altering behaviour to start and establish new norms. Others will wait until the ideas become mainstream. A few will remain as laggards, for whom the change is too much of a challenge. The EBA WWW Standing Committee initiated the FATIGUE project in 2019, aiming to raise awareness about the consequences of fatigue both on patient safety and on anaesthesiologists' wellbeing and safety. Collaborating closely with the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care and other organisations, the EBA WWW working group aims to promote a change of culture and regulations in our specialty by multiple means: evaluation of current European practice (surveys), educational events, publications. The EBA WWW group is working closely with trainees; it won't be many years before there are enough newly appointed consultants to influence safety education about good fatigue management. Of course, we also have a large group of established consultants who also embrace this approach. Hopefully, there will soon be a change of culture and regulations. After all, why should healthcare not have the same requirement for fatigue risk management as every other safety critical industry?",

      "abstract": "The non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem is frequently administered as a short term psychopharmacotherapy for insomnia. Although it is well-established in a broad clinical routine and often well-tolerated, severe delirium and complex sleep behavior were reported in rare cases. Hereby, it remains unclear whether zolpidem's potential for delirium might be enhanced when combined with further psychopharmacotherapeutics. The present case report portrays a young male Caucasian inpatient with schizoaffective disorder, who was admitted due to severe hyperactive delirium after a single dose of zolpidem 10 mg that was administered in addition to already established psychopharmacotherapy including clozapine 200 mg/day, aripiprazole 15 mg/day and cariprazine 4.5 mg/day. In detail, disorientation, agitation, confabulations, bizarre behavior, and anterograde amnesia occurred shortly after ingestion of zolpidem and gained in intensity within a couple of hours. Once zolpidem was discontinued, the abovementioned symptoms subsided completely and did not reoccur. Since a clear temporal association could be drawn between the intake of zolpidem and the onset of hyperactive delirium, the present clinical experience should serve as a cautionary note for combining potent sedative-hypnotics and substances with anticholinergic properties, even in young adults in a good general condition. Moreover, our case argues for the necessity of further research into the pathomechanism of the interaction potential of non-benzodiazepines as zolpidem, especially with substances exerting anticholinergic properties, which are known for their potential to precipitate delirium. Therefore, the metabolic pathways of the concurrently administered substances should be further taken into account.",

Whether local brain stimulation, electroconvulsive shock (ECS), or metrazol the consequence of periodic administration of convulsive agents was found to be the same; in each case repeated application of the agent resulted in the gradual development and intensification of convulsive symptoms (kindling). Moreover, in each case the resulting intensification was not specific to the agent being used and seemed to increase the responsiveness to convulsive agents in general. In the present studies this interaction was seen in the form of an intensified alcohol withdrawal syndrome observed 18 days after cessation of a series of metrazol injections, amygdaloid stimulations, or ECS. Thus, it appears that one of the hazards of the convulsive therapies is that they may induce enduring changes in brain function which leave the patient in a state of increased susceptibility to a variety of potentially convulsive agents.",

      "abstract": "Implantation Complicated by Intracranial HemorrhageCatatonia is a syndrome of motor dysregulation characterized by fluctuating stupor, mutism, negativism, catalepsy, automatic obedience, and stereotypy. 1 Other motor signs include gegenhalten, mitgehen, waxy flexibility, echophenomena, and ambitendency.The diagnosis requires two to four features. 2 The pathophysiology of catatonia remains unclear but may involve dysfunction of frontal circuitry and motor regulatory brain areas.Catatonia is most closely associated with mood disorders but also results from medications (e.g., dopamine blockers and serotonergic agents), metabolic derangement, seizures, or focal structural brain lesions. 2 We present a patient with Parkinson's disease (PD) who developed catatonia during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery complicated by intracranial hemorrhage.The patient was a 60-year-old right-handed woman with levodopa-responsive PD for 12 years.Prior to surgery, she was taking levodopa 800 mg, entacapone 800 mg, and ropinirole 8 mg daily but experienced debilitating motor fluctuations, abrupt ''off'' periods, and dyskinesias, despite adjustments to her medication regimen.She had a history of nonmelancholic depression treated with citalopram 20 mg daily.During presurgical evaluation, she had no dementia on neuropsychological testing or evidence of an active mood disorder.Off-on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) testing demonstrated at least a 32% improvement to her standard morning levodopa dose.She was deemed an appropriate DBS candidate and underwent surgical placement of DBS electrodes into each subthalamic nucleus using microelectrode recordings.The surgery was conducted in the off medication state, over 12 hours after her last dose of PD medication.Mild hypertension during the procedure was controlled with low doses of metoprolol.Before DBS electrode placement, the patient spoke only when asked questions or to complain of intermittent left arm pain.During right electrode placement, she gradually developed dystonic flexion posturing of the left arm and intermittent flexion of the right arm and left leg.When asked questions or given commands, she was mute.She had gegenhalten in both arms and eyelids upon passive manipulation.She had no motor weakness.Other catatonic features included a protruding grimace (schnauzkrampf), bilateral grasp reflexes, and mitgehen in the right arm.Differential considerations included a worsening of her parkinsonian ''off'' state versus catatonia.Lorazepam 2 mg",

      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided.Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination.Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Although catatonia was conceptualized as a subtype of schizophrenia, it is now recognized to occur most commonly in the course of other psychiatric disorders, in drug-induced disorders [1] or neurologic conditions [2]. Catatonia is rarely seen together with OCD and there are a limited number of case reports in the literature [3,4]. Objective We describe the case of a 12 year boy who presented in our clinic with mutism, negativism, immobility, social withdrawn, rigid posture, refusal to eat. Method We performed a thorough psychiatric diagnostic assessment of the child as well as laboratory tests and MRI of the brain. Results The child's first symptoms appeared 2 years ago: initially the child became socially withdrawn, spent most of time at his room, and became preoccupied with rituals of hand washing, walking back and forth, preoccupations with food contamination, became aggressive if someone would interrupt what he was doing, stopped going at school, and stopped calling his parents “mother” or “father”. Brain MRI showed lateral ventricular asymmetry and suboccipital cyst. Conclusions The child was put on therapy with lorazepam and sertraline. His obsessive-compulsive symptoms improved, and the apparent catatonic like features resolved and did not return over follow-up. Discussion Catatonia is not uncommon among children and adolescents, and the relationship between OCD and catatonia is still misunderstood, but it may be an indicator of the severity of the OCD.

Spectroscopic magnetic resonance has found some signs of neuronal injury and glial proliferation, predominantly in frontal lobes. Functional neuroimage techniques have found defects in blood brain perfusion, that can be persistent during some months, after detoxification, and that have been associated to the presence of cognitive impairment and other neuropsychological disturbances. Furthermore a reduction in dopaminergic receptor D2 density has been fond in the cerebral cortex and a decrease in the binding to the dopamine transporter, in basal ganglia and thalamus, might be related to a hipodopaminergic state of the brain, due to chronic cocaine abuse. Cognitive and mood symptoms, and behavioral disturbances shown by cocaine abusers, while in a recovery therapeutic program, can be related to brain organic disturbances, induced by cocaine, and can increase the early relapse risk.",

Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them. These “minor” events can still progress to more significant harm.",

      "abstract": "Pre trial detention is a coercion measure where a suspect is incarcerated between the time he or she is being arrested until the trial. A pre trial detainee is considered innocent until proven guilty and thus it is important that the detention is not used as a punishment or rehabilitation. Whether a detainee is innocent or not he or she should be treated with respect for his or her human dignity. If there is a risk that a pre trial detainee will remove or effect evidence in the ongoing criminal investigation The court may allow the prosecutor to impose restrictions which limit the detainees contact with the outside world. Individual restrictions should be proportional to their means and used restrictively. \r\nExtensive use of such restrictions in combination with a long period of detention may lead to isolation of a detainee increasing the risk of anxiety, reduced cognitive abilities, sleeping difficulties and memory loss. Extended periods of isolation may even lead to serious mental illness such as personality changes and post traumatic stress disorder. Such isolation and its consequences has been compared to psychological torture. Another aspect of this matter is that a detainee who is experiencing mental illness may be disadvantaged when it comes to participating in interrogations, appearing in court or preparing his or her defence. \r\nThe Swedish pre trial detention system has been widely criticized due to an extensive use of restrictions, long detention times and the treatment of adolescents in custody. Nearly 50 % of all the detainees where subject to one or more types of restrictions and there are examples of detainees in Sweden that have been in pre trial detention with full restrictions up to three or four years. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) and the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (SPT) have visited Sweden eight times altogether since 1991. The purpose of the visits has been to evaluate the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty. The reports and recommendations following the visits have shown that there is a need for change for Sweden to better meet the mental health of detainees in pre trial detention.\r\nIn April 2015 the Swedish prosecutor general provided guidelines directed to Swedish prosecutors. The guidelines aim to change the procedure of imposing restrictions of detainees and to reduce the time they spend in pre trial detention. The subject of this thesis is the question of whether these guidelines will change the prevailing situation, or if they need to be supplemented by legislative measures. Among the proposals of what such legislative measures might look like are detailed regulation regarding the use of restrictions, established time limits for pre trial detention and isolation, and a procedure where the District Court Judge has a greater influence on the restrictions that are imposed. In my opinion, Swedish custody laws are in great need of change in order to make sure that the needs of the detainees and their mental health are respected.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "It is known from clinical studies that some patients attempt to cope with the symptoms of post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by using recreational drugs. This review presents a case report of a 19‐year‐old male patient with a spectrum of severe PTSD symptoms, such as intense flashbacks, panic attacks, and self‐mutilation, who discovered that some of his major symptoms were dramatically reduced by smoking cannabis resin. The major part of this review is concerned with the clinical and preclinical neurobiological evidence in order to offer a potential explanation of these effects on symptom reduction in PTSD. This review shows that recent studies provided supporting evidence that PTSD patients may be able to cope with their symptoms by using cannabis products. Cannabis may dampen the strength or emotional impact of traumatic memories through synergistic mechanisms that might make it easier for people with PTSD to rest or sleep and to feel less anxious and less involved with flashback memories. The presence of endocannabinoid signalling systems within stress‐sensitive nuclei of the hypothalamus, as well as upstream limbic structures (amygdala), point to the significance of this system for the regulation of neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to stress. Evidence is increasingly accumulating that cannabinoids might play a role in fear extinction and antidepressive effects. It is concluded that further studies are warranted in order to evaluate the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in PTSD. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

Causation of the mental symptoms in certain cases is outlined, schematically, as a complex system of vicious circles, in which the two factors of anxiety and metabolic imbalance both play a part. 4. In view of our personal good results in such cases, a high-vitamin diet is recommended for tentative trial not only in acute or subacute psychoses characterized by delirium and amentia, but also in acute episodes of the organic-reaction type which occur in the course of schizophrenic and manic-depressive psychosis.",

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Benzodiazepines and Z‐drugs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

      "abstract": "L’alcoolo-dépendance est une maladie chronique hautement récidivante dont l’enjeu principal est la prévention des rechutes. Les rechutes sont favorisées par le ressenti du sujet vis-à-vis de son environnement social [1]. L’alcoolo-dépendance entraîne des troubles cognitivo-comportementaux dont des déficits de reconnaissance émotionnelle et une altération des interactions sociales [2] majorant le risque de rechutes [3]. Ces troubles pourraient être liés à une altération du sentiment de familiarité. La familiarité se définit comme un sentiment de connaissance préalable d’un stimulus générant une émotion inconsciente, sans souvenir conscient de son identité [4]. Nous nous proposons d’étudier la familiarité aux visages dans l’alcoolo-dépendance. Douze patients alcoolo-dépendants (AD) étaient appariés en sexe et en âge à 12 témoins (T). Les participants ne présentaient ni trouble psychiatrique, ni neurologique, ni addiction en dehors d’un trouble d’usage sévère d’alcool pour le groupe AD (classification DSM-5). Des morphes entre visages familiers et inconnus (contenant 5 à 95 % du visage familier) étaient présentés. Les sujets devaient indiquer les visages leur semblant familiers. Un pourcentage de réponse « familier » était alors calculé par niveau de familiarité, permettant de construire une fonction psychométrique par sujet, et d’en déduire le seuil de familiarité (pourcentage de familiarité contenue dans le morphe pour lequel 50 % des stimuli étaient considérés comme familiers). Les interactions sociales étaient évaluées par une échelle de cognition sociale (MASC). Le seuil de familiarité était significativement plus faible dans le groupe AD que dans le groupe T (48,79 % versus 54,94 % – p = 0,025). Parallèlement les 2 groupes différaient sur les scores au MASC (AD : 26/45 ; T : 31/45 – p = 0,015). Ces résultats démontrent une hyperfamiliarité dans l’alcoolo-dépendance, associée à une altération de la cognition sociale. L’implication de l’altération de ces deux processus sur les risques de rechute est abordée.",

Explaining the concept of depression synonyms is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment of related disorders. Method: In this qualitative review, content of five depression synonyms including Jazaa, Hozn, Khobse-Nafs, Gham and Karb has been analyzed by using of texts and dictionaries in Iranian Traditional Medicine, dictionaries references in era of Islamic civilization and recent books. Results: In this part conceptions and definitions of each keywords was set (In compliance with the temporal series of resources) in a separate table. Discussin and Conclusion: The results elucidates Gham which is source of other psychiatric disorders, is feeling of heart compression and wish something related to the last time that there is no possibility of achieving it. Hozn is a grief mood following the loss of a favorite that gradually increases over time. Jazaa is severe stage of Hozn that person be disappointed to his desire and therefore become impatient and intolerant (doing behaviors like slap in the face and screaming and ripping the collar.) Karb is increasing Gham or sadness that causes a feeling of pressure on the chest. Khobse-Nafs is an inner discomfort and psychological clogging without any obvious reason. In conclusion, the words in medical resources express physiological state and in dictionaries express psychological state.",

Substance abuse among this age group is associated with significant psychiatric morbidities that differ according to the substance used. Many literature studies were conducted to explore the psychiatric conditions and consequences associated with substance abuse. To date, cannabis was the most common substance studied and the most well-known illicit drug to be associated with various psychiatric co-morbidities. Other studied substances include alcohol, opiates, barbiturates, hallucinogens, and inhalants. The psychiatric effects of various substances depend on the state, the duration, and the dose of their use.

When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

Along the evolution, it´s usual to find psychotic symptoms, especially auditory hallucinations. We present a case with atypical evolution: The subject presents auditory hallucinations, with a good response to psychopharmacological treatment. The presence of these symptoms could be observed in the first years of the diseases. We describe the status of the patient at the admission, the evolution during the stay, with the increase of symptoms in several areas (cognitive, motor, neurologic), and the current status, after hospitalization, where the patient begun receiving enteral nutrition by gastrostomie, due to the limitations to receive the treatment and /or nutrition by oral way. This case is also interesting due to the use of Metformine, an antidiabetic agent, whose use has been suggested as therapeutic alternative for this syndrome.",

Secondly, at this age, the prescription of drugs rises questions about pharmacokinetics, possible side-effects, expected therapeutic effects and the way the prescription is experienced psychologically. Neuroleptics, which may be necessary in spite of their side-effects, should be restricted to psychotic conditions. Antidepressants, lithium, tranquilizers are also discussed with respect to their usefulness, risks and indications.

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "abstract": "Introduction Most pleasures have been condemned at some time and many laws have attempted to prohibit supposedly harmful behavior. Evolution has not collaborated perhaps because addictive behaviors, associated with reward and pleasure circuits/centers in the brain, are important for survival. Withdrawal symptoms are treatable with nicotine replacement therapy. Pleasure, is a harder problem to tackle and is associated with rituals, the senses and affect regulation and may be a major culprit in relapse. Dopamine dysregulation may favor addiction and addiction may lead to dopamine dysregulation. Many psychiatric patients may have dopaminergic dysregulation and altered pleasure circuit function and are more prone to addiction, especially to nicotine, and probably harder to help. Objectives/aims A reflection on desire and pleasure in smokers in general and psychiatric patients and on possible strategies to overcome these difficulties. Methods 1) A review of philosophical, sociopolitical, biological and neuropsychiatric views of pleasure 2) Rating of smoking as a pleasure on a visual analog scale on first assessment of a smoking cessation program in a psychiatric hospital 3) Reflections on difficulties encountered in a smoking cessation program and possible strategies to overcome these Results and conclusions Treating addictions poses tremendous challenges since the very mechanisms nature disposed for survival, are those gone awry. Pleasure is identified as a major driving force behind addiction in tobaco smoking therefore should be specifically addressed in smoking cessation programs. Psychiatric patients who smoke tobaco are an especially difficult patient population and one of the contributing factors may be dopamine dysregulation/pleasure dysregulation.",

      "title": "Child abuse and neglect: psychiatric and neuro-biological consequences",
      "abstract": "Child abuse and neglect is a common problem that is potentially damaging to long-term physical and psychological health of children. Over the past, researchers have documented this relationship and have identified two possible mechanisms that can explain the increased incidence of childhood stress and consequent adult somatic disease: the increased incidence of health harming behaviors and causes epigenetic and other changes that predispose individuals to disease through a raised non-specific inflammatory profile [1]. Abuse survivors, as well as persons who have experienced other types of childhood adversities, are more likely to participate in high-risk behaviors [2]. Possible etiologic factors in survivors' health problems include abuse-related alterations in brain functioning that can increase vulnerability to stress and decrease immune function. Adult survivors are also more likely to participate in risky behaviors that undermine health or to have cognitions and beliefs that amplify health problems [2].\r\n\r\nChildhood abuse and early life stress may become hard-coded into the genome, creating an epigenetic memory of events that leads to impaired health at a later date [3].\r\n\r\nChronic early life stress results in long-term changes in HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis function and regulation typified by hypersecretion of CRH and ACTH. The initial hypersecretion of cortisol may over time lead to blunting of the cortisol response to CRH and ACTH and relative glucocorticoid resistance. A decrease in glucocorticoid levels or impaired glucocorticoid receptor function might then lead to increased stress responsiveness [2].\r\n\r\nChildhood abuse and neglect is also associated with reduced adult hippocampal volume, particularly on the left side, and these findings support the hypothesis that exposure to early stress in humans, as in other animals, affects hippocampal subfield development [4].\r\n\r\nAnother recent study demonstrate that children who experienced two or more types of violence exposure showed significantly accelerated telomere erosion from age-5 baseline to age-10 follow-up measurement compared with children who had one type of violence exposure or who were not exposed to violence [5].\r\n\r\nPeople experience and interpret physical and emotional insults in diverse ways and many contextual factors affect the phenomenology of abuse and neglect, and in Italy there are many children victims of various types of maltreatment particularly within their own families. But we must not forget the most vulnerable children who may have even more serious consequences: those who live in foster care [6] or abandoned babies [7] that are actually little-known but that equally needs of social interventions, health and human rights.",

      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "title": "Cannabidiol as a Potential Antipsychotic",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are psychiatric conditions that express by a wide range of symptoms. Current treatments are effective in controlling so-called positive symptoms (e.g., delusions or hallucinations) but are often less effective for negative symptoms (e.g., blunted affect and passive social withdrawal) as well as for cognitive impairments. Further, current anti-psychotics may induce several side-effects that limit use and patient adherence. Therefore, mechanistically novel anti-psychotics are urgently needed. Cannabidiol, a major cannabinoid of Cannabis sativa, has been investigated in both animal models for aspects of schizophrenia, clinical studies, and controlled trials. Animal studies have raised substantial evidence for cannabidiol’s anti-psychotic effects. While controlled clinical trials have shown mixed results, studies using cannabidiol at higher dosages have demonstrated its ability to ameliorate psychotic symptoms while showing a relatively benign side-effect profile. Although the currently available data is short of any proof justifying the registration of cannabidiol as an anti-psychotic at present, the data from phase II clinical trials justify further study of cannabidiol’s antipsychotic properties in controlled clinical trials to clarify its therapeutic value and safety profile, notably in long-term treatment. In addition, more insight into its mechanisms of action may broaden our understanding of new targets for treatment.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

There are many factors that play role in depression are like alcohol or drug abuse, Divorce, sleeping problem, job loss, death or illness of someone close to you, social isolation etc. Depression can change or distort the way you see yourself, your life, and those around you. People who have depression usually see everything with a more negative attitude, unable to imagine that any problem or situation can be solved in a positive way. Conventional antidepressant drugs are usually associated with many side effects. Sometimes herbal remedies play important role in treatment of depression. However, Ayurvedic knowledge needs to be coupled with modern medicine and more scientific research needs to be done to verify the effectiveness, and elucidate the safety profile of such herbal remedies for their antidepressant potential, now a day's herbal remedies are more in use due to fewer side effects.

      "abstract": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurring and repetitious thoughts coupled to anxiety characterized by obsessive thoughts and associated compulsive behavior(s). The OCD patient often fears that the anxiety will not abate and obsessional thoughts will control her/his mind or body in advocating or carrying out unwanted compulsive behaviors. Such thinking patterns or behaviors may often be frightening but usually they are quite harmless except when promoting accompanying anxiogenic activity. Confused thinking may be severe enough to cause functional impairments when obsessions or compulsions dominate mental status. In OCD, disrupted thoughts and actions may dominate the normal conduct of everyday tasks. Anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts is usually relieved by time-consuming and significant effort-requiring compulsive behaviors. Compulsive activities like diversionary counting, checking behavior (e.g., like repeatedly checking whether the stove is on or off), or excessive cleaning activity dominate the response to obsessive thoughts. Excessive hand washing (sometimes called the Pontius Pilot Syndrome) occurring as a compulsive behavior, not only relieves the causal obsession but serves as a “refresh button” (i.e., like that found on a computer)--clearing the mind of obsessions, compulsive urges, and extraneous thoughts. The major extracts of the Cannabis sativa plant are primarily delta9-THC (causing intoxication, psychosis, often anxiety) and secondarily the non-psychotomimetic compound Cannabidiol (CBD). Studies have found multiple therapeutic actions in the uses of CBD—with anxiolytic activities (i.e., opposing the anxiogenic actions of delta9-THC), anti-psychotic activities, and lessening of the compulsions that occur with OCD and other psychiatric conditions.

The classical conditioning contributes to the development of hypersensitivity of respiratory passages to non-allergic stimuli, which are associated with recurrent experiences of bronchial irritation caused by infection or allergies. The instrumental learning appears to be related to the conditioning of certain emotional reactions (e.g. fear of separation, feeling of rejection). A psychogenic asthmatic attack is produced by the simultaneous influence of a number of factors, e.g. presence or absence of local irritation of bronchial mucosa, general state of child's health, amount of conditioning to non-allergic stimuli and arousal of certain emotional states. In other words, an asthmatic child, in good physical health and without respiratory infection or irritation, is less likely to have a psychogenic asthmatic attack while enjoying his play activities.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome develops in individuals with alcohol dependence who discontinue or reduce alcohol intake after long-term or binge drinking. Withdrawal symptoms usually occur 6–8 hours after the last alcohol consumption and peak between 24–72 hours. Typical manifestations include tremor, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, agitation, and excess sweating. Complicated withdrawal syndrome may manifest with seizures (including cluster seizures), status epilepticus, acute psychosis and delirium, when hallucinations are accompanied by disorientation in time, place and situation. About 10–15% of patients develop complicated withdrawal syndrome. The seizures in alcohol withdrawal syndrome are triggered in the brain stem and have a mechanism other than that of classic epileptic seizures. Benzodiazepines, which are more effective than other classes of anticonvulsants (they primarily reduce the frequency of convulsions in the first two days after alcohol discontinuation and significantly reduce the risk of death), are the gold standard for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) is a helpful tool for making decisions on treatment initiation or discontinuation. It should be noted that chronic use of benzodiazepines in the secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures is not recommended due to the addictive potential of these agents and a more severe course of alcohol withdrawal seizures with benzodiazepine co-dependence.",

It is not uncommon to occur co-morbidly between narcolepsy and psychiatric disorders. This association is poorly understood. Recent findings indicate that anxiety disorders also are associated with typical symptoms of narcolepsy. Objectives Study of the comorbidity between narcolepsy and psychiatric disorders, like anxiety, through a clinical case. Methods A 21-year-old female patient with no psychiatric history who consulted due to anxiety and panic attacks related to poor narcolepsy control. Debut of the neurological disease during adolescence with frequent cataplexy attacks that condition their daily activity and generate avoidance behaviors and agoraphobia. Results The patient complained of poor quality of sleep and reported a large number of different types of situations (eg, surprise, embarrassment) associated with cataplectic events. Treatment with SSRIs first and bupropion with pregabalin later was partially effective. Recent studies suggest efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation. Conclusions Anxiety disorders, especially panic attacks and social phobias, often affect patients with narcolepsy. Anxiety and mood symptoms could be secondary complications of the chronic symptoms of narcolepsy. Recent studies have shown that narcolepsy is caused by defective hypocretin signaling. As hypocretin neurotransmission is also involved in stress regulation and addiction, this raises the possibility that mood and anxiety symptoms are primary disease phenomena in narcolepsy. Recent studies suggest that vagus nerve stimulation could be potentially useful in the treatment of resistant depressive and anxiety disorder and it is not a contraindication in patients with narcolepsy.

      "title": "Disulfiram neuropathy: two case reports",
      "abstract": "Neuropathy is a rare adverse side effect of disulfiram therapy and is under-recognized. There have been few case reports documenting this side effect. Two cases of disulfiram peripheral neuropathy are discussed. The first case is that of a 25-year-old Caucasian woman who was exposed to disulfiram therapy for a total of 8 months and developed pain and stiffness that prevented her from walking. The second case is that of a 46-year-old Caucasian woman who developed sudden-onset numbness in her lower extremities with progression to pain. Her symptoms improved over the course of 2 months after cessation of disulfiram therapy. In both cases, symptoms improved after cessation of disulfiram therapy. Disulfiram neuropathy occurs in persons with a history of chronic alcohol use. It is under-recognized and often attributed to alcoholic neuropathy given its comorbidity with alcoholic neuropathy. A greater understanding of this side effect may reduce neurologic complications related to disulfiram neuropathy and aid in early withdrawal of this offending agent.",

O órgão alvo crítico é o cérebro, promovendo sinais e sintomas de encefalopatia mais ou menos acentuada, tais como, cefaléia, perda de memória, perda da concentração e atenção em tarefas corriqueiras, alterações de humor, com irritabilidade, depressão, insônia, ou sonolência, estupor, convulsões e coma, dependendo da dose e duração da exposição. O diagnóstico é confirmado pela dosagem de chumbo no sangue (plumbemia) ou na urina (plumbúria), ou de algum dos parâmetros de efeito do chumbo na cadeia de formação da hemoglobina, tais como o ácido deltaminolevulínico no sangue ou na urina e protoporfirina eritrocitária no sangue. O tratamento da intoxicação é feito com quelantes. Por questão de custos e disponibilidade comercial, a experiência acumulada no Brasil restringe-se ao uso do dimercaprol (BAL), do versenato de cálcio (EDTACaNa2) e da D-penicilamina. Entretanto, os quelantes mais eficazes são o EDTACaNa2 por via parenteral e o ácido dimercapto succínico (DMSA) por via oral. O BAL pode ser utilizado juntamente com o EDTACaNa2 em casos de adultos com sintomatologia encefalopática, ou em crianças mesmo sem sintomas de SNC, pois diferentemente do EDTACaNa2 ele passa a barreira encefálica quelando chumbo presente no cérebro ou impedindo que chumbo mobilizado durante o uso do EDTA aja no cérebro da criança.",

      "title": "Autistic phenomena in neurotic patients 1",
      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

The diagnosis is based on clinical examination and occurs in both pediatric and adult patients and is associated with an increased mortality. Catatonia is associated with psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia, major depression, encephalitis, and bipolar disorder. The physiopathology of catatonia is complex and not fully understood. There is an ongoing debate in the medical community whether catatonia is an independent syndrome, or secondary to other mental illnesses. This case presentation is unique, as there are few reports describing cases of isolated catatonic syndrome in the absence of any other psychiatric or medical condition with a delayed onset caused by recreational drug abuse.",

      "title": "Neurological Involvement in Inherited Metabolic Diseases: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

      "title": "1、吗啡成瘾及吗啡对其他学习记忆的影响 2、老年猕猴初级视觉皮层细胞时间及空间特性的改变",
      "abstract": "一、 药物滥用是一种慢性、复发性脑疾病。药物滥用将导致药物成瘾（addiction），其主要表现有药物依赖、药物耐受、药物敏感化以及药物停用后的戒断症状（withdraw symptom）。药物成瘾的核心特征是强迫性觅药和用药行为。药物成瘾会导致药物滥用者认知功能的损伤和认知偏差，并会造成滥用者情绪异常。药物成瘾是一个复杂的生物学过程，有着及其复杂的机理。对药物成瘾机制的解释有很多种，主要认为成瘾过程是一种学习记忆过程，学习记忆的机制在药物成瘾过程中起到了非常重要的作用。首先，学习记忆和药物成瘾过程都受到了相似的神经营养因子以及神经递质系统的调控，例如：它们都受cAMP，CREB等调控因子的调控。其次，研究发现与成瘾相关的线索，如用药有关的人物、地点或暗示等，在药物戒断很长时间后都会恢复吸毒者的用药行为。并且，当把与成瘾相关的线索呈现给毒品戒断中的人时，这些人会出现心率、呼吸加快，血压升高等现象，甚至表现出明显的渴求行为。药物对学习记忆的影响是复杂的，虽然重复使用药物会导致药物成瘾，并且这个过程需要学习记忆机制的参与，但同时使用吗啡却会对其他类型的学习记忆（如：恐惧性学习记忆、一次性被动回避学习记忆和水迷宫空间学习记忆）造成破坏。学习前给予吗啡可以剂量及状态依赖地破坏被动回避试验以及空间辨别试验的记忆获取过程。学习过程结束后立即给予吗啡可以破坏一次性被动回避试验、主动回避试验和恐惧条件化试验的记忆巩固过程。测试前给予吗啡可以破坏空间辨别试验的记忆提取过程。本研究的目的在于更进一步地了解使用吗啡导致吗啡成瘾以及使用吗啡导致学习记忆的各个阶段受损的机制。为此我们采用了药理学以及多种行为学的方法，1、用PTZ诱发的癫痫持续状态干扰吗啡成瘾的学习记忆过程，进一步比较了吗啡成瘾的学习记忆与其他学习记忆，例如：空间学习记忆以及食物奖赏学习记忆的机制有何异同；2、研究了β-肾上腺素系统与阿片系统在空间记忆巩固过程中的相互作用；3、我们还研究了NMDA受体的激动剂和拮抗剂在吗啡破坏空间记忆提取过程中的作用。研究结果发现： 1．戊四唑诱发的癫痫持续状态，对吗啡建立的条件化位置偏好没有任何影响，动物仍然对阳性箱（吗啡匹配箱）表现出明显的偏好。但是癫痫持续状态破坏了食物建立的条件化位置偏好，并且还破坏了水迷宫和Y迷宫检测的空间记忆。癫痫持续状态破坏了食物建立的条件化位置偏好，原因不是由于其影响了动物的食欲。此外，癫痫持续状态也没有持续地破坏动物的活动能力，因此，对动物活动量的影响也不是造成其他学习记忆破坏的原因。这些结果说明，吗啡成瘾的学习记忆和普通的学习记忆在机制上可能存在不同之处。为了说明这个问题，我们还需要进行其他更深入的研究。 2、训练后立即单独注射吗啡（0.25和2.5 mg/kg）或心得安（2，10和20 mg/kg）都不会破坏动物Y-迷宫空间记忆的巩固过程，动物仍然能识别新异环境，并在里面停留较长时间。但是，训练后同时注射吗啡和心得安却可以破坏动物空间记忆的巩固过程。并且，较高剂量的吗啡（2.5 mg/kg）加上较高剂量的心得安（10和20 mg/kg）对记忆的破坏更严重，实验组动物在新异环境停留的时间显著低于对照组。这说明阿片系统和去甲肾上腺素系统在破坏记忆巩固的过程中可能有协同作用。 3、记忆提取前30分钟注射吗啡（1和10 mg/kg）可以剂量依赖地破坏Y-迷宫空间记忆的提取。单独注射NMDA受体的激动剂NMDA（1，2和4 mg/kg）对动物的空间记忆提取没有影响，但是，单独注射NMDA受体拮抗剂MK-801（0.05，0.1和0.2 mg/kg）剂量依赖地破坏了空间记忆的提取。同时注射吗啡（10 mg/kg）和NMDA（2 mg/kg）可以阻断吗啡对空间记忆造成的破坏作用。相反，共同注射吗啡（1 mg/kg）和MK-801（0.05 mg/kg）可以加重吗啡对空间记忆造成的破坏作用。这说明谷氨酸系统可以干扰吗啡对记忆提取过程的影响。 二、衰老严重地影响了人们的视觉功能，然而眼睛光学系统的老年性改变并不能完全解释清楚这种视觉功能衰退。一般认为是神经系统的退化导致了这种老年性功能降低。但是，研究显示视网膜（retina）和外膝体（dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, dLGN）在衰老的过程中神经元的数量和体积以及神经元的功能特性，如对比度敏感性、空间分辨率等，都没有明显的变化，因此，人们推测老化导致的神经系统的变化发生在更高级的视觉皮层。过去几年的研究发现老年动物视觉皮层细胞发生了一系列反应特性的改变，如：老年动物皮层细胞的方向选择性和方位选择性降低以及细胞反应的潜伏期延长。这些细胞水平的变化被认为是老年性视觉功能衰退的神经机制。为了更全面地了解衰老过程对视觉皮层的影响以及细胞反应改变与整体功能降低之间的关系，本研究采用活体动物细胞外单位记录的方法，比较了青年和老年猕猴初级视觉皮层细胞时间反应特性和空间反应特性的差异。研究结果发现：老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的时间频率和空间频率敏感性明显比年轻动物降低。表现为老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的最优时间和空间频率、空间分辨率（spatial resolution, SR）和较高时间截至频率（high temporal frequency cut-off, TF50）都显著低于年轻动物初级视觉皮层细胞，同时伴随着这些功能的降低，老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的自发放增加，对视觉刺激的反应增加，但是信噪比却显著降低。这些结果表明，老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的功能在老化过程中都普遍降低。这可能是导致老年人视觉功能降低的原因。",

      "title": "Neuronal Mechanisms Mediating the Integration of Respiratory Responses to Hypoxia.",
      "abstract": "The activation of peripheral chemoreceptors by hypoxia or electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve elicited a hypoxic respiratory response consisting of both stimulatory and subsequent or simultaneous inhibitory components (hypoxic respiratory stimulation and depression). Both components have different time domains of responses (time-dependent response), providing an integrated respiratory response to hypoxia. This review has focused on the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological correlations responsible for these responses and their neuropharmacological mechanisms. Hypoxic respiratory depression is characterized by the initial activation of respiration followed by a progressive and gradual decline in ventilation during prolonged and/or severe hypoxic exposure (biphasic response). The responsible mechanisms for the depression are located within the central nervous system and may be dependent upon activity from peripheral chemoreceptor. Two underlying mechanisms contributing to the depression have been advocated. (1) Change in synaptic transmission: Within the neuronal network controlling the hypoxic respiratory response, hypoxia might induce the enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission (modulation), disfacilitation of excitatory neruotransmission or both. (2) Change in the membrane property of respiratory neurons: Hypoxia might suppress the membrane excitability of respiratory neurons composing the hypoxic respiratory response via modulating ion channels, leading to hyperpolarization or depolarization blocking of the neurons. However, the quantitative aspects of Pao2 (degree and duration of hypoxic exposure) to induce these changes and the susceptibility of both mechanisms to the Pao2 level have not yet been clearly elucidated.",

      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

The prevalence of akathisia in patients using classical antipsychotics is 20-30% and for users of clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (atypical antipsychotics) it is lower. Risk factors are a high dosage of antipsychotics, akathisia in a previous treatment, and diabetes mellitus. The treatment of akathisia starts, if possible, with the antipsychotic being withdrawn or the dose administered being lowered. Another treatment possibility is switching to clozapine, olanzapine or quetiapine, or adding a beta-blocking agent, an anticholinergic or mianserin.",

Other psychotic features, such as disorganized speech or hallucinations unrelated to the core delusion itself, are never present, and the delusional belief does not extend into other areas of life. Secondary DI, when one needs to address the underlying condition in order to achieve adequate treatment, is also possible. We present the case of a 42-year-old male with a 2-year history of having a persistent and firm belief that his house was infested with tiny insects that were constantly biting him and laying their eggs under his skin. His delusional belief was preceded by a complex, years-long substance use disorder, which confronted us with a differential diagnostic dilemma between primary and secondary DI. He was successfully treated with olanzapine pamoate depot, which was introduced to address his lack of insight and unsatisfactory compliance, and his delusion faded away after his symptoms subsided.",

Conclusion:Young persons who present with agitation and cardiovascular and/ or psychiatric manifestations of unclear origin and whose drug screening tests are negative may be suffering from an intoxication with a novel psychoactive substance.Physicians should know the classes of such substances and their effects.Targeted toxicological analysis can be carried out in a toxicology laboratory or a facility for forensic medicine.►Cite this as:",

Acontecem episódios repetidos de hipoxemia e hipercapnia, e com eles o sono torna-se superficial e fragmentado, resultando em distintas complicações ao indivíduo e à coletividade. O objetivo deste estudo foi revisar a literatura quanto às consequências individuais, econômicas e sociais causadas pela SAOS. Identificaram-se diversas complicações da SAOS relacionadas ao indivíduo: (1) alterações físicas e comportamentais: sono excessivo, fadiga, ansiedade, irritabilidade, depressão, redução da libido, diminuição da qualidade de vida, astenia, consequências metabólicas (ganho de peso, diabetes e dislipidemia) e cardiovasculares (hipertensão arterial sistêmica, aterosclerose e doença coronariana); (2) disfunção neurocognitiva: déficits de atenção, percepção, memória, raciocínio, juízo, pensamento e linguagem. Quanto à relação da SAOS e repercussões socioeconômicas, tem-se: (1) aumento do número, proporção e gravidade de acidentes automobilísticos devido à diminuição da concentração do motorista; (2) prejuízos ocupacionais com queda na produtividade, demissões e acidentes de trabalho; (3) prejuízo social: o individuo com SAOS representa também um perigo potencial para toda a sociedade por aumento de imperícias; (4) aumento de gastos públicos e privados: manutenção de rodovias e estrutura de fiscalização e apoio, gastos previdenciários, custos diagnósticos, terapêuticos e hospitalares. A SAOS deveria ser considerada uma doença de saúde pública, dados seus inequívocos prejuízos individuais, sociais e econômicos.

Nymphomania can be defined in terms of three distinct elements: marked increase in sexual drive; extremely frequent partner sexual behavior; promiscuity. The essence of the problem, however, is the disruptive increase in desire. Causes often involve one or more of the following: acting out; atypical psychoses; alcohol and/or drug abuse; temporal lobe disorders; involvement with an inappropriate partner; response to another sexual dysfunction. Many of these women are unable to derive emotional satisfaction from sex.",

In this chapter, the terms “dual diagnosis,” “substance use disorder[s],” “[name of substance] use,” and/or “[name of substance] dependence” are used. The more modern term “co-occurring disorder” is virtually synonymous with “dual diagnosis,” both of which reference the coexistence of a clinically significant use of drugs and/or alcohol with a primary psychiatric illness (an example of this would be bipolar disorder with cocaine dependence). Of course, a patient can have a substance use disorder (SUD) without having a dual diagnosis – i.e., without a separate, primary psychiatric illness [1]. The assumption is made that, unless mentioned specifically, clinical situations discussed here involve patients who do have a primary psychiatric illness in addition to a SUD. Also, although the fairly recent, though now outdated, DSM-IV criteria differentiated between substance abuse and substance dependence, this volume (again, unless specifically mentioned) does not make that distinction.",

Salvia is a highly selective full agonist of primate and cloned human cerebral kappa‐opioid receptors, although its psychotomimetic effects are similar to serotonergic agonists and NMDA glutamate antagonists. Salvia has been associated with depersonalization, laughter, feelings of levitation and self‐consciousness. These effects resolve within 30 minutes following use. Salvia has been banned in many countries, although it remains legal and easily assessable over the internet in the United States. Case description A 15‐year‐old man with a history of salvia and marijuana use presented to psychiatric emergency services with acute onset of mental status changes characterized by paranoia, déjà vu, blunted affect, thought blocking and slow speech of 3 days' duration. Conclusion There is limited literature discussing the clinical effects of salvia use. Based on this case presentation, salvia use may be associated with many undocumented long‐term effects such as déjà vu. The ease of use and increasing popularity of salvia requires further investigation into the clinical effects of salvia use.",

People with ADHD usually experience the following types of symptoms: (1) Attention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly. (2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

      "abstract": "Abstract: The negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent an impairment of normal emotional responses, thought processes and behaviors, and include blunting or flattening of affect, alogia/aprosody, avolition/apathy, anhedonia, and asociality. Negative symptoms contribute to a reduced quality of life, increased functional disability, increased burden of illness, and poorer long-term outcomes, to a greater degree than positive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are prominent and persistent in up to 26% of patients with schizophrenia, and they are estimated to occur in up to 58% of outpatients at any given time. Negative symptoms respond less well to medications than positive symptoms, and to date treatment options for negative symptoms have been limited, with no accepted standard treatment. Modest benefits have been reported with a variety of different agents, including second-generation antipsychotics and add-on therapy with antidepressants and other pharmacological classes. Recent clinical research focusing on negative symptoms target novel biological systems, such as glutamatergic neurotransmission. Different approaches include: enhancing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function with agents that bind directly to the glycine ligand site or with glycine reuptake inhibitors; influencing the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2/3) with positive allosteric modulators; and stimulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In conclusion, the lack of clearly efficacious pharmacological treatments for the management of negative symptoms represents a significant unmet need, especially considering the importance of these symptoms on patient outcomes. Hence, further research to identify and characterize novel pharmacological treatments for negative symptoms is greatly needed.

Risk factors associated with emergence delirium are age, preexisting behaviours, types of surgery and the use of volatile anaesthesia. Transient agitation - delirium from sevoflurane anesthesia can lead to a variety of adverse events, such as airway spasm, shedding or displaced tracheal tube, dehiscence, or bleeding. Volatile anaesthetics may affect brain activity by interfering with the balance between neuronal synaptic inhibition and excitation in the central nervous system. Elevated postoperative pain has been suggested to underlie ED. But given that ED is seen in patients undergoing MRI, pain cannot be the sole cause. Treatment options include the use of premedication, analgesic adjuvants, single dose of propofol at the conclusion of the case. Midazolam premedication, intraoperative dexmedetomidine and fentanyl were associated with lower incidence of ED. The incidence of ED in patients receiving propofol is markedly lower than those receiving sevoflurane, despite the similar rapid emergence profile of both agents. Paediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale, developed specifically for children, is a valid and reliable scale. Watcha score is a simpler, reliable tool to measure emergence behaviour. There has been considerable progress in the neuroscience of anaesthesia and the application of new pharmacological agents, but the mystery behind the exact mechanism of ED is elusive. ED is a diagnosis of exclusion once other causes have been dismiss. There is no strong evidence of long-term effects and outcomes in children who developed emergence delirium after anesthesia. Prevention may be the best treatment but no one medication is entirely effective.",

      "title": "A Case of Transient Global Amnesia due to Marijuana Use",
      "abstract": "Transient amnesia is a temporary version of the amnestic syndrome. The most striking example of transient amnesia is the transient global amnesia (TGA) syndrome which lasts from several to 24 hours, with or without retrograde components of impairment, and any signs of neurological deficit in nature. In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

      "abstract": "Long-haul flights allow rapid crossing of times zones. When four time zones are crossed, the transmeridian flight induce jet-lag syndrome. Jet-lag is essentially composed of digestive and behavioural disturbances (insomnia and/or drowsiness). It is due to an immediate conflict between external time cues, which have been phase-advanced or phase-delayed by eastward or westward flight, respectively, and the endogenous clock. This conflict induces a desynchronization of the biological rhythms. Different counter-measures could be advised, but the most used is the pharmacological one. Hypnotics like benzodiazepines, cyclopyrones or imidazopyridines induce a recovery sleep but could also induce secondary effects in case of chronic use. Melatonin secreted by pineal gland needs more studies before a safety use for jet-lag treatment. Psychostimulants are able to induce a prolonged wakefulness. But amphetamine-like substances have to be forbidden because of the importance of side effects. New researches are studying a new galenic form of caffeine: the time release caffeine, which permits to induce a long and good quality wakefulness.",

      "title": "Managing drug-induced psychosis",
      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use is a modifiable risk factor for the development and exacerbation of mental illness. The strongest evidence of risk is for the development of a psychotic disorder, associated with early and consistent use in youth and young adults. Cannabis-related mental health adverse events precipitating Emergency Department (ED) or Emergency Medical Services presentations can include anxiety, suicidal thoughts, psychotic or attenuated psychotic symptoms, and can account for 25–30% of cannabis-related ED visits. Up to 50% of patients with cannabis-related psychotic symptoms presenting to the ED requiring hospitalization will go on to develop schizophrenia. With the legalization of cannabis in various jurisdiction and the subsequent emerging focus of research in this area, our understanding of who (e.g., age groups and risk factors) are presenting with cannabis-related adverse mental health events in an emergency situation is starting to become clearer. However, for years we have heard in popular culture that cannabis use is less harmful or no more harmful than alcohol use; however, this does not appear to be the case for everyone. It is evident that these ED presentations should be considered another aspect of potentially harmful outcomes that need to be included in knowledge mobilization. In the absence of a clear understanding of the risk factors for mental health adverse events with cannabis use it can be instructive to examine what characteristics are seen with new presentations of mental illness both in emergency departments (ED) and early intervention services for mental illness. In this narrative review, we will discuss what is currently known about cannabis-related mental illness presentations to the ED, discussing risk variables and outcomes both prior to and after legalization, including our experiences following cannabis legalization in Canada. We will also discuss what is known about cannabis-related ED adverse events based on gender or biological sex. We also touch on the differences in magnitude between the impact of alcohol and cannabis on emergency mental health services to fairly present the differences in service demand with the understanding that these two recreational substances may impact different populations of individuals at risk for adverse events.",

The neuropsychiatric effects of anticholinergic agents and anabolic steroids (ASs) can manifest as symptoms like anxiety, agitation, dysarthria, confusion, seizures, visual hallucinations, bizarre behavior, delirium, psychosis, and coma. When dealing with a conscious patient who has ingested an anticholinergic substance, a detailed history of ingestion can aid clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis. However, the lack of information about the substances consumed can complicate diagnosis. In cases where the exposure is unknown, clinicians should consider anticholinergic poisoning in patients showing signs of altered mental status and physical examination findings consistent with anticholinergic toxicity. We report four cases presenting a range of symptoms, including neuropsychiatric manifestations, following the ingestion of the same bodybuilding powders with anticholinergic properties. All four patients consumed yellow and white powders at the same time and in the same place. Laboratory analysis revealed that yellow powder and white powder contained ASs and cyproheptadine, respectively.",

      "abstract": "The second most prevalent cause of years of disability worldwide is migraine, a neurological condition that causes a persistent headache that is lifelong. This condition affects more than a billion people globally. Its widespread prevalence and concomitant impairment have several adverse effects. Migraines are brought on by numerous behavioural, ecological, and genetic factors. There are various types of migraines, of which migraine without aura is the most common. The objective of this article is to determine the causes of migraine headaches, review the appropriate diagnosis of migraine, and describe the migraine headache management alternatives that are available. Various treatments for migraine are available on the market. Among the many types of headaches, migraines are neurological in nature and are inherited in some people. It has four phases: prodromal phase, aura, attack phase, and postdrome phase. Stress, anxiety, changes in the female endocrine system, bright lights, loud noises, foul odour, excessive or insufficient sleep, changes in the environment or the climate, flashes of light or intense lighting, overexertion, missing meals, drinking alcohol and smoking, quitting caffeine, and taking too many migraine drugs are some of the triggering factors for migraine. Diagnosis of migraine mainly relies on a good history. Appropriate prevention can be done for specific indications. Treatment mainly revolves around medications like analgesics, triptans, ergot derivatives, and newly derived biologics. Lifestyle modifications are also essential as many daily life factors contribute to migraine. Migraine can be well-managed if sufficient attention and care are given along with proper medications and guidance. The patient should not ignore symptoms and report to the physician at the earliest so that correct management can be done.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

Dentre esses, estao a depressao maior, a distimia e os sintomas depressivos clinicamente significativos (SDCS).A sindrome depressiva e caracterizada pela presenca de humor predominantemente depressivo e/ou irritavel e anedonia (diminuicao da capacidade de sentir prazer ou alegria). Existe uma sensacao subjetiva de diminuicao de energia (cansaco, fadiga), desinteresse, lentificacao, pensamentos pessimistas e ideias de ruina. Em geral, esses sintomas sao acompanhados de modificacoes no sono e apetite, prejuizo cognitivo, alteracoes comportamentais e sintomas fisicos. Podem ocorrer delirios ou alucinacoes congruentes com o humor como delirios de culpabilidade excessiva ou de saude muito ruim, delirios de pobreza ou persecutorios; as alucinacoes sao menos comuns, mas podem aparecer e tendem a ser visuais ou olfatorias. Os profissionais da saude que lidam com este grupo etario devem ficar atentos aos sintomas depressivos mascarados, como dores inespecificas, adinamia, insonia, perda de peso e queixas subjetivas de perda da memoria, evitando imputar estas queixas ao envelhecimento pois os tratamentos disponiveis melhoram muito os sintomas e a qualidade de vida dos individuos acometidos.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia, which is associated with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) hypoactivity, often responds robustly to benzodiazepines. It has been reported to be a consequence of abrupt discontinuation of clozapine, an antipsychotic used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine discontinuation, sometimes necessitated by medical concerns, can carry the risk of adverse outcomes, including catatonia. We present the case of a 66-year-old African-American male with schizoaffective disorder (depressive subtype) and a complex medical history. He discontinued clozapine abruptly due to medication unavailability, and, seven days later, presented with catatonic symptoms, initially unrecognized by emergency room clinicians. His symptoms included self-neglect, auditory hallucinations, isolation, psychomotor retardation, fixed gaze, and thought blocking. An attempt to reinstate clozapine led to orthostatic hypotension, prompting admission to an inpatient psychiatry unit. Attempt to initiate risperidone for psychosis worsened the catatonia, which then responded rapidly to intravenous lorazepam challenge. This facilitated the re-introduction of clozapine with slow re-titration.",

      "title": "Suicide versus Accidental Death by Autoerotic Asphyxiation in a Patient Receiving Intravenous Ketamine for Depression",
      "abstract": "Clinical trials have demonstrated that subanesthetic intravenous ketamine exerts antidepressant effects lasting a week or longer postinfusion, as well as antisuicidal effects starting approximately 4 hours postinfusion and lasting 72 hours or longer. These findings have generated considerable enthusiasm within psychiatry. However, reports of treatment-emergent suicide attempts and completed suicides in some patients receiving ketamine or the ketamine enantiomer esketamine have begun to emerge. Here, we contribute to the small literature on suicide-related adverse events and ketamine with an unusual case of a patient who died either by suicide or accidental death via autoerotic asphyxiation approximately four days after a ketamine infusion. Case Presentation. The patient was a 28-year-old man with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypothyroidism, low testosterone, and sleep apnea referred for management of treatment resistant depression. His depression briefly remitted with ketamine, and suicidality briefly disappeared. However, these improvements were short-lived. Four days after his seventh and final scheduled ketamine infusion, the patient was found dead, presumably due to autoerotic asphyxiation. Interestingly, ketamine use has been reported in association with autoerotic asphyxiation. However, given our patient's recent severe suicidality, methods of his past suicide attempts, and family history of suicide, death from suicide seems more likely. Discussion. Here we consider the possibility of whether ketamine may have contributed to the patient's possible suicide, either via a direct worsening of his suicidality or psychological withdrawal following cessation of treatment, given recent concerns about psychological withdrawal's potential role insuicides following esketamine treatment.Though we are uncertain about the patient's cause of death, this case provides an opportunity to highlight important gaps in our understanding of the suicide-related risks of subanesthetic intravenous ketamine treatment for mood disorders and suicidality.",

This is a growing field of research, and the purpose of this brief review is to provide an update on the effects of creatine supplementation on brain health in healthy people.&#x0D; Description of the state of knowledge: Creatine, is an organic compound produced mainly by the liver and kidneys. From the liver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract, creatine enters through the bloodstream into skeletal muscle, where a total of about 95% of the body's total creatine is stored. It is stored in the muscles, heart and brain.&#x0D; Summary: There is potential for creatine supplementation to improve cognitive processing, especially in conditions characterized by creatine deficits in the brain, which can be triggered by acute stress factors (e.g., exercise, lack of sleep) or chronic, pathological conditions (e.g., creatine synthesis enzyme deficiencies, mild traumatic brain injury, aging, Alzheimer's disease). People with depression, the elderly, people with diseases associated with certain genetic defects (where creatine production and storage in the brain is impaired) are just some of the groups of people in whom creatine supplementation may be helpful. More research is needed to determine the clinical impact of long-term creatine supplementation dosing strategies on brain function and health.",

Treatment was well tolerated and the side effects, consisting mainly of nausea or symptoms related with the nervous system, such as anxiety, depression, confusion or drowsiness, were mild or moderate in most cases and rarely led to the patient's giving up the treatment. The drug has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, with little potential to interact with other pharmaceuticals. It seems to have a synergic effect with modafinil, boosting its effects in the treatment of excessive sleepiness. Although it is a substance that has been used as a recreational drug, no cases of addiction or drug abuse have been observed in narcoleptic patients treated in a controlled manner.Sodium oxybate can be considered to be a first-choice drug in the treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

The frontal lobes appear to be more vulnerable to alcoholrelated brain damage than other cerebral regions. The cerebellum, cortical-limbic circuits, skeletal muscle, and peripheral nerves are also important targets of chronic alcohol-related metabolic injury and degeneration [1-3]. Although all cell types within the nervous system are vulnerable to the toxic, metabolic and degenerative effects of alcohol, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and synaptic terminals are major targets, accounting for the white matter atrophy [4]. A heavy drinking history is a cardinal feature in the criteria for alcoholic dementia, which include memory impairment in addition to one or more other cognitive symptoms. Among the cognitive symptoms are dysphasia, apraxia, agnosia, and disturbance in executive functioning [3]. All these features were found in our patient and were persistent for at least 6 months of follow-up. a 43 year-old man was brought to the emergency room with head trauma following a fall. His medical history was significant for heavy alcoholism since age 35 and related falls and injuries. Neurological examination demonstrated significant memory impairment, dysphasia, apraxia, agnosia and disturbance in executive functioning, leading to the diagnosis of alcoholic dementia. Computed tomography (CT) scan of his head repeated during 6 years demonstrated progressive central and peripheral brain atrophy with sulcal widening, ventricular enlargement, and cortical white matter shrinkage characteristic of chronic alcohol abuse [Figure 1]. Long-standing heavy alcohol abuse leads to disproportionate loss of white matter with reduction in brain volume and brain weight. Alcohol abuse is a very serious health, social and economic problem worldwide. The present case conveys a clear message regarding the brain damage that results from chronic alcohol abuse.",

Individual factors are important and can profoundly influence both the type and extent of drug effects. Relevant drugs can be divided into: 1. Those prescribed primarily to treat psychiatric disorders. These include sleeping tablets, tranquillizers, antidepressants and antipsychotics. 2. Those used to treat neurological disorders that have psychological side-effects. Examples are anticonvulsants and anti-parkinsonian drugs. 3. Those used to treat non-nervous disorders that may have psychological side-effects. 4. Illicit drugs used in the non-medical context by drug addicts. Drug-induced states that can influence testimony are mainly sedation, disinhibition, paradoxical reactions and alterations in memory. A list of pointers was given in this paper with respect to practical considerations in assessing the possible effects of drugs on testimony.",

      "title": "The Potential Role of Iatrogenic Comorbidity in the Interaction between Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy in Anxiety Disorders",
      "abstract": "The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in the setting of anxiety disorders is often viewed as a potential source of augmentation of clinical effects, with little attention paid to the potential occurrence of negative events. In most of the studies, however, if benefits ensued, they were modest and likely to fade. Further, 4 high-quality and well-designed individual studies suggest that the addition of a benzodiazepine or an antidepressant to cognitive behavioral treatment of anxiety disorders could be detrimental compared to placebo at follow-up. The aim of this review was to outline a novel hypothesis, which needs to be adequately tested but may shed some new light on this interaction. Any type of psychotropic drug treatment, particularly after long-term use, may increase the risk of experiencing additional psychopathological problems that do not necessarily subside with discontinuation of the drug or of modifying responsiveness to subsequent treatments. The changes are persistent and not limited to a short phase, such as in the case of withdrawal reactions, and cannot be subsumed under the generic rubrics of adverse events or side effects. The term ‘iatrogenic comorbidity' refers to unfavorable modifications in the course, characteristics, and responsiveness of an illness that may be related to treatments that were administered previously. The likelihood of iatrogenic comorbidity needs to be considered in clinical practice: The concurrent use of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may yield advantages in the short term, but its costs at some later point in time may largely outweigh such benefits.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a conspicuous problem in modern 24 h society. In this brief overview, medications used to treat insomnia such as hypnotics, sedatives, medications inducing sedation as a side effect, medications directed at the sleep-associated circadian neuroendocrine system, and agents utilized in treating insomnia-inducing sleep diagnoses such as restless leg syndrome are discussed. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia with the majority of evidence supporting treatment efficacy for cognitive-behavioral therapy and short acting GABA-receptor agonists. In patients with comorbid insomnia the use of hypnotics can improve outcomes and potentially reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the use of more toxic medications. Except in individuals whose insomnia is secondary to circadian disturbance, mood disorder/depression and/or restless leg syndrome , there is minimal evidence supporting the efficacy of other medications used to treat insomnia despite their widespread use. Sedatives and other medications used off-label for sedative side-effects are a contributing factor to drug induced hypersomnolence, a factor in more than 30% of motor accident deaths. Hypnotic medications with low toxicity, addictive potential, minimal next day sleepiness, and an otherwise benign side-effect profile can be utilized safely and effectively to treat and improve function and quality of life for patients suffering from insomnia. These are the agents that should be exclusively classified as hypnotics and utilized to induce sleep when medications are required to treat the complaint of insomnia. Other pharmacological agents producing sedation (sedatives and agents used off-label for sedative side-effects) should be used cautiously for the treatment of insomnia due to the increased risk of next day sleepiness as well as for known toxicities and adverse side effects.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Long-time consumption of narcotics leads to altered mental status of the addict. It is also connected to damages of different organic systems and it often leads to ap- pearance of multiple organ failure. Excessive narcotics con- sumption or abuse in a long time period can lead to various consequences, such as atraumatic rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and electrolytic disorders. Rhabdomyolysis is charac- terized by injury of skeletal muscle with subsequent release of intracellular contents, such as myoglobin, potassium and cre- atine phosphokinase. In heroin addicts, rhabdomyolysis is a consequence of the development of a compartment syndrome due to immobilization of patients in the state of unconscious- ness and prolonged compression of extremities, direct heroin toxicity or extremities ischemia caused by intraluminal occlu- sion of blood vessels after intraarterial injection of heroin. Se- vere hyperkalemia and the development of acute renal failure require urgent therapeutic measures, which imply the applica- tion of either conventional treatment or a form of dialysis.

Research shows that the incidence of postpartum depression is 1 to 2 of 1000 births and that 25% of mothers who have just given birth experience severe postpartum depression and that in mothers giving birth to their next child around 20%. Symptoms of postpartum depression include depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in the activity, impaired appetite, sleep disturbance, physical agitation or psychomotor slowdown, weakness, feeling useless, difficulty concentrating, even suicidal ideation. It is important to do an early diagnosis of postpartum depression to both prevent and make symptoms worse. Mothers with postpartum depression need to get broad and maximum management from various parties, including families, closest people, and health workers from multidisciplinary sciences. In its handling, non-pharmacological therapies can be given such as psychological therapy and changes in daily behavior and also pharmacological therapies that previously need to be consulted to doctors such as tricyclic antidepressant drugs (TCAs) to reduce symptoms of postpartum depression.",

As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

      "abstract": "Heroin is an illicit, highly addictive drug. It is either the most abused or the most rapidly acting member of opioids. Abusers describe a feeling of a surge of pleasurable sensation, named as \"rush\" or \"high\". Repeated administration of high doses of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence. Physical dependence refers to an altered physiological state produced by chronic administration of heroin which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a characteristic syndrome, the opioid withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may occur within a few hours after the last administration of heroin. Symptoms of the withdrawal include restlessness, insomnia, drug craving, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain, cold flashes with goose bumps, and leg movements. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of heroin and subside after about a week. At this time, weakness and depression are pronounced and nausea and vomiting are common. Nevertheless, some chronic addicts have shown persistent withdrawal signs for many months or even years. Heroin addiction is considered as a behavioural state of compulsive drug use and a high tendency to relapse after periods of abstinence. It is generally accepted that compulsive use and relapse are typically associated with the status of heroin craving or heroin hunger that are difficult to define but appear to be powerful motivational significance in the addiction process. The route of administering heroin varies largely and may indicate the degree of seriousness of the individual's addiction. Intravenous administration seems to be the predominant method of heroin use, but recently a shift in heroin use pattern has been found, i.e. from injection to sniffing and smoking. Frequent injections coupled with widespread sharing of syringes increase the risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B, C and other blood-borne infectious diseases. Long-term use of heroin has also severe medical consequences such as scarred veins, bacterial infections of blood vessels, liver and kidney diseases, and lung complications.",

Each of the four subtypes, A, B, C, and D, is caused by the deficiency of a different enzyme in the degradative pathway of heparan sulphate: heparan-N-sulphatase (EC 3.10.1.1), α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC3.2.1.50), acetyl-CoA N-acetyl transferase (EC 2.3.1.3), and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulphatase (EC 3.1.6.14), respectively.1 Clinical symptoms usually occur after two years of apparently normal development and include hyperactivity, aggressive behaviour, delayed development (particularly in speech), sleep disturbances, coarse hair, hirsutism, and diarrhoea. There are only relatively mild somatic manifestations. There then follows a period of progressive mental retardation with death usually between the second and third decade of life. In a small number of patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, there is a more slowly progressive form of the disease with later onset known as the attenuated phenotype.2-4 A late onset phenotype has also been described for Sanfilippo syndrome type A.5 \n\nSanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme heparan-N-sulphatase (sulphamidase).

      "abstract": "A four year old boy presented three epileptic seizures of psychomotor type; immediately after he began to show a progressive and rapid dissolution of speech, until he became completely aphasic after few weeks. Since then, repeated EEG examinations have always shown anomalies of epileptic type, located on the left hemisphere, at times on the right, at times bilaterally asynchronous. The neurological, psychic, audiological, chemical-biological and neuro-radiological (bi-lateral carotidogram and penumoencephalogram) exams did not show any other anomalies. After an observation period three years, the AA. underline the following evolutive aspects of the case: 1) The aphasic syndrome is on the way to slow improvement both in its expressive component and in its perceptive component. The recovery of speech seems to follow, with a slower rhythm, the stages of acquisition of the speech in the normal subject. 2) Diversely from other cases of the literature, no positive correlation exists between the gravity of the aphasic syndrome and that of the EEG anomaly: they have worsened while the disturbance of the speech have partially regressed.",

Zu den Methoden der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie gehört die Aufklärung über Schlaf und Schlafhygiene (Psychoedukation), Entspannungstechniken wie etwa die progressive Muskelentspannung, spezifische verhaltenstherapeutische Techniken wie etwa die Stimuluskontrolle oder die Schlafrestriktion sowie kognitive Techniken zur Reduktion nächtlicher Grübeleien. Aufgrund von mehreren, in den letzten Jahren veröffentlichten Meta-Analysen können diese Techniken insbesondere in ihrer Applikation als Kombinationstherapie, als evidenz-basiert und der pharmakologischen Therapie als kurzzeitig gleichwertig und langfristig überlegen angesehen werden.

      "title": "Altered Level of Consciousness after Combined Spinal-Epidural Labor Analgesia with Intrathecal Fentanyl and Bupivacaine",
      "abstract": "Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology, Department of Anesthesiology, Northwestern University Medical School.Received from the Department of Anesthesiology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois.COMBINED spinal-epidural labor analgesia has become increasingly popular because of the rapid onset of profound analgesia accompanied by minimal motor blockade. 1The technique usually includes an intrathecal injection of opioid, often fentanyl or sufentanil, either alone or in combination with a local anesthetic. Reported side effects include pruritus, hypotension, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, fetal bradycardia, and respiratory depression or, more rarely, respiratory arrest. 2Several authors have reported the occurrence of high sensory blockade 3,4associated with facial tingling, dysphagia, and dyspnea. Fragneto and Fisher 5recently reported a case of “mental status change and aphasia” after the intrathecal injection of 10 μg sufentanil and 2.5 mg isobaric bupivacaine. The author reports a case of mental status changes associated with automatisms and an inability to speak after intrathecal injection of 25 μg fentanyl in combination with 2.5 mg bupivacaine.A 27-yr-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, with full-term, singleton vertex gestation was admitted to the labor and delivery unit with painful uterine contractions. The patient's medical history and antenatal course were unremarkable. She had not received neuraxial analgesia with her previous deliveries. She denied use of alcohol or any illicit drugs. The obstetrician's examination revealed 4-cm cervical dilation, 80% effacement, +1 station and ruptured membranes. The patient requested epidural labor analgesia. She had not received any medications.The patient was placed in the sitting position, and combined spinal-epidural analgesia was initiated at the L3–L4 interspace via a needle through needle technique, using a 17-gauge epidural needle and a 27-gauge Whitacre spinal needle (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The intrathecal injection consisted of 25 μg fentanyl (fentanyl; Elkins-Sinn, Inc., Cherry Hill, NJ, USA; 50 μg/ml, 0.5-ml) in combination with 2.5 mg bupivacaine (Sensorcaine-MPF; Astra USA, Inc., Westborough, MA, USA; 0.5%, 0.5-ml). A single open end-hole epidural catheter was threaded approximately 4-cm into the epidural space and an epidural test dose (1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 [3-ml]) was administered. The test dose was considered negative on the basis of no change in heart rate, or development of dense spinal blockade. A continuous epidural infusion was initiated with a solution containing 0.06% bupivacaine and fentanyl, 2 μg/ml, at 15 ml/h. The patient's vital signs were monitored for approximately 15 min, during which time her blood pressure ranged from 145/85 to 105/55 mmHg. Minimal motor weakness of the lower extremities was present.Approximately 25 min after the patient received the intrathecal medications, the anesthesiologist was called. Upon arrival in the labor room, the anesthesiologist noted that the patient was not responsive to verbal stimuli, and was generally combative, swinging her arms wildly. Respiratory rate was 6 breaths/min and pulse oximetry revealed a hemoglobin oxygen saturation of 94% while breathing room air. Heart rate was 100 beats/min, blood pressure was 105/55 mmHg and the patient was moving her upper and lower extremities well. She was given oxygen, positive pressure ventilatory assistance via bag and mask, and 160 μg intravenous naloxone (naloxone HCl; Abbott Laboratories, N. Chicago, IL; 0.4 mg/ml) in divided doses. The epidural infusion was discontinued.Within 1–2 min, the patient's respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 100%. She was no longer combative, but she was not fully alert: She looked absently around the room, and did not speak, or attempt to mouth words, when questioned. She exhibited behaviors best described as automatisms, such as looking intently at her intravenous tubing and picking it up. Several minutes later, she communicated by nodding her head in response to yes/no questions, or squeezing the examiner's hand, but still did not speak. She had a sensory level to cold in the distribution of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. Over the next 15 min, the patient gradually recovered the ability to speak, although she was still not quite fully alert. It was noted that the patient scratched occasionally.Forty minutes after treatment with naloxone (65 min after the intrathecal medications had been given), while the anesthesiologist was still in the room, the patient suddenly began scratching her face and upper body quite severely and over the next minute she once again became less responsive and more combative. She was given an additional 80 μg intravenous naloxone and she once again became more alert, though not fully so. Again, she looked around the room, displayed automatisms, and did not speak. After several minutes she communicated through nonverbal methods and then gradually regained the ability to speak.Approximately 30 min after the second dose of naloxone (95 min after the intrathecal medications had been given), the patient was speaking fluently and complaining of labor pain. Obstetrical examination revealed complete cervical dilation and effacement and +2 station. She was delivered of a liveborn female infant shortly thereafter. One and 5 min APGAR (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration) scores were 9 and 9.One hour after delivery, the patient was awake, fully alert, and oriented to person, place, and time and was released from the labor and delivery unit by the anesthesiologist. She had incomplete recall of the events, including a vague recollection of being unable to speak.As combined spinal-epidural labor analgesia is used more commonly, several uncommon adverse reactions have been reported, including excessive sedation and severe respiratory depression. 2Sensory blockade that extends to the high thoracic dermatomes, or even the trigeminal dermatomes can occur because the opioid or local anesthetic intrathecal solutions commonly injected are hypobaric, and analgesia is often initiated with the patient in the sitting position. 3,4An English language literature search revealed no other reports of this type of reaction occurring after intrathecal fentanyl and bupivacaine.The time of onset of the event makes it likely that it was a reaction to the intrathecal medications. The sedation, respiratory depression, and pruritus are consistent with cephalad spread of fentanyl, and naloxone quickly reversed these symptoms. The patient required a second dose of naloxone for these symptoms after 40 min, which is consistent with its duration of action. The patient's other behaviors (decreased levels of alertness and attentiveness and automatisms accompanied by muteness) did not respond to treatment with naloxone. Perhaps a higher dose of naloxone would have reversed these symptoms also. It is possible that cephalad spread of bupivacaine played an undetermined role in this patient's presentation.Although the patient's test dose was negative, it is still possible that the epidural catheter was placed intravascularly. If this were the case the patient would have received approximately 12.5 μg fentanyl and 3.75 mg bupivacaine over approximately 25 min. While this dose is too small to entirely explain these symptoms, intravenous fentanyl-bupivacaine could have worsened the clinical situation. Opioid induced hypoventilation could also have worsened the patient's clinical course.The combination of decreased alertness and attentiveness, automatisms, and inability to speak are reminiscent of temporal lobe seizure activity, and it is possible that this patient's behaviors represented some sort of seizure, the mechanism of which is unclear. Unfortunately, there was no electroencephalogram documentation during or after the event.Fragneto and Fisher 5reported a case of combined spinal-epidural labor analgesia with 10 μg intrathecal sufentanil and 2.5 mg bupivacaine followed by mild respiratory acidosis and mental status changes including “aphasia” and “an apparent disassociated state,” symptoms very similar to those of our patient. They hypothesized that the reaction was caused by cephalad spread of either the opioid or the bupivacaine. They did not attempt to treat the patient with naloxone. A similar mechanism of action may have been present in both the case reported by Fragneto and Fisher and the case presented here.Although high sensory blockade is not uncommon after intrathecal fentanyl and bupivacaine are administered for labor analgesia, it is unlikely that sensory blockade of the larynx (recurrent and superior laryngeal branches of the tenth cranial nerve) could account for difficulty with speech. In cases where such sensory deficits are known to exist (for instance, during sensory blockade in preparation for conscious intubation), patients are able to speak. Thus, normal sensation is not necessary for speech production.It is not likely that the lidocaine and epinephrine epidural test dose was injected into the intrathecal or subdural space because the patient did not exhibit appreciable motor weakness and/or hypotension. In addition, it is unlikely that the patient had isolated motor weakness of the laryngeal nerves. She did not appear to mouth words, as if attempting to speak.In summary, the author presents a case of an altered level of consciousness and inability to speak after intrathecal fentanyl and bupivacaine administered for labor analgesia. Clinicians should be aware of this possible complication when this analgesic technique is used.The author thanks M-Marsel Mesulam, M.D., (Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois) for his help with preparing this manuscript.",

      "abstract": "Abstract 1,1-Difluoroethane (DFE) is a halogenated hydrocarbon that is commonly used as a propellant in air duster products. Herein, the pharmacology of DFE was reviewed, and questions relevant to medicolegal investigations were addressed. Particular emphasis was given to detection time in biological specimens and the range, onset and duration of effects. DFE may be abused as an inhalant and is rapidly absorbed through the lungs. Onset of central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects is within seconds and the duration may only last minutes. The effects may lead to impairment of human performance, including confusion, lethargy, impaired judgment, loss of motor coordination and loss of consciousness. Death may result even after the first use. With heavy use or in combination with other CNS depressants, extended periods of drowsiness or loss of consciousness may be observed with an increased risk of a fatal event. A majority of impaired driving investigations where DFE was identified included a collision demonstrating the significant impact its use may have on traffic safety. When DFE is identified alone, without other drugs that cause CNS impairment, the effects may not be observable minutes after the crash, making identification of its use difficult. Although concentrations dissipate rapidly, DFE has been detected in blood specimens collected up to 3 hours after the driving incident. Two studies on passive exposure presented herein demonstrated that it is unlikely to detect DFE above concentrations of ∼2.6 µg/mL in blood or urine due to even extreme unintentional exposure. Alternative specimens such as brain, lung and tracheal air should be considered in some postmortem investigations. DFE has been identified in blood specimens from postmortem cases at concentrations from 0.14 to 460 µg/mL and in impaired driving cases from 0.16 to 140 µg/mL.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment in substance use disorders",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairments in substance use disorders have been extensively researched, especially since the advent of cognitive and computational neuroscience and neuroimaging methods in the last 20 years. Conceptually, altered cognitive function can be viewed as a hallmark feature of substance use disorders, with documented alterations in the well-known “executive” domains of attention, inhibition/regulation, working memory, and decision-making. Poor cognitive (sometimes referred to as “top-down”) regulation of downstream motivational processes—whether appetitive (reward, incentive salience) or aversive (stress, negative affect)—is recognized as a fundamental impairment in addiction and a potentially important target for intervention. As addressed in this special issue, cognitive impairment is a transdiagnostic domain; thus, advances in the characterization and treatment of cognitive dysfunction in substance use disorders could have benefit across multiple psychiatric disorders. Toward this general goal, we summarize current findings in the abovementioned cognitive domains of substance use disorders, while suggesting a potentially useful expansion to include processes that both precede (precognition) and supersede (social cognition) what is usually thought of as strictly cognition. These additional two areas have received relatively less attention but phenomenologically and otherwise are important features of substance use disorders. The review concludes with suggestions for research and potential therapeutic targeting of both the familiar and this more comprehensive version of cognitive domains related to substance use disorders.",

      "title": "T195. PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS IN PATIENTS WHO USE SYNTHETIC CANNABINOIDS: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND PATIENT PROFILE",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the two principal ingredients of natural cannabis with counteracting functions. Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are much more potent than natural cannabis, since they act as a more potent full agonist at the cannabinoid subtype 1 receptor than THC, and they also lack cannabinoids such as CBD that may otherwise counteract psychoactive properties of THC. Therefore, SCs may induce a more severe clinical presentation than natural cannabis does: the use of SCs may be associated with agitation, anxiety, tachycardia, hallucinations, irritability, memory and cognitive impairment, violent behavior, unresponsiveness, and psychosis. Clinical characteristics, specificity of the disease course and patient profile of the SC-induced psychoses are still poorly characterized in the scientific literature. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the psychotic disorders in patients with synthetic cannabinoid use disorder in terms of patient profile and clinical characteristics with reference to their follow-up. Methods A total of 60 male patients (n=60; mean (standard deviation [SD]) age: 23.6 (3.5) years) diagnosed with psychotic disorder induced by the SC use who were hospitalized at the intensive care unit or emergency department of the Moscow Research and Practical Centre on Addictions of the Moscow Department of Healthcare were included in this single-centre, longitudinal, observational cohort study. The catamnestic follow-up period was up to 2 years. Results We evaluated different clinical cases of SC-induced psychoses and identified four clinical types of them on the ground of leading psychopathological syndrome during the patient’s entire length of hospitalization: Then we performed a catamnestic follow-up of patients to reveal the possible schizophrenic process manifestation in patients who use SC. Catamnestic follow-up revealed that manifestation of the schizophrenic process was present in 8 patients (13% of cases). Discussion Our results revealed that SC-induced psychoses affect young adults primarily. Consistent with the statement that the majority of first-time SC users are experienced marijuana smokers, SC was used following other transitional substances rather than as the first substance in the majority of our patients, with cannabis being the most popular antecedent substance. SC was not the first substance used in the majority of our patients, and it had been preceded by use of other transitional substances, such as cannabis in most cases. Despite the exogenous nature, structurally such psychoses are often endoformic. For instance, even the delirium is atypical and includes the elements of Kandinsky-Clerambault’s syndrome. Psychopathologically hallucinations and delusions dominate in the clinical presentation of the psychoses (with predominant hallucinatory symptoms or affective paranoid symptoms). Development of substance-induced psychoses is often associated with the manifestation of the schizophrenic process (in our study it was revealed in 13% of cases). It is extremely difficult to create a differential diagnosis between such psychotic disorders and a primary endogenous psychotic episode. In such cases the appearance of deficit symptoms specific for schizophrenia becomes crucial.",

      "abstract": "Excessive somnolence can be a consequence of lifestyle, environmental and circadian influences, medical disorders, drugs or substances. Disorders of excessive somnolence include insufficient sleep, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, recurrent hypersomnia and hypersomnia associated with neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders and internal disorders. This chapter focuses on hypersomnias of central origin and arising from insufficient sleep. It describes epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for each of the excessive somnolence disorder. Hypersomnia may be caused by an underlying medical or neurological disease. Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes. Hypersomnia may occur as a side effect of many drugs, due either to the soporific effects of the drug or to the effect of the drug on reducing night-time sleep.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Synesthesia is a perceptual experience in which a stimulus presented through one modality (e.g., hearing) will spontaneously evoke a sensation experienced in an unrelated modality (e.g., vision). For example, an individual may experience a specific color for every given note (e.g., C sharp is red) or every number may be tinged with a specific hue (e.g., five is indigo and seven is green). Although synesthesia can occur in response to drugs (LSD, mescaline, peyote), sensory deprivation, or, in rare cases, brain damage, research has largely focused on individuals with the heritable trait of developmental synesthesia. Synesthesia has no known association with any disorder or condition, and research suggests a higher occurrence among artists and musicians. Furthermore, synesthetes will often lament the loss of these experiences that sometimes occurs because of depression or the use of antidepressants.",

      "abstract": "The word “apnea” means literally \"without breath\", and thus “sleep apnea” means not breathing while sleeping. Normally, during sleep we do not have pauses in-between breaths. Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

      "title": "The LSD syndrome. A review.",
      "abstract": "lsd (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a powerful bio-active substance related to serotonin in structure. Its actions generally affect autonomic, sensory and psychological functions. Autonomic stimulation is varied. Sensory responses are usually visual, involving heightened and distorted color perception and fusion of sensory impressions. Psychological responses include a feeling that a unique experience is occurring; feelings of depersonalization; pronounced fluctuation of mood; time and space distortions; autistic phenomena; fluctuation of aggressive drives (usually reduction); and spontaneous reoccurrence of the lsd experience. THE SUBJECTIVE RESPONSES CAN BE RELATED TO THREE BASIC PHENOMENA: (1) expectation; (2) loss of characteristic modes of perceptual and cognitive patterning; and (3) hypersuggestibility. THE MAJOR ADVERSE REACTIONS ARE: (1) chronic drug dependence including subsequent personality changes and depressive reactions; and (2) acute ego dissolution. These reactions usually occur in already emotionally ill people. Most of these users fall into two groups, those with unresolved identity problems and those with severe ego abnormality. The majority of adverse reactions are of the chronic drug dependence type and are usually seen in adolescents and young adults who have not negotiated the age-appropriate tasks of forming and integrating the various identities that are the composite of their life experiences.lsd helps alleviate these stresses via some of its psychological properties as discussed. It also provides a nidus for the formation of a subculture where goals for social, sexual and vocational achievement are lower and idiosyncratic modes of adaptation are better tolerated. A smaller group of users who have serious reactions such as psychosis, rage reactions, homicidal and suicidal ideation are usually found to have preexisting ego abnormality such as ambulatory schizophrenia, chronic impulse disorders and borderline states. Although adverse reactions most often appear to be related to pre-morbid psychopathology, this is not invariably so. Further, there is as yet no reliable method to determine who will have an adverse reaction and what the nature of that reaction will be.",

Certain rare complications of alcoholism, such as degeneration of the cerebellum and the corpus callosum, are not included in this classification, since their relation to the toxic effects of alcohol or to nutritional deficiency has not yet been clarified. Acute intoxication from alcohol results in the familiar symptoms of drunkenness or, if severe in degree, in stupor and coma.

      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

      "abstract": "Dans le débat sur la décriminalisation du cannabis, ce sont les conséquences de la consommation de cette substance psychoactive qui interpellent les experts. Rarement s’interroge-t-on, toutefois, sur la nature de l’intoxication au cannabis. Or, un survol attentif de la littérature laisse entrevoir de multiples rapports entre les effets du cannabis et la phénoménologie de la schizophrénie. Communément classé parmi les perturbateurs du système nerveux central, le cannabis possède des propriétés psychotomimétiques. Selon les circonstances, il peut produire des manifestations qui rappellent diverses dimensions de la schizophrénie. Alors que ses effets aigus évoquent les atteintes cognitives des schizophrènes, ses effets chroniques (le controversé syndrome d’amotivation) peuvent ressembler aux symptômes négatifs, et certains de ses effets adverses (la « psychose cannabique ») imitent les symptômes positifs de cette psychopathologie. Incidemment, les schizophrènes seraient particulièrement sensibles au cannabis. En effet, la probabilité de développer un trouble de consommation de cannabis est environ six fois plus élevée chez le schizophrène que dans la population générale. Divers modèles tentent de rendre compte de cette comorbidité singulière, le principal étant celui de l’automédication. À l’encontre de ce modèle toutefois, la littérature rapporte que la consommation de cannabis accroît régulièrement l’incidence des rechutes psychotiques et des hospitalisations chez les schizophrènes. Sur le plan biologique, des données préliminaires suggèrent l’existence de perturbations du système des cannabinoïdes endogènes chez le schizophrène. Dans cette foulée, la communauté scientifique espérait que le blocage du récepteur CB 1 , le principal récepteur des cannabinoïdes, agisse comme antipsychotique. Après l’échec clinique du rimonabant, un antagoniste CB 1 , la recherche se tourne maintenant vers les inhibiteurs de la recapture de l’anandamide, le cannabinoïde endogène le mieux connu.",

Characteristic symptoms, in addition to upper abdominal pain or discomfort, are nausea, vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, postprandial abdominal bloating and excessive repetitive postprandial belching. Patients with concomitant symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are currently excluded from this clinical entity. Delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids, postprandial antral hypomotility and antroduodenal incoordination, gastric myoelectrical arrhythmias and dysfunction of visceral afferents are the major alterations in upper gut sensorimotor activity which have been described. An empirical trial of medical therapy is warranted if there are no “alarm” symptoms at presentation. If symptoms are not relieved after 2-4 weeks, then investigations of the upper gastrointestinal tract, preferably by endoscopy, to exclude the presence of organic disease, is advisable. Management approaches are then reassurance, dietary manipulations and attention to psychosocial aspects. Prokinetic agents appear to be useful as short-term medical therapy in some patients, but optimum long-term treatment strategies, including the use of medications which may improve a diminished tolerance to gut distension, are not established.",

Anxiety is the complex blend of unpleasant emotions and cognitions that is both more oriented to the future and much more diffuse than fear (2).Anxiety has not only cognitive components but also physiological and behavioural components. At the cognitive level anxiety involves negative mood worry about the possible future, threat or danger, self-preoccupation and future threat and to control it if it occurs. At the physiological level anxiety often creates a state of tension and chronic over arousal which may affect readiness for delaying with danger. At behavioural level anxiety may create a strong tendency to avoid situations where danger might encounter but there is not the immediate urge to flee with anxiety as there is with fear (3). An increased risk of muscular skeletal disorder was found in workers with pre-existing anxiety and depression compared to the without them (4).",

Changes in energy levels, sleep patterns, ability to focus, and other features can dramatically impact a person’s behavior, work, relationships, and other aspects of life. Most people experience mood changes at some time, but those related to bipolar disorder are more intense than regular mood changes, and other symptoms can occur. Some people experience psychosis, which can include delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. Objectives Through this research we aimed to identify all the special features of bipolar depression which will help the clinical psychiatrists in easier diagnosis and management of the disorder. Methods Literature review (PubMed) Results Clinical Characteristics in Favour of Bipolarity in Depression: psychomotor retardation, history of psychotic depression,history of psychotic depression shortly after giving childbirth, frequent catatonic symptoms, atypical depressive features, severe impairment in interpersonal relationships, inconsistency in business life, history of hypomania, mania or mixed episode,common feeling of numbness and anhedonia; less common sadness and feelings of guilt, mood instability, volatility in temperament, frequent change in affect, daydreaming during the episode and daily life, short duration of depression &lt;3 months, poor cognitive functions during depressive episode, generally similar symptom severity during the day and night etc. Conclusions This leads to misdiagnosis of bipolar depression as unipolar depression, which in turn leads to delayed correct diagnosis and treatment and may severely affect the patient’s entire life.

Seizure‐related disrobing may occur either as an ictal automatism or during the postictal period. Some patients may experience a seizure while already in the unclothed state, engage in ictal wandering, and thereby appear in public in the nude. Two cases involving disrobing associated with seizures captured via video‐monitored electroencephalography are offered. An additional case reveals the legal consequences endured by one patient who experienced a nocturnal seizure and began wandering in an unclothed state. Collectively, these cases illustrate the medical reality of seizure‐related disrobing and the related adverse effects on patients’ quality of life. Disrobing associated with epileptic seizures carries the potential for serious legal consequences if not properly identified as an ictal phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Swallow syncope is a rare dysautonomic syndrome characterized by temporary loss of consciousness upon swallowing solid foods or liquids, displaying primarily in individuals with an underlying structural or functional esophageal or cardiac pathology. However, the evidence also suggests that isolated vagal dysfunction or abnormal reactions of esophageal mechanoreceptors after mechanical irritation, demyelination, or trauma can potentially evoke a cardioinhibitory response or vasodepression upon swallowing. We present a case of a 49-year-old otherwise healthy female patient who developed swallow syncope two weeks after whiplash neck injury acquired in a rear-end collision. After no evident anatomical and/or functional cardiac or esophageal pathology was diagnosed using several diagnostic procedures, the final diagnosis was confirmed by a provocative tilt-table test while ingesting solid food. Subsequently, a dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted, relieving the patient from troublesome symptoms. Abnormal reactions of esophageal mechanoreceptors to stimuli associated with food ingestion and/or dysfunction of afferent and efferent vagal fibers due to stretch injury and related neck trauma (acquired during the car accident) may be the leading pathophysiological mechanisms of swallow syncope in our patient.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic and disabling mental disorder characterized by periods of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. It affects individuals in their personal, school, and professional lives. While the exact cause of the disorder remains unknown, it often runs in families, and factors like premature birth, low birth weight, alcohol, smoking, and drug abuse during pregnancy may contribute to it. ADHD is typically classified into three main types: hyperactive/impulsive type, which involves excessive movement, restlessness, and impulsive actions; inattentive type, which includes difficulty staying focused on tasks, organizing work, losing things, and being easily distracted; and combined type, which is diagnosed when both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptoms are present.",

      "title": "Debate: When does a seizure imply epilepsy?",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy recently has been defined conceptually as a condition of at least one seizure, with an enduring predisposition to have seizures. It is not yet clear how to make this definition operational and practical. A diagnosis of epilepsy has potentially serious consequences for health, psychosocial well-being, and economics, and, therefore, it should be made with a high level of certainty. A definite diagnosis of epilepsy can be made with two unprovoked seizures at least 24 h apart. This method has the benefit of simplicity and consistency with past epidemiologic studies. Nevertheless, certain circumstances suggest a high likelihood of having a second seizure, as evidenced by common clinical practice of considering treatment after a first unprovoked seizure in conjunction with additional risk factors (surrogate markers). One unifying approach is an operational definition of \"definite epilepsy\" after two unprovoked seizures at least 24 h apart. An operational definition of \"probable epilepsy\" can be established with one unprovoked seizure and clinical, electroencephalography (EEG), neuroimaging, genetic, or other information to suggest greater than a 50% chance of having another seizure. \"Possible epilepsy\" operationally would exist with a single unprovoked seizure and insufficient evidence to predict a high likelihood of recurrence. Future clinical and epidemiologic evidence would allow refinements of the operational definitions.",

      "abstract": "Byline: Himanshu. Sharma Sir, The term tardive dyskinesia has been used to refer to a group of delayed-onset abnormal involuntary movement disorders that present with rapid, repetitive, stereotypic choreoathetoid movements mostly involving the oral, buccal, and lingual areas or the trunk (oro-bucco-lingual variety ).[sup] [1] The word Tardiv e means late appearing movements which start after 3months of neuroleptic exposure.[sup] [2] The annual rate is estimated at 5% for the early years, the cumulative rates over 5 years being between 20-26%.[sup] [3] Most patients with TD have schizophrenia but it can develop in-patients with depression or anxiety. Risk factors for TD are age over 40 years, affective disorder, Negroes, prolonged use and use of high potency neuroleptics in high doses, early occurrence of drug-induced Parkinson's disease, and female gender and smoking, chronic use of anticholinergic drugs and diabetes mellitus.[sup] [1],[3],[4] Of the various pathogenic mechanisms proposed, dopamine receptor hypersensitivity, damage to GABA containing -neurons and free radical formation from catecholamine metabolism are the most widely accepted.[sup] [5] Following are some of the proposed guidelines for its treatment: 1) minimal dose of the causative antipsychotic or switching over to clozapine, after tapering off the offending antipsychotic drug slowly.[sup] [1] 2) Dopamine-depleting drugs -Reserpine (1 to 8 mg/day), Tetrabenazine (25 to 150 mg/day).[sup] [4],[6] 3) GABA-enhancing drugs Clonazepam (1 to 4 mg/day), Valproate, Vigabatrin, Baclofen, 4) Antioxidants: Vitamin E 800 IU/bid.[sup] [1],[7] A 34-year-old male was referred to the Psychiatry OPD of our hospital with complaints of involuntary movement of orofacial region along with difficulty in breathing and swallowing, pain in nuchal region and backache. A detailed examination revealed that the patient had complex repetitive movements of orofacial region including forehead and eyebrows raising, eye closure, puckering of lips, to and fro movements of head and neck, protrusion of and twisting and darting out movement tongue in between the parted lips and repeated clenching of teeth. The patient reported that 3 years ago he had faced some financial loss as result of which he suffered from a bout of depression for which he consulted a private psychiatrist who prescribed him Trifluoperazine 10 mg along with T.Citalopram 20mg and T. Trihexyphenidyl 2mg and T. Propranolol 10-mg tid. After 2 years the patient developed TD. Patient was nonalcoholic but chronic smoker and tobacco chewer since 15 years. His baseline assessment of abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS)[sup] [8] revealed a score of 21 qualifying for diagnosis of Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) . All psychotropic drugs were tapered off and a course of Tetrabenazine 25mg 1/2 hs bid was started which was increased to 25mg bid and then tid after 2 weeks. In addition to this Clonazepam 0.5 mg I hs and Cap Vit E 400 mg 1 OD were added. The patient reported a dramatic improvement within first 2 weeks of starting the treatment (AIMS score-13) and finally achieving a score of AIMS - 10 at the end of four weeks. …",

      "title": "Secondary headache attributed to exposure to or overuse of a substance",
      "abstract": "Background Secondary headaches attributed to exposure to or the overuse of a substance are classified under chapter eight in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition. Three distinct sub-chapters consider: 1. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance, 2. Medication overuse headache, and 3. Headache attributed to substance withdrawal. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance refers to a headache with onset immediately or within hours after the exposure, while medication overuse headache is a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month that has developed as a consequence of regular usage of acute headache medication(s) for more than three consecutive months in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache disorder. The withdrawal of caffeine, oestrogen, and opioids is most often associated with the development of headache. Discussion Despite the current headache classification, there is no certainty of a causal relationship between the use of any substance and the development of headache. Some substances are likely to provoke headache in patients that suffer from a primary headache disorder like migraine, tension-type headache or cluster headache, while others were described to cause headache even in people that generally do not get headaches. Toxic agents, such as carbon monoxide (CO) are difficult to investigate systematically, while other substances such as nitric oxide (NO) were specifically used to induce headache experimentally. If a patient with an underlying primary headache disorder develops a headache, in temporal relation to exposure to a substance, which is significantly worse than the usual headache it is considered secondary. This is even more the case if the headache phenotype is different from the usually experienced headache characteristics. Medication overuse headache is a well-described, distinct disease entity with only marginally understood pathophysiology and associated psychological factors. Managing medication overuse headache patients includes education, detoxification, prophylactic treatments and treating comorbidities, which is reflected in available guidelines. Viewing medication overuse headache as a separate entity helps clinicians and researchers better recognise, treat and study the disorder. Conclusion Identification of substances that may cause or trigger secondary headache is important in order to educate patients and health care professionals about potential effects of these substances and prevent unnecessary suffering, as well as deterioration in quality of life. Treatment in case of medication overuse and other chronic headache should be decisive and effective.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen.

Mokjong was so capricious that he got angry or brutally slaughtered the Valets (近侍). In addition, drinking too much and sleeping resulted in more days of not attending the meeting, and officials were appointed in a drunken state. As a result, the political situation became unstable due to the lack of administrative efficiency and the loss of national territory by passive response in foreign relations. He shows a psychopathic phenomenon called borderline personality disorder. A person with borderline personality disorder experiences a sense of confusion about himself, showing various protruding behaviors that are hard to predict because stable self-image has not been established. He was self-indulgent and self-indulgent, war, and sexual dysfunction, depending on alcohol, but he was more drunk and destroyed himself in a vicious cycle of shame and guilt caused by moral anxiety. Eventually, he is killed by people who serves close (近侍) who were subject to murder. As such, the impact of a human growth process on an individual is absolute. Abnormal behavior and mental disorder are the products of such painful and unhappy past experiences, as well as the causes that make life painful and unhappy. This could bring misfortune to society and the nation, not only to the parties but also to their families and people around them. In particular, it was inevitable that the absolute monarch of feudal society would fall in national power and endanger the country, as he was acting strangely due to psychological disorder, wrong decision-making, and disorderly conduct, so that his subjects could not control the monarch. #요 목종 #수왕 #근시 살해 #정신분석 #경계선성격장애 #遼 穆宗 #睡王 #近侍殺害 #情神分析 #境界線性格障礙 #Muzong emperor in Liao Dynasty #sleeping king #slaughter of Valets #psychoanalysis #borderline personality disorder Ⅰ. 머리말Ⅱ. 목종의 가계도 및 그 생애Ⅲ. 목종의 이상행동과 그 원인Ⅳ. 맺음말참고문헌Abstract",

      "title": "Alcohol and Opioid Peptides: Neuropharmacological Rationale for Physical Craving of Alcohol",
      "abstract": "Until recently alcoholism was regarded as an incurable psychological problem. During the last decade a chain of research has led to important hypotheses about the etiology of the physical craving of alcohol. Recent discoveries indicate that the brain has receptor sites for naturally occurring opiatelike substances (endorphins, enkephalins, and dynor-phins) which are produced by the nervous system. Opiates such as morphine or heroin and some of the metabolic products of alcohol (tetrahydroisoquinolines) can also attach themselves to these receptors. It has been further discovered that the physiological craving for alcohol may be the result of a deficiency of the naturally occurring opiatelike substances as well as other neurochemical deficits (i.e., dopaminergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic). These neurochemical deficits can occur genetically or as a result of long-term heavy drinking.SUMMARYScrutiny of available data reveals the following salient points: (1) Ethanol and opiates have a common biochemical mechanism of action; (2) the metabolic condensation by-products of ethanol, tetrahydroisoquinolines, link ethanol and opiate actions by virtue of interaction at multiple opioid receptor sites in the brain; (3) inbred mice showing a prediction toward alcohol preference exhibit significant differences of brain opiate peptides (endorphins and enkephalins) relative to mice showing an aversion to alcohol. Stress induces significant brain reductions of endogenous opioid peptides and induces copious alcohol consumption. Long-term ethanol ingestion remarkably reduces animal brain endorphins and enkephalins. Similarly, cerebrospinal fluid endorphin levels are reduced in human alcoholics, as are plasma enkephalin levels [40].Both acute and chronic treatment with D-phenylalanine and hydrocin-namic acid, known carboxypeptidase A (enkephalinase) inhibitors, significantly attenuate both forced and volitional ethanol intake, in mice with a genetic predisposition to prefer alcohol. These animals are known to have innate brain enkephalin deficiencies. Since these agents, through their enkephalinase inhibitory activity, raise brain enkephalin levels, we propose that excessive alcohol intake can be regulated by alteration of endogenous brain opioid peptadergic functionality and interaction with other neuroaminergic pathways.",

      "abstract": "Comorbidity between medical-surgical diseases and depression is well documented. Among the somatic disorders associated to the depressive disorder are arthritis, cancer, pulmonary diseases, neurological disorders and heart diseases. Other psychiatric disorders are often comorbid with depressive disorders: alcohol or drug abuse, anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as eating disorders in women. Depression increases by three the risk of cardiac mortality. If depression is not treated, it increases the risk of suicide or other violent actions. The treatment will reduce the risk of suicide to a half, especially in males under 30 years of age. Alcohol or drug abuse, unemployment, social isolation, and impulsivity increase the risk of suicide. Finally, we review the only drugs that have been proved effective in reducing suicidal behavior that are lithium for the risk of suicide in bipolar disorders, and clozapine in the risk of suicide of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

      "abstract": "being persecuted.However, a variety of other themes is also possible, for instance the belief that the fillings in one's teeth are radio transmitters receiving extraterrestrial messages, or the belief that some outside agency has added or removed thoughts in one's brain.Negative symptoms, on the contrary, describe loss or significant impairment of normal psychological functions, such as blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passivity and apathy, and anhedonia (APA, 2000).Although this reduction in normal functioning may seem less dramatic as positive symptoms, particularly negative symptoms are associated with long periods of hospitalization and poor social functioning.Indeed, a patient's degree of negative symptoms appears to determine whether a patient is still able to function in society.Last, cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia comprise 'executive dysfunctions', including problems in maintaining goals, allocating attentional resources, evaluating and monitoring performance, and utilizing these capacities to solve problems. Diathesis-stress hypothesis of schizophreniaSchizophrenia is a complex illness, and its possible causes are still subject of debate.However, according to a widely adopted view, both a biological predisposition, and exposure to environmental stress are necessary ingredients for schizophrenia to become manifest -the so-called diathesis stress model (Zubin & Spring, 1977).A classical example of the association between environmental stress and the risk of developing schizophrenia, comes from studies of the 1944-1945 Dutch Hunger Winter (Susser & Lin, 1992;Susser et al., 1996;Susser et al., 1998).In this discrete period during the Second World War, there was a serious decline in food intake in six cities of western Netherlands.Among people born in these cities between 1944 and 1946, the most exposed birth cohort (i.e., conceived at the height of the famine) showed a twofold and statistically significant increase in the risk for developing schizophrenia (Susser & Lin, 1992).Since this particular famine, many others occurred worldwide, but these were less suitable for epidemiological investigations due to more disorganized conditions (St Clair et al., 2005).However, several years after the Dutch Hunger Winter, a similar occasion occurred in China.Specifically, from 1959-1961, people in affected provinces were starving and died in large numbers due to bad weather (for refs see (St Clair et al., 2005)).Among births that occurred during the famine years, the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life was significantly increased when compared to those born before or afterwards (St Clair et al., 2005).These 'natural experiments' suggest that prenatal stress, i.e., exposure to maternal nutritional deficiency, could increase the risk of schizophrenia in later life.However, evidence from many observational studies that have investigated the association between experience of stress in adulthood and acute onset of psychotic illness, has not been confirmative (Phillips et al., 2007).In particular, there is no consistent evidence that experience of stressful life events is able to trigger onset of psychosis.Findings from longitudinal studies on the other hand, are stronger in linking episodes of relapse in schizophrenia patients to an elevated rate of stressful life events (Phillips et al., 2007;Walker et al., 2008), thus providing additional evidence for a role of stress exposure in (the course of) schizophrenia.

      "title": "Chemical Abuse in the Elderly: Evidence From Hair Analysis",
      "abstract": "The use of a drug to modify a person's behavior for criminal gain is not a recent phenomenon. However, the recent increase in reports of drug-facilitated crimes (sexual assault, robbery) has caused some alarm in the general public. Drugs involved can be pharmaceuticals such as benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam), hypnotics (zopiclone, zolpidem), sedatives (neuroleptics, some antihistamines), or anesthetics (GHB, ketamine); drugs of abuse such as cannabis, ecstasy, or LSD; or, more often, ethanol. Mistreatment of older people, whether it is abuse or neglect, can be classified as physical, psychologic, or financial/material. Several types of mistreatment may occur simultaneously. Very few data are available in the international literature. It seems that mental abuse and neglect are more frequent, but physical abuse such as beating, pushing, kicking, and possibly sexual abuse have also been reported. Drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults can be difficult to detect (active products at low dosages, chemical instability), can possess amnesic properties, and can be rapidly cleared from the body (short half-life). In these situations, blood, or even urine, can be inadequate. This is the reason why some laboratories have developed an original approach based on hair testing. Hair was suggested as a valuable specimen in situations in which, as a result of a delay in reporting the crime, natural processes have eliminated the drug from typical biologic specimens. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in sexual assault. It should not be considered as an alternative to blood and urine analyses, but as a complement. Mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry technologies appear to be required for analyses in drug-facilitated cases. The experience of the authors is presented in cases involving the elderly and chemical poisoning.",

      "abstract": "Apresentacao: A Esquizofrenia e um transtorno psiquiatrico complexo de evolucao cronica, caracterizado por uma alteracao cerebral que dificulta o correto julgamento sobre a realidade, tendo sintomas classificados como positivos (por exemplo, alucinacoes e delirios) ou negativos (dificuldades de expressar sentimentos e emocoes e pobreza no discurso). E subdividida em cinco tipos: hebefrenica, paranoide, catatonica, residual e indiferenciada. Neste estudo abordaremos a Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica. A Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, tambem conhecida como desorganizada, e caracterizada por uma acentuada regressao de comportamento, tendo como principais sinais e sintomas estao a infantilidade, discurso incoerente, enfraquecimento intelectual, perturbacao dos afetos, ideias delirantes, alucinacoes, pensamento desorganizado, gesticulacao exagerada, comportamento irresponsavel e imprevisivel, com tendencia ao isolamento social. Geralmente, comeca a ser percebida dos 15 aos 25 anos de idade. A causa ainda nao e totalmente definida, mas hoje sabe-se que se trata de uma doenca quimica cerebral que decorre de alteracoes nos varios sistemas bioquimicos, que sao os neurotransmissores, e vias neuronais cerebrais. Nessa conjuntura, o presente trabalho faz uma analise acerca do diagnostico de Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica de uma jovem assistida pelo Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juventil de Imperatriz – MA e tem por objetivo conhecer o contexto da Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, compreendendo os fatores que ocasionam influencia sobre a mesma, alem de conhecer a realidade da pessoa com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, bem como contexto familiar e alteracoes sociais que esta pode vim a causar, entender o processo de acompanhamento e tratamento da paciente realizado pela equipe multiprofissional do CAPS IJ, com destaque para a Enfermagem e elaborar problemas e intervencoes, visando a melhora na qualidade de vida da paciente. Desenvolvimento: O estudo realizado e descritivo, do tipo relato de caso, pois segundo Parente (2010), tem como caracteristica a descricao detalhada, contendo caracteristicas importantes sobre sinais, sintomas e outras caracteristicas do paciente e relata os procedimentos terapeuticos utilizados, bem como o deslanche do caso. A coleta de dados foi realizada no Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juvenil - CAPS IJ, na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, no dia 27 de Setembro de 2017, com observacao da consulta de Enfermagem com a mae e revisao do prontuario da paciente, entrevista direta com a enfermeira e assistente social da unidade, e ainda com busca eletronica e literaria, incluindo artigos cientificos na lingua portuguesa, para uma abrangente revisao. Foi consultado o prontuario da mesma a fim de compreender as principais causas do ocorrido e propor intervencoes para melhor qualidade de vida. Para a construcao dos diagnosticos/problemas e intervencoes de enfermagem foi utilizado o NANDA 2015-2017 e NIC, para estudos de medicacoes utilizou-se o AME e manual da ANVISA. Resultados: Com a busca desenvolvida, acerca das informacoes e historico da paciente soube-se que a mesma possui 20 Anos, e estudante, reside na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, com pais divorciados e uma irma com 15 anos, foi diagnosticada em 2013, aos 15 anos, com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1). A mae da paciente relata que teve parto normal de 7 meses, porem laborioso – ocorrido na recepcao do hospital, tendo em decorrencia deficiencia na oxigenacao cerebral (hipoxia neonatal) e convulsao. A paciente teve crescimento retardado, veio a andar apenas com 3 anos e falou as primeiras palavras com 4 anos de idade, mas apresentava boa socializacao. Apresenta retardo mental, relata a equipe multiprofissional do CAPSIJ que ouve vozes, ve um homem com capa preta, tem delirios, convulsoes, dificuldade no controle dos esfincteres, apresenta alteracoes na compreensao, alteracoes no humor, dificuldade motora, fala desconexa, em contexto fora da realidade, relata que nunca viu o pai, informacao que, segundo a mae, nao e verdadeira. Fala em namoro, mas de forma infantilizada, grita muito, nao tem paciencia em escutar, possui baixo nivel de atencao e gosta de pintar e ouvir musicas, se ocupando assim, por vezes, durante o dia inteiro. A paciente iniciou acompanhamento apos inicio dos primeiros sintomas na Associacao de Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais – APAE, tendo de inicio as seguintes hipoteses diagnosticas: Epilepsia (CID 10 G40), Retardo Mental moderado (CID 10 F71), Transtornos Mentais e Comportamentais associados ao puerperio (CID 10 F53), Transtorno Psicotico Agudo e Transitorio (CID 10 F23) e Esquizofrenia (CID 10 F20). Em seguida foi encaminhada ao CAPS IJ onde em 2013, aos 15 anos, L.G.S foi diagnosticada com Esquizofrenia do tipo Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1) e iniciou acompanhamento e tratamento com  equipe multiprofissional da Unidade, com atendimentos psiquiatrico, com nutricionista, enfermeira, assistente social e psicologa, e atualmente tambem participa de oficinas de arte e teatro, que a paciente relata que gosta, mas tem aversao aos grupos de adolescentes, pois diz que sao mais velhos e a mesma prefere se relacionar com criancas. Atualmente, tendo 20 anos e com tratamento medicamentoso, acompanhamento com equipe multiprofissional e participacao em oficinas, obteve melhora do quadro, melhora na socializacao, o que possibilitou tambem diminuicao na medicacao, passando a ser iniciado com a mesma o processo de alta da Unidade de Atendimento, com comparecimento da paciente de 15 em 15 dias para interacao social e acompanhamento com a equipe ate que esteja pronta para a alta. Fez-se levantamento das medicacoes utilizadas pela paciente e de diagnosticos de Enfermagem, como: • Atividade de recreacao deficiente, caracterizado pelo tedio, relacionado a atividades de recreacao insuficientes. confusao aguda, controle de impulsos ineficaz, comunicacao verbal prejudicada•            Interacao social prejudicada, caracterizada por funcao social prejudicada, interacao disfuncional com outras pessoas, relacionado ao conhecimento insuficiente para de como fortalecer a reciprocidade, disturbio no autoconceito, isolamento terapeutico e processos de pensamento perturbados, sindrome de estresse por mudanca, risco de automutilacao e risco de violencia direcionada a si mesmo. Fez se tambem o levantamento de intervencoes, que foram: Aplicar arteterapia, praticar musicoterapia, estipular terapia socioambiental, utilizar brinquedos terapeuticos e administrar medicacao quando prescrito. Consideracoes Finais: Em suma, o referido estudo possibilitou como ferramenta fundamental para conhecimento na pratica em relacao as principais alteracoes e especificidades de um paciente com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, trazendo um olhar critico para a importância da equipe de enfermagem nos cuidados e acompanhamento do paciente acometido, assim abrindo a concepcao para uma analise sobre a patologia, alem disso, possibilitou a capacidade de realizar uma pesquisa cientifica em bases de dados e literaria, que e primordial para a formacao academica.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening condition classically associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. NMS commonly presents with initial mental status changes, followed by muscle rigidity, fever, and eventual dysautonomia. Cocaine intoxication can present with symptoms that are very similar to those found in NMS, making differentiating the two disorders challenging. We present the case of a 28-year-old female with a history of cocaine use disorder who presented with acute cocaine intoxication. She had severe agitation associated with her intoxication, requiring the use of antipsychotic medications. Subsequently, she developed atypical NMS from abrupt dopamine withdrawal after receiving the antipsychotics. Although overlapping dopamine pathways between cocaine use and NMS could deter one from this practice and guidelines recommend against it, antipsychotics are routinely used in the emergency setting for cocaine-associated agitation. This case highlights the need for a more standardized treatment protocol, provides an explanation of why treating cocaine intoxication with antipsychotics is inappropriate, and suggests that chronic cocaine users may be more prone to NMS in this scenario. Furthermore, this is a unique case because it describes atypical NMS in the context of cocaine intoxication, chronic cocaine use, and administration of antipsychotics to an antipsychotic-naïve patient.",

Oral mechanism examination with gag and velar elevation was normal. Cranial nerves for speech, hearing and swallowing were normal clinically. Language assessment using Modified Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) in the first language Tamil indicated her responses were slow, elicited with repeated questioning, and constant reminders to focus, paucity of spontaneous speech, slowness of thought, limited verbal fluency to single-word or two-word phrases with increased response time and preserved reading skills. Impaired writing due to right-sided weakness. Visual Neglect and Agnosia was ruled out. Speech was slow, monotonous with normal articulation, hypophonic with a breathy voice, and normal nasalance. Grade 1 (G-1, R-0, B-3, A-0, S-0) indicated Mild Dysphonia. Maximum phonation time could not be recorded, while cough efforts were strong. Bedside swallow evaluation was normal and was gradually started on oral feeds. VLS by ENT for persistent dysphonia with odynophagia indicated normal larynx and laryngopharynx. No prior history of anger burst out, depression or anxiety was reported. On follow-up, she was passive, poorly participating in conversations. She was unable to complete Mini Mental State Examination. A score of 4 on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was given. Prior to admission, GR was a happy homemaker. Speech and Language evaluation was not conclusive of an apparent significant linguistic, cognitive or speech deficit. Although Dysarthria was ruled out, her voicing efforts were inadequate for verbal communication. Bradyphrenia and reduced spontaneous motor movements were conclusive of an extrapyramidal disorder. The finding of apathy was eliminated with a detailed evaluation which denoted aboulia. The lack of spontaneity and volitional behaviours is linked to the neural network that consists of the Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), Supplementary Motor Area (SMA), Thalamus and Basal Ganglia with Dopamine as an important neurotransmitter.[4] However, aboulia may also be caused by subcortical lesions of the anterior thalamus,[4] caudate nucleus,[56] globus pallidus, internal capsule, frontal lobes,[4] Progressive Supra Nuclear Palsy (PSP).[4] Functional localization of aboulia involve disruptions in the network. Reciprocal connections with cingulate gyrus, other limbic structures and frontal cortex provide an interface between the decision-making process and the emotions. The connection between motivation and action is governed by the limbic striatopallidal connections. These are derived from the concepts of observation that the amygdala and hippocampal formation has afferent connections with limbic striatopallidal and projects to the rest of the basal ganglia in turn involved in eliciting and forming motor performances.[1] [Figure 1c] The diagnosis is done clinically. In Fisher's “Telephone test” the patient thought to respond better over a telephonic conversation than face to face.[2] [Table 1] Table 1: Common Clinical Features of Abulia considered based on the factor analysis[4]The clinical presentation of aboulia as a communication disorder is under reported and often ignored by clinicians skilled in diagnosing and rehabilitating linguistic, cognitive and communication disorders. Cerebral dysfunction such as delirium, language disorder such as Aphasia, mood disorder such as depression may co-exist in several conditions. Aphasias in subcortical strokes are presumably less. Since aboulia is commonly seen in subcortical involvement, clinicians should look for distinguishing aboulia from other disorders especially Aphasia. Primary care providers (PCPs) such as neurologists may be focused on motor recovery, which could be hindered due to an underlying unattended cause such as Aboulia presenting as a barrier to recovery in a patient, otherwise misdiagnosed as post stroke depression (25%-50%).[1] Dysfunction in a region out of the area of a lesion can occur in regions that are connected functionally (Diaschisis). A comprehensive Neurological, Neurocognitive and Language examination is of great clinical value in identifying, quantifying and treating Aboulia. A more commonly seen Parkinson's disease can cause aboulia.[37] Due to poor initiation and varied presentation, people with aboulia may even suffer from malnutrition and dehydration.[27] This state of diminished motivation can be partially or completely reversed with appropriate medical management and rehabilitation. Dopamine agonists have been stated effective in Aboulia.[89] Direct or indirect damage to the circuit that controls voluntary behaviours can present in the form of a communication disorder which is non-classical of aphasia, dysarthria or cognitive-communication disorder. Also, the disparity in the severity of a disorder and their speed of motor, language recovery may be additionally dependent on this factor. PCPs should involve Rehabilitation specialists such as SLPs playing a critical role in the evaluation and management of such complex patients and in turn help improve their quality of life. Since the management is complex and long term, involvement of multidisciplinary team of experts helped GR gradually progress to an mRS score of 1 with appropriate medical management and cognitive rehabilitation.

      "title": "Pharmacy medications and driving: delivering key information to ageing drivers",
      "abstract": "Ageing road users face an increased risk of fatality and serious injury in a crash due to their fragility and other issues associated with ageing. A high proportion of ageing driver fatalities involves multiple vehicle accidents, with many occurring at intersections. Complex traffic situations become more demanding, particularly in combination with deteriorating hearing, vision, reaction time and/or mobility. A range of research recently reviewed by the TAC also highlights that as drivers age, there is a higher prevalence of medication usage for health purposes, but the use of these medications can often and unknowingly, impair driving ability. Taking multiple medications increases the chance that driving will be impaired. Likewise, mixing of drugs with alcohol also has the potential to increase the level of impairment. Main classes of drugs that are impairing include anxiety, depression, any emotional condition, cold and cough, antihistamines, and epilepsy drugs. The TAC has undertaken a project to provide all drivers (but primarily those aged 60 years and over) with up-to-date information and associated safety advice about specific pharmacy medications and how they can impair driving ability/judgment, so that they can make an informed decision about their driving capabilities. This paper will describe the research and development of this initiative, including the comprehensive stakeholder engagement process.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Epilepsy: Treatment Options.",
      "abstract": "The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drugs. Risk of recurrent seizures should guide their use. In adults, key risk factors for recurrence are two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography, abnormal brain imaging, nocturnal seizures, or an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures. In children, key risk factors are abnormal electroencephalography results, an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures, severe head trauma, and cerebral palsy. The risk of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs is considerable and includes potential cognitive and behavioral effects. In the absence of risk factors, and because many patients do not experience recurrence of a seizure, physicians should consider delaying use of antiepileptic drugs until a second seizure occurs. Delaying therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year remission rates. Treatment should begin with monotherapy. The appropriate choice of medication varies depending on seizure type. Routine monitoring of drug levels is not correlated with reduction in adverse effects or improvement in effectiveness and is not recommended. When patients have been seizure free for two to five years, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs may be considered. For patients with seizures that are not controlled with these agents, alternative treatments include surgical resection of the seizure focus, ketogenic diets, vagus nerve stimulators, and implantable brain neurostimulators. Patients who have had a recent seizure within the past three months or whose seizures are poorly controlled should refrain from driving and certain high-risk physical activities. Patients planning for pregnancy should know that antiepileptic drugs are possibly teratogenic.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "abstract": "Introduction and objectives Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in a variety of neuropsychiatric disturbances ranging from subtle deficits to severe intellectual and emotional disturbances, including cognitive impairments, mood and psychotic disorders and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and TBI are closely related. The reward-mediated behaviors central to alcohol addiction seem to interact with the cognitive dysfunction of TBI. First, a significant proportion of patients with TBI have a history of alcohol abuse. Second, AUD might jeopardize TBI recovery and trigger or lower seizures threshold. Third, both AUD and TBI share a negative impact on mental functioning (from memory and cognitive performance to mood impairment). Finally, there is some limited and recent evidence that TBI can increase AUD in patients with no history of substance use prior to the injury, by disrupting incentive-motivation neurocircuitry. Methods We aim to present a 27-year-old Portuguese male patient without prior psychiatric history who developed AUD and epilepsy after TBI (from a work-related fall). Results After 3 years of treatment, the patient's hasn’t achieved abstinence. His treatment included pharmacological therapy with mood stabilizers, flufenazine injections and naltrexone, psychotherapy and rehabilitative interventions. Conclusions Given the sparse knowledge about this dual diagnosis, the approach of AUD after TBI is still challenging and the best treatment remains to be determined. Monitoring alcohol consumption should be considered in all patients presenting with TBI. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

Case Report A 3-year-old drug-naive patient accidentally ingested 200 mg of aripiprazole. This ingestion resulted in immediate lethargy with brief improvement 16 hours after ingestion and subsequent decline 2 hours later. Patient returned to baseline 72 hours after ingestion. Discussion Unlike previous case reports, this patient displayed a biphasic course of somnolence. Previous reports have described delayed onset and prolonged sedation in response to an aripiprazole overdose. Current recommendations regarding monitoring after ingestion do not account for possible worsening of symptoms after improvement.

      "abstract": "The kidneys can be injured in diverse ways by many drugs, both legal and illegal. Novel associations and descriptions of nephrotoxic effects of common and emerging drugs of abuse have appeared over the past several years. Anabolic androgenic steroids, illicitly used by athletes and others for decades to increase muscle mass and decrease body fat, are emerging as podocyte toxins given recent descriptions of severe forms of FSGS in long-term abusers. Synthetic cannabinoids, a new group of compounds with marijuana-like effects, recently became popular as recreational drugs and have been associated with an atypical form of AKI. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy, is a widely used synthetic recreational drug with mood-enhancing properties and a constellation of toxicities that can result in death. These toxic effects include hyperthermia, hypotonic hyponatremia due to its arginine vasopressin secretagogue-like effects, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiovascular collapse. Cocaine, a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor that serves as an illegal stimulant, appetite suppressant, and anesthetic, also causes vasoconstriction and rhabdomyolysis. Recent adulteration of much of the world's supply of cocaine with levamisole, an antihelminthic agent with attributes similar to but distinct from those of cocaine, appears to have spawned a new type of ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis. This review discusses the nephrotoxic effects of these common and emerging drugs of abuse, of which both community and health care providers should become aware given their widespread abuse. Future investigation into pathogenetic mechanisms associated with these drugs is critical and may provide a window into ways to lessen and even prevent the nephrotoxic effects of these drugs of abuse and perhaps allow a deeper understanding of the nephrotoxicities themselves.",

      "abstract": "Mental fatigue or brain fatigue is a pathological and disabling symptom with diminished mental energy. It can be a long-lasting consequence after trauma or disease affecting the brain. The person can do most things in the moment and can be perceived as completely healthy, but the mental energy is insufficient over time and affects the ability to work and participate in social activities. After a conversation, for example, the person can be completely drained of energy and the recovery time is disproportionally long. Here we describe the phenomenon of mental fatigue, provide an explanatory model for how the condition can arise, point out diagnostic methods and possible treatments, which are currently in the research stage but may be implemented in healthcare within the foreseeable future.",

This case highlights a young woman with a medical history of recurrent hospitalisations due to intractable nausea and vomiting related to heavy, prolonged cannabis use and acute dystonic reactions secondary to haloperidol. The patient presented with intractable nausea, vomiting and frequent hot bathing five days after her last cannabis use. She developed an acute dystonic reaction to low-dose metoclopramide, a commonly used antiemetic, potentially exacerbated by cannabis's inhibition of drug-metabolising enzymes.

Although contact proximity to these UFO-like luminosities is fatal, less terminal encounters have generated many religious and cosmic references. Unfortunately, the biobehavioral effects produced by these hazardous exposures have not been considered seriously. One hypothesis is that close-encounter experiences displayed near a luminosity are evoked by direct stimulation through current induction within the observer's brain. Because of the architectural and electrical characteristics of temporal lobe structures, their functions should dominate clinical profiles. Whereas the immediate experience would involve dream-like sequences, terror, perceptual changes, depersonalization, vestibular alterations, auditory sensations, and profound meaningfulness, post-episodic effects would include amnesia, time loss, confabulation, crisis suggestibility, and electroconvulsive shock symptoms. Progressive personality deterioration could be characterized by enhanced religiosity, “sense of the personal,” a compulsion to proselytize, affective disorders and modifications of memory from before the event.",

With recreational use, users are interested in the effects of acute intoxication and long-term consequences are rarely considered. However, following addiction or dependence to a substance, chronic misuse becomes associated with a variety of physical health issues and disorders. This chapter begins by providing the practising clinician with information about the impact of alcohol on the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, haematological and nervous systems. The second half covers the impact of illicit drugs, starting with the opioids and the physical complications of intravenous drug use. The unique patterns of morbidity associated with cannabis, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, ketamine, solvents and nitrous oxide are then considered.",

      "title": "Malignant Catatonia: A Review for the Intensivist",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by psychomotor, neurological and behavioral changes. The clinical picture of catatonia ranges from akinetic stupor to severe motoric excitement. Catatonia can occur in the setting of a primary psychiatric condition such as bipolar disorder or secondary to a general medical illness like autoimmune encephalitis. Importantly, it can co-occur with delirium or coma. Malignant catatonia describes catatonia that presents with clinically significant autonomic abnormalities including change in temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. It is a life-threatening form of acute brain dysfunction that has several motoric manifestations and occurs secondary to a primary psychiatric condition or a medical cause. Many of the established predisposing and precipitating factors for catatonia such as exposure to neuroleptic medications or withdrawal states are common in the setting of critical illness. Catatonia typically improves with benzodiazepines and treatment of its underlying psychiatric or medical conditions, with electroconvulsive therapy reserved for catatonia refractory to benzodiazepines or for malignant catatonia. However, some forms of catatonia, such as catatonia secondary to a general medical condition or catatonia comorbid with delirium, may be less responsive to traditional treatments. Prompt recognition and treatment of catatonia are crucial because malignant catatonia may be fatal without treatment. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with malignant catatonia, intensivists should familiarize themselves with this important and under-recognized condition.",

There is science demonstrating benefit from cannabis/marijuana. However, there is also an evolving body of science demonstrating side effects and indication of negative consequences of marijuana use both with acute use and chronic use. Marijuana use impairs visual functions with acute use and chronic use in the abstinent state. Marijuana use has been shown to deplete the retina of dopamine. Changes in dopamine are a risk for mobility concerns as is evident from diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. We have identified retinal ganglion cell dysfunction using a simple visual field test with an alternating striped ten-degree target with variable contrast with acute use of inhaled marijuana. The temporary acute loss of vision in the mid periphery can have serious consequences with gait, mobility and driving. One of the fastest growing group of marijuana users for recreational purposes are older adults. This group may be at greater risk for harm related to falls and injury with the use of marijuana. Further, with reductions in other functions with aging, the risk for fatal injury while driving is significant. This abstract discusses the retinal dysfunction and vision impairment with acute marijuana use.",

      "title": "Preeclamptic psychosis",
      "abstract": "Neurological manifestations of preeclampsia include holo-cranial headaches, hyperreflexia, visual field changes and blindness, and altered sensorium.[1] Psychiatric manifestations usually arise when eclampsia sets in and particularly affects primiparae. A gap may be noted between the seizures and the onset of psychotic symptoms, occasionally up to 4 days. Symptoms usually include features of mania, delirium, and retrograde amnesia.[2] Donkin Psychosis, first described by Arthur Donkin in 1863, is a specific form of pregnancy-associated psychosis and is also known as Eclampsia Psychosis Without Seizures.[3] Previous studies have shown that preeclampsia predisposes females to postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis.[4] We present a case of a patient who was brought to the emergency department with features of preeclampsia and psychosis. A 36-year-old primigravida, with 36 weeks of gestation, was detected to have gestational diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism during the first and second trimesters, respectively (adequate glycaemic control and thyroid status with medical nutrition therapy and oral thyroxine, respectively), with no past/family history of psychiatric illness, and was brought to the emergency department with elevated blood pressure since 18 days. Her blood pressure was 180/104 mmHg. No pedal edema was noted. A neurological examination did not reveal any abnormalities. She was diagnosed as a case of severe preeclampsia with impending eclampsia. In the ward, she was agitated, uncooperative, and intermittently crying, following which a psychiatric consult was requested. Mental state examination (MSE) revealed an ill-groomed lady, lying on the bed with her eyes closed, intermittently crying. She was uncooperative. The affect was depression. She had nihilistic delusions in which she believed that she, her parents, and all the patients in the hospital had died, and that only after she left her body would her parents and other patients become alive. No perceptual abnormalities were noted. She was oriented to time, place, and person. Attention was arousable and concentration was sustained. Relevant investigations were within normal limits, including CBC, liver/renal functions, serum electrolytes, blood glucose, and thyroid function tests. Urine was positive for proteinuria. She underwent emergency low-segment cesarean section under sub-arachnoid block and a healthy male child was born. However, she remained tearful and agitated, and nihilistic delusions persisted post-op. On the same day, she was administered an injection of haloperidol 5 mg intramuscularly. The next morning, her delusions were fragmenting and her interaction with family members improved. By afternoon, her delusions had completely fragmented. She was observed drug-free. Serial MSEs and ward observations did not reveal any overt psychopathology. An earlier case report mentioning psychotic features during preeclampsia reported visual, tactile, and auditory hallucinations in a 21-year-old primiparous woman. The patient was not offered any antipsychotics, and there was spontaneous resolution of psychotic symptoms post-delivery.[5] In the present case, inj. Haloperidol was given to control psychotic symptoms and acute agitation. The current case, in addition to being a rare presentation, highlights the challenges in its diagnosis and treatment. Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

      "abstract": "Potential drug interactions encountered at the end of life may be cumbersome to predict and have significant impact on the palliation of symptoms. Recent advances in identifying metabolic pathways and metabolites of frequently used medications allow clinicians to consider the fate and pharmacodynamic effects of drugs prescribed. Numerous medications used in the palliative care population undergo hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism to active and inactive metabolites. Hepatic reactions rendering medications prepared for excretion or removal from the system are complex, but may be summarised for medications frequently used in end-of-life care as Phase 1 oxidation, hydroxylation, and reduction reactions, and Phase 2 glucuronidation reactions. Both general types of drug metabolism pathways may be altered by medications, disease states, and normal ageing processes. Specific to end-of-life care, Phase 1 reactions may become less robust, while Phase 2 reactions are typically preserved. Benzodiazepines, opioids, non-opioid analgesics, and hypnotics may all exhibit additive or reduced efficacy when given concurrently with medications which inhibit or induce these pathways. Unexpected dose-related toxicity or adverse effects may also manifest. In summary, understanding and anticipating potential drug interactions in end of life and palliative care is paramount for the health professional.",

Most cases of a central nervous system toxic reaction due to isoniazid use result from sudden intentional or accidental overdose. We describe a patient taking 1200 mg of isoniazid daily for 6 weeks who presented to the hospital with confusion and lethargy that progressed to coma. Within 30 minutes of receiving 1 g of intravenous pyridoxine hydrochloride, the patient was fully alert and lucid. The diagnosis of a toxic reaction to isoniazid was delayed by the possibility of concurrent active neurosyphilis and the failure to initially consider isoniazid poisoning in a patient without a history of sudden isoniazid overdose.

      "abstract": "Alcohol intoxication plays a significant and causal role in various fatal injuries. In comparison to sober individuals, intoxicated people have a greater generic risk for being involved in hazardous activities that may result in fatal injuries. However, it is not clear whether the biological effects of acute alcohol intoxication result in worse injuries than those sustained by sober individuals who are injured by identical mechanisms. Alcohol intoxication has a neuroprotective effect in experimental animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) but the evidence for a similar effect in humans is controversial. Earlier studies found such a protective effect, but more recent large epidemiological studies have not confirmed this finding; some studies also suggest a dose-related protective or exacerbating effect of alcohol intoxication on TBI. There are two apparent alcohol-associated syndromes in which an otherwise survivable blunt force impact to the head of an intoxicated individual is fatal at the scene. The first is a fatal cardiorespiratory arrest (the so-called alcohol concussion syndrome or “commotio medullaris”); the second is “traumatic basilar subarachnoid hemorrhage” (secondary to tears in the cerebral arteries, particularly the intracranial and extracranial vertebral arteries).",

In cases of death, it is difficult to relate it to the sexual practice itself. Suicide and homicide are the main differential diagnoses. Closely related derivatives of asphyxiophilic sex are anesthesiophilia (inhalation of variable volatile substances) and electrophilia (use of electric current during sexual activity)--both also intended to enhance the sexual stimulation. These forms of sexual practice are less prevalent than asphyxiophilia.",

Like other addictive disorders, alcoholism is characterized by chronic vulnerability to relapse after cessation of drinking. To understand the factors that compel some individuals to drink excessively, alcohol research has focused on the identification of brain mechanisms that support the reinforcing actions of alcohol and the progression of changes in neural function induced by chronic ethanol consumption that lead to the development of dependence. More recently, increasing attention has been directed toward the understanding of neurobiological and environmental factors in susceptibility to relapse.",

Anxiety in turn makes it more difficult for the patient to cope with suffering. In advanced disease, anxiety is often associated with depression. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale is a sensitive and specific tool for generalised anxiety which can also help in identifying accompanying depression. The differentiating feature is that patients may deny any severe anxiety, although sometimes anxiety is part of the drug effect. A single drug alone is an unusual cause unless higher doses are being used, or the patient is very young or elderly. The risk is much greater when two or more at-risk drugs are used together and this risk can be reduced by avoiding combinations of drugs with this effect. Pain that is not worsened by movement can make some patients restless, mainly as a distractive behaviour.",

Signs and symptoms of AW can include, among others, mild to moderate tremors, irritability, anxiety, or agitation. The most severe manifestations of withdrawal include delirium tremens, hallucinations, and seizures. These manifestations result from alcohol-induced imbalances in the brain chemistry that cause excessive neuronal activity if the alcohol is withheld. Management of AW includes thorough assessment of the severity of the patient's symptoms and of any complicating conditions as well as treatment of the withdrawal symptoms with pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches.

A critical step is to make the differential diagnosis between alcohol-induced anxiety (principally alcohol withdrawal) and anxiety disorders per se. Interview and examination techniques useful in making this differential are presented. Clinical management of and pharmacotherapy for alcohol withdrawal are outlined. Anxiety disorders that can be comorbid with alcoholism include panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic measures for each of these in the setting of alcoholism are suggested, and various possible interrelationships between anxiety disorders and alcoholism are considered. Although anxiety disorders may contribute to the underlying etiology of alcoholism in some cases, alcohol abuse tends to take on a life of its own. Treatment of an anxiety disorder can rarely, if ever, be expected to cure alcoholism. Therefore, the need to institute simultaneous treatment aimed at establishing and maintaining sobriety is emphasized. Research on anxiety disorders and alcoholism is as yet inadequate to fully answer many clinical questions about their relationship and their appropriate diagnosis and management. More research is needed in this area.",

No abnormality was evident on brain computed tomographic scan. These findings suggest the diagnosis of cortical blindness. The patient was able to see normally when he awoke the next morning.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAccording to Turcin1, none of the factors that encourage the criminal acts is as undeniable and obvious as alcohol. Nevertheless, there are numerous attempts of searching for something that could be classified as or prealcoholic personality.25 Some authors indicate neuroticism, weak ego, addiction and change in stimuli intensity as significant characteristics of the alcoholic personality. There is numerous evidence of weak ego in alcoholics.612Erikson1316 describes an alcoholic as an individual whose life course is defined by a negative ego-identity, which reduces and destroys his abilities. Thus, everything that makes the ego stronger contributes to the strengthening of an individual's ego-identity.Nenadic Sviglin10 states that the alcoholics who began drinking before the age of twenty, and exhibited the antisocial behaviour, showed the highest level of hostile feelings among groups. The psychosocial maturity in latent phase was lower in the group of alcoholics with antisocial behaviour, who began drinking before the age of twenty, than in the following two groups: alcoholics without antisocial behaviour and alcoholics with antisocial behaviour who began drinking after the age of twenty.11Kozaric Kovacic9 states that the group of aggressive alcoholics showed a significantly lower psychosocial maturity in the latent phase, in contrast to the non-aggressive alcoholics, which indicates the ego development blocking in this phase. A study by the same author showed that delinquent alcoholics exhibited a weaker ego in the latent phase with a significantly higher level of outward hostility than the non-delinquent alcoholics.The aim of the studyTo determine the psychodynamic characteristics of ego and Psychopathologie characteristics of alcoholic personality in respect to the type of criminal offence.The hypothesis of the studyAlcoholic offenders committing homicide have weaker egos and present more hostile, depressive and anxious personality characteristics.Sample and method of the studyThe study was conducted within the penal system, in the penitentiary in Lipovica and at the Dr Ivan Barbot Neuropsychiatrie Hospital in Popovaca. The study included two groups of subjects.The experimental group (E) (N=96) was comprised of individuals with prison sentences for homicide (N 1=32), traffic offences (N2=32) and property offences (N3=32). The experimental group was comprised of subjects who had been diagnosed with alcohol dependence during the expert evaluation and were being treated for alcoholism during their incarceration. The subjects had been drinking for at least five years and the clinical assessment of alcohol addiction met the diagnostic conditions according to MKB-IO and DSM-IV criteria.The control group (K) (N4=64) was comprised of alcoholics who were being treated for alcoholism at the Department for alcohol abuse at the Dr Ivan Barbot Neuropsychiatrie Hospital in Popovaca; they, too, met the diagnostic conditions. We excluded the alcoholics suffering from severe physical illnesses, those that had used drugs or other psychotropic substances during the last year prior to the study, those with obvious organic disorders, those suffering from schizophrenia or affective disorders not related to alcohol, those with antisocial personality disorders before the presentation of alcoholism, and those with high primary intellectual dysfunctions. Schizophrenia, mania, depression and antisocial personality disorders were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria.18 The study was carried out between the fifth and the tenth day after the admission.The following measuring instruments were applied for each subject:1. A structured questionnaire for general data;2. A structured questionnaire for the alcohol abuse history;3. An ego identity scale according to Erikson1315 for estimation of fixation and regression, to determine the six levels of psychosocial maturity. …",

W pracy przedstawiono i omówiono doniesienia o niewłaściwym używaniu kwetiapiny, nadużywaniu, a nawet uzależnieniu psychicznym, a także o objawach zbliżonych do tak zwanego zespołu dyskontynuacji, często mylonego z zespołem abstynencyjnym występującym w przebiegu uzależnienia.

Z tego względu należy pamiętać o ostrożności w przepisywaniu kwetiapiny tym osobom. W artykule dyskutowane są potencjalne mechanizmy, które mogą prowadzić do niewłaściwego używania kwetiapiny. Jest to prawdopodobnie związane z działaniem sedatywnym i przeciwlękowym co powoduje jej częste stosowanie z substancjami pobudzającymi.

      "abstract": "Abstract A hiccup is a sudden contraction of the inspiratory and diaphragmatic muscles followed by an abrupt closure of the glottis; that produces a characteristic noise resulting from vibrations of the vocal cords. Brief episodes of hiccups are common in humans at all stages of life and are usually benign. Prolonged attacks that last for days or weeks are considered a more serious phenomenon and may indicate an underlying disorder warranting a comprehensive medical evaluation. These attacks have been associated with significant burden and morbidity. The most common triggers for acute hiccups are linked with gastro-intestinal causes, such as the gastric distension that occurs after an abundant meal, or with gastroesophageal disease. Sudden changes in temperature, excessive alcohol consumption, as well as excitement or emotional stress, may also set off acute hiccups. Certain drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and many others, have been reported to induce hiccups. Drug-induced hiccups are diagnosed by exclusion of other causes and represent a very unusual side-effect of drugs like corticosteroids. We present a case of hiccups associated with intra-articular Diprospan (Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate) administration.",

      "title": "Status Epilepticus History, Incidence and Problems",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The history of status epilepticus shows that it was not recognized until the early 19th century probably because it occurred very exceptionally. It became increasingly frequent coincidental with the introduction of anti‐convulsant treatment in the second half of the 19th century. Today although the commonest cause of death in epileptics is known, the pathogenesis of the condition is still little understood and treatment has not advanced significantly since the beginning of this century. It is however established that it occurs more often in symptomatic epilepsy. Two precipitating factors have been recognized since the advent of anti‐convulsant therapy: (1) withdrawal of or change in anti‐convulsant medication; and (2) intercurrent infection. It is suggested that infection precipitates status epilepticus only in patients receiving anti‐convulsant medication and that it does so by producing a state of internal withdrawal, the pyrexia itself or the infective process interfering with the uptake, excretion or metabolism of the drugs, or altering body requirements. The present‐day importance of status epilepticus as a cause of death is demonstrated on published and unpublished statistics from the Registrar General's Office, and a pilot investigation of two series of patients presented to test the thesis that only in patients on anti‐convulsant medication does infection precipitate status epilepticus. RÉSUMÉ ET CONCLUSIONS L'historique de l'état épileptique montre que son existence n'a été reconnue qu'à partir du début du 19‐ième siècle, ceci étant probablement dû au fait qu'il ne se produisait que dans des cas tout à fait exceptionnels. Sa fréquence a commencéà augmenter avec l'introduction de la thérapeutique anti‐convulsivante dans la seconde moitié du 19‐ième siècle. De nos jours, bien que la cause de décès la plus commune chez les épileptiques soit connue, la pathogénèse de cette affection reste encore très mystérieuse et sa thérapeutique n'a pas accompli de progrès significatifs depuis le début de ce siècle. Il est cependant établi que sa fréquence est plus élevée dans les cas d'épilepsie symptomatique. Deux facteurs précipitants ont été identifiés depuis l'avènement de la thérapeutique anti‐convulsivante: (1) l'arrêt de la médication anti‐convulsivante ou son remplacement par une autre; (2) l'apparition d'une infection intercurrente. L'auteur avance l'hypothèse qu'une infection ne précipite le déclenchement d'un état épileptique que chez les malades qui font l'objet d'un traitement anti‐convulsivant et qu'elle aboutit à ce résultat en créant un état de sevrage interne, la pyrexie elle‐même ou le processus infectieux compromettant la résorption, l'excrétion ou le métabolisme des médicaments ou modifiant les besoins de l'organisme. L'importance actuelle de l'état épileptique entant quecause de décès se trouve démontrée à la lumière de statistiques publiées ou inédites du Registrar General's Office et une étude‐pilote sur deux séries de patients est présentée en vue de contrôler l'exactitude de la thèse suivant laquelle une infection ne précipite l'installation d'un état épileptique que chez les malades soumis à l'application d'un traitement anti‐convulsivant.",

      "title": "Dual Pathological Dependence On Alcohol and Araliaceae Stimulators: Problem Identification and Integrated Approaches to the Treatment",
      "abstract": "Abuse of pharmaceuticals and formation of addiction states became an urgent problem in Ukrainian narcology. The purpose of the research is to identify problem of dissemination of new forms of addiction to Araliaceae galena and tablets and to search effective integrated treatment remedies. Officinal alcohol tinctures Extractum Eleotherococci Fluidum, Tinctur? Ginseng , ?inctura Aralia? mandshurica and their alcohol-free tablet analogues are the pattern representatives of this group. Their intensifying excitation, psychostimulation, tone up, antistress, euphoriant effects attract drug addicts. Non-medical abuse specific features, typical somatoneurological, mental, pathopsychological, behavioral and social consequences (increased tolerance and megadoses attainment, cross-tolerance phenomenon, pathological inclination and discontinuation syndrome formation, mental and physical dependence) prove narcogenic potential availability in Araliaceae drugs. Chronologically, in majority of the patients dependence made a debut as alcoholic dependence and then it transformed into combined dual (dual alcohol + Araliaceae) or lucid (Araliaceae only) one. Formation of Araliaceae dependence on tablet pharmaceutical forms of Araliaceae drugsis possible. Dual dependence significantly complicated the clinical picture of addiction and determined therapeutic resistance. The research demonstrates the author's method for dual pathology treatment in which with the aim to stop the addiction to alcohol and Araliaceae the examinations were prescribed: conventional pharmacotherapeutic detoxication including membrane plasmapheresis, laser therapy modifications; electroauricular reflexotherapy; microwave resonance therapy; anticonvulsant and thymoleptic Carbamazepine (Finlepsin). The proposed integrated treatment demonstrated expressed sedation, reduced internal strain, anxiety and irritability as well as mood improvement, cessation of alcohol and Araliaceae stimulators inclination. The work discusses mechanisms of therapeutic effects of the proposed complex.",

      "abstract": "A nondescribed behavioral disorder was observed during wake-sleep transitions in 2 young children. Two boys had episodes of abnormal behavior in hypnagogic-and occasionally hypnopompic-periods for 1 year from the time they were 1 year and several months old. The episodes consisted of irregular body movements, which could be either gentle or violent but never made the children get out of bed. They lasted from a few seconds to 2 hours and were associated with poor reactivity and amnesia of the events. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed wake-state features, with brief bursts of hypnagogic hypersynchrony, and did not display seizure activity. A distinctive behavior disorder occurring during wake-sleep transitions with a wake EEG pattern has been identified in very early childhood. The clinical profile does not fit any of the known parasomnias and might belong to a new category of parasomnia.",

      "abstract": "DRUGS, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE: TOWARD A THEORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY PAUL WILLNER* Levels ofExplanation ofPsychotropic Drug Effects A few micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) can produce a major psychological experience, usually described as an \"altered state of consciousness,\" which can sometimes be the most powerful experience a person has ever had. \"Explanations\" ofthese phenomena usually involve a discussion of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) [1, 2]. Clearly, however, a description of biochemical phenomena in no sense explains the LSD experience, since no account is offered of how the biochemical changes give rise to altered states of consciousness. A similar problem arises in relation to biochemical \"theories\" of mental disorder, such as the dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia or the catecholamine hypothesis of depression. Paranoid delusions are not explained by demonstrating that DA systems are hyperactive; neither are ideas of suicide explained by a malfunction of noradrenergic (NA) systems . However successful these reductionist hypotheses may be in generating testable hypotheses, leading, for example, to the development of effective pharmacological agents, a hypothesis of brain function which omits any reference to the structure or operating principles ofthe brain is unlikely to be of more than heuristic value. An alternative approach attempts to bridge this conceptual gap by seeking explanations of psychotropic drug effects in four independent explanatory domains: biochemical, physiological, cognitive, and subjective (using die word \"cognitive\" in the information-processing sense in which it is now used in cognitive psychology, rather than as a synonym for \"conscious\"). In terms of a computer analogy, these four domains ?Psychology Department, City of London Polytechnic, Old Castle Street, London El 7NT, England.© 1984 by The University of Chicago. AU rights reserved. 003 1-5982/85/2801-0404$01 .00 Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 28, 1 · Autumn 1984 \\ 49 include two levels of \"hardware\" and two of \"software,\" corresponding very roughly to components, wiring, programming, and editing. Each explanatory domain has its own language and logic, and each must be understood in its own terms. A recent theory of the action of anti-anxiety drugs [3] will serve as an illustration. In this account, which is embedded within the context of a comprehensive neuropsychological theory of anxiety, anxiolytic drugs act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, or at other sites (level 1), to disrupt the flow of impulses in neural circuits in the hippocampus and subiculum (level 2). The information carried in these circuits is used to make a comparison between actual and expected events: a mismatch activates a \"behavioural inhibition system,\" which suppresses ongoing motor activity and increases arousal and attention to the environment (level 3); these effects are experienced as anxiety (level 4). Irrespective of its empirical merits [4], the hypothesis has a sound conceptual basis. The analysis spans all four levels ofexplanation, rather than the usual two: physiological (level 2) and cognitive (level 3) levels are interposed between biochemistry (level 1) and subjective experience (level 4). In addition to describing an empirical relationship between receptor interactions and an anti-anxiety effect, die account also specifies the neural pathways implicated, their role in normal cognitive functioning , and the relationship between changes in cognitive function and changes in experience. In describing the psychological effect of a drug or an endogenous biochemical change, it is important to consider not only the intervening levels of explanation but also the nature of the transitions between adjacent levels. The generation of changes in neural firing (level 2) from the biochemical effect of a drug (level 1) depends on the integration of that biochemical effect into a context of other ongoing biochemical processes , which include adaptive regulation resulting from the primary drug effect. The effect of tricyclic antidepressant drugs at noradrenergic synapses is a well-worked example: it is now established that, in addition to potentiating neurotransmission by blocking neurotransmitter reuptake, after chronic treatment, tricyclics also decrease neurotransmission by reducing the sensitivity of postsynaptic beta-receptors [5]. It is rather less frequendy recognized, however, that the important issue is the net outcome of these and other effects on the traffic of nerve impulses in postsynaptic structures [6, 7]. Similar considerations apply to die transition from physiology (level 2) to cognitive processes (level 3). A good...",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms vary moment-to-moment within a day. One factor that may influence these variations is chronotype. Evening chronotypes prefer to engage in activities (e.g., sleep, physical and social activity) later in the day, and evening chronotype is implicated in psychopathology, including anxiety-related disorders. However, it is unknown whether chronotype influences diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and whether these effects are amplified in individuals with a probable anxiety-related disorder. We examined the diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and daily activities in morning and evening chronotypes with and without probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a community sample of adults (N = 410). Evening chronotypes reported higher anxiety symptoms, particularly in the evening hours, and lower engagement in daily activities, predominantly in the morning hours. Evening chronotypes with probable GAD or OCD reported worse anxiety symptoms in the evening. Our findings indicate that anxiety symptoms and engagement in daily activities fluctuate considerably across the day, and these patterns differ depending on chronotype. Evening chronotypes have more anxiety symptoms in the evening, despite preferring this time of day. Personalized treatment approaches that consider chronotype and target certain times of day may be efficient in alleviating peaks in anxiety symptoms.",

      "title": "THE HYPNOTIC AND HYPNOTHERAPEUTIC UNMASKING INTENSIFICATION, AND RECOGNITION OF AN EMOTION",
      "abstract": "1. When indicated, in order to facilitate rapid, radical, short-term therapy, patients may be hypnotized and then treated, sometimes successfully, both by the more usual psychotherapeutic techniques and by techniques made possible only as a result of the hypnotic interpersonal relationship. It should be stressed, however, that we do not consider hypnosis of itself either a therapeutic agent or a therapeutic technique. Patients with surgical disease are treated (i. e., operated upon) not by but under anesthesia; and likewise patients with emotional disease can be treated psychotherapeutically not by but under hypnosis. Our approach is channelizing and directive, rather than suggestive or aggressive. 2. A number of extremely specialized hypnotherapeutic techniques now exist. Among these is one that for want of a better term we have characterized as the hypnotic unmasking, intensification, or recognition of an emotion. Some patients blot out conscious awareness of emotion. Though not felt spontaneously, it can nevertheless be aroused under hypnosis. If this particular technique be utilized, the emotion of the moment may erupt into conscious awareness with such intensity as to result even in the acting out of fantasies underlying those attitudes and symptoms that have caused so much difficulty to the patient in his relationship with other human beings. Sexual fantasies, naked anxiety, or pronounced rage reactions frequently come to the fore. These patients, however, seem to know almost instinctively, in view of the frequency of psychotherapeutic sessions and the time intervals between them, exactly how much anxiety they can tolerate during any one session. The problem, therefore, seems to be not so much that of the patient's anxiety as the psychiatrist's. Nevertheless, since defenses do not constitute an automatic brake, it must be emphasized over and over again that this technique is much too dangerous for use by therapists if they be nondynamically oriented or inadequately trained. 3. The reactions elicited may be treated along dynamic lines, but without verbal consideration and investigation of transference relationships. It seems to be the intense emotional experience of the therapeutic sessions, sometimes by itself but usually only when tied in with reaction patterns, motivational bases of behavior, early attitudes, and present difficulties in interpersonal relationships, that somehow is integrated into the personality structure and thereby helps make it possible for the patient to achieve warmer, more adequate, and more satisfying relationships with those other human beings with whom he finds himself—or wishes to find himself—in intimate daily contact. 4. Calculated risks must at times be taken when treatment of this type is decided upon. These include those of suicide by the patient, of collaboration by the therapist in the fantasies of his patient, and of acting out by the patient of the fantasies of his therapist. Such pitfalls, for the most part, so it is believed, can be avoided. 5. During this discussion, we have restricted ourselves specifically to the clinical applications—diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic—of this technique. We believe it may also find use as a research tool, but in our opinion such research—and, in fact, all research with hypnosis—should be under supervision by dynamically oriented psychiatrists.",

      "title": "ILAE Official Report: A practical clinical definition of epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary Epilepsy was defined conceptually in 2005 as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures. This definition is usually practically applied as having two unprovoked seizures &gt;24 h apart. The International League Against Epilepsy ( ILAE) accepted recommendations of a task force altering the practical definition for special circumstances that do not meet the two unprovoked seizures criteria. The task force proposed that epilepsy be considered to be a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions: (1) At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring &gt;24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who either had an age‐dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past the applicable age or who have remained seizure‐free for the last 10 years and off antiseizure medicines for at least the last 5 years. “Resolved” is not necessarily identical to the conventional view of “remission or “cure.” Different practical definitions may be formed and used for various specific purposes. This revised definition of epilepsy brings the term in concordance with common use.

      "abstract": "In according to World Health Organization's (WHO) definition, addiction is mentally and sometimes physical condition generated by interaction between living organism and addiction resources (medium). It is characterized by behavior and other mental process which involve coercion for occasional or regular use of addiction resources with intention to experience it's effect on mental process or to avoid discomfort due to absence of such a resource (medium). Psychic (mental) addiction is characterized by feeling of satisfaction and will for drug re-consummation to cause comfort and avoid discomfort. Physical addiction is defined as a condition of adjustment on drugs followed by need for increase of dose to achieve its effect as it was in the beginning with smaller quantity and with occurrence of abstinence crisis in absence of drugs. Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only). Human can be addicted to food, lottery games, television, internet, work, some other human or about anything but common characteristic is that activities connected to addiction may become central content and factor of his/her living. Such different addictions have and different importance, influence and consequences and addiction does not have to be necessarily negative phenomenon although it is mostly considered and judged as such. Depriving of stimulant, bring to crisis similar to ones found in physical addiction.",

      "title": "Reactive Psychoses Revisited",
      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided. Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination. Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

Older people who self-medicate often have a high risk for medication errors. Methods and Results: We described here the case of a 65-year-old woman who experienced recurrent transient anterograde amnesia, anxiety, bewilderment, and repetitive questioning that lasted for 2 to 3 hours after erroneously taking zolpidem. This mistake was due to the similarity in appearance between zolpidem and her newly prescribed anticholesterol drug, ezetimibe. Conclusions: History of medication, particularly as regards hypnotics, should be carefully reviewed when a patient presents with transient global amnesia-like symptoms. The inadvertent use of drugs may be an underrecognized phenomenon among the elderly who self-medicate. When prescribing a new drug to elderly patients, especially hypnotics, physicians and pharmacists should educate them and their families about the proper use of these medications for their own safety.",

Nicotine probably modulates the function of pathways involved in stress response and anxiety in the normal brain, which results in alterations of anxiety levels. Anxiety disorders do not seem to be related to a particular form of tobacco consumption. However, smoking is more frequent in these patients and seems to be implicated in some of their coping strategies. Understanding neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms underlying the association between smoking and anxiety disorders may improve physician's ability to assist smokers in their efforts to quit.",

The content of obsessions is ego‐dystonic, meaning that they are experienced as intrusive, unwanted, and generally inconsistent with one's self‐image, values, beliefs, and behaviors. Obsessions differ from ego‐syntonic thoughts about everyday problems (e.g., recurrent thoughts or worries about finances, occupation, relationships, and the like) and should be distinguished from the “brooding” ruminations that are common in depression. Typical obsessions include doubts about whether one did something adequately (e.g., turned off the stove); intrusive sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts or images (e.g., horrific image of stabbing a friend); thoughts about contamination; and excessive concerns about symmetry or exactness. Individuals with Obsessive‐Compulsive Disorder (OCD) experience frequent obsessions that are severe enough to cause significant functioning impairment and try to suppress or neutralize their obsessions with other thoughts or compulsive actions. Unlike individuals with psychotic or delusional disorders, individuals with OCD generally recognize their obsessions as senseless and know that the obsessions originate in their own minds.",

The principal one is hypomania that declares itself as an attenuated form of a manic episode. Its principal signs are an increase in energy, hyperactivity and disinhibition. In other cases, bipolar disorders express themselves as impulsive behaviours. More rarely, the mask of a bipolar illness is translated into behaviours such as intermittent alcohol abuse. The consummation of alcohol is sudden and paroxysmal. It is a type of dipsomania. Finally, bipolar disorders can express themselves as difficulty in impulse control. The two most frequent examples are impulse buying and pathological gambling.",

Results:The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity score at baseline was markedly ill (5).Initial CGI-improvement score after a week was much worse ( 6).The CGI-I worsened to very much worse (7).After introduction of quetiapine in 1 weeks' time, patient's CGI-I improved to minimally improved (3), and at discharge after 6 weeks, to much improved (2), indicating significant improvement. Conclusion:Coprophagia is a difficult to treat and is a distressing symptom.Treatment with quetiapine appears to have helped our patient.There is paucity of published studies and future large scale studies with medication and other behavioral interventions are recommended.",

The term alteration of consciousness requires specification as to whether it defines alteration of arousal - when the patient might be confused, in a stupor or in some degree of coma (light, deep) - or alteration of awareness – that is, confused (spatiotemporally disorientated, with difficulty in maintaining his attention), with or without delirious ideation. The coma, in the strict sense, originates from structural (neurological) or functional (metabolic) dysfunction of the ascending reticular activator system, but it is accepted that it can derive also from diffuse bihemispheric cortical-subcortical damage. In the emergency department the starting point is the triad of situations that requires immediate treatment applying the normal protocol (ABC); next, pathologies involving risk to life, which might cause cerebral hypoxia, are ruled out: diminished cardiac output, shock and respiratory failure. Subsequently, a neurological evaluation is made, bearing in mind two situations of potential gravity: endocraneal hypertension and diseases that might cause respiratory failure due to muscular fatigue. Neurological exploration will specify the respiratory, pupil and ocular patterns and motor responses. The depth of the coma is established through scales; a simplification of Jouvet’s scale is proposed. The etiological diagnosis will on occasion require image tests and lumbar puncture.",

      "title": "Mood Stabilizers in the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals suffering from drug addiction may also manifest features of bipolar spectrum disorders. Hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments may render individuals vulnerable to later development of substance abuse. Bipolar disorders themselves may be altered or precipitated by substance use, most notably by stimulants (amphetamines), alcohol, and cannabinoids.The clinical usefulness of mood stabilizers, particularly antiepileptics, has been established as safe and effective in substance abusers with and without comorbid mood disorders. Most studies on this issue have been of short duration and focused on the resolution of a currently manifest period of illness. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of these drugs on the long-term longitudinal course of these diseases, such as frequently encountered recurrent relapses into states of agitation, impulsivity, and/or dissatisfaction. As opposed to the clinical experience with traditional antidepressants and neuroleptics, antiepileptics do not induce counter-polar states (depressed patients abruptly turning manic or hypomanic; nor patients currently hypomanic or manic turning abruptly depressed). Many clinicians consider antiepileptic mood stabilizers to be the preferred category of medications for the treatment of such patients. Valproate appears to be a potentially fruitful medication to study in these dual diagnosis patients due to preliminary evidence demonstrating its anticraving efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a common health complaint that produces a significant impairment in quality of life and involves difficulty in initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, waking too early, non-restorative sleep, and daytime functional deficits. Insomnia is associated with a disturbance in one or more of the three systems that regulate sleep: homeostatic, circadian and arousal. A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues. A number of treatment methods have been developed that use behavior modification and cognitive restructuring to facilitate homeostatic and circadian mechanisms of sleep, and to reduce arousal during bedtime. These methods actively engage the patient to implement life style changes, attitudes and beliefs that promote sleep.",

      "title": "Sleep architecture disturbance due to the use of benzodiazepines",
      "abstract": "Introduction Insomnia, which is characterized by difficulty in initiating or maintaining a physiological sleep, is a relevant clinical issue, affecting not only the elderly population (from 20% to 40%), but also the general population since 30% of adults report problems in sleeping properly. In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "The author presents a new psychosomatic stress model. All the elements of the hypothesis are well known but, in this context, are published first. The following are the most critical aspects of the recommended chronic stress model. 1/ Stress contains both sympathetic and parasympathetic elements, but the latter predominate. 2/ The mediator of stress is carbon dioxide, the substance that can turn the psyche into soma. 3/ In humans, chronic stress is mainly social; people cause it to each other. Chronic social stress is created frequently due to deviations in civilisation, education and tolerance. 4/ The freeze response (or freezing behaviour) plays a subordinate role in the animal world; it lasts mainly for a maximum of minutes, while in humans, it dominates and can continue for decades. 5/ The decisive step of freeze is apnea, hypopnea, which occurs due to aversive psychological eff ects. After a more extended existence, mild chronic respiratory acidosis develops and most often appears in the clinical form of obstructive sleep apnea. 6/ Chronic hypercapnia can shape the metabolism into metabolic syndrome. 7/ After that, various cardiovascular and metabolic complications (hypertension, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, depression) may develop - partly due to genetic and lifestyle reasons.

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "title": "Smoking induced worsening of dystonia a case report",
      "abstract": "Several biochemical abnormalities have been observed in the brain of patients with primary dystonia, mainly involving norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine.1 Another neurotransmitter that is also probably involved in dystonia is the cholinergic system, as evidenced by the response to treatment with anticholinergics. However, it is not clear which of these is pathophysiologically related to the development of dystonia.1 There are only three published reports which suggest an association between nicotinic cholinergic system and dystonia, however with conflicting roles.2-4 We report here a patient with multifocal dystonia, predominantly cervical, which used to worsen after smoking and later showed improvement with anticholinergics and cessation of smoking, thus supporting the role of nicotinic cholinergic system in dystonia. Our patient was a 31-years-old man symptomatic for the past 10 years with difficulty in speaking which had increased in severity over the past 2 years. It was characterized by difficulty in pronouncing the words clearly with nasal quality to voice and occasionally he also felt that he had to strain more while speaking. For the past 2 years he also noted abnormal posturing of the neck in the form of turning towards right side, which was associated with neck pain, and difficulty in moving the neck sideward. There was no history suggestive of dystonia affecting other parts of the body, no sleep benefit or diurnal fluctuation, exposure to any toxins or neuroleptics. He did not have any significant family history of neurological illness. The patient was a chronic smoker, smoking cigarette for more than 6 years. However, recently, for the past few months, he noted that after smoking 1 to 2 cigarettes his abnormal movements of neck as well as the neck pain worsened significantly. This used to occur approximately 5 to 10 min after smoking and lasted for an hour. On examination he was found to have involuntary movements in the form of rotation of head to right side, elevation of right shoulder, mild retrocollis, facial grimacing, pouting of lips and increased frequency of blinking. When he spoke these abnormal movements worsened and he had predominantly adductor type of dysphonia. In addition he had mild postural tremors of both hands and minimal dystonia of both hands was noticed on walking. Rest of the neurological and systemic examinations was normal. There was no Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea and the MRI of brain was normal. The patient was further evaluated, using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) before and after smoking to objectively confirm the symptomatic worsening of the cervical dystonia reported by him. The TWSTRS score was 36 before smoking (baseline) (Video Segment 1), 45.5 5 minutes after smoking 2 cigarettes (Video Segment 2), and again reduced to 35.5 2 hours after smoking. He also had increased blinking, worsening of facial grimacing, and neck pain after smoking, but no evidence of worsening of hand dystonia. The patient was started on trihexyphenidyl 2 mg/day and slowly increased to 30 mg/day. He was also counseled regarding the benefits of smoking cessation. After 3 weeks of therapy he showed significant improvement in his symptoms both pain and dystonia and the TWSTRS score was 24.5 (Video Segment 3). During this period patient also had stopped smoking completely. He continued to maintain improvement at follow up visit after 4 weeks. There are three previously published reports which had shown a possible role of nicotine in the pathophysiology of dystonia.2-4 These reports had showed that nicotine improved in dystonia in 2 patients and worsened in another 2 patients.2-4 The patients who had worsening with nicotine had primary dystonia in the form of writer's cramp.3 On the contrary, the 2 patients with dystonia who had shown improvement with smoking and subsequently with nicotine had dystonia due to underlying secondary causes. One patient had developed dystonia after an encephalitic illness4 and other had developed dystonia following childhood hemiplegia.2 It is noteworthy that both these patients had associated spasticity, thus having secondary dystonia. The differences in the etiologies of dystonia probably contributed to the difference in the response to nicotine in patients with dystonia. Similar to that reported by Murase et al.3 in writer's cramp which is a form of primary dystonia, our patient who had, predominantly cranial dystonia, also worsened with smoking and subsequently showed improvement with smoking cessation and anticholinergics. The exact mechanism of effect of smoking and nicotine in either improving or worsening dystonia is unknown, primarily because there are only few documented cases. The major component of cigarette smoke that is responsible for addiction and other effects on the central nervous system is nicotine, which acts through nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChR).5 Nicotinic receptor activation after smoking facilitates the release of neurotransmitters. Most of this release is believed to occur via modulation by the presynaptic nAChRs. Other neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, and endorphins are released as well, mediating various behaviors of nicotine. There is also evidence of both nicotine and cigarette smoking improving symptoms of Parkinson's disease6 and this may be a result of augmentation of release of dopamine from the basal ganglia.7 Finally, dopamine-depleting agents or blockers have been used in treating dystonias. Therefore, it is not surprising that cigarette smoking or nicotine can aggravate primary dystonias as demonstrated in our patient and that reported by Murase et al.3 Smoking or nicotine induced worsening of dystonia could be also due to facilitation of release of acetylcholine8 or stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. Since our patient also had benefit from trihexyphenidyl, which is only a muscarinic receptor blocker, the former mechanism can at least be implicated in the worsening of dystonia. In summary, our case illustrates a rare and interesting observation, which needs to be studied further. Apart from clinical documentation, functional imaging in dystonic patients before and after smoking may be useful in elucidating the role of smoking in dystonia. Finally, for evaluation of the efficacy of any medical or therapeutic interventions in a patient of dystonia who is also a smoker, concomitants effects of smoking should also be considered.

      "abstract": "Like other addictions, alcoholism reflects the continuation of alcohol use despite negative consequences (e.g., an ulcer or family problems made worse by alcohol consumption). Recent cognitive theories suggest that optimal information processing related to the capacity to make decisions under uncertainty conditions is impaired either prior to the initiation of alcohol use, or it is related to the consequence of its repeated utilization. In this paper, we suggest that alcoholism may be the product of an imbalance between two separate, but interacting, cognitive registers that contribute to decision making: a reactive/automatic attentional and memory system for signaling the presence of alcohol cues in the environment and for attributing to such cues pleasure and/or excitement; and a reflective/nonautomatic system for regulating the dominant reactive/automatic response. Hyperactivity within the reactive system can override the reflective system and brain/cognitive changes induced by ethanol could lead to the disruption of self-regulation. We finally develop the idea that different patterns of imbalance between reactive and reflective systems could lead to distinct patterns of clinical impulsivity involved in the vulnerability to, the development of, and the relapse into alcoholism.",

Other agents are responsible for drop of arterial pressure by changing position, including antihypertensive drugs, alpha-blocking agents used in urology, antipsychotics, cyclic antidepressants, vasodilators and nitrates, dopaminergic antiparkinson drugs, sedatives, etc. Only drug with true ototoxic properties will be discussed here, namely substances that are able to damage the inner ear (cochlear or vestibular damage) or the VIIIth cranial nerve, causing impairment of equilibrium and/or (most often) hearing. No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "abstract": "Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy (DPHL) is a demyelinating syndrome characterized by acute onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms days to weeks following apparent recovery from coma after a period of prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation. It is diagnosed, after excluding other potential causes of delirium, with a clinical history of carbon monoxide poisoning, narcotic overdose, myocardial infarction, or another global cerebral hypoxic event. The diagnosis can be supported by neuroimaging evidence of diffuse hemispheric demyelination sparing cerebellar and brainstem tracts, or by an elevated cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein. Standard or hyperbaric oxygen following CO poisoning may reduce the likelihood of DPHL or other neurologic sequelae. Bed rest and avoidance of stressful procedures for the first 10 days following any prolonged hypoxic event may also lower the risk. Gradual recovery over a 3 to 12 month period is common, but impaired attention or executive function, parkinsonism, or corticospinal tract signs can persist. Stimulants, amantadine or levodopa may be considered for lasting cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms. Anticipation and recognition of DPHL should lead to earlier and more appropriate utilization of health care services.",

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "title": "Developing an International Core Outcome Set for SSD Interventions",
      "abstract": "Unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) is defined as normal or near-normal hearing in one ear and a severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing impairment in the other ear.1 Common causes of SSD in adulthood include vestibular schwannoma and associated surgery, Ménière's disease, and bacterial or viral infections. SSD affects an estimated 12 to 27 individuals in every 100,000 of the general population.2Shutterstock/Inspiring, hearing loss, deafness, technology.Figure 1: Steps to develop a core outcome set for SSD interventions for adults. Hearing loss, deafness, technology.Difficulties in daily life as a result of SSD vary considerably from person to person. Functional difficulties in everyday life are commonly reported, such as difficulties in speech perception in noisy environments and poor spatial awareness. SSD can also negatively affect one's psychological well-being, resulting in worries about losing one's hearing in the other ear and/or reduced confidence and belief in one's abilities to participate in social situations. Various social impacts of SSD can result from activity limitations and participation restrictions, including withdrawal from and within situations.3 The multidimensional burden of SSD on an individual's overall health is indicated by reductions in health-related quality of life.4 Interventions like a contralateral routing of signals (CROS) aid or a bone conduction device aim to alleviate the impact of SSD by rerouting signals from the impaired ear to the better-hearing ear.5 In the past decade, we have seen the introduction of cochlear implantation,6 which restores hearing by delivering information directly to the impaired side, thus creating a sensation of true binaural hearing. TREATMENT CHALLENGES The challenge faced by people diagnosed with SSD, health care professionals, and clinical researchers is understanding which intervention (if any) is ideal.7 How can we measure the benefits or harms associated with an intervention for SSD? Existing literature has highlighted inconsistencies in the benefits and risks (side effects), or outcome domains, assessed when evaluating these interventions. For example, clinical studies that evaluate these interventions have measured performances such as speech perception in quiet or noisy environments and sound localization. Studies have also assessed tinnitus symptom severity and quality of life. The tests (measurement instruments) that researchers have chosen to measure these effects also vary widely from study to study. For example, sound localization can be measured using a setup of four loudspeakers arranged at the front, back, and sides (90 degrees apart) or a more complex setup of six loudspeakers arranged in a semi-circle in front of the participant (30 degrees apart). This diversity of chosen measures poses a challenge to both health care users and professionals when comparing and contrasting various study outcomes. In some cases, researchers choose available measures because they are standardized or easily accessible, and not because of their importance to health care users or professionals themselves. ADDRESSING THE INCONSISTENCY Identifying appropriate outcome domains is crucial to designing clinical trials to evaluate the effects of various interventions for SSD.8 Selected outcomes need to be vital and tailored to key stakeholders such as health care users, professionals, or budget holders to minimize bias when making decisions about health care.9 Furthermore, the choice of outcome measures should be based on what is important and of interest to people making decisions about health care, not on what outcome instruments are available or most commonly used. The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative just celebrated its 10th anniversary. The network brings together researchers interested in the development of agreed and standardized sets of outcomes, known as core outcome sets. Part of the COMET work focuses on developing recommendations on minimum standards for the design of core outcome set (COS) studies.10 A COS is a recommendation of what should be measured and reported in all trials in a specific area as a minimum. If developed from the perspectives of all relevant stakeholders, a COS can overcome the problems imposed by the utilization of diverse measures. In the field of audiology and ENT, a group led by Professor Deborah A. Hall at the University of Nottingham has developed a COS for tinnitus.11 Professor Iain A. Bruce and his team at the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre are working on the PONCHO study: Prioritizing Outcomes iN Childhood Hearing lOss. THE CROSSSD STUDY The Core Rehabilitation Outcome Set for Single-Sided Deafness (CROSSSD) project is an international initiative that aims to develop a COS for SSD interventions. It aims to find an agreement on what outcomes are critical and should always be measured when evaluating interventions for SSD, using the methodology proposed by the COMET initiative. We have an advisory group of clinical professionals from the United Kingdom, United States, and Europe. The CROSSSD project also works closely with people who have lived experience of SSD. They have been integral to the design and delivery of the CROSSSD study. For example, a promotional video (http://bit.ly/2QbLJk) was developed alongside collaborators with lived experience of SSD to increase awareness of the project and help with global participant recruitment. Our methodology is as follows (Fig. 1): Systematic review of the published literature reporting interventions for SSD to identify the outcome domains and measurement instruments that have already been used.12 Workshops using a range of qualitative methods to explore patient perspectives on outcomes. Interactive online consensus exercise, known as a Delphi survey, with key stakeholders to identify which outcome domains are important when evaluating SSD interventions. Interactive consensus meeting with a subgroup of the key stakeholders to discuss the Delphi survey findings and recommend a minimum set of outcome domains that are relevant to all. So far, we have completed the systematic review of the literature. From 72 papers, we identified a total of 244 outcome domains. Many of these were duplicates or not directly relevant to SSD, and so we were able to produce a shortened list of 44 unique candidate outcome domains. The Delphi survey engaged 277 participants from 30 countries. They suggested five additional candidate outcome domains. The e-Delphi concluded in February 2020 and the CROSSSD team are currently preparing for the interactive consensus meeting to finalize the core outcome domain set. FUTURE STEPS Once a COS is developed, we would know what is important to measure in all studies; however researchers also need to consider how the included outcomes should be measured. The COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) international initiative has collaborated with the COMET initiative to develop guidelines for selecting outcome measurement instruments for outcomes included in a COS.13 For instance, if quality of life is an outcome in a COS, indicated to be critical and important to always measure for SSD interventions, COSMIN standards can help us establish what commonly agreed instrument or questionnaire everyone should utilize to measure it. Appropriate dis emination strategies14 will ensure that anyone designing a trial in this area will have a list of outcomes to measure as a minimum, alongside a list of recommended instruments to utilize. The COS will not prevent researchers from measuring additional outcomes or utilizing supplementary instruments. Future studies in the field should adopt the recommended COS to reduce the heterogeneity of measures utilized. Moreover, only outcomes meaningful to all stakeholders will be employed and, as a result, transparency will be established since both benefits and harms will be reported. Clinical researchers will be supported in thinking critically about what they are trying to measure, and they will not select their outcomes simply based on the popularity or accessibility of available instruments. Uptake of the COS will be encouraged internationally to improve research quality, enhance clinical decision-making, and facilitate meta-analysis in systematic reviews.

      "abstract": "SYNOPSIS Migraine has been hypothesized to be the clinical expression of a deficiency in pain modulating mechanisms. Abnormalities in opiate receptor responsiveness may be an aspect of this dysfunction. In migraine patients, i.v. administration of pentazocine (15 mg), a kappa and sigma opiate receptor agonist, provoked: (1) disturbances in visual and/or body image perception in 9 of the 24 treated patients, different from controls where these phenomena were never observed; (2) other symptoms which were also reported by controls; (3) miosis, without differences from controls. No differences between common and classical migraine sufferers were found. In patients complaining of perceptive disorders from pentazocine the other symptoms were longer lasting and miosis less intense than in the remaining patients, who responded to the drug as controls did. Two subgroups of patients could be defined, with and without pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, the former abnormally, the latter normally reacting to the drug. Pretreatment with naloxone (0.4 mg): (a) prevented pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, (b) shortened duration of the other symptoms in both patients and controls, (c) antagonized pentazocine‐induced miosis in controls but not in patients. It was discussed whether reduced miosis in patients with pentazocine‐induced perceptive disorders depends on a hyporesponsiveness of kappa receptors, or may be attributed to the sigma opiate receptor hyperreactivity upon which the perceptive disturbances seem to depend.",

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Disasters, whether resulting from terrorism or natural events, have a dramatic impact on the health and well-being of children. Studies after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and countless reports on the impact of natural disasters on children show that a child's mental health can suffer from direct and indirect exposure to these events. Children may react to a disaster or act of terrorism in a variety of ways. These reactions are influenced by age, developmental level, intellectual capacity, individual and family support systems, personality, and other factors. Common manifestations of psychological trauma in young children include regression, clinging behavior, inattentiveness, aggressiveness, bed-wetting, somatic complaints, irritability, social withdrawal, nightmares, and crying. Longer-lasting effects may include depression, anxiety, adjustment disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and interpersonal or academic difficulties. Some children are particularly vulnerable to postdisaster trauma because of preexisting psychosocial stressors (homelessness, foster care, exposure to violence, etc), low socioeconomic status, or special needs (including cognitive delays and prior mental illness). These postdisaster reactions may not manifest until well after the event and could persist for years.\n\nThe National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP) at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health gathered key staff to discuss the appropriate response to the needs in the Gulf Coast region. Over the following few days, talks were held with federal, state, and local public officials to assess immediate needs and determine what resources could be offered to the affected areas. Necessary clearances to provide medical care were obtained from the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas departments of health.

      "title": "Distortion of Olfactory Perception: Diagnosis and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Clinically, olfaction can fail in any of three ways: (i) decreased sensitivity (hyposmia, anosmia) and two types of distortion (dysosmia); (ii) distorted quality of an odorant stimulation (troposmia); (iii) perceived odor when no odorant is present (phantosmia, hallucination). The distortions are usually much more upsetting to a person's quality of life than a simple loss. An ipsilatersal loss of olfactory sensitivity is often identified in the nostril with any type of olfactory distortion. The pathophysiology of a stimulated distortion (troposmia) is likely a decreased number of functioning olfactory primary neurons so that an incomplete characterization of the odorant is made. In phantosmia, two possible causations include an abnormal signal or inhibition from the primary olfactory neurons or peripheral olfactory or trigeminal signals that \"trigger\" a central process. The clinician's goal is to carefully define the problem (e.g. taste versus smell, real versus perceived, one versus two nostrils), to perform the appropriate examination and testing and to provide therapy if possible. Treatment includes assurance with no active therapy (because many of these will naturally resolve), topical medications, systemic medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose and, rarely, referral for surgical excision of olfactory neurons. Endoscopic transnasal operations have the advantage of treating phantosmia and sometimes allowing a return of olfactory ability after the operation.",

      "title": "<scp>Kinesigenic</scp> Triggers in Episodic Ataxia Type 1",
      "abstract": "Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) (MIM 160120) is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with KCNA1 mutations, encoding for the alpha subunit of the delayed rectifier potassium ion channel Kv1.1.1 It usually presents in childhood with intermittent attacks of short-lasting imbalance, dizziness, and sometimes interictal painful cramping and muscle contractions, variably reported as neuromyotonia, myokymia, or dystonia.2, 3 Premonitory sensory symptoms may occur, and attacks may be triggered by startle, vigorous activity, changes in posture, emotion, hunger, alcohol, or intercurrent illness.4, 5 EA1 was described by Van Dyke in 1975 and associated with KCNA1 mutations in 2004.6, 7 Pre-genetic era reports mentioned kinesigenic triggers and sometimes the co-existence of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD).5, 8 PKD (MIM 128200) is a clinical syndrome characterized by short bouts of dyskinesia triggered by sudden initiation of movement, such as rising from a chair or running after standing for some time.9 PKD is associated with mutations in the PRRT2 gene in 27–65% of patients, with other genes involved including KCNA1.10, 11 This apparent allelic heterogeneity had been implicated in earlier reports but has not been revisited. We sought to explore the presence of kinesigenic triggers in patients with a clinical and molecular diagnosis of EA1. Using a database of all EA1 published cases, we retrieved 86 EA1 subjects with confirmed pathogenic KCNA1 mutations from 20 articles published between 1994 and 2017 (Supporting Information). Demographic and clinical data from this cohort are seen in Table 1. Data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS software; analysis of statistical significance was done using the Chi-square test when comparing categorical variables. Trigger data was available in 87.2% of cases (75/86), with kinesigenic triggers reported in 68% (51/75). These were often described as sudden movements (of a limb or head) or changes in posture, such as standing up from a seated position. Presence of kinesigenic triggers was associated with interictal myokymia (77.3% vs. 38.1%, χ2 P = 0.002), higher attack frequency (daily in 46.8% vs. 18.8%, χ2 P = 0.048), and acetazolamide responsiveness (complete/partial remission 63.2% vs. 12.5%, χ2 P = 0.016). Daily 25/64 (39.1) Weekly 25/64 (39.1) Monthly 6/64 (9.4) Rare/sporadic 8/64 (12.5) Generalizability of our findings is limited as data were collected indirectly through a literature review, comprised mostly of retrospective observational studies that are prone to recall and selection bias and may overestimate the presence of kinesigenic triggers in EA1. A smaller prospective study reported sudden movement as a trigger in 9/33 cases (27.3%).3 Other papers reported “postural changes” as a trigger, but it is unclear from clinical descriptions whether this represented purely a kinesigenic trigger or some other mechanism. Finally, the association with interictal and clinical features is exploratory, and direct causal relationship cannot be inferred. The limited understanding of pathophysiology of EA1 renders the relationship between phenotype and triggers mysterious. The Kv1.1 channel is expressed in the juxtaparanodal region of peripheral nerves and cerebellar basket cells. KCNA1 pathogenic mutations exert a dominant-negative effect with channel dysfunction leading to neuronal hyperexcitability, potentially explaining neuromyotonia/myokymia in the peripheral nervous system.4 Centrally, KCNA1 mutations in mice lead to increased GABAergic output from basket cells to the Purkinje cell axon hillock, causing deep cerebellar nuclei disinhibition.12, 13 Cerebellar involvement has also been demonstrated in PRRT2 mutations, causing altered synaptic input from granular cells to Purkinje cells.14 These findings suggest a shared role of kinesigenic triggers, network excitability and cerebellar dysfunction in KCNA1 and PRRT2.15, 16 Notwithstanding limitations in our study, our results are informative. The prevalence of kinesigenic triggers in KCNA1-EA1 is clinically relevant, particularly in limited resource settings where genetic testing is unavailable. Future studies may attempt to describe attack features and triggers in more detail, ascertaining sensitivity and specificity of kinesigenic triggers to differentiate forms of episodic ataxia.

      "title": "Bipolar depression: the clinical characteristics and unmet needs of a complex disorder",
      "abstract": "Objective: We reviewed important clinical aspects of bipolar depression, a progressive psychiatric condition that is commonly treated in primary care. Bipolar depression is associated with considerable burden of illness, high suicide risk, and greater morbidity and mortality than bipolar mania.Methods: We identified articles relevant to our narrative review using a multistep search of the literature and applying terms that were relevant to bipolar depression or bipolar disorder.Results: Bipolar depression accounts for the majority of time spent unwell for patients with bipolar disorder; high rates of morbidity and mortality arise from full symptomatic episodes and interepisode subsyndromal symptoms. Bipolar depression is an important contributor to long-term dysfunction for patients with bipolar disorder due to psychosocial impairment, loss of work productivity and high rates of substance abuse. Missed and delayed diagnosis is prevalent due to overlapping symptoms with unipolar depression and other diagnoses. Medical comorbidities (i.e. cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome) and psychiatric comorbidities (i.e. anxiety disorder, personality disorder, eating disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) are common. Currently, only three treatments are FDA-approved for bipolar depression; monotherapy antidepressants are not a recommended treatment option.Conclusions: Bipolar disorder is common among primary care patients presenting with depression; it is often treated exclusively in primary care. Clinicians should be alert for symptoms of bipolar disorder in undiagnosed patients, know what symptoms probabilistically suggest bipolar versus unipolar depression, have expertise in providing ongoing treatment to diagnosed patients, and be knowledgeable about managing common medication-related side effects and comorbidities. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical.",

Meanwhile, constipation, including symptoms of evacuation difficulty and/or fewer bowel movements, is a common problem as people age. Risk factors include problems in cognition, mobility, gastrointestinal motility, dysautonomia, anorectal dysfunction, and disabling neurologic disorders. Faecal incontinence is more common in frail individuals but is often assessed inadequately. The cause is often multifactorial. Treatment depends on the cause: a combination of approaches may be necessary, including avoidance of faecal impaction, instigation of a structured bowel care plan including regular prompted toileting, dietary modification, and (in some cases) use of loperamide or similar medications.",

      "abstract": "Ayurveda “Science of life” is a unique combination of science and philosophy that balances the holistic aspects of health i.e. physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Its aim is to promote and preserve physical and mental health and cure of ailments too. In order to lead a good quality of life both physical and mental health of a person should be maintained in good conditions. Now a days, even people know the importance of mental health as due to their busy lifestyle usually they succumb to unhealthy lifestyle which later pose harm to their health. Due to extreme stress in life people are becoming susceptible to various mental and lifestyle health issues like anxiety, depression, HTN, Diabetes and insomnia. Insomnia is defined as a condition where a person is unable to sleep or does not have a sound and sufficient sleep and wakes up usually tired and exhausted. The general causes of insomnia include stressful lifestyle, environmental influence, mental tension, changed food habits or any mental trauma. It is generally of two types: acute insomnia and chronic insomnia. The acute insomnia is referred to a condition one with short duration of few days to few weeks and the second chronic insomnia is which lasts for longer duration of few months to even years. Some of the major symptoms of insomnia include: difficulty in falling asleep at night, sleeplessness, waking up abruptly while sleeping and then not being able to fall asleep again, waking up tired and exhausted, irritability, sometimes wake up with headache, less concentration and low mood throughout the day, over thinking and worry related to sleep. There are various treatments available for this ailment in the form of oral medicines and therapies. In Ayurvedic treatment for insomnia some therapies such as Shirodhara and herbal medicines like Brahmi, Ashwagandha, Sarpgandha are known to produce calming and relaxing effect and result in sound and good sleep. This paper aims to compile and review the classical literature regarding management of Anidra; scientifically reported classical and non-classical sedative herbs; and clinical trials conducted on Anidra.",

      "title": "Complicated Withdrawal Phenomena During Benzodiazepine Cessation in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "The cause of prolonged or recurrent symptoms following the cessation of long-term benzodiazepine use is proposed to be related to downregulation and allosteric decoupling of the γ-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor complex. This case series describes 2 patients with prolonged (>2 weeks) recurrent complications during attempted tapering of benzodiazepine doses after long-term treatment. Excited catatonia developed in a 90-year-old woman, and prolonged delirium developed in a 69-year-old woman. Both patients showed improvement of symptoms after resumption of higher doses of benzodiazepine treatment and recurrence of symptoms when the dose was again lowered. Caution should be exercised regarding the long-term use of benzodiazepines in older adults (aged ≥65 years). Tapering of benzodiazepines in older patients after long-term treatment may require slow decreases in dose over long periods. Psychotherapeutic interventions, such as brief cognitive therapy with psychoeducation and motivational enhancement, and osteopathic manipulative treatment to decrease paravertebral muscle tension may be beneficial during the tapering process.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome affecting movement, emotion, speech, and behavior, which commonly occurs secondary to medical or psychiatric disorders and with comorbid illnesses. We report the case of an 18-year-old male with a history of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, polysubstance use, and previous suicide attempts who presented to the hospital from a residential eating disorders treatment facility, due to psychomotor slowing. The patient scored 3 or lower on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), but he showed marked improvement following 2 mg of intravenous lorazepam. The patient was referred for ECT, experienced dramatic improvement, and was discharged at his baseline functioning. His discharge diagnosis was catatonic syndrome secondary to severe melancholic depression. Catatonia may present a diagnostic challenge as no single catatonia screener captures all possible phenotypes. The patient consistently scored low on the BFCRS but he had a clear response to standard-of-care catatonia treatment. Psychomotor slowing is common in catatonia but is not designated as a catatonic feature in either the DSM-5 or the BFCRS. This case also presented diagnostic complexity as the patient initially presented with malnutrition and concern about a possible eating disorder. This report highlights that diagnosing catatonia is challenging, particularly in the context of medical complexity, and that there are discrepancies between diagnostic tools. When suspicion of catatonia is high, despite low individual screening scores, clinicians may consider alternative screening instruments or empiric treatment.",

A variety of pharmacologic interventions is available, as are non-pharmacologic cognitive or cognitive-behavioral therapies that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of panic disorder.

      "abstract": "As Far As We Can Tell, Two Powerful Brain Events Always Occur with Sexual Experience:* Attachment (bonding) to the sexual partner* Desire for repetition of sex acts (addiction)Sex may not always lead to permanent attachment or uncontrolled addictive behavior because of multiple other influences (family, faith, control of actions by higher brain centers, etc.) But observations of brains with new imaging techniques and of behavior suggest that sexual experience can have a powerful brain impact.1 PET scans can identify specific areas of the brain involved when a person is interested in another person, but cannot distinguish between lust and Only time and other behaviors can reveal the difference.2* Lust is a powerful emotional state and can cause people to do things that they would not ordinarily do, often for self-gratification.* Early is a powerful emotional state, which can last several months and cause people to think of doing things they would not ordinarily do.* Mature love is the deep, abiding love of a couple that stays together and follows the healthy evolution of early love. It is the stability of this mature love on which marriage, home, & family depend.3A separate brain area for pain has also been identified. The brain lights in the same area if it's physical pain, like a broken bone, or emotional pain, like a broken relationship.4 Emotional Consequences of Sexual Activity with broken relationships:* Pain and suffering from broken relationships* Fear, confusion about romantic feelings* Altered self-esteem* Sense of betrayal and abandonment* Guilt, depression and emotional rollercoaster* Impaired ability to form healthy long-term relationshipsBroken bonding may explain a large percentage of adolescent depression. According to a national survey of teen health, girls who were sexually active were three times more likely to be depressed than those who were abstinent. Suicide is attempted more often by sexually active teens than those who have not had sex: three times more often by girls and eight times more often by boys.5Sex & Depression - College Students* 30% of students reported they felt so depressed that it was sometimes hard for them to function.* 6% of students reported seriously considering attempting suicide at least once during the past year and 1.3% had actually attempted suicide.6Damage to the Human Bonding Ability* Individuals who have had multiple sexual partners prior to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than individuals who did not have multiple partners prior to marriage.* Couples who cohabit before committing to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than couples who did not cohabit.'Young Women Are More Vulnerable to premature sexual activity. They are much more likely to be pressured for sex8 and their behavior decisions can be influenced unconsciously.9* By pheromones. Young women are sensitive to pheromonal concentrations as little as l/100th of a drop. These powerful chemicals influence desire for sex, and cause the young womans mood to brighten and mental focus to sharpen, increasing propensity to sexual behavior.* By release of oxytocin with sexual activity. Oxytocin not only makes them bond it can also make them trust. More women than men say their beloved's faults don't matter much to them and women score higher on the test of passionate love.The Emotional TruthsFifty percent of teen relationships break within six months of beginning a sexual relationship. Many teens report two weeks is common length of relationships. This has spawned the concept of up = sex without relationship. Hooking results in unhealthy molding of the brain. More sex partners may lead to attachment difficulty. Brain molding that result from incomplete or unhealthy attachments is a threat to one's emotional and physical health. …",

The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether.

      "title": "BEHAVIORAL STUDIES OF SLEEP PATTERNS IN ALCOHOLICS DURING INTOXICATION AND WITHDRAWAL",
      "abstract": "Twenty-four-hour sleep patterns of 50 male alcohol addicts were assessed behaviorally during a 5-day base-line period, a 7- to 62-day period of spontaneous drinking and a subsequent alcohol withdrawal phase. Alcohol ingestion produced an increase in total hours of sleep which was associated with two distinctive changes in sleep patterns:1) fragmentation , a tendency to sleep in several short episodes (3-4 hours) instead of a sustained night9s sleep; and 2) somnolence , the distribution of consecutive hours of sleep was shifted beyond the base-line mode and long sleep episodes were combined with occasional naps. Fragmentation of sleep patterns was the most reliable correlate of alcohol ingestion and a frequent accompaniment of alcohol withdrawal. However, there were no common sleep distribution patterns during alcohol withdrawal either as a function of symptom severity or type of medication used. Contrary to the prevailing clinical impression, abrupt cessation of drinking did not invariably produce an initial insomnia. Moreover, hallucinosis occurred as a concomitant of the alcohol abstinence syndrome and independent of an antecedent or concurrent state of insomnia. These data are discussed in the context of current models of physical dependence.",

      "title": "The cannabis withdrawal syndrome: current insights",
      "abstract": "Abstract: The cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS) is a criterion of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fifth Edition ) and cannabis dependence (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10). Several lines of evidence from animal and human studies indicate that cessation from long-term and regular cannabis use precipitates a specific withdrawal syndrome with mainly mood and behavioral symptoms of light to moderate intensity, which can usually be treated in an outpatient setting. Regular cannabis intake is related to a desensitization and downregulation of human brain cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors. This starts to reverse within the first 2 days of abstinence and the receptors return to normal functioning within 4 weeks of abstinence, which could constitute a neurobiological time frame for the duration of CWS, not taking into account cellular and synaptic long-term neuroplasticity elicited by long-term cannabis use before cessation, for example, being possibly responsible for cannabis craving. The CWS severity is dependent on the amount of cannabis used pre-cessation, gender, and heritable and several environmental factors. Therefore, naturalistic severity of CWS highly varies. Women reported a stronger CWS than men including physical symptoms, such as nausea and stomach pain. Comorbidity with mental or somatic disorders, severe CUD, and low social functioning may require an inpatient treatment (preferably qualified detox) and post-acute rehabilitation. There are promising results with gabapentin and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol analogs in the treatment of CWS. Mirtazapine can be beneficial to treat CWS insomnia. According to small studies, venlafaxine can worsen the CWS, whereas other antidepressants, atomoxetine, lithium, buspirone, and divalproex had no relevant effect. Certainly, further research is required with respect to the impact of the CWS treatment setting on long-term CUD prognosis and with respect to psychopharmacological or behavioral approaches, such as aerobic exercise therapy or psychoeducation, in the treatment of CWS. The up-to-date ICD-11 Beta Draft is recommended to be expanded by physical CWS symptoms, the specification of CWS intensity and duration as well as gender effects.

      "title": "Post‐stroke mania in late life due to right temporoparietal infarction",
      "abstract": "Depressive syndromes following stroke are a well-known phenomenon, but a few clear-cut cases of secondary mania have been reported.1 Post-stroke mania has been strongly associated with right hemispheric strokes involving limbic or limbic-related cortical 'orbitofrontal/basotemporal' or subcortical 'caudate nucleus or thalamus' regions.2 Mania after brain pathology is relatively rare. It occurs in less than 1% of all strokes.3 We report a case of secondary mania late in life with lesions in the dominant hemisphere and discuss the clinical course and response to treatment in the light of the current literature. We also aim to illustrate clinical points in the evaluation of post-stroke mania. A 69-year-old right-handed woman with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type II diabetes mellitus but no personal or family history of psychiatric disorder was initially admitted to the emergency room because of disorganized speech, laughing and visual hallucinations (moving animals such as birds over the wall), the sudden onset of left-sided arm and leg weakness and focal motor seizure. Her relatives reported a 2 day history of sudden change in behavior. She had an elevated mood, rapid speech, inappropriate laughing and did not want to sleep at night. When the patient was examined in the emergency room, she showed pressured speech, flight of ideas, grandiosity, and pyschomotor agitation. Neurological examination revealed a visual and motor neglect to the left side of the body, and left-sided hemiparesia with hyperactive reflexes. Electrocardiography demonstrated atrial fibrillation and the patient was on digitalis and diltiazem treatment. After initiating oral anticoagulant and carbamazepine, the patient was hospitalized. Physical examination was normal. The patient responded to simple and complex verbal commands. The patient's formal thinking was characterized by loosened associations and rhyming. There was no aphasia. Memory and cognitive functions were normal. There was no amnestic period. Examination of left upper and lower limbs revealed normal tone, 4/5 graded power, minimally increased reflexes in comparison with the right side. The plantar reflexes were extensor on the left side. Laboratory tests including full blood count, kidney, liver and thyroid functions, electrolytes, and urine analysis were within normal limits. Electroencephalography was normal. The cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed age-related cortical atrophy and right temporoparietal cortical infarction. Atherosclerotic changes were observed with Doppler ultrasound of the carotid artery. Because the patient's mood and sleep disturbances continued at the end of the first week, we asked for psychiatric consultation, and it became obvious that the patient was suffering from a mood disorder characterized by severe manic episode with mood-congruent psychotic symptoms. The ongoing 800 mg/day carbamazepine treatment was titrated up to 1200 mg/day. Over a 3 week period her elevated mood settled to a hyperthymic level. Her disorganized behavior gradually improved. The patient was reassessed on 6 month follow-up visit: the scores of the Young–Mania Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Scale were under the threshold but the patient was still talkative and had characteristics of hyperthymic temperament with unimpairment in social functioning. Premorbidly the patient was a euthymic person with introvert characteristic features. Mania is a rare complication of cerebral ischemia, its frequency is less than 1% of all strokes.3 Dunne et al. diagnosed only three cases of post-stroke mania among 661 stroke patients,4 and similarly Starkstein et al. identified three cases in their clinical sample of 700 consecutive stroke patients.5 Mania was not diagnosed among 157 patients following their first stroke, who were consecutively admitted to a rehabilitation unit in Hong Kong.6 Most of the reported patients had lesions in the non-dominant hemisphere, similarly to this patient.7 Considerable confusion pervades the diagnosis and classification of manic syndromes in the geriatric population. Mood disorders following cerebrovascular accidents have required special attention because of significant functional impairment and medical comorbidity. Late-onset mania is associated with greater vascular risk factors. The bimodal appearance of age at first psychiatric hospitalization in clinical studies provides further support of late-onset mania as a distinct manic subtype with possibly a different, vascular etiology. Control of these vascular risks may impact on the incidence of late-onset mania, as well as on its clinical management.8 Clinical data have revealed the association between secondary mood syndromes and stroke. Recent studies, however, have begun to distinguish whether these mood disorders represent primary disorders or are a secondary consequence of the cerebral infarction. Although post-stroke mood disorders share similarities with primary mood disorders in their clinical phenomenology, longitudinal course, and response to treatment, clinical–pathologic correlation during the acute post-stroke period has provided strong evidence that these disorders are frequently etiologically linked to cerebral ischemia. It is reported that mania is caused by a dysfunction in limbic corticostriato-thalamocortical circuit secondary to abnormal input to the limbic striatum. It is thought that the pathophysiology of post-stroke mania is disconnection between limbic structures (thalamus, caudate nuclei) and/or frontal, temporal cortical areas. There is a strong relationship between secondary mania and right hemisphere lesions. The lack of prior psychiatric disorder or family history, the radiographic change and a lesion conducive to the development of mania were all highly suggestive that this infarction was the cause of her manic episode. Carbamazepine, lithium, clonidine, valproic acid, and neuroleptics are effective in the treatment of post-stroke mania. Carbamazepine was given to the present patient because of its anticonvulsant and antimanic effects.9 We suggest that such a model may fit the present patient because a right-hemispheric stroke extending to the subcortical areas precipitated a unipolar manic disorder and also reversed the premorbid mood to hyperthymia.",

Very often and most heavy are pharmacogenic depressions following recovery from schizophrenic symptoms (under fluphenazine-decanoate up to about three quarters of the patients). A controlled study showed that they are caused by neuroleptic drugs. First and best therapy is to reduce or even discontinue the application of the neuroleptic.

      "abstract": "Abstract The effects of affects (anxiety, anger) on the content of concurrently ongoing dreams have been studied in 10 college students. Dreams were defined as mental products in which everything (including thoughts) is expressed by means of visual imagery. Anxiety or anger were generated by posthypnotic suggestions. The Ss professed total amnesia for the posthypnotic suggestions. The presence of suggested anxiety or anger concurred with changes of the galvanic skin resistance, the blood pressure, the heart rate, and the free fatty acid content of blood plasma. Analysis of the reported dream contents suggests that the dream content may be altered through endogenous affects that concur with the process of dreaming. Mild or moderate anxiety or anger without a specific content may promote retrieval of old memory traces and incorporation of these memory traces into the dream content. Intensive anxiety (or rage) may result in dreamwork designed to cope with this intensive emotion. This may interfere with the engramming of last day's residue.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The withdrawal syndromes after discontinuance of alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedative drugs, such as chloral and paraldehyde, are all similar. The severity of a withdrawal reaction is largely determined by the daily dose, the duration of administration and the rate of fall of the drug levels after withdrawal, as well as the propensity of the individual patient. The time course of a withdrawal reaction is determined by the drug's clearance. Alcohol has a half‐life of a few hours; withdrawal symptoms may develop within 6–8 hours of abstinence and convulsions in 12–48 hours. After discontinuance of short‐ or medium‐acting barbiturates (half‐life 8–40 hours) symptoms may develop in 1–3 days, followed by convulsions and delirium after 3–8 days. Symptoms and seizures may develop in the 1–10 days after withdrawal of benezodiazepines. In patients with no prior history of epilepsy the types of seizures most commonly induced by drug withdrawal are generalized convulsions, but partial seizures are not uncommon if there is a focal cerebral lesion, or a previous history of partial seizures. Paroxysmal activity and photosensitivity may occur after barbiturate withdrawal in non‐epileptics, more commonly in severe withdrawal reactions. Similar EEG changes may be seen after alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, but photosensitivity does not appear to have been shown to be a feature of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.",

      "abstract": "In a previous publication (Brown and Birley, 1968) we have presented some findings which suggest that life changes and crises frequently precipitate the acute onset, relapse or exacerbation of schizophrenic states. To summarize : consecutively admitted patients diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia were seen at mental hospitals serving a known catchment area. The first fifty whose onsets occurred within three months of admission and could be accurately dated within a week were included. Both the patient and at least one other informant were interviewed about the occurrence of certain previously defined and datable events occurring to the patient or to close relatives. These included such events as moving house, starting or leaving a job, admission to hospital, birth, marriage or death during the twelve weeks prior to onset. These were classified, according to their apparent independence of the patient's control, as ‘independent’ or ‘possibly independent’. The former were those which could be regarded as outside his control, e.g. discovering a burglary or hearing of a brother's serious illness. ‘Possibly independent’ events were those which were considered to have been within the patient's control but which had not been brought about by any unusual behaviour on the patient's part. They were chiefly changes of job, or of opposite sex friends. (Loss of job would, under certain circumstances, be rated as ‘independent’, e.g. when a whole firm closed down).",

      "abstract": "In this paper, it is suggested that the first use of hallucinogenic drugs often occurs during a life crisis which requires a more autonomous level of functioning. On the one hand, the person wishes to be more self-sufficient; on the other, he wishes to regress to a more dependent state. By taking the drug, he unconsciously hopes it will resolve this dilemma by making him unable to cope without making him feel ashamed of his incapacity. Three case histories are presented to illustrate this type of response. Drug use may also be due to the opposite wish—to become more powerful and able to cope with a crisis. Such unconscious coping mechanisms may often determine the first use of drugs and may also explain why many people are only occasional users. Habitual drug use may occur if concomitant feelings of depression and alienation are relieved, or if pleasure or insight are experienced. Since the psychodynamic determinants of drug use vary for different groups and individuals, it is probably useful and necessary to delineate them in greater detail so as to gain a better understanding of a multicausal phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake pattern constitute one of the major complaints of patients with a wide range of psychiatric conditions, including major depression disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol abuse. Recent advances have cast light on the mecanisms underlying modifications in sleep in psychiatric disorders, offering new approaches in management and opening new avenues of research. Isnomnia and psychiatric disorders, especially depression, are intimately linked. Insomnia, defined as a difficulty in initiating and/or in maintaining sleep leading to daytime repercussions, is not simply a symptom of depression but an independent diagnostic entity, and is known to be an independent risk factor for both depression itself and the development of a new depression episode or relapse. To date, the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the relationships between insomnia and affective disorders are not yet fully understood. The review by Chiara Baglioni et al. examines the latest findings from several fields of research, with particular attention to alterations of the arousal system leading to hyperarousal and to the possible biological mechanisms involved in the link between sleep alteration, insomnia, regulation of emotion, and mood symptoms. Links between depression sleep and circadian rhythms have long been suspected due to the existence of seasonal depression, where the onset of low mood correlates with a reduction in day length. Seasonal affective disorder (SA) is primarily a circadian rhythm disorder. Alfred Lewy discusses the theory of misalignement between the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion and the midpoint of the sleep bout, and emphasise the importance or careful timing of treatment administration (bright light or melatonin). Timing of treatment administration requiring detailed information on patients’ phase state and the role of new accessible tools such as dim light melatonine onset are evaluated as are different treatment modalities. The importance of biological rhythms in SA disorder has led to an interest in the role of circadian rhythms in the development of depression. The successes of chronobiotic treatments for SA disorder have led to the trialling of psychological and pharmacological treatments targeting circadian rhythms in unipolar major depression (MDD). The review by Sarah Hartley et al. focuses on the research linking circadian rhythms and depression, and on the evidence for effectiveness of chronobiotic treatments such as high intensity light, melatonin or melatonin agonist or behavioural therapy in MDD. The evidence base for novel antidepressants combining 5HT2c antagonist and melatonin agonist action in acute treatment of unipolar MDD and in relapse prevention is reviewed as is their use in clinical management of MDD. Managing bipolar disorder is a challenge for psychiatrists and it has been long known that sleep disorders are a sign of relapse. Carole Boudebesse et al. examine the evidence that sleep and circadian rhythms are disturbed in bipolar patients during both mood episodes and periods of remission. Therapeutic applications of chronobiology in bipolar disorder, such as specific psychosocial interventions, light therapy and physical exercise are described. Finally, psychiatrists are faced with frequent reports of sleep disorders in adults and children with attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, conversely, sleep specialists report certain symptoms of ADHD (attention deficits, fidgeting) in patients suffering from primary sleep disorders. Are ADHD symptoms secondary to sleep fragmentation due to sleep disorders such as sleep disordered breathing and periodic legs movements, and treatable with treatment of these specific disorders? Could some ADHD subjects share a common deficit in the sleep/wake regulation systems resulting in sleep fragmentation? The pathophysiological relationship between sleep disorders and ADHD is complex and probably multidirectional. The hot topic from the team of Astrid Claret et al. reviews the latest research and aims to help clinicians in developing a framework for understanding and treating patients suffering from ADHD and sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Concurrent Alcohol and Tobacco Dependence: Mechanisms and Treatment",
      "abstract": "People who drink alcohol often also smoke and vice versa. Several mechanisms may contribute to concurrent alcohol and tobacco use. These mechanisms include genes that are involved in regulating certain brain chemical systems; neurobiological mechanisms, such as cross-tolerance and cross-sensitization to both drugs; conditioning mechanisms, in which cravings for alcohol or nicotine are elicited by certain environmental cues; and psychosocial factors (e.g., personality characteristics and coexisting psychiatric disorders). Treatment outcomes for patients addicted to both alcohol and nicotine are generally worse than for people addicted to only one drug, and many treatment providers do not promote smoking cessation during alcoholism treatment. Recent findings suggest, however, that concurrent treatment for both addictions may improve treatment outcomes. KEY WORDS: comorbidity; AODD (alcohol and other drug dependence); alcoholic beverage; tobacco in any form; nicotine; smoking; genetic linkage; cross-tolerance; AOD (alcohol and other drug) sensitivity; neurotransmitters; brain reward pathway; cue reactivity; social AODU (AOD use); cessation of AODU; treatment outcome; combined modality therapy; literature review Alcohol consumption and tobacco use are closely linked behaviors. Thus, not only are people who drink alcohol more likely to smoke (and vice versa) but also people who drink larger amounts of alcohol tend to smoke more cigarettes. Furthermore, patients diagnosed with dependence on one of the drugs also are commonly diagnosed with dependence on the other drug (e.g., Zacny 1990). In fact, smoking rates among alcoholics have been estimated to be as high as 90 percent, with approximately 70 percent of alcoholics smoking at least one pack of cigarettes per day (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 1998). Similarly, smokers are far more likely to consume alcohol than are nonsmokers, and smokers who are dependent on nicotine have a 2.7 times greater risk of becoming alcohol dependent than nonsmokers (e.g., Breslau 1995). Finally, although the smoking rate in the general population has gradually declined over the past three decades, the smoking rate among alcoholics has remained persistently high (e.g., Hays et al. 1999). Concerns about the concurrent use of alcohol and tobacco are particularly salient given the detrimental impact of this drug combination on the individual and on society. For instance, alcohol and tobacco when used together increase the risk of various forms of cancer (e.g., mouth and esophageal cancer), as well as cardiovascular disease, more than use of either drug alone (e.g., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1989). The concurrent use of both drugs by pregnant women can also result in more severe prenatal damage and neurocognitive deficits in their offspring than use of either drug alone (e.g., Martin et al. 1997). Furthermore, the combined use of alcohol and tobacco among adolescents is more predictive of illicit drug use and various personal and social problems among this population than use of either drug alone (e.g., Hoffman et al. 2001). Given the frequent occurrence and broad implications of concurrent alcohol and tobacco use, research and clinical efforts clearly must focus on people who abuse both drugs. Over the past decade, interactions between alcohol and tobacco have indeed received growing attention from both basic and clinical researchers. Alcohol dependence and smoking, individually and in combination, are complex forms of addictive behavior that may be influenced by a variety of genetic, neurobiological, conditioning, and psychosocial mechanisms, as described in this article. In addition to these mechanisms, the article discusses issues related to the treatment of alcoholic smokers. This overview will necessarily be selective; for instance, there is little mention of sociocultural (e.g., economic and demographic) factors that also may contribute to concurrent use of alcohol and tobacco (see Bobo and Husten 2000). …",

      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

As a result of the observation of a sudden cure of a deep vital depression in a 73 year old patient in direct chronological connection with the appearance of an allergic urticaria, studies were carried out, in the 8 years following, of a total of 18 cases of similar circumstances; during the treatment of an endogenous depression the development of intercurrent allergic skin reactions showed: in 6 cases the psychosis completely disappeared with the development of the urticaria; in 8 cases the symptoms were considerably relieved so that only the remains of vegetative disorders persisted; in 4 cases no effect could be determined. In 2 cases the same allergic reaction was consciously provoked by a reapplication of the medicaments concerned during a following depressive phase; again with favourable results since under these conditions coincidences are not very probable, the conclusion can be made, and experimentally supported, that allergic drug reactions may be employed in the course of depressions, with careful avoidance of complications.",

It is usually described as an unpleasant noise, but in some patients it takes the form of a ringing, buzzing, hissing, humming, or whistling sound, or as ticking, clicking, roaring, tunes, songs, or beeping. It is estimated that 1 out of every 5 people experience some degree of tinnitus. Tinnitus is not itself a disease but an unwelcome symptom. It can be accompanied by audiometric evidence of deafness which occurs in association with both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss resulting from a range of underlying causes, including ear infections, foreign objects orwax in the ear, and injury from loud noises. Tinnitus is also a side-effect of some metabolic disorders, medications, and may also result from an abnormally low level of serotonin or high level of insulin. As mentioned above, some foods are found by some people to make their tinnitus worse. The inner ear, like the brain, is totally lacking in energy reserves. Its metabolism depends directly on the supply of oxygen and glucose from the blood supply. Alterations in glucose metabolism therefore have great potential for disturbing the workings of the inner ear. Because tinnitus is often defined as a subjective phenomenon, it is difficult to measure using objective tests. Although there is no specific cure for tinnitus, those affected can learn techniques to successfully manage their tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a problem for them.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a triphasic metacognitive formulation of problem drinking and its implications for treatment are presented together with a summary of the evidence consistent with this approach. In the triphasic formulation during the pre‐alcohol use phase, alcohol‐related triggers, in the form of cravings, images, memories or thoughts, activate positive metacognitive beliefs about extended thinking, which lead to desire thinking, rumination and worry or their combination. The activation of the latter brings to an escalation of cravings and negative affect, strengthening negative metacognitive beliefs about the need to control thoughts and enhancing the likelihood of alcohol use. In the alcohol use phase, positive metacognitive beliefs about alcohol use and a reduction in metacognitive monitoring contribute to dysregulation in alcohol use. Over the course of time and as the drinking problem escalates in severity, negative metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability of alcohol use and alcohol‐related thoughts emerge, contributing to the perseveration of dysregulated alcohol use. In the post‐alcohol use phase following the activation of positive metacognitive beliefs about post‐event rumination, the affective, cognitive and physiological consequences of dysregulated alcohol use become the subject of rumination. This, in turn, leads to a paradoxical increase in negative affect and alcohol‐related thoughts, together with the strengthening of negative metacognitive beliefs about such thoughts. Intermittent attempts to suppress alcohol‐related thoughts increase the likelihood of returning to use alcohol as a means of achieving self‐regulation. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

Medical treatments (eg. cerumen removal, lens replacement), and ‘;instant’ therapies (eg. slowed speech, close proximity) may improve communication in the short term. In serious cases, specialist therapists may need to implement longer‐term intervention (eg. environmental control, perceptual aids, communication training). Recurrent communication breakdown can have devastating consequences for interpersonal relationships and psychosocial well‐being. Some older people with severe sensory impairment are able to interact only with skilled communication partners. This condition of age‐related communicative dependence on others has major implications for health care and professional education.",

Its toxicity is reported with both acute sudden exposure and gradual exposure. The authors report a case of methyl iodide toxicity occurring in a 47 year-old male with sudden exposure to this chemical. He presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms primarily slurring of speech, ataxia followed by delusion and hallucinations which resolved within 2 weeks with parenteral thiamine and an antipsychotic. Symptoms reappeared after a re-exposure, this time with more prominent psychiatric symptoms which were late to resolve (4 weeks) with similar treatment. Neuroimaging revealed hyperintensities in posterior regions of the brain which resolved after 4 weeks. The patient had prominent neurocognitive deficits which were persistent. The case highlights the rare chemical toxicity with neuropsychiatric manifestations with persistent neurocognitive symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction or substance-use disorder is a chronically relapsing disorder that progresses through binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect and preoccupation/anticipation stages. These stages represent diverse neurobiological mechanisms that are differentially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive drug use and from positive to negative reinforcement. The progression from recreational to compulsive substance use is associated with downregulation of the brain reward systems and upregulation of the brain stress systems. Individual differences in the neurobiological systems that underlie the processing of reward, incentive salience, habits, stress, pain, and executive function may explain (i) the vulnerability to substance-use disorder; (ii) the diversity of emotional, motivational, and cognitive profiles of individuals with substance-use disorders; and (iii) heterogeneous responses to cognitive and pharmacological treatments. Characterization of the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie individual differences in addiction-like behaviors is the key to understanding the mechanisms of addiction and development of personalized pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Background COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread psychosocial distress. In addition to pandemic associated psychological distress, there is increasing evidence to suggest direct effects of the COVID- 19 virus itself and the subsequent host immunologic response on Central Nervous System manifesting in the form of wide range of neuropsychiatric complications in both acute and post recovery phase. Neuropsychiatric manifestations The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as “long Covid,” is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. Psychoneuroimmunology of COVID-19 Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. Role of psychiatrist Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. Management The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. Conclusion Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term. Although the mechanisms to neuropsychiatric complications is still under study, the better understanding will not only augment screening of at-risk individuals but also help in prevention and management of these neuropsychiatric complications.",

It is a matter of common experience for one doing extensive intranasal surgery to be confronted by a so-called cocaine reaction, and this is especially true when using flake anesthesia. Often people are encountered who exhibit an idiosyncrasy to the drug, and who, consequently, are susceptible even to minute amounts. The intoxication is manifested usually by loquacity, restlessness, tremor and cardiac palpitation. There is also present a peculiar writhing of the tongue and the face. This hyperactivity of the lingual and facial musculature may become so troublesome as to interfere seriously with the necessary intranasal manipulations. Not rarely, the symptoms of mild intoxication noted in the foregoing may progress to those associated with profound depression, combined with cold clammy sweat, pallor and even syncope which",

It is demonstrated by the cases reported, that upon the sudden death of a juvenile increased consideration must also be given to a possible connection between death and drug use. First and foremost the drug used is susceptible of leading to death by way of an intoxication due to too large a dosage or owing to oversensitiveness. Far advanced putrefaction, the combined effects of several drugs including alcohol, the difficulty in furnishing chemical proof of the presence of hashish and LSD in body-fluids and organs can make it nearly impossible to clarify the cause of death. Only what has been related in respect of the manner of living and drug use by members of the family, mates and friends makes the connection between death and drug use appear quite likely. The indirect connection between drug use and the juvenile's death is to be accepted if it comes to the accident under the influence of drugs - be it under the impression of invulnerability or omnipotence or in a state of hallucinations. Depressions under the influence of drugs are also susceptible of resulting in real suicidal actions.

It does not cover specific drug therapies for alcoholism (aversion, chemical restraint, dissuasion), nor nonspecific drug therapies (vitamins, magnesium) the interest and limits of which are well known. All types of psychotropic drugs, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants, thymoregulators, neuroleptics, and beta-blockers are used, with two main indications: (a) to prevent or to treat the withdrawal syndrome and (b) to diminish the psychopathological factors related to alcoholism (anxiety or depression, for example), in order to avoid pathological recourse to alcohol. Recently, attempts have been made to decrease the craving for alcohol in humans after detoxification. Although psychotropic drugs are often used in the management of alcoholics, such management is not limited to them, but also includes psychotherapy and social measures.",

Addiction or dependence are terms used to describe persistent psychoactive drug use, but these terms also can be applied to other forms of repetitive behaviors. Many of these repetitive behaviors are regulated by specific regions of the brain that are influenced by drugs. Consequently, drug addiction may involve effects on systems that are involved in regulating forms of addiction that are necessary for the maintenance of life. Addictions also seem to be regulated by genetic factors. Because drug addiction may influence the activities of systems that evolved to regulate behaviors necessary to survive (ie, eating and drinking) and because individuals may differ in addict-ability for a given drug caused by genetic reasons, addiction should be considered as a disease and therapy should be developed with this concept in mind.",

Apathy is a state characterized by a simultaneous decrease in the behavioral, cognitive and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior due to loss of motivation [15]. Behavioral changes lie in a declining everyday problem-solving effectiveness at home or work. Cognitive changes result in reduced cognitive functioning and a lack of plans and life strategies. Emotional changes manifest in a decrease in affective response to events that previously elicited either a positive or negative emotional response. Diagnostic criteria, or the 'gold standard' for apathy, identify behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social symptoms of apathy that cause clinically significant disorders in personal, social, professional, or other important areas of life. The differential diagnosis of apathy involves its clinical distinction from syndromes such as delirium, dementia, depression, abulia, akinesia, and demoralization. The review can be useful for psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and all practitioners who interact with people at risk of developing apathetic states.",

This review article aims to address the specific research studies and case reports that relate caffeine to psychiatric symptoms. Caffeine can cause anxiety symptoms in normal individuals, especially in vulnerable patients, like those with pre-existing anxiety disorders. Caffeine use is also associated with symptoms of depression due to either a self-medication theory, or a theory that caffeine itself causes changes in mood. Psychosis can be induced in normal individuals ingesting caffeine at toxic doses, and psychotic symptoms can also be worsened in schizophrenic patients using caffeine. Sleep and symptoms of ADHD may be altered by caffeine as well. Prevention of caffeine-induced psychiatric symptoms is possible by recognizing, educating, and treating patients using a tapering approach.",

      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

      "abstract": "Clozapine is a second generation antipsychotic indicated for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). TRS is schizophrenia that does not respond fully to conventional schizophrenia treatments, including first-line antipsychotics. According to the Canadian Schizophrenia Guidelines (CSG), treatment-resistance is indicated after failure of two antipsychotics, although definitions of TRS vary among clinical trials. It has been estimated that in patients receiving conventional pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia, 50% of these patients do not respond adequately to prescribed pharmacotherapy (30% may exhibit a partial response, and 20% may exhibit no response).Clozapine is associated with a variety of side-effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, tachycardia (high resting heart rate), constipation, weight gain, lowered white blood cell count, and excess saliva production. Serious side effects include myocarditis, pericarditis, neutropenia, cardiomyopathy, and death. Some side effects, such as myocarditis, can occur relatively quickly (within two weeks) after initiation of the medication.Clozapine must be initiated at a low dose and titrated up to the therapeutic dose over time to avoid side effects. Therapeutic doses can range from 200 mg to 450 mg per day and are generally not exceeding 900 mg per day (although doses of more than 900 mg per day are possible).– Initiation of clozapine may start as low as 12.5 mg per day, titrating upwards until individual effectiveness is seen (for example, resolution of psychosis symptoms).,Initiation on clozapine requires strict monitoring protocols to ensure compliance and to address the side effects associated with the medication. For example, in the United States, the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy requires all prescribers and pharmacies to be certified in order to prescribe or dispense clozapine. Part of the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program includes regular absolute neutrophil counts for patients on clozapine to monitor for neutropenia. In Canada, after reintroduction of clozapine in 1991 (after removal from the market in 1975 because of reported infections due to low white blood cell counts), patients were required to join a patient registry program (e.g., Sandoz Clozapine Risk Management Program1) to monitor white blood cell counts. When switching to a new brand of clozapine, patients must join the manufacturer-specific registry upon changing medications.Guidelines outlining appropriate use of clozapine are important to ensure timely, safe, and suitable prescribing of clozapine in a variety of settings. The objective of the current review is to summarize clinical effectiveness of clozapine during the initiation phase of treatment in adult patients with schizophrenia and summarize recommendations regarding monitoring of adult patients during this initiation phase.",

      "title": "Neurotensin and Alcohol Use Disorders: Towards a Pharmacological Treatment",
      "abstract": "Harmful alcohol use is responsible for a group of disorders collectively named alcohol use disorders (AUDs), according to the DSM-5 classification. The damage induced by alcohol depends on the amount, time, and consumption patterns (continuous and heavy episodic drinking). It affects individual global well-being and social and familial environments with variable impact. Alcohol addiction manifests with different degrees of organ and mental health detriment for the individual, exhibiting two main traits: compulsive drinking and negative emotional states occurring at withdrawal, frequently causing relapse episodes. Numerous individual and living conditions, including the concomitant use of other psychoactive substances, lie in the complexity of AUD. Ethanol and its metabolites directly impact the tissues and may cause local damage or alter the homeostasis of brain neurotransmission, immunity scaffolding, or cell repair biochemical pathways. Brain modulator and neurotransmitter-assembled neurocircuitries govern reward, reinforcement, social interaction, and consumption of alcohol behaviors in an intertwined manner. Experimental evidence supports the participation of neurotensin (NT) in preclinical models of alcohol addiction. For example, NT neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala projecting to the parabrachial nucleus strengthen alcohol consumption and preference. In addition, the levels of NT in the frontal cortex were found to be lower in rats bred to prefer alcohol to water in a free alcohol–water choice compared to wild-type animals. NT receptors 1 and 2 seem to be involved in alcohol consumption and alcohol effects in several models of knockout mice. This review aims to present an updated picture of the role of NT systems in alcohol addiction and the possible use of nonpeptide ligands modulating the activity of the NT system, applied to experimental animal models of harmful drinking behavior mimicking alcohol addiction leading to health ruin in humans.",

      "title": "[Dependence and obsession].",
      "abstract": "Alcoholism, especially the urge to drink and relapse from abstinence, is deeply associated with obsession. And also alcoholics on abstinent 10 years or more are still higher on the obsessive-compulsive symptom dimension more than the depression and interpersonal sensitivity. Obsession was introduced by Kraepelin in 1915 and has been studied extensively since. When a person with obsession becomes exhausted with chronic rumination accompanied suspicion, he or she is driven to impulsive acts like alcoholics, and develops a personality disorder that displays persistent abnormal activities. Impulsive-compulsive spectrum characterizes by dimensions of risk-aversive/risk-seeking and harm-avoidant/harm- minimizing behaviors. Disorders on the compulsive end of the spectrum include obsessive-compulsive disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia nervosa an depersonalization. Mixed compulsive and impulsive disorders include Tourette's disorder, trichotillomania, pathologic gambling, sexual compulsions and alcoholism. Disorders on the impulsive end of the spectrum include borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Using 123I-IMP SPECT, regional cerebral blood flow significantly decreased in alcoholics without Korsakoff sign (WAIS FIQ 90 or over) than alcoholics with Korsakoff signs (WAIS FIQ 89 or under) and control on the frontal lobe and thalamus. Recent model of obsessive-compulsive pathophysiology demonstrating that cortical regions have different effects on the direct and indirect pathways, indicates that the the different effects of serotonergic agents in the cortex alone could result in a change in balance between the direct versus indirect basal ganglia pathway. This article reviews alcoholism and obsession, ego dystonic and ego syntonic, approach-avoidance conflict, a recent biological approach to alcoholics and a spectrum for obsession.",

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibiity seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleo-vestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "abstract": "Principles of benzodiazepine selection are outlined for various psychiatric indications and diverse populations (the elderly, and drug and alcohol abusers). Benzodiazepines are still among the most commonly used classes of medications, and they differ in their pharmacodynamic properties. They have varied uses as monotherapy or as adjunctive medication because of their efficacy in the treatment of conditions involving a dysfunction of the GABAergic system or where neuronal inhibition is required. In multiple therapy, benzodiazepines augment the efficacy of other drugs such as lithium in mania, antipsychotics in psychotic agitation and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in panic disorder. Benzodiazepines can produce dependence and tolerance in most patients; predisposed individuals are at greater risk. Short- and intermediate-beta half-life compounds carry a greater risk of rebound and withdrawal reactions, and drug dependence than long acting agents. Adverse effects include sedation, psychomotor and cognitive impairment, memory loss, potentiation of other central nervous system depressants and treatment-emergent depression. Drug potency and beta elimination half-life are reviewed and compared as pharmacokinetic variables.",

      "title": "[Abnormal behavior and adaptation problems in dogs and cats and their pharmacologic control].",
      "abstract": "Small animal practitioners are increasingly confronted with patients showing adaptation related problems (ARP) which are expressed as disturbed or abnormal behavior (DAB). As a result, practitioners are asked increasingly to euthanize animals which seemingly cannot be socialized. In healthy dogs and cats, three main causes for DAB can be detected: refusal of obedience because of the drive for dominance; anxiety and frustration; and geriatric DAB. Increasingly, disease conditions not readily diagnosed can cause DAB, especially hypothyroidism. Influencing and contributing factors to DAB are breed, sex, experiences as a puppy, behavior of owners, changes in the pet's environment. ARPs may also cause disturbances in the condition of skin and fur, e.g. atopic dermatitis, pruritus sine materia, lick granuloma, and of the intestinal organs (vomiting, irritated bowel syndrome) and may result in an immune deficiency. Therapeutic approaches include behavioral therapy, surgical or hormonal castration with progestins or antiandrogens, substitution with thyroxin in cases with hypothyroidism, and/or the use of psychopharmaca, most prominently of modern antidepressiva like amitriptyline; buspirone; clomipramine and fluoxetine, but also of selegiline, a mono-aminoxydase inhibitor. These compounds, among other effects, are elevating prolactin levels. This seems to allow to formulate a working hypothesis: in the canine species, prolactin is obviously a hormone enabling socialization; hence all drugs which safely cause an increase in prolactin production might be suitable to manage or control ARPs and DAB in the dog, but also in the cat. Higher levels of prolactin than those required for socialization, as seen in nursing bitches or some clinically overt cases of pseudopregnancy, may cause maternal aggression and can be controlled with prolactin inhibitors, if needed.",

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly. Furthermore, prevalence and incidence, definition and causes of voice disorders in elderly are shown by presenting results of the recent researches. This paper also describes diagnostic procedures and current treatments for voice disorders in elderly and addresses its efficiency.",

Importantly, there are elements of addiction that emerge during the addiction trajectory (e.g. liking, wanting, habit, craving) that are a reflection of key changes in the homeostasis of brain networks that control different behaviours. These homeostatic changes ultimately lead to 1) a decreased sensitivity for natural rewards, 2) an enhanced sensitivity for conditioned substance cues and the expectation of substance use rewards, 3) a weakened control over substance use urges and substance-taking behaviour, and 4) substance tolerance and withdrawal. Significantly, these changes are targets for pharmacological and psychological treatment interventions in addiction.",

Much is unknown about the pathophysiology, but dysfunction of cortico-cortical modulation and a \"top-down modulation\" of the basal ganglia resulting from a deficiency of GABA in the cerebral cortex, resulting in motor dysfunction and glutamate hyperactivity and dopamine hypoactivity at the D2 receptor have been proposed. Benzodiazepines, especially Lorazepam, are reportedly effective, but reports of other benzodiazepines, Zopiclone and trials of mood stabilisers are documented. Electroconvulsive therapy is the suggested next line of action in case benzodiazepine fail, while the use of antipsychotic in catatonia is inconclusive. We present a case series of catatonia in 1) acute on chronic renal failure, complicated with uraemic encephalopathy and 2) severe depressive disorder with psychotic features.

Case presentation: A 36-year-old female patient presented to the emergency room with a primary concern and symptoms consistent with panic disorder, including experiencing a sense of losing control or impending death, chest pain, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, excessive perspiration, trembling, and dizziness. The patient experienced significant periods of anxiety between episodes, preoccupied with the anticipation of the next occurrence. Each episode had a duration of roughly 15 minutes. The patient refutes any history of alcohol or drug misuse, and her sole medical condition is hypothyroidism. Subsequently, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the thyroid profile and make a referral to an internal medicine specialist for collaborative treatment. We treated the patient with a combination of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine 20 mg/day and a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Conclusion: Repeated episodes of intense panic attacks, accompanied by feelings of anxiety and observable alterations in behavior, distinguish panic disorder as a medical illness. The treatment involves the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antidepressants, and cognitive behavioral therapy.",

      "abstract": "Spasticity is a source of disability for the hemiplegic patient. It leads to various disorders influencing the quality of gait: at the lower limb varus equinus foot deformity, toe-claw and/or hip adduction with adductors spasticity. At the upper limb, flexion deformity of the wrist and the hand makes grasp and grip ineffective and spasticity of the Pectoralis Major muscle is considered as a main cause of sympathetic dystrophy. Neurolysis with alcohol injection in the nerve trunk or at the motor point destroys the gamma fibers and reduces spasticity, without impairing motor command. The effects on spasticity, motricity, and deformity of 33 chemical neurolysis with alcohol are analysed with a six months follow-up (27 hemiplegic patients, 28 to 62 years old, mean = 54.5). The authors have used 60% alcohol concentration. Sciatic nerve injection significantly reduces triceps spasticity (7/11), improves the range motion of the ankle, and allows the patient to take off the ankle device. Those fair results are still present at the fourth month after injection. Similar results are reported after injection of the obturator nerve for hip adduction deformity (2/3), median nerve injection for wrist and hand deformity (6/6). Pectoralis Major injection in the motor point is effective for 10 of the 13 cases, preventing sympathetic reflex dystrophy or contributing to its dramatic improvement.",

      "title": "Some implications of conditioning theory for problems of drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Viewing the development of drug cults as a conditioning process, examples are given of specific effects of alcohol, barbiturates, opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, marihuana, LSD and other psychotomimetic drugs that can reinforce continued use of the drug in question through facilitation of specific patterns of behavior that serve to gratify specific biological and socio-culturally generated human needs. It is hypothesized that, through repeated temporal contiguity between such primary reinforcement and the performance of rituals prescribed by those who are already members of the drug cult, novitiates eventually learn to perceive the magical drug-effects defined by the cult and to experience them even without benefit of the drug when the rituals are performed (secondary reinforcement), thereby becoming a new, full-fledged member of the cult. It is suggested that the maintenance of secondarily reinforced behavior in the absence of further programmed reinforcement by the drug is a consequence of previous classical conditioning of primary drug effects and possibly, of interoceptive conditioning. Some therapeutic applications of conditioning theory are indicated, with special reference to the possible use of specific drug antagonists to facilitate extinction of drug-seeking behavior. Expansion of basic psychopharmacological research as well as of educational and social ameliorative efforts are stressed as desiderata for eventual control of the problem of drug abuse.",

One of the common ways to cope with grief is alcohol or substance intake. The course and resolution of grief vary depending upon many factors. Hypnotherapy has been useful and effective in addressing grief reactions as well as associated manifestation, such as sleep problems, depressive features, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It might be a good choice of treatment while dealing with patients having underlying issues or maladaptive coping mechanisms. This is a single case study design hypothesized to indicate maladaptive coping of increased alcohol consumption to deal with the death of a young son. The case had been treated as alcohol dependent syndrome with multiple hospitalizations without addressing underlying grief. The treatment approach was changed, and grief was addressed using hypnotherapy. Clinical hypnotherapy helped address grief and facilitated the index case to accept the loss. This resulted in minimizing hospitalizations, abstinence and improved day-to-day functioning along with the use of adaptive mechanisms to cope with the loss. Clinical hypnotherapy is an effective intervention to deal with underlying conflicts or issues that may not be addressed directly in a therapy setting.",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of drug and substance abuse has become a contemporary social problem among youth. Alarmingly, large number of youth in Nigeria becomes involved up to the extent of some of them becoming dependents thereby affecting their quality of life. Understanding the nature of this phenomenon is related to operationalizing basic concepts such as use, misuse and abuse. The boundaries that separate these concepts have remained ambiguous and debatable, varying from drug/substance to drug/substance, user to user. Given the broad typology and varied nature of what is consumed and abused today, some of the drugs/substances put users to sleep while some wake them up. They are typically grouped as – depressants, hallucinogens, narcotics, over-the-counter drugs, prescription drugs, sedatives, stimulants, synthetic drugs, solvents/inhalants and tranquilizers. The reasons for abusing drugs/substances and the implications are so complex involving many issues, some of which are situated around the individual; external to the individual or are situated within the society or the environment. There is no single theory of drug/substance abuse, the propositions of scholars in respect of socio-psychological, trait, bio-social, learning, availability, relative deprivation, social disorganization, gateway/stepping-stone, strain and anomie theories are instructive. No society has been spared from the devastating havoc caused by drug/substance abuse especially the implications on socio-economic and political development. The adverse consequences could be social, economic, political, physical, psychological, medical and physiological, affecting users, immediate families and the society. Government, communities, using educators, should continue with the efforts on raising awareness about drugs/substances and their effects.",

      "title": "Considerations on third generation antihistamines",
      "abstract": "For several months now, the term ‘third generation of antihistamines’ has emerged spontaneously from the medical literature. These attempts at definition, which vary greatly, create confusion both for the health professionals and the lay public. This is of considerable concern for the scientific community involved in allergy, mainly due to the lack of consensus. One definition refers to the active metabolites of new second generation drugs as the basis for a third one [1,2]. Others are focused on certain specific properties: no electrocardiogram (ECG) effects [3], rapid onset of action [4] or no drug interactions [3]. First generation antihistamines were defined by their H1 receptor blocking power and despite pronounced unwanted side-effects are still often used mainly in over-the-counter (OTC) products, alone or in combination with other drugs. The second generation antihistamines are said to be ‘non-sedating H1 blockers’ due to the lack of penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Compared to the first generation, they are known for their high potency and minimal central nervous system (CNS) effects. Numerous compounds have been created responding to their own pharmacokinetics. Some of them undergo extensive metabolism, others do not. Cardiotoxic effects emerged with some second generation antihistamines and most of the new compounds exhibit properties on systems other than H1 receptors, i.e. anti-inflammatory properties. Certainly, the second generation manifests a great diversity. Which criteria should drugs have to fulfil to be labelled as third generation antihistamine? This is obviously for the scientific community to answer. To pave the way for the elaboration of a consensual definition and with the support of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology, a Consensus Group on New Generation Antihistamines (CONGA) has been set up. This Group is led by Professor S. T. Holgate (UK) and includes Professor G. W. Canonica (Italy), Dr G. Scadding (UK), Professor F. Estelle R. Simons (Canada), Professor M. Tharp (USA), Professor H. Timmerman (the Netherlands) and Professor K. Yanai (Japan), so that there will be a multidisciplinary input. This exercise is closely linked to the Southampton Workshop ‘Antihistamines: Back to the Future’[5] and should appear as a necessary sequel after a 4-year evolution of the antihistamine class. The Consensus Group met for the first time at the University of Leuven (Belgium), June 11–12, 2001, and made clear the necessity to clarify the theme with the help of international experts representing the different fields involved in allergy. Respecting a strictly academic approach, the Consensus Group agreed on the following aims: (a) to review in depth the present status of the term ‘third generation antihistamines’, (b) to analyse the potential criteria that drugs should fulfil to be labelled as third generation, (c) to find gaps and to bridge them with the back-up of expert networking, and (d) to issue a consensual statement endorsed by the scientific community.",

      "title": "Tolerance and withdrawal symptoms may not be helpful to enhance understanding of behavioural addictions",
      "abstract": "The importance attached to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms in the conceptualization of addiction reflects the prominence of theories that posit neuroadaptation to the presence of a drug [1], and suggest that drug use persists because of negative reinforcement, i.e. as an effort to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms [2]. Given that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms do not always occur in addiction, they have not been included in the recent general definitions of addiction [3–5]. However, these phenomena are often incorporated into the conceptualization of behavioural addictions. For example, one model [6] postulates that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms are mandatory for any behaviour to be considered addictive. In behavioural addictions, tolerance is usually defined in a way that superficially resembles its counterpart in substance addictions, i.e. dose escalation to achieve the same initial effect. Thus, tolerance is portrayed as an increase in various aspects of the activity (frequency, intensity, duration, time spent, money spent) to achieve the desired effect, satisfaction or excitement. Occasionally, it is described as a need for the latest or more powerful equipment (e.g. mobile phones, computers, software) to produce the desired effect or excitement [7,8]. The diagnostic criteria for internet gaming disorder [9] do not state the purpose of an increase in activity engagement, implying that any such increase denotes tolerance. Nevertheless, increased activity engagement and a need for better equipment in behavioural addictions do not necessarily reflect tolerance [10,11], which underscores the importance of assessing the contextual aspects of these phenomena. Withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions have usually been described as emotional states (irritability, restlessness, anger, moodiness, sadness, guilt, anxiety, feeling tense) that occur when activity engagement is thwarted. In internet gaming disorder, withdrawal symptoms can be easily mistaken for reactions to an externally imposed gaming deprivation or for craving for gaming [12]. There have been no reports of severe physical withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions [13], and a few studies reporting physical withdrawal symptoms in pathological gambling [14,15] had significant methodological shortcomings. Withdrawal states occurring upon abrupt drug cessation comprise both physical and emotional symptoms, with the latter hypothesized to contribute more to the motivation to continue using drugs because of the short-lasting effects of the former [2]. In pathological gambling, however, emotional withdrawal symptoms, as well as tolerance, were not found to play an important role in maintaining this behavioural addiction [16]. ‘Borrowing’ tolerance and withdrawal from substance addictions might have been driven by a need to ‘legitimize’ behavioural addictions. This was unnecessary, because these phenomena and theories suggesting that they are important for addiction have not been able to account fully for either type of addiction [5]. The alternative is to conceptualize behavioural addictions via specific factors that explain more clearly attachment to the particular activity [17] and maintenance of addictive behaviour. In pathological gambling, these factors were identified as the negative feelings associated with gambling losses, shortage of money and the need to be secretive about gambling [16]. The task is to ascertain factors that provide an adequate account for each behavioural addiction. None.",

      "abstract": "Stereotyped behaviour can be produced in animals both by stimulant drugs (amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, etc.) and by a restricted cage environment. Strong evidence indicates that the effect of stimulant drugs is mediated through a primary effect on brain dopamine, and further knowledge is now being acquired through studies on dopamine receptors, tolerance and reverse tolerance to amphetamines and the neural connections of dopaminergic sub-systems with other sub-systems in the brain. The forms of stereotypy induced by a restricted cage environment have been compared with other effects of this type of environment on behaviour and general health. This has led to a hypothesis that stereotyped behaviour may function as a survival (or defence) strategy in an unfavourable milieu. Some evidence indicates that brain dopamine is also involved in the mediation of stereotyped behaviour induced by the environment. The relevance of these results in clinical psychiatry is discussed. Stereotypy (and related disintegrated behaviour) is a well known feature of several mental diseases.",

      "title": "SUPPRESSION OF TENEURIN-4 IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS ALLEVIATES METHAMPHETAMINE-INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE AND BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS IN MICE",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background According to the World Drug Report 2022 from United Nations, amphetamine-type stimulants take third place in worldwide drug addiction, primary methamphetamine (METH) [1]. And over 30,0000 people died from drug overdoses induced by stimulants combined with other drugs [2]. METH is recognized as a widely distributed psychostimulant with a strong addictive potential that impacts the central nervous system and body health [3]. METH predominantly exerts its influence on the limbic system through the stimulation of the release of various neurotransmitters, including dopamine, within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical element of the brain's reward circuitry. Both short-term and prolonged METH use can result in lasting physical and mental health complications, some of which may endure indefinitely. Over the last decades, significant social problems associated with METH have gotten worse over the past few decades, especially after COVID-19 [1, 2]. Aim &amp; Objectives Our previous data revealed several genes associated with METH, including Odz4 gene. The Odz4 gene encodes teneurin-4 (TENM4) protein which belongs to one subtype of type II transmembrane teneurin proteins (TENM1-4) [4]. Genetic studies have indicated a correlation between teneurin proteins and developmental issues, neurological disorders, and drug residence [5]. Recently, some clinical research found that the Odz4 gene has an abnormal mutant in the brain of patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia [6, 7]. Based on the aforementioned research, it is suggested that TENM4 might play a role in the progress of drug addiction. Here we investigated the performance of TENM4 knockdown in METH-induced dopamine release of NAc shell and behavior alterations in mice. Method We administered METH or saline subcutaneously to mice for six consecutive days. Two hours after the final injection of METH, we sacrificed all mice and preserved them under 80°. Then we investigated the changes in Odz4 mRNA and protein levels using RT-qPCR and WB, respectively. Subsequently, we injected AAV-carrying Odz4-targeting gRNA involved CRISPR-Cas system into the NAc After four weeks of the injection, we assessed the time response of dopamine in NAc by in vivo microdialysis and alteration of conditioned place preference induced by METH. Results We found a significant increase in Odz4 mRNA and TENM4 protein levels in the NAc region after continued METH administration. We confirmed the knockdown effect by AAV injection of the NAc of mice. The TENM4 knockdown exhibited an attenuated response of dopamine and place preference induced by METH. Discussion and Conclusion These results indicate the association between TENM4 and the pharmacological effects of METH in NAc region of mice. However, addiction behaviors affected by the knockdown of TENM4 and its specific mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear and require further investigation.

      "title": "Secondary bruxism: A valid diagnosis or just a coincidental finding of additional masticatory muscle activity? A narrative review of literature",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Bruxism is defined as a repetitive masticatory muscle activity that can manifest it upon awakening (awake bruxism‐AB) or during sleep (sleep bruxism‐SB). Some forms of both, AB and SB can be associated to many other coexistent factors, considered of risk for the initiation and maintenance of the bruxism. Although controversial, the term ‘secondary bruxism’ has frequently been used to label these cases. The absence of an adequate definition of bruxism, the non‐distinction between the circadian manifestations and the report of many different measurement techniques, however, are important factors to be considered when judging the literature findings. The use (and abuse) of drugs, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and psychoactive substances, the presence of respiratory disorders during sleep, gastroesophageal reflux disorders and movement, neurological and psychiatric disorders are among these factors. The scarcity of controlled studies and the complexity and interactions among all aforementioned factors, unfortunately, does not allow to establish any causality or temporal association with SB and AB. The supposition that variables are related depends on different parameters, not clearly demonstrated in the available studies. Objectives This narrative review aims at providing oral health care professionals with an update on the co‐risk factors and disorders possibly associated with bruxism. In addition, the authors discuss the appropriateness of the term ‘secondary bruxism’ as a valid diagnostic category based on the available evidence. Conclusion The absence of an adequate definition of bruxism, the non‐distinction between the circadian manifestations and the report of many different measurement techniques found in many studies preclude any solid and convincing conclusion on the existence of the ‘secondary’ bruxism.",

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Alcoholic hallucinosis is a well-known phenomenon consisting of vivid auditory hallucinations that begin immediately following the reduction or cessation of alcohol consumption.1 The estimated prevalence of alcohol hallucinosis is 7.4% among alcohol-dependent inpatients,2 a subset of whom will develop chronic hallucinations that resemble paranoid schizophrenia.3 Here, we present a case of chronic alcohol hallucinosis previously diagnosed and treated as schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A, a 32-year-old man, was admitted recently to the inpatient psychiatry ward after several visits to the outpatient psychiatry service.\r\n\r\nMr A complained of auditory pseudohallucinations that began in adolescence. These were described as 3 adult male voices with origin inside the head that are ego-dystonic and frequently attempt to persuade him to hurt himself. His hallucinatory experiences were identified during an inpatient stay for alcohol rehabilitation about 5 years earlier at another center. At the time of discharge, he was given the diagnosis of schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) and was started on clozapine treatment. Mr A began drinking alcohol to excess at the age of 14 years, with self-report ranging from 7 to 48 standard drinks per day. Mr A smokes tobacco daily and cannabis occasionally and has been a heavy user of several other substances. Previously known treated diseases were unremarkable and stable. Mr A’s family history is significant for psychiatric illness, including mood disorders, substance use disorders, and suicide. There was no evidence of thought disorder.\r\n\r\nResults of physical examination and broad laboratory screens were unremarkable. Findings of noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging were similarly unremarkable. Outcomes of neuropsychological testing were remarkable for poor verbal memory, both immediate and delayed. A previous psychological report was obtained and noted third- to fifth-grade capabilities in reading, spelling, mathematics, and verbal comprehension as well as strong visuospatial ability.\r\n\r\nClozapine therapy was ceased by slow taper. Mr A was monitored closely but was unable to notice any subjective changes. The nursing and medical staff were similarly unable to note any objective changes. Mr A was discharged 16 days following the cessation of clozapine therapy. He will be assessed for a therapeutic trial of a newer neuroleptic agent such as risperidone or lurasidone and anticraving medications such as acamprosate.\r\n\r\nHere, we present a unique case of what we believe to be persistent alcoholic hallucinosis occurring for many years. Our patient was initially diagnosed with schizophrenia; however, upon further inspection, we do not believe this to be the case. He has insight into his illness and has no evidence of thought disorder or negative symptoms, and his illness has not run the typical course of schizophrenia. Furthermore, he lacks the characteristic memory loss and confabulation typical of Korsakoff’s psychosis. Misdiagnosis resulted in exposing the patient to the risks of superfluous pharmacotherapy, in this case, metabolic syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, and blood dyscrasia. We suggest that alcoholic hallucinosis should be suspected in patients who present with auditory hallucinations and significant alcohol use history and who are refractory to best-practice pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia.",

Anxiety sensitivityAnxiety sensitivity (AS) refers to individual differences in the fear of anxietyrelated sensations and the expectation that such sensations can have harmful consequences (Reiss, 1997;Reiss & McNally, 1985).Just as some people are afraid of spiders, some individuals fear the sensations that accompany anxiety.This construct AS can be measured with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) (Peterson & Reiss, 1992;Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986).AS has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders, specifically PD (Reiss, 1991).Besides AS, trait anxiety is also regarded as a vulnerability factor for the de- Chapter 2Reactivity to a 35% CO2 challenge in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with panic disorder Background: The effects of a 35% CO2 challenge were examined in healthy firstdegree relatives of panic disorder patients and in healthy control subjects matched for age and gender.Methods: One single inhalation of a 35% CO2 / 65% O2 challenge was administered to 50 first-degree relatives of panic disorder patients and 50 control subjects.Results: The first-degree relatives were more reactive to the 35% CO2 challenge than the control subjects.Conclusions: These findings indicate that being a member of a family with a panic disorder patient is, in itself, an important factor in CO2 hypersensitivity among subjects who have never experienced a panic attack.Both panic disorder patients and their first-degree relatives have a tendency to be more reactive to the CO2 challenge.van Beek, N., & Griez, E.

An unanticipated opportunity for King David to peep at Bathsheba led him to a train of Biblical woes and Nathan's rebuke. According to old lore, Tom's peeping at Lady Godiva led God to blind him. The stories of King David and Tom are presented as examples of “sinful,” not pathological, behavior. Neither story provides enough details to permit a diagnosis of voyeurism for either man. Voyeurism as a diagnosis came later. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), voyeurism requires more than isolated episodes of peeping. The DSM‐IV‐TR diagnosis of voyeurism has three criteria; (1) The patient must have recurrent sexual fantasies, urges, or acts of observing an unsuspecting person naked, in the process of undressing, or having sex; (2) The patient must have had these recurrent fantasies, urges, and acts for at least six months; and (3) Either the patient has engaged in peeping or, if not, is having personal or interpersonal difficulties as a result of voyeuristic interests.",

      "abstract": "• Ten (17%) of 58 patients with chronic viral hepatitis treated with a four- to 12-month course of recombinant human interferon alfa developed psychiatric side effects. The psychiatric side effects fell into three categories: an organic personality syndrome characterized by irritability and short temper; an organic affective syndrome marked by extreme emotional lability, depression, and tearfulness; and a delirium marked by clouding of consciousness, agitation, paranoia, and suicidal potential. These psychiatric side effects appeared after one to three months of therapy, usually improved within three to four days of decreasing the dose of interferon alfa, and invariably resolved once therapy was stopped. The organic personality and affective syndromes tended to occur in patients who received the highest dose of interferon alfa, who had relatively mild hepatitis, and who lost weight during interferon treatment. Delirium tended to occur in patients with severe hepatitis who had previous evidence of organic brain injury or dysfunction or previous drug and alcohol abuse. Failure to recognize these side effects quickly and to treat them with supportive therapy and modification of the dose of interferon alfa could result in limitation of therapy and serious personal and interpersonal consequences.

Pregabaline is likely to be abused for its positive psychological effects, e.g. euphoria. However, these effects are weak and not sustained during long-term use. Pregabaline is therefore likely to have a lower potential for abuse than benzodiazepines. In clinical studies, symptoms suggestive of physical dependence (e.g. insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhoea) have been observed in some patients after abrupt discontinuation of pregabaline. However, available documentation indicates that pregabaline is associated with less physical and psychological dependence than benzodiazepines.",

This carries the implication of potentially new or previously undereported drug interactions. A case report is presented in which a commonly used anticonvulsant drug, valproic acid, and a commonly used antidepressant, desipramine, interacted in such a manner as to cause potentially toxic serum concentrations of desipramine. This case demonstrates the important point that it is not simply the addition of one drug to another that may cause interaction, but the withdrawal of a particular drug which may then adversely impact the remaining drug regimen.",

Rather than postulate any single mechanism which might account for the phenomenon, two interpretations are contrasted which seem sharply opposed. First, posthypnotic amnesia may be seen as essentially like any other hypnotically suggested experience. It can be considered as an explicitly or implicitly administered posthypnotic suggestion. On the other hand amnesia can be viewed as a form of dissociation. One possible mechanism of such dissociation may be a basic difference of the structure of thought processes involved in hypnosis compared to those of normal waking experience. In this sense amnesia should occur independently of suggestion and be different in kind from most other hypnotic phenomena. The former mechanism may occur more frequently in experimental situations and the latter in clinical contexts.",

Many of the same effects are reported in normals after harmine and Nalline (other workers). unlike mescaline and LSD at usual dosage levels, the present psychotomimetics regularly produce drowsiness and sleep along with the aberrant mental effects. The resultant state is partly that of \"hypnagogic\" visual hallucinations or imagery. The results with increased dosage suggest that the basic effect of these agents is to produce an acute toxic reaction type. The difference between them and mescaline or LSD with respect to clouding of consciousness and certain aspects of the hallucinogenic response may be quantitative rather than qualitative. The indole nucleus is not necessary in the structure of psychotomimetics since Win-2299 and Nalline are non-indoles. The tertiary nitrogen grouping may contribute to certain aspects of psychotomimetic action.",

      "title": "Endocannabinoid system and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: a narrative update",
      "abstract": "Cannabis use has been increasing in the United States and throughout the world. It is derived from one of the earliest plants cultivated by humans – Cannabis sativa. Cannabis (also called marijuana) is the most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide. The cannabis plant has more than 400 chemicals, of which more than 100 cannabinoids (such as cannabigerol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol) have been identified. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays an essential role in the effects of cannabis on end organs. Although cannabis use has been reported for many decades, some of its unique adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, termed as cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), were noted recently. The legal status of cannabis in the United States has been rapidly changing from state to state. The incidence of CHS is expected to rise with rising access to cannabis in the United States. Furthermore, CHS is frequently underdiagnosed due to a lack of uniform criteria, subjective nature of symptoms, and overlap with cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS). Understanding the ECS and its role in biphasic response (proemetic and antiemetic) of CHS is critical to explain its pathophysiology. As the use of cannabis increases globally, awareness of CHS is warranted for early recognition and prompt treatment to avoid complications. We describe the putative mechanism of CHS with an overview of the clinical features in these patients. Furthermore, we highlight the differences between CHS and CVS with important differentials to consider. We provide a narrative update on the current evidence on CHS pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and identifying research gaps.",

Recent evidence shows that, apart from severe anterograde and retrograde memory deficits, Korsakoff's pathology can include pronounced emotional abnormalities and impairments in executive functioning (e.g., problem solving, cognitive flexibility, set shifting, and task monitoring). Neurological studies have consistently revealed lesions in diencephalic and prefrontal brain areas among KS patients. It is assumed that damage in mammillary regions and the thalamus are determinants of amnesic symptoms, whereas observed executive dysfunctions more likely result from damage in the prefrontal lobe. Future research will more closely examine the causes of brain changes in KS, discerning between the primary neurotoxic effects of alcohol consumption on the one hand, and the secondary effects of malnutrition and/or vitamin deficiencies on the other. A further topic of inquiry will concern symptom specificity in KS, alcohol-addiction, and alcohol-related dementia.",

      "abstract": "In fact alcohol is a toxic substance that has a direct effect on brain. Some of the most common mental disorders due to alcohol abuse are: Memory disorder: Hazardous amounts of alcohol may cause intoxication, impairment of memory so that the person who took a drunken accident may not remember the event. Periods of memory impairment in those with a history of alcohol addiction would also happen in binge drinkers. Memory impairment may happen all days or most part of the day. Depression: Depression may be caused by long term alcohol abuse. On the other hand, in some cases, depressed people have tendency towards abusing alcohol, but it may improve their symptoms. The depression that can lead to more alcohol abuse and alcohol abuse can lead to depression, so the exact sequence of two modes should be revealed. Suicide: Based on current evaluation, 6 to 20 percent of alcoholics committed suicide due to   harmful feature of alcohol. Evidence of suicidal behavior or intention to harm themselves is more prevalent than normal people in their age. Personality disorder: Personality disorder is one of the problems that often occur in large proportion of alcoholic people. It can interfere with their self-centered manner. Excessive alcohol abuse is rare but serious complication of pathological jealousy. Suspicion to partners is also very common among these people. Sexual Dysfunction: People who consume alcohol for a long period, often complain of sexual and erectile dysfunction and their ejaculation are usually delayed. Effects of alcohol on the nervous system or vascular disorders associated with excessive abuse of alcohol and sexual dysfunction in men may have been involved. Hallucination: Transient vision or hearing hallucinations are seen in some abusers. Even in the rare disorder called alcoholic hallucinations, severe threatening voices is usually heard. Some patients hear loud voices and others are also experienced violence in these sounds. These people are delusional about the possibility of the harm and injury.",

These disorders can appear without a context of histrionic personality. The evolution of hysterical disorders during life is not well known. First of all, because the nosographic systems are not constant and, secondly, because the disorders themselves can vary when observed at different times. The aging subject is exposed to an increasing symptomatology or conversely, to an improvement due to the waekening of the narcissism. It is also possible that a continuum could be established from hysterical symptoms in the adulthood to delusions or hallucinations in the elderly. The relation with the old hysteric subject must be marked by empathy and by the conviction that improvement will only lead back to a basal symptomatology.",

Furthermore, chronic diseases, chronic pain symptoms, addiction problems as well as recent, psychologically burdening events increase the risk for a depression. If anamnesis or clinical investigation are suggestive for a depression, the patient should be explored systematically with respect to his symptoms. Main symptoms of a depression are depressed mood, loss of enthusiasm and joyfulness as well as depressed motivation and increased fatigability. Further common symptoms are reduced self-confidence, unfounded self-accusations, suicidal thoughts, reduced ability to concentrate, hyperagitation or psychomotor restriction, sleeping disorders as well as loss of appetite. Since depression can be positively influenced by antidepressive drugs or suitable psychotherapeutic methods, early diagnosis by the physician is of decisive importance.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A growing family of medications is used for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder. These medications fall into two broad categories according to likely mechanisms of action. Within the categories, specific drugs may vary in their efficacy for different phases of the disorder. The first category, including lithium, anticonvulsants, and some novel treatments, appears to have mechanisms related to intracellular second messengers. These medications have more pronounced antimanic than antidepressant effects, except for lamotrigine, which has antidepressant effects without precipitating mania. The second group of mood stabilizers is the atypical antipsychotics, which act through dopamine and other monoamines. Olanzapine and in all likelihood other drugs in the class possess marked, acute antimanic properties and possible antidepressant properties, but require further study before they can be used as routine options in long-term care. It is clear that the advent of multiple mood stabilizer candidates has not yet led to a single ideal therapy for bipolar disorder, but rather to options that can be flexibly tailored to the lifetime needs of individual patients, in sequences or combinations, and perhaps in conjunction with other classes of psychotropics.",

Then, in a special case review, we highlight recent advances regarding the knowledge on the association between nicotine dependence and schizophrenia. Further understanding these mechanistic links, including nicotine-induced improvements in cognitive deficits, might provide new insights into improving smoking cessation success in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Additionally, we discuss data indicating that smoking cessation does not worsen mental health symptoms or increase other drug and alcohol use. Indeed, smoking cessation interventions should be available within mental health and substance use treatment settings. Treatments for nicotine addiction include psychological interventions and pharmacological agents such as nicotine replacement therapies (e.g. gums and lozenges) or medications such as the partial agonist varenicline. Importantly, the outcomes for smokers with mental illness are enhanced when these approaches are combined and may need to be administered over the long term.",

      "title": "STRESS COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION PREVENTS COCAINE RELAPSE BY DISRUPTING MEMORY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug addiction is a chronic and recurrent brain disease. Addictive substances can cause changes in brain circuits and may be integrated into the memory system. Drug addiction consists of different phases, beginning when recreational use escalates to compulsive use and then cycles through withdrawal, and relapse. A relapse is a return to drinking or drug use after attempts have previously been made to stop. The prevention of relapses is perhaps the most fundamental task in addiction recovery. Repeated retrieval by the cue without reward stimulant reduces the behavioral response through a process called extinction. This learning is the fundamental principle underlying many cognitive- behavioral psychotherapeutic treatments. Yet behavioral change may be difficult to sustain, and relapse is not uncommon, even after successful treatment. Memory updating was applied to substance use problems by weakening the ability of drug-associated triggers to elicit substance use[1]. Stress can potentially affect all cognitive phases involved in memory function such as the process of memory storage, retrieval or/and consolidation. Stress prior to extinction might not only enhance the consolidation of extinction memory, like post-extinction stress does, but also make it less context- dependent[2]. Aims &amp; Objectives 1) Whether stress combined with extinction learning disrupts consolidated memory to suppress cocaine relapse. 2) What is the mechanism of stress combined with extinction learning suppressing drug seeking behavior. Method The self-administration of cocaine was used as an animal model for addictive memory. A combination of techniques, including immunofluorescence, fiber optic recording, brain slice patch-clamp recordings, and Golgi staining, was employed to explore the mechanism of stress combined with extinction in addictive memory. Results (1) The drug-priming test following self-administration extinction training suggested that rats exposed to footshock before extinction training (FE group) had a lower number of active nosepokes compared to extinction group (E group). Interestingly, in conditioned place avoidance test, footshock did not elicit an aversive response. (2) Fiber optic recording results showed excitatory neuron in LHb were more active in FE group during drug-priming test. Electrophysiological in vitro results suggested a significant increase in action potential firing and reduction of the threshold of the injected current to trigger the action potential in LHb. (3) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb combined with extinction training effectively facilitated the elimination of cocaine addiction memory and reduced psychological craving. (4) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb increased cfos expression in RMTg. Activation of LHb-RMTg also facilitated extinction and inhibited relapse. Activation of LHb-RMTg circuit could mimic the effect of stress combined with extinction in inhibiting relapse. Discussion &amp; Conclusion This study demonstrateed that stress combination with extinction training may promote the extinction of addictive memory and inhibit relapse by reshaping activity of neurons in the LHb-RMTg circuit.

      "title": "Drug Dependency",
      "abstract": "The legal and illegal use of psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, hypnotics, tranquilizers, and hallucinogens, is markedly increasing. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may cause severe acute or chronic symptoms; one cannot predict adverse reactions or relate them to frequency and length of LSD use. Among its effects are acute psychologic changes, including psychosis; and chronic alterations, such as apathy, psychosis, and \"flashback.\" Chlorpromazine is recommended for treatment of symptoms; psychotherapy and education help prevent further LSD use. Chronic amphetamine use may lead to toxic psychosis, confusion, or brain damage; acute withdrawal may lead to depression, with suicidal ideation, and increases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with nightmares and insomnia. Chronic use of barbiturates and nonbarbiturate hypnotics may lead to mental impairment, motor incoordination, and depression. Withdrawal produces weakness, irritability, and occasionally convulsions or psychosis. Amphetamines and hypnotics should be withdrawn gradually and patients educated as to possible physiologic alterations, both those patients dependent on large doses and those who have taken therapeutic doses for some months. Withdrawal of these drugs leads to marked increases in REM sleep, nightmares, and insomnia, which may lead to drug dependency. Marijuana may change time sense and visual and auditory perceptions. Chronic use frequently indicates underlying psychologic disturbances needing psychotherapy. Psychoactive drugs differentially affect responses of various autonomic systems. Central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs do not induce only one condition and cannot be simply classified as excitants or depressants. The physiologic alterations produced by psychoactive drugs are basic to drug dependency as are personality factors.",

      "abstract": "In many alcoholics, the severity of withdrawal symptoms increases after repeated withdrawal episodes. This exacerbation may be attributable to a kindling process. Kindling is a phenomenon in which a weak electrical or chemical stimulus, which initially causes no overt behavioral responses, results in the appearance of behavioral effects, such as seizures, when it is administered repeatedly. Both clinical and experimental evidence support the existence of a kindling mechanism during alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures, result from neurochemical imbalances in the brain of alcoholics who suddenly reduce or cease alcohol consumption. These imbalances may be exacerbated after repeated withdrawal experiences. The existence of kindling during withdrawal suggests that even patients experiencing mild withdrawal should be treated aggressively to prevent the increase in severity of subsequent withdrawal episodes. Kindling also may contribute to a patient's relapse risk and to alcohol-related brain damage and cognitive impairment.",

Cannabis can induce and exacerbate psychotic symptoms and it can deteriorate the disease process in schizophrenic patients. First-episode schizophrenic patients with long-term cannabis consumption were significantly younger at disease-onset, mostly male and suffered more often from paranoid schizophrenia (with a better prognosis) than those without cannabis consumption in our investigation. The significance of higher serum neurotrophin levels in cannabis consuming schizophrenics as compared to those without cannabis consumption remains equivocal so far. The cognitive functions of this patient group are at least not worse than in those with schizophrenia alone. Taken together, the effect of cannabis on the brain vulnerable to schizophrenia is not yet completely understood; besides the undoubtedly deleterious effects, there may also be some neuroprotective effects.",

      "abstract": "24 January 2008 Dear Editor, SCREENING FOR CANNABIS USE IN A PEDIATRIC SLEEP CLINIC Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug globally, and its use appears to be increasing.1 The active ingredient is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),2 which is a ligand for human cannabinoid receptors. These receptors are widely distributed in the brain, with particularly high densities in the cerebellum, parts of the basal ganglia, hippocampus and many regions of the neocortex.3 Cannabis affects almost every body system. It combines many of the properties of alcohol, tranquillizers, opiates and hallucinogens; it is anxiolytic, sedative, analgesic, psychedelic. Furthermore, it stimulates appetite and has many systemic effects.2 The symptomatology of THC includes dizziness, fatigue, headache, somnolence, depression and memory impairment. Some of these symptoms are also reported by patients consulting a paediatric sleep clinic. Although there are – to the best of our knowledge – no recent studies investigating the influence of THC on sleep, early studies revealed that THC reduced sleep latency and caused some suppression of slow wave sleep,4 often with a residual ‘hangover’ effect the next day.5 In this view, we investigated the prevalence of cannabis use in teenagers attending a paediatric sleep clinic and its effects on sleep architecture. This was a retrospective case study of teenagers who attended our sleep clinic for various indications. Since 2006, we started to routinely screen all children aged 10 years and older for cannabis use in urine. Technical details on polysomnographic methods have been described before.6 Polysomnographic measurements of subjects with and without a positive toxicology screen for cannabis were compared using Mann–Whitney U test. Cannabis screening was performed in 41 subjects. Indications for polysomnography were as follows: sleep-disordered breathing (n = 18), dyssomnia (n = 10), evaluation of chronic fatigue and hypersomnolence (n = 10), parasomnia (n = 2) and nocturnal epilepsy (n = 1). Four patients tested positive for cannabis: one in the sleep-disordered breathing group and three in the chronic fatigue and hypersomnolence group. Subject and polysomnographic characteristics between both groups are presented in Table 1. Although subjects with a positive cannabis screening were older, they had a significantly higher percentage of stage 4 sleep. Furthermore, there was a trend for reduced rapid eye movement sleep. This small retrospective report described that cannabis use is not exceptional in a paediatric sleep clinic. We found a prevalence of 9.8% in teenagers attending a paediatric sleep clinic. Almost all subjects who had used cannabis consulted our clinic for the evaluation of chronic and unexplainable fatigue. However, due to the retrospective design of this report, it cannot be elucidated if cannabis use was a cause or consequence of the fatigue and sleep problems. Furthermore, we could already document a significant increase in stage 4 sleep, which could suggest the presence of chronic sleep deprivation in these adolescents. In conclusion, we would like to recommend routine toxicology screen in teenagers consulting for sleep problems and certainly in the evaluation of unexplainable fatigue. Further prospective studies are warranted to assess the influence of cannabis on sleep architecture and perhaps more importantly, on the effects of cannabis withdrawal on adolescent sleep.",

      "title": "Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder Following Recreational Dextromethorphan Use",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a rarely diagnosed disorder characterized by continuous sensory disturbances following the use of hallucinogenic substances. Its cause remains unknown, and treatments remain elusive, although previous case reports have detailed attempts at treatment with a variety of psychoactive medications. No previous case reports have discussed the emergence of HPPD following dextromethorphan use, or its treatment with ropinirole. Case: We present the case of a 20-year-old male who developed HPPD after repeated recreational dextromethorphan use at supratherapeutic dosages, leading to the acute onset of visual snow, motional trails, the persistence of afterimages, the perception of halos around lights, tinnitus, and depersonalization and derealization. The client found these symptoms to be greatly distressing, and he had worsening of symptoms when treated with antipsychotic medications. After he was treated with lamotrigine and clonazepam, he had some improvement of symptoms. To treat additional visual symptoms, the patient was given ropinirole, a dopamine agonist, which made him feel better with less visual disturbances. Ultimately he had to discontinue all medications due to intolerability to side effects. Conclusions: The lack of effective treatments for HPPD and a general lack of awareness among patients and providers leads to underdiagnosis and incorrect management. Ropinirole may offer a novel treatment for patients with HPPD, and more research is needed to determine the suitability of dopamine agonists in the treatment for HPPD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "abstract": "Athletes suffer from some mental health symptoms and disorders at rates equal to or higher than the general population. Addiction disorders, including substance use and gambling disorders, represent conditions by which athletes are disproportionately or uniquely affected relative to the general population. This chapter focuses on these disorders. Specifically, substance use disorders covered in this chapter relate to recreational drugs; ergogenic substance use is covered in a subsequent chapter. There are varied reasons why athletes start to and/or continue to use recreational substances or gamble. Many of these overlap with reasons for use or participation by non-athletes. In most sport, athletes use substances at lower rates than the general population, especially during the competitive season. However, athletes in some sport and across genders use and misuse some substances at higher rates than non-athletes. This chapter will highlight prevalence, reasons for use/participation, and impact on performance of athletes’ participation in gambling and use of the following substances: alcohol, cannabinoids, nicotine, stimulants, and prescription drugs. Finally, prevention and management strategies for addiction disorders in athletes will be delineated.",

      "title": "Stimulants and the developing brain",
      "abstract": "In de afgelopen decennia is het gebruik van ADHD medicatie, met name stimulantia, toegenomen. Deze toename leidt regelmatig tot verhit maatschappelijk debat en onrust onder ouders en clinici. De zorgen over ADHD medicatie worden in de media aangewakkerd door suggestieve berichtgeving over de overeenkomsten met harddrugs als cocaine en ecstasy. Terecht vraagt men zich af: willen we onze kinderen blootstellen aan een middel waarvan we het lange-termijn effect op de hersenontwikkeling niet kennen? In dit proefschrift presenteer ik de resultaten van onderzoek naar de lange-termijn effecten van ADHD medicatie op het zich ontwikkelende brein. Vaker dan wel, vinden we geen verband tussen medicatie en de ontwikkeling van het brein. Zo vinden we geen effect van ADHD medicatie op de dikte van de cortex (deze is bij kinderen/jongeren met ADHD vaak wat dunner), op het volume van de frontaalschors (deze is bij kinderen/jongeren met ADHD vaak wat kleiner), of op activatie in het striatum tijdens beloning (deze is bij kinderen/jongeren met ADHD vaak wat verhoogd). Ook wat betreft ADHD symptomen, sociaal-emotioneel functioneren en cognitie vinden we geen lange-termijn effect, positief dan wel negatief, van medicatie. In een aantal studies vinden we echter wel subtiele veranderingen in het brein na behandeling met stimulantia. De frontaalschors, bijvoorbeeld, is kleiner bij jongeren met ADHD, maar niet bij jongeren met ADHD die drager zijn van het DRD4 7R allel en bovendien op jonge leeftijd medicatie hebben gekregen. Ook vinden we dat jongeren die intensief zijn behandeld met stimulantia, wanneer ze een beloning krijgen, een hersengebied activeren dat belangrijk is voor cognitieve controle; jongeren met ADHD die niet zo intensief zijn behandeld activeren dit gebied niet. We denken dat deze extra activatie positief kan zijn voor de jongeren, en er bijvoorbeeld aan kan bijdragen dat intensief behandelde jongeren minder kans hebben om verslaafd raken. Samenvattend: vaker dan wel vinden we geen effect van medicatie op het brein. De effecten die we wel vinden zijn subtiel, soms specifiek voor een bepaalde subgroep van kinderen/jongeren met ADHD, en lijken eerder een positief dan een negatief karakter te hebben.",

      "abstract": "The alcohol dependence syndrome negatively affects cognitive functioning, particularly in terms of memory, attention, executive functions, among others. Cognitive changes often improve with abstinence time and with age. However, others persist in time. These changes may influence the treatment and can lead to relapse, so it is necessary to include in the therapeutic process the assessment, as well as the stimulation and rehabilitation of these functions. Two studies were conducted in order to discriminate the variables that influence the existence or not of deficits in individuals with alcohol consumption. One of the findings consists in the existence of cognitive deficits, especially at an attention and language level, and to some extent changes in this area were more significant in older and those with less time of abstinence.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "abstract": "Disulfiram is used in alcohol rehabilitation because it inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and consequently causes the disulfiram-ethanol reaction (vomiting, vertigo, anxiety, cardiovascular effects) after ingestion of alcoholic beverages. However, adverse effects on the central nervous system (for the most part psychotic reactions, acute organic brain syndrome, catatonia) may appear as a direct result of the drug itself. Disulfiram and its metabolite carbon disulfide inhibit dopamine beta-hydroxylase, increasing the levels of dopamine and reducing those of norepinephrine in the central nervous system. We observed direct disulfiram-induced toxicity on the central nervous system in 8 abstinent patients in whom a disulfiram-ethanol reaction had been excluded. Risk is increased when 1) excessive amounts of the drug are ingested; 2) the patient is already suffering from a major psychiatric illness; 3) the patient has anatomical brain lesions. In all cases observed, the toxic effects appeared in the first weeks and were reversed after suspension of the drug (except in one patient who died from severe bronchopulmonary infection). We thus suggest the following protocol: 1) physical examination and interview 3-4 weeks after initiation of treatment; 2) as a general rule, in abstinent patients, the lowest possible maintenance dosage should be administered. This strategy, despite the risk of underdosage, meets the goals inherent in an integrated medical and psychosocial approach to the treatment of alcoholism with which these patients seem better able to comply.",

      "title": "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach to Hypothalamic Amenorrhea",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "The Religious Sentiment in Epileptics",
      "abstract": "In the following observations I propose to describe a feature in the mental condition of Epileptics, which, to the best of my knowledge, has not attracted that attention to which its frequency entitles it. I refer to the exaltation of the religious sentiment. Irritability, suspicion, impulsive violence, egotism, strong homicidal propensities are among the most commonly observed characteristics in the insane epileptic; but in strange contradiction with these we very frequently find combined a strong devotional feeling, manifesting itself, it may be, in simple piety or in decided religious delusions. I do not pretend that the forms of religious insanity to be afterwards noticed are peculiar to epilepsy, but they are very frequently found in connection with it, and, I believe, I have only to describe a few illustrative cases to bring to your recollection numerous others which have occurred in your own experience. The causes which combine to develope a devotional frame of mind in Epileptics are probably numerous. In congenital cases or those arising from diseases of childhood education no doubt exercises a powerful influence. The epileptic child is necessarily less able to join in the amusements and occupations of healthy children, and a large share of his time and attention may be devoted at home to religious instruction. The mysterious nature of the disease, the consciousness of infirmity and helplessness developes a craving for sympathy in the epileptic which we rarely see in other lunatics. In the wards and airing-courts of our asylums, epileptics may be distinguished from their fellow-patients by the fact that they are generally found associating in little groups of twos or threes. They sympathize with each other, lean on each other for help in the time of trouble, and however much they exhibit violence and viciousness to others, they rarely attack each other. Along with this desire for sympathy, the epileptic is mercifully endowed with strong hope. He is always getting over his trouble, he thinks the turns are less severe, and will tell you perhaps the day before a fatal seizure that he thinks he will have no more fits. We all know how much hope has helped the physician in his efforts to combat this disease with a whole battery of drugs, each of which in its turn seems for a time to promise success, only too surely to fail in the end. This craving for sympathy finds a deep response in the highest development of hope—religion; and the sufferings of this life are assuaged by the assurance of sympathy and aid from heaven, and of a blessed future where suffering and sorrow are no more.",

      "abstract": "Clozapine is an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent for treating previously resistant schizophrenic patients. Its main advantages over \"typical\" neuroleptics are low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects and its capacity to induce therapeutic response in previously treated refractory patients. However, withdrawal from clozapine has been observed to lead to \"atypical\" clinical characteristics or a \"rebound phenomenon,\" manifested in two interwoven clinical forms: (1) psychotic exacerbation, and (2) cholinergic rebound. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism of this phenomenon is postulated to be a result of cholinergic supersensitivity. In this paper, the \"rebound phenomenon\" will be discussed and exemplified by three case histories in which abrupt cessation of clozapine led to serious deterioration and psychotic exacerbation, and one case in which gradual titration from the drug was employed in order to preempt this hazardous occurrence.",

Reduced sense of taste is well-known especially in salty sense, while the changes of sweet, bitter, and sour tastes are different among individuals. Finally, deep sensation of vibration and proprioception is decreased with age as well as superficial sensation (touch, temperature, pain).

Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is the primary active ingredient which demonstrates serotonergic- and muscarinic-enhancing properties via inhibition of selective serotonin reuptake and acetylcholinesterase. We report a young adult female with no history of bipolar disorder who developed mania and psychosis approximately 1 week following initiation of G cambogia and the Cleanse and Detox™ dietary supplement manufactured by Apex Vitality Health. She presented with a predominantly expansive mood, psychomotor agitation, disorganized and pressured speech, flight of ideas, grandiosity, delusions, and auditory hallucinations. Following discontinuation of G cambogia and the initiation of lithium and quetiapine, the patient experienced rapid and progressive mood stabilization and was discharged after 8 days. Seven previous case reports associating (hypo)mania and/or psychosis with G cambogia consumption have been published. The chronology of mania and/or psychosis onset may appear between 1 and 8 weeks following initiation of G cambogia. Psychiatric symptoms have resolved with G cambogia discontinuation in some instances and may not require chronic pharmacotherapy. Our report should encourage further research and case reports regarding this adverse event and the reconciliation of complete herbal supplement use at clinic visits and hospital admissions.",

Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

In addition, it briefly discusses the mental status changes that may occur at high altitudes. With mild hypoxia, lowered levels of blood oxygen may produce symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, clumsiness, and poor judgment. Patients may behave as if they are intoxicated. When individuals remain at very high altitudes for long periods of time, mental status changes may ensue. Changes in mental state, however, may be prominent, signaling a gradually developing or worsening hypoxia. Worsening hypoxia or anoxia will lead to loss of consciousness and may cause irreversible brain damage or death. Patients with chronic lung disorders are especially sensitive to inadequate ventilation during anesthesia. Individuals with sleep apnea are at risk for hypoxia during the night.",

Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression. In this review, acute and maintenance treatment of the depressive episodes of BD will be discussed according to the treatment algorithms.",

The symptoms of bipolar disorder can be confused with other medical illnesses or drug effects or may even be overlooked entirely as extreme character traits. The consequences of delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis are potentially devastating, including loss of employment, impaired relationships and a severely impaired quality of life. This article will review the historic perspectives of bipolar disorder, the diagnostic criteria for the phases of the illness, and the pharmacologic options available to treat this condition. Quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic, will be reviewed indepth. Based on extensive trial data, reviewed in this article, quetiapine is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with other mood stabilizers for the treatment of acute manic episodes of bipolar I disorder. Clinical trials describing the efficacy of quetiapine in other phases of bipolar disorder and in other patient populations are also reviewed. A discussion of the drug profile of quetiapine includes its chemistry, availability, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and metabolism. Preclinical studies, postmarketing surveillance, safety, tolerability and regulatory issues are also evaluated. Finally, potential future directions for quetiapine are discussed, together with a review of key issues in bipolar disorder management and details of the information resources used in preparing this article.",

Asenapine is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and of the manic or mixed episodes in bipolar I disorder (1,3). \"Mrs. O.M.\", is a caucasian woman aged 55 suffering from bipolar disorder type I since she was 22 years old, with mood cycles characterized by long manic episodes with soft mixed and cognitive features. Readmitted for a manic exacerbation, the increasing of clozapine up to 250 mg/day was accompanied by hyperphagia, weight gain, cognitive impairment, sedation, fatigue, anergy, resistant chronic constipation. To that point clozapine was abruptly replaced with asenapine 20 mg/day with rapid clinical improvement within two days without major side effects. After 6 months the patient is still showing a good affective stability, without side effects.

Toxicity is characterized by slurred speech, impaired judgment, and unsteady gait; overdose results in stupor, coma, respiratory depression, vasomotor collapse, and even death. Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications.

Methods : Two Patients with psychasthenia are unable to resist specific actions or thoughts, regardless of their maladaptive nature and have insufficient control over their conscious thinking and memory, sometimes wandering aimlessly and/or forgetting what they were doing. Results : The constant mental effort induces physiological fatigue, which worsens the condition. Nevertheless, psychasthenia has become a forgotten disorder.

      "title": "Central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS) in anesthesia and intensive care.",
      "abstract": "Many of the drugs used in anesthesia and intensive care may cause blockade of the central cholinergic neurotransmission. Acetylcholine is of significance in modulation of the interaction among most other central transmitters. The clinical picture of the central cholinergic blockade, known as the central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS), is identical with the central symptoms of atropine intoxication. This behaviour consists of agitation including seizures, restlessness, hallucinations, disorientation or signs of depression such as stupor, coma and respiratory depression. Such disturbances may be induced by opiates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, ketamine, etomidate, propofol, nitrous oxide, and halogenated inhalation anesthetics as well as by H2-blocking agents such as cimetidine. There is an individual predisposition for CAS--but unpredictable from laboratory findings or other signs. Reports of postanesthetic occurrence of the CAS requiring treatment are not unanimous, varying between 1 and 40%. Differential diagnosis of the CAS includes disorders of glucose and electrolyte metabolism, severe hormonal imbalance, respiratory disorders (hypoxia, hypercarbia), hypothermia, hyperthermia and neuropsychiatric diseases (cerebral hypoxia, stroke, catatony, acute psychosis). The CAS may considerably impair the postanesthetic period especially when agitation is prevalent, which may endanger the patient or the surgical results. The diagnosis is confirmed ex iuvantibus by the sudden increase in the acetylcholine level in the brain. This is achieved with physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor able to easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Its peripheral muscarinic effects are minimal. Postanesthetic CAS can be prevented by administration of physostigmine during the anesthesia procedure. During intensive care (IC), agitated forms of CAS may occur in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, particularly during prolonged high-dose sedation. Artificial ventilation of such patients becomes very difficult and muscle relaxation may be necessary. In these cases of IC-CAS, physostigmine is of value and has proven beneficial during weaning from mechanical ventilation. Dealing with the CAS for more than a decade has improved knowledge of the central cholinergic transmission. For example, it can be said that CAS occurs alongside general anesthesia, being no more than a frequent side-effect. Furthermore, acetylcholine is involved in nociception through the endorphinergic and the serotoninergic systems. There is a close relation between the central cholinergic transmission and actions of nitrous oxide. Moreover, cholinergic transmission is involved in withdrawal from (among others) alcohol, opiates, hallucinogens and nitrous oxide. In some intoxications with psychoactive agents, physostigmine is useful for reversal of the central nervous symptoms of the acute intoxication itself. In addition it can be used for prevention of some withdrawal states. In",

Some writers call it a form of delirium tremens and acute alcoholism; others consider it a distinct epilepsy due to the toxic action of alcohol on the brain centers. In some instances the craving for alcohol precedes the paroxysm or epileptic fit like an aura or premonition. Sometimes the convulsion is intensified and increased by alcohol, or in other instances it may be neutralized and the direction of the symptom changed. The sudden maniacal impulse to become narcotized by alcohol, as seen in the dipsomaniac and periodic inebriates, closely resembles epilepsy. A number of cases have been noted where a distinct convulsion preceded the use of spirits and was followed by a continued impulse to drink. When this craving was neutralized by treatment, the convulsion returned. When spirits were",

This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "title": "Sedative-Hypnotics: Addiction and Current Research Status",
      "abstract": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in human and animals. These depressants produce varying degrees of CNS depression, depending mainly upon the dose used. In small doses, they can alleviate anxiety and/or reduce spontaneous activity; in moderate doses, they induce sleep; with large doses, severe CNS depression progresses to anesthesia, coma or even death. This graded, dose-dependent CNS depression is a common feature of these agents. In addition to causing CNS depression, these agents also possess other pharmacological properties, e. g. muscle relaxation, Anticonvulsant activity, respiratory depression, hypothermia, etc. Tolerance-dependence developing to sedative-hypnotics is a common feature following continuous administration of sedative-hypnotics. Tolerance is defined as a decreasing response to repeated administration of the same dose of a sedative-hypnotic or as a necessary increase of the dosage to obtain the initial response. There are two types of tolerance-one dispositional (pharmacokinetic), the other functional (pharmacodynamic). Dependence is defined as a modification of physiological functions that require continuous drug adiministration to prevent the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Abrupt withdrawal from long-term usage of these drugs may produce anxiety, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscular twitching, hyperthermia, delirium, tremors, convulsions, and death. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by sedative-hypnotics, e.g benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol, may be mediated through the GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. However, the mechanisms of the actions of these agents on the GABA system remain to be elucidated. Benzodiazepines have been demonstrated to have receptors which are parts of the GABAA receptors (GABA benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complexes). Although a definitive barbiturate binding site has not yet been identified, the available evidence strongly suggests that barbiturate binding sites and convulsant binding sites are separate but allosterically affect each other. As far as ethanol is concerned, it is likely that multiple neurotransmitter systems are affected. Therefore, it is still unclear how alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are functionally associated with the GABA system. The evidence summarized demonstrates that the GABA synapse plays an important role in the pharmacologic effects of barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines. There are similarities and differences in the effects of these CNS depressants on the pharmacology and biochemistry of the GABA synapse. The effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on GABA synapses are different in different brain regions. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in (a) animal models used, (b) brain regions used, (c) protocols used in treating the animals (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) and/or (d) techniques used (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.)",

It was first described in 1875 by Kahlbaum (1) who reported 25 patients with a \"brain disease\" characterized by four of the following signs: long periods of immobility, mutism alternating with verbigeration, staring, withdrawal and refusal to eat or drink, negativism, posturing and grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia, stereotypy, and waxy flexibility (see Table 1). Kahlbaum observed that these otherwise immobile patients could become very agitated or excited and were often found to have extremes of mood disturbance in the form of \"melancholy\" or \"mania.\" This phenomenon of marked, polar alterations in the predominant psychomotor state eventually led to division of the syndrome into retarded and excited types (2). The excited form has been much more difficult to characterize and distinguish from mania (3). In rare instances, patients with severe motor excitement develop fever, autonomic disturbances, stupor, and rhabdomyolysis and may succumb to cardiovascular collapse. This clinical state has been referred to as lethal or malignant catatonia (4,5) and the clinical and laboratory similarities to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has generated considerable interest and discussion (6,7).",

The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

If agitation persists and patients have contraindications for these substances, then anesthetics, such as propofol, can also be used as well, to serve as a sedative. Our attention was drawn to a particular case in which dexmedetomidine was used as a sedative.<br/> AIM: To study the literature on the use of α2-agonists, such as dexmedetomidine, in the treatment of extreme agitation.<br/> METHOD: We reviewed the relevant scientific literature.<br/> RESULTS: α2-agonists, such as dexmedetomidine, are new anesthetic agents that have analgetic and sympatholytic effects without suppressing respiration. These agents are used frequently in intensive care because their sedative effect are short-lived and do not cause amnesia, sleep deprivation or cognitive disturbance. Excited delirium syndrome (eds) is a type of extreme agitation for which dexmedetomidine can be used.<br/> CONCLUSION: There may well be a place for dexmedetomidine in the treatment of extreme agitation when standard treatments have failed. Further research is needed in order to ascertain whether dexmedetomidine should play a role in such treatment.",

      "abstract": "1. If mild cerebral trauma such as we were investigating produced changes in the electroencephalographic tracing the abnormality disappeared within a period of minutes in the vast majority of cases. 2. Patients who gave a history of amnesia following cerebral trauma, but were clear mentally at the time the EEG was taken, showed only a slight increase in the percentage of abnormal records as compared to the control series. This was true even when the records were taken within a few hours of the accident. 3. If there was an impairment of consciousness of any degree at the time the EEG was taken, abnormality in the EEG was the rule. 4. Electroencephalographic records taken within 30 minutes after patients sustained head injury showed a greater percentage of abnormality than those taken after 30 minutes had elapsed. The rapid disappearance of abnormal electroencephalographic findings points, in our opinion, to some mechanism in concussion other than petechial hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, embolic phenomenon, or any other histopathological change which must of necessity require several days to disappear. 5. In the patients with abnormal electroencephalographic records the average velocity of the striking object or of the falling head at the time of impact was greater than the velocity necessary to produce concussion in experimental animals as determined by others. The average velocity of the striking object or falling head in patients who showed normal or borderline electroencephalographic records was less than the velocity necessary to produce concussion in experimental animals. 6. The study of the electroencephalographic records taken immediately following mild head injury was less reliable than clinical judgment in predicting time loss from work. An ultimate opinion of the value of EEGs in this respect will depend upon a study of a group of more severely injured patients.",

Up to half of all cigarettes are consumed by a minority of the population: persons with schizophrenia and other forms of mental illness. Ironically, despite nicotine dependence being considered a serious and deadly form of addiction in the general population, research on smoking in mental illness is predominantly guided by the idea that smoking has beneficial medication-like treatment effects. This article considers pitfalls of adherence to the self-medication hypothesis as an exclusively held dogma. New evidence from animal modeling work suggests the need to broaden hypothesis-driven research on smoking in mental illness. Adolescent smoking could predispose to mental illness and/or increased nicotine dependence in schizophrenia may represent an involuntary, general addiction vulnerability that has little to do with the 'helpful' psychoactive effects of nicotine or other drugs.",

      "abstract": "<italic>Life’s Rewards: Linking Dopamine, Incentive Learning, Schizophrenia, and the Mind</italic> explains how increased brain dopamine produces reward-related incentive learning, the acquisition by neutral stimuli of increased ability to elicit approach and other responses. Dopamine decreases may produce inverse incentive learning, the loss by stimuli of the ability to elicit approach and other responses. Incentive learning is gradually lost when dopamine receptors are blocked. The brain has multiple memory systems defined as “declarative” and “non-declarative;” incentive learning produces one form of non-declarative memory. People with schizophrenia have hyperdopaminergia, possibly producing excessive incentive learning. Delusions may rely on declarative memory to interpret the world as it appears with excessive incentive learning. Parkinson’s disease, associated with dopamine loss, may involve a loss of incentive learning and increased inverse incentive learning. Drugs of abuse activate dopaminergic neurotransmission, leading to incentive learning about drug-associated stimuli. After withdrawal symptoms have been alleviated by detoxification treatment, drug-associated conditioned incentive stimuli will retain their ability to elicit responses until they are repeatedly experienced in the absence of primary drug rewards. Incentive learning may involve the action of dopamine at dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons that have recently had glutamatergic input from assemblies of cortical neurons activated by environmental and proprioceptive stimuli. Glutamate initiates a wave of phosphorylation normally followed by a wave of phosphatase activity. If dopaminergic neurons fire, stimulation of D1 receptors prolongs the wave of phosphorylation, allowing glutamate synaptic strengthening. Activity in dopaminergic neurons in humans appears to affect mental experience.",

The complex issues relating to the description, definition and classification, and diagnosis of psychiatric comorbidity and substance misuse are outlined. The fact that there is no uniformly accepted definition of what constitutes ‘dual diagnosis’ or ‘psychiatric comorbidity’ in young people is highlighted: this variability impacts upon clinical assessment and study design. Despite these considerable drawbacks, a degree of consistency is beginning to emerge in the co-occurrence of some conditions, e.g. disruptive and suicidal behaviours. It is recognized that psychological distress and substance misuse are also associated with multiple social and physical complications. The rapid advances in treatment options are presented. At present the ‘best practice’ is implementation of what works for adults with addiction and young people with psychiatric disorder. This includes psychosocial interventions such as motivational enhancement techniques and cognitive behavioural treatment, as well as appropriate safe (usually), short-term use of a range of pharmacological agents. Very few comprehensive designated adolescent addiction services exist, while child and adolescent mental health services are under serious pressure. Thus the need for a longitudinal and multidisciplinary approach, with appropriate assessment instruments in young people, is required to further explore diagnostic classification which will classify the degrees and patterns of relationships between disorders. In this way it may be possible to build up a picture of the nature and extent of numerous complex, and sometimes overlapping, problems and needs in children and adolescents in a variety of settings: primary and secondary care, the criminal justice system and educational establishments. This might strengthen the development of innovative treatment services where novel interventions are tested as a priority.",

Regardless of sensory modality, disorders of the special senses in the elderly can be conveniently divided into conductive, sensorineural, and central disorders. Disorders of the chemosensory senses, smell and taste, are usually less disabling than disorders of the other special senses (vision and hearing). Nevertheless, olfactory impairment is a significant contributor to perceived disability and lower quality of life among elderly patients and is a significant predictor of subsequent cognitive decline. Gustatory disorders in the elderly that are not secondary to olfactory disorders should prompt consideration of systemic factors, such as medication use, toxin exposures and autoimmune disorders.",

The subject was a twenty-two year old unemployed male who had left school without formal qualifications and had been brought up by his grandparents since his parents' separation. He had been a bodybuilder for four years and misused combinations of oral and parenteral anabolic steroids in increasing doses for two years. His depressive symptoms included lowered mood, loss of energy, anhedonia, suicidal preoccupations, disturbed sleep, poor appetite and impaired concentration. It is proposed that unusually prolonged exposure to steroids followed by withdrawal was the most likely cause of the depression in this case and that biological vulnerability to affective disorder may explain the severity of the episode.

Recognizing catatonia in children and making a differential diagnosis is important in terms of investigations required as well as for determining the treatment protocol. The present paper discusses the differential diagnosis of catatonia presentation and the clinical characteristics of a 17-year-old male case who was initially followed as inpatient in our clinic for catatonia presentation, though his diagnosis did not become definite within this period. Approximately one year later, he was readmitted to our clinic being pre-diagnosed with bipolar disorder-manic attack because of symptoms such as talking excessively, hyperactivity, irritability, and insomnia.",

      "title": "A practical approach to benzodiazepine discontinuation",
      "abstract": "Non-medical use of benzodiazepines is rare among patients with anxiety disorders. Numerous studies have found that non-medical use, or abuse, of benzodiazepines occurs usually among patients with histories of alcohol and drug abuse--those who use those drugs to get \"high\". This article distinguishes between medical and non-medical use of benzodiazepines in clinical practice, and offers practical approaches to discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment for both medical and non-medical users of those medicines. The major barrier to clear thinking about the abuse of benzodiazepines is the confusion of \"addiction\" and \"withdrawal\". Addiction means high, unstable dosing outside medical and social boundaries for \"recreational\" purposes, loss of control over use, and continued use despite clear evidence of harm. Alcoholism and heroin addiction are typical examples of addiction (Kalant, 1989). In contrast, withdrawal is a pharmacological consequence of discontinuation of a substance on which a person has become dependent. Many drug-addicted people have only minor withdrawal symptoms when they stop drug use. Many medical patients, with no evidence of addiction, have withdrawal symptoms when they stop treatment, especially when they stop abruptly (e.g. surgical patients using narcotic analgesics and epileptics using benzodiazepines or barbiturates in their treatment). Addiction to benzodiazepines, in the sense of loss of control over use and continued despite harm, is virtually limited to people with pre-existing drug or alcohol abuse, while withdrawal symptoms after prolonged daily use are common among medical users of benzodiazepines. The serious nature of both drug abuse and anxiety disorders is not emphasized sufficiently during medical school or in the professional literature. The distress and disability from which both groups of patients and their families suffer is profound. Fortunately, both drug abuse and anxiety patients receive tremendous benefit from successful treatments, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological (DuPont, 1986a; DuPont, 1984). This article discusses the use of benzodiazepines in two distinct populations--drug abusers and patients with anxiety disorders--and helps clinicians distinguish between the use of benzodiazepines in the two groups. The central distinction made in this article is reflected in the common use of the words \"drugs\" and \"medicines\". The former term often denotes non-medical substance use, while the latter term refers to traditional pharmacotherapy.",

Abuse of a medication refers to excessive use of a drug to achieve a “high,” which may result in addiction to the medication and which causes dysfunction in a patient's life. However, misuse refers to usage of a medication without a prescription or for reasons other than that which it was prescribed. Diversion refers to the diverting of legally prescribed medication into illegal use by other than the patient. Sahakian and Morein-Zamir recently discussed the use of cognitive-enhancing drugs by individuals with a variety of disorders as well as off-label and non-prescription use by the general public. In addition to inappropriate use of medications, patients with ADHD often turn to other substances that are detrimental to their health, such as nicotine.",

      "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening multisystem syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mast cell- and basophil-derived mediators into the systemic circulation. Foods, medications, and insect stings cause most anaphylaxis for which a cause can be identified, but virtually any agent capable of directly or indirectly activating mast cells or basophils can cause it. This syndrome can consist of some or all the following signs and symptoms: diffuse pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and/or angioedema; bronchospasm; laryngeal edema; hypotension; and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Some of the other symptoms that can occur include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, headache, feeling of impending doom, and unconsciousness. Regardless of the presenting signs or symptoms, which usually present within 5–30 min following the administration of the offending agent, this reaction can progress to respiratory compromise and cardiovascular collapse resulting in human fatalities. Usually, the more rapid the onset of clinical manifestations, the more likely the anaphylaxis will be life threatening. Immediate and appropriate therapy, especially with epinephrine, is mandatory to reverse the reactions. While most reactions are uniphasic, some can be biphasic or protracted. This chapter discusses the immunopathologic mechanisms and effects of anaphylaxis.",

      "abstract": "La calidad de vida de los ninos con cancer se ve afectada por sintomas muchas veces incapacitantes, ocasionados ya sea por los tratamientos y/o por la misma enfermedad, afectando tambien al sistema familiar, especialmente en el aspecto emocional y economico. Se ha demostrado que sintomas como fatiga, nauseas y dolor prevalecen aun despues de terminado el tratamiento, afectando areas\r\npsicologicas como lo son el optimismo y llevandolos muchas veces a la depresion. La hipnosis clinica se ha usado anteriormente como coadyuvante en diferentes enfermedades cronicas y en estudios recientes se ha demostrado sus multiples beneficios en pacientes con cancer. La hipnosis se divide en dos tipos, la hipnosis tradicional inducida por un estado de relajacion, y la hipnosis activa, que se caracteriza por tener los ojos abiertos y sugerir en vez de relajacion, actividad y expansion mental, donde ademas la persona puede hablar\r\nfluidamente, caminar y realizar las tareas cotidianas mientras experimenta las sugestiones. El proposito del estudio es evaluar el efecto de la hipnosis activa en\r\nla fatiga y el optimismo de ninos con Leucemia Linfoblastica Aguda (LLA), durante su tratamiento medico. Se utilizo un diseno aleatorio experimental de tipo pretest/ post-test con grupo control. La muestra se conformo por 21 pacientes, con edades de entre 6 a 16 anos, 12 fueron unicamente evaluados y 9 participaron\r\nadicionalmente en una intervencion de 3 sesiones con duracion de una hora, en donde se expondrian a la tecnica de hipnosis activa, con sugestiones orientadas a reducir fatiga y aumentar el optimismo. Para evaluar el efecto de la hipnosis activa se utilizo el cuestionario COP para medir optimismo, la escala de esfuerzo percibido Epinfant para medir fatiga y dos escalas visuales analogicas con caritas para medir las variables mencionadas. Se reporto un aumento del optimismo (d= 1.50) y una reduccion de la fatiga (d=-2.4) clinicamente significativas, en comparacion con el grupo control. \r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nThe quality of life of children with cancer is affected by symptoms that are often incapacitating, caused either by treatments and / or by the same disease, also\r\naffecting the family system, especially in the emotional and economic aspects. It has been shown that symptoms such as fatigue, nausea and pain prevail even after treatment ends, affecting psychological areas such as optimism and leading many times to depression. Clinical hypnosis has previously been used as a coadjuvant in different chronic diseases and recent studies have shown its multiple benefits in patients with cancer. Hypnosis is divided in two types,traditional hypnosis induced by a state of relaxation, and active hypnosis, which is characterized by having open eyes and suggesting instead of relaxation, activity and mental expansion, where the person can also speak fluently, walk and perform everyday tasks while experiencing the suggestions. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of active hypnosis on fatigue and optimism in children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) during their medical treatment. An experimental randomized design of pre-test / post-test type with control group was used. The sample consisted of 21 patients, aged between 6 and 16 years, 12 were only evaluated and 9 additionally participated in an intervention of 3 sessions lasting one hour, where they would be exposed to the active hypnosis technique, with suggestions aimed at reducing fatigue and increasing optimism. To evaluate the effect of active hypnosis, the COP questionnaire was used to measure optimism, the Epinfant perceived effort scale to measure fatigue and two visual analog scales with faces to measure the aforementioned variables. An increase in optimism (d = 1.50) and a reduction in fatigue (d = -2.4) clinically\r\nsignificant were reported, in comparison with the control group.",

      "abstract": "Climate solutions are available now, are widespread, and support psychological health.Increasing adoption of active commuting, public transportation, green spaces, and clean energy are all solutions that people can choose to support and integrate into their daily lives.These climate solutions, among others, can help to curb the stress, anxiety, and other mental illnesses incurred from the decline of economies, infrastructure, and social identity that comes from damage to the climate.Major acute mental health impacts include increases in trauma and shock, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compounded stress, anxiety, substance abuse, and depression.Climate changeinduced extreme weather, changing weather patterns, damaged food and water resources, and polluted air impact human mental health.Increased levels of stress and distress from these factors can also put strains on social relationships and even have impacts on physical health, such as memory loss, sleep disorders, immune suppression, and changes in digestion.Major chronic mental health impacts include higher rates of aggression and violence, more mental health emergencies, an increased sense of helplessness, hopelessness, or fatalism, and intense feelings of loss.These feelings of loss may be due to profound changes in a personally important place (such as one's home) and/ or a sense that one has lost control over events in one's life due to disturbances from climate change.Additionally, a sense of loss regarding one's personal or occupational identity can arise when treasured objects are destroyed by a disaster or place-based occupations are disrupted by climate change.Personal relationships and the ways in which people interact in communities and with each other are affected by a changing climate.Compounded stress from a changing environment, ecomigration, and/or ecoanxiety can affect community mental well-being through the loss of social identity and cohesion, hostility, violence, and interpersonal and intergroup aggression.Recent increases in natural disasters illustrate the relationship between the acceleration of climate change and severe weather.Areas that endure a natural disaster face a number of risks and difficulties.Direct physical impacts range from brute physical trauma to more pernicious effects, like increased incidence of infectious disease, asthma, heart disease, and lung problems.These physical health impacts interact with mental health impacts, which is why they are detailed in this report on page 39.In this section, we use floods, the most common form of natural disasters (EM-DAT, 2011, as reported in Alderman, Turner, & Tong, 2012), as an example to illustrate the ways in which direct health impacts of disasters come about.",

      "abstract": "Episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik merupakan bentuk dari depresi berat yang disertai gejala psikotik yang khas seperti waham atau delusi non-bizarre nihilistik, somatik, kemiskinan, ketidakberhargaan, atau adanya keyakinan-keyakinan delusional tentang perasaan bersalah dan sedang dihukum, serta kadang-kadang muncul halusinasi. Keyakinan-keyakinan delusional pada penderita episode depresif dengan gejala psikotik merupakan suatu distorsi kognitif, sebuah pola berpikir yang rancu dan menimbulkan kesalahan secara negatif yang meningkatkan kerentanan terhadap depresi. Studi kasus ini mengkaji klien yang didiagnosis episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik dari sudut pandang psikologi dengan pendekatan Teori Kognitif Beck. Seorang laki-laki bernama G, berusia 45 tahun mengurung diri dan tidak mau bertemu dengan saudara-saudaranya. Klien tidak mau mandi serta tidak shalat. Klien merasa ia tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagi. Menurut kakak, adik ipar, dan istri klien, klien pernah mengalami kecelakaan ketika bekerja di pabrik dan saat mengendarai sepeda motor sehingga kondisi fisiknya menurun. Klien lalu mendapatkan pemutusan hubungan kerja. Kondisi kejiwaannya terganggu. Hasil integrasi tes psikologi menunjukkan bahwa klien memiliki depresi dan kecemasan berlebihan. Teori kognitif Beck mengenai depresi mencantumkan tiga aktivitas kognitif yang mendasari munculnya sebuah gangguan, yaitu: a) negative triad (pandangan pesimistik terhadap diri sendiri, dunia, dan masa depan); b) skema atau keyakinan negatif yang dipicu oleh peristiwa/ situasi kehidupan negatif; dan c) distorsi kognitif. Negative triad berupa pandangan klien bahwa ia telah gagal, sedang dihukum, dan tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa di masa depan. Skema atau keyakinan negatif klien, yaitu meyakini bahwa karena sakitnya yang dialaminya tersebut membuatnya tidak berdaya. Distorsi Kognitif dalam bentuk overgeneralisasi, yaitu â€œSaya tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagiâ€. Â  Kata Kunci: depresi, gejala psikotik, keyakinan delusional, Teori Kognitif Beck, negative triad Â  Severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a form of major depression accompanied by typical psychotic symptoms such as delusions or nihilistic, non-bizarre delusions, somatic, poverty, worthlessness, or delusional beliefs about guilt and being punished, and sometimes appear hallucination. Delusional beliefs in people with depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a cognitive distortion, a pattern of thinking that is ambiguous and negatively causes errors that increase susceptibility to depression. This case study discusses clients diagnosed with severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms from a psychological perspective with Beckâ€™s Cognitive Theory approach. A 45-year-old man named G locked himself in and didn't want to see his brothers and sisters. Clients did not want to shower and did not pray. The client feels he could not do anything According to the brother, sister-in-law, and client's wife, the client had an accident while working in a factory and while riding a motorcycle so that his physical condition declined. The client then gets terminated in work. His mental condition is disturbed. The results of the integration of psychological tests show that the client has depression and excessive anxiety. Beck's cognitive theory of depression lists three cognitive activities that underlie the emergence of a disorder, namely: a) negative triads (pessimistic views of yourself, the world, and the future); b) negative schemes or beliefs triggered by negative life events/ situations; and c) cognitive distortion. Negative triad is the client's view that he has failed, is being punished, and cannot do anything in the future. The client's negative schema or belief, which is to believe that because of the pain he is experiencing makes him helpless. Cognitive Distortion in the form of overgeneralization, which is I can't do anything else.

We argue against this diagnosis as the patient did not fall into the diagnostic criteria of serotonin syndrome. The diagnosis of serotonin toxicity remains clinical one, and no laboratory test confirms the same. It is a syndrome characterised by a triad of neuroexcitatory features (neuromuscular hyperactivity, tremor, clonus, hyper-reflexia, pyramidal rigidity), autonomic hyperactivity (diaphoresis, fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea), and altered mental status (agitation, excitement, confusion).[2] According to another commonly used 'Hunter's Serotonin Toxicity Criteria', at least one out of the following five clinical feature is required for the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome: Spontaneous clonus; inducible clonus with agitation or diaphoresis; ocular clonus with agitation or diaphoresis; tremors and hyper-reflexia; hypertonia, temperature above 38°C, and ocular or inducible clonus.[3] The patient in discussion had only agitation without any clonus, hyper-reflexia, or hyperthermia. Occurrence of ventricular tachycardia and subsequent fibrillation remain unexplained using any of the diagnostic criteria's of serotonin toxicity. The same review article[3] as quoted by the authors clearly mentions that both fentanyl and tramadol are weak serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and rarely precipitate dose-dependent serotonin toxicity in conjunction with serotonergic medications and that too only if large doses of fentanyl or tramadol are used or in susceptible individuals.[3] The patient in discussion was not on any serotonergic medications and authors had injected only 0.83 μg/kg of fentanyl and over 1 mg/kg of tramadol. They deferred injecting additional doses of fentanyl with the fear of developing chest wall rigidity, which did not appear by that time. Wooden chest syndrome usually occurs at much higher doses of fentanyl (12–15 μg/kg in an adult), or when the drug is injected at a rapid rate.[4] Lack of classical clinical presentation, the absence of administration of large doses of opioids and drug interaction with SRIs, makes the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome unlikely.",

      "title": "The effect of tobacco use on performance in a structure-from-motion task among patients with psychotic psychopathology.",
      "abstract": "Psychotic disorders are debilitating, in part, due to psychotic symptoms, like hallucinations or delusions. Additionally, patients with psychotic psychopathology (PwPP) typically display reduced cognitive performance on visual-spatial working memory and attention tasks. More recent work has found deficits in early visual processes among PwPP, including center-surround suppression and contour integration, suggesting that abnormal early sensory processing may contribute to distorted sensory percepts and/or hallucinations. One factor that may be relevant to cognitive and perceptual dysfunction in PwPP is nicotine use. PwPP are 2-3 times more likely to use tobacco, and there is evidence that nicotine use among PwPP may be associated with better cognitive functioning. One theory is that PwPP use nicotine to compensate for impaired attention and working memory. On the other hand, tobacco use might have a causal relationship with psychotic illness, as cigarette use among young people is associated with risk of developing psychosis. In terms of perception, we have found that PwPP report faster switch rates during a bi-stable structure-from-motion (SFM) task and that this is associated with smaller changes in pupil size during perceptual switches. This suggests abnormalities in attentional allocation to visual stimuli in this population. Here, we asked whether nicotine use was related to individual or group differences in SFM task performance among PwPP (n = 14), their biological relatives (n = 4), and healthy controls (n = 1). We found a trend towards a significant correlation between faster switch rates and increased tobacco use across groups. However, we did not see a significant correlation when only looking at the PwPP group or significant differences between users and non-users in overall switch rates. Our results suggest a relationship between higher tobacco consumption and greater perceptual dysfunction in our SFM task.",

      "title": "Hypnosis as an Adjunct to Anesthesia in Children",
      "abstract": "Most children anticipate the prospect of submitting to surgery and anesthesia with fear and apprehension. Youngsters who have to be given an anesthetic are afraid that something disastrous may happen to them while they are asleep. The child fears not only what he can understand but also what is less understandable, such as will he ever wake up or is he going to be killed? There are many connections in the child's mind between anesthesia, sleep, and death.1 When a child is brought to the operating room heavily premedicated or asleep, without having his fears allayed or his anxieties resolved, he will usually experience a nightmare of restlessness on recovery. During such a confused and stressful state, a child is more subject to psychic trauma than one who will recover quickly and quietly to a state of full consciousness and awareness.2 Sleep disturbances, temper tantrums, hallucinatory phenomena, and dependency reactions have been reported after surgical procedures where anesthesia was administered.3 In order to cope with this situa¬ tion, anesthesiologists in recent years have become more aware and better oriented to the psychological aspects of anesthesia for children.4·5 It is but a short step in inducing anesthe¬ sia in children with the use of stories, music, and flavoring agents to the superior effec¬ tiveness of an hypnotic induction. With children, relaxation by means of hypnosis is worth while. The comparative ease of inducing hypnosis in many children is a surprising finding. More than half of them can reach a sufficient hypnotic depth to permit minor surgical procedures, such as venipuncture, spinal tap, and reduction of simple fractures, to be performed. Hypnosis is a valuable method of inducing anesthesia or achieving basal anesthesia in children.6·7 Hypnotic inductions permit the use of posthypnotic suggestions that render recovery from anesthesia less distressing and more pleasant. Results in such cases are gratifying, because on recovery these children are quieter, more comfortable, and more cooperative than those who undergo anesthesia induced by chemical agents alone. Although hypnosis may be performed suc¬ cessfully in younger children on occasion, youngsters between the ages of 7 and 14 years are the most susceptible. These chil¬ dren usually make good subjects because of their heightened powers of imagination and their ability to play a role or create a fantasy. I try to use the child's own experiences—things with which he is famil¬ iar, so that better imagery can be produced. If children are admitted the day prior to surgery, a visit may be made in the after¬ noon or evening in order to take advantage of the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the child and to ascertain his area of interests. If it is possible to have a pre¬ liminary rehearsal of the hypnotic induction, it will serve the anesthesiologist well. How¬ ever, no attempt should be made to force the situation.

Apart from the commonly described passage (a brief hallucination of a person, animal, or object passing sideways, within the periphery of the visual field) and presence (sensation of someone or something being present nearby, in the absence of seeing it) hallucinations, a multimodal (visual and tactile) hallucination can be seen in patients with advanced PD, mostly with dementia.

Taste distortion or loss involves an impairment of this interaction and may be defined as dysgeusia (taste distortion), hypogeusia (reduced ability to taste), or ageusia (complete inability to taste). Medications have been reported to induce reversible and persistent taste disturbance in many patients. The mechanism by which medications alter taste is unknown, but there are many hypotheses. Patients may react to taste disturbances with decreased appetite, decreased dietary and nutrient intake, and/or increased use of salt or sugar. Management of taste disorders often includes discontinuation of the suspected offending agent.

Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor.

Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

The diagnosis, usually easy, may be beset with several traps: alcoholism may be unrecognized, or a diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome may be wrongly made, or again a complication may be either overlooked or erroneously suspected. An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months. Beside delirium tremens, with its mandatory and well-established treatment, prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and treatment of its initial stages raise no problems, as it consists above all of psychotherapy combined by such tranquillizers as febarbamate or a benzodiazepine taken in well-specified dosage.",

Il semble, parmi les médicaments, que l'incidence des convulsions induites par les antidépresseurs tricycliques était particulièrement importante. Parmi les substances illicites, l'utilisation accrue des psychostimulants, principalement de la cocaïne, s'accompagne également fréquemment de convulsions. Les crises convulsives induites par des toxiques sont souvent uniques et de courte durée, cédant parfois avant tout traitement. Elles peuvent cependant évoluer vers un état de mal épileptique. Si les mécanismes physiopathologiques sont similaires à ceux décrits dans l'épilepsie au sens large, il existe cependant quelques mécanismes de toxicité plus spécifique dont la connaissance peut avoir une implication thérapeutique. De même, des facteurs extraneurologiques peuvent aggraver la situation. De nombreuses complications des crises convulsives peuvent être décrites, notamment cardiocirculatoires. Acute or chronic poisoning by drugs, illicit substances, environmental agents can cause seizures with a variable incidence. Seizures may be explained by the intrinsic properties of the drug or toxic agent. Among drugs, the incidence of tricyclic antidepressants induced seizures was particularly high. The increasing use of psychostimulants, like cocaine, is also responsible for frequent seizures. Drug induced seizures are usually brief, single, generalized tonic–clonic and self-limiting. They can even stop before any drug administration. However, they may evolve in some instances to status epilepticus. The mechanisms involved in drug induced seizures are rather similar to those observed in epileptic seizures. Yet, more specific mechanisms are also encountered and they will modify the therapeutic decisions. Also, extraneurological disorders could worsen the clinical condition. Several complications are described, including cardiocirculatory failure.",

The most frequent triggers of anaphylaxis in childhood are food, insect venom, drugs, exercise, etc. In some cases, the presence of more than one trigger is necessary for the allergic reaction, while one trigger alone is tolerated. This rare condition is called summation anaphylaxis (SA). Food‐dependent exercise‐induced anaphylaxis is the most well‐known SA. However, SA may also occur with the association between food and/or exercise plus one or more of the following other cofactors, such as drugs, especially non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAID), alcohol, infections, temperature variation, and menstrual cycle. SA can explain some cases of idiopathic anaphylaxis, as well as cases of an apparent breakdown in a previously acquired tolerance for food, or finally, when faced with a suggestive clinical history of food allergy or exercise anaphylaxis and the provocation test is negative. In these situations, a more careful clinical history looking for other cofactors is necessary.",

There is an accompanying anxiety associated with the aversive stimulus or with difficulties in verbal expression, as in the case of brain damaged patients. The diskinetic movements are initially Voluntary movements aiming at removing the aversive stimulus (stage of voluntary movements). If they succeed in reducing the accompanying anxiety, the reduction of anxiety reinforces the diskinetic response. In a subsequent stage, these movements lose their laborious voluntary quality and become automatic (stage of automatic movements). In a final stage, the diskinetic movements become instrumental in reducing anxiety in the absence of the aversive stimulus (stage of instrumentalization). The question is raised whether drug-induced oral diskinesia can be placed under the general rubric of tics, as a special drug-induced form of it.",

These phenomena can occur shortly after patients have started to take antipsychotics, for some time or even for a long time after. Patients who choke frequently or take rapid, irregular breaths interspersed with groans or sighs need to be observed closely. Risk factors are high doses of and long-term use of antipsychotics. Clinical examination of the gag reflex and the respiration contributes very little to an unequivocal diagnosis of swallowing disorders. However, swallowing disorders can be identified reliably by means of videofluoroscopy. Treatment that involves an adjustment of a patient's medication can often be effective.Timely recognition of asphyxia is vital for the prevention of a life-threatening complication arising from the use of antipsychotics.",

The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

A nivel biologico las alteraciones que se producen en el organismo debido a la malnutricion y las conductas purgativas deben ser tenidas en cuenta para no confundir las manifestaciones psicologicas debidas a alteraciones somaticas con trastornos de la personalidad, ni con interacciones familiares disfuncionales. Por otro lado el abordaje puramente somatico es necesario, ya sea normalizando las constantes vitales, recetando farmacos psicotropos, o regulando una dieta adecuada. A nivel psicologico las alteraciones de la personalidad previa, una deficiente autoimagen y baja autoestima que se asientan sobre una base depresiva, se ven incrementadas por las conductas alimentarias disfuncionales. Estas alteraciones psicologicas deben ser estudiadas en detalle para incluirlas como objetivo terapeutico (Espina, 2003). A nivel social, la moda de la delgadez y el exito en la sociedad occidental, hace que personas susceptibles sean mas vulnerables a padecer trastornos alimentarios. Por otro lado, las relaciones familiares pueden tener unas caracteristicas, especialmente la dificultad de autonomizacion de sus miembros y las alteraciones de la comunicacion, que son terreno abonado para la aparicion de trastornos alimentarios en personas susceptibles. Estos factores, junto con acontecimientos vitales estresantes (separaciones, perdidas, fracasos...), pueden jugar un papel etiologico y, cuando el TCA esta establecido, actuar como factores de mantenimiento (Espina, 1998a).",

The chronic intoxication model is produced by daily injections of a small dose of MAP into animals for several weeks or months. Behavioral studies with various species of animals from guinea pigs to monkeys produced essentially the same disorders as those observed in human abusers. Specifically, monkeys manifest psychotic behaviors, which appear to result from perceptual-cognitive disturbances, as well as enduring autistic behavior disorders that resemble the defect symptoms in chronic schizophrenia. Furthermore, the psychotic behaviors were found to have a high relapse liability; they recurred readily after the readministration of the drug or under nonspecific stress conditions. The difference and relationship between the chronic MAP intoxication model and the amphetamine stereotypy (acute intoxication) model are discussed.",

Not all patients have all symptoms. When cataplexy is present, the disorder is almost always due to a destruction by the immune system of about 70,000 brain cells that produce a chemical called hypocretin. As this chemical helps in staying awake and regulating sleep and muscle tone, the lack of hypocretin explains all the symptoms of narcolepsy. In these cases of narcolepsy, the disease is life-long and does not resolve. When cataplexy is not present, many causes may be involved and the diagnosis is more difficult. Evolution and response to treatment are also more variable. Narcolepsy is diagnosed using sleep tests, biochemical measures and occasionally by measuring hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after a lumbar puncture. Current treatments involve medication and behavioral, life styles changes.",

Whereas the majority of consumers make a ((soft)) use of cannabis, there is a minority of problematic cannabis users. However, many of cannabis chronic effects are still controversial, especially regarding the causal nature of their relationship with cannabis use. There is a scientific consensus to claim that cannabis induces a state of dependence in a small proportion of users. Severe abuse of cannabis can also lead to cognitive impairments, especially on memory, although these effects usually improve after the cessation of cannabis use. The statistical link between cannabis use and the development of psychotic disorders is more worrying, although the causal nature of this relationship remains controversial. Finally, a chronic abuse of cannabis is reputed to induce an amotivational syndrome, mainly characterized by a state of apathy. Although the symptoms of the amotivational syndrome are in keeping with some clinical observations, it remains difficult to ascertain whether this clinical picture is causally produced by cannabis abuse.",

The second half explores the story behind the diagnostic terminology used in clinical practice today, and describes the recent changes to the addiction section of the major classificatory systems. Addiction is conceptualised as a disorder involving a loss of the normal flexibility of human behaviour, leaving a dehumanised state of compulsive behaviour (‘overwhelming involvement’). It has acquired a variety of terminology over time, much of it inferring moral weakness. Addiction may be associated with psychoactive substances or other pleasurable behaviours and occurs on a spectrum of use and harms, which vary in severity. The term ‘dependence’ may refer to physiological aspects of addiction (tolerance or withdrawal), but is also used to define the severe end of the spectrum. Confusion around this terminology has led to it being removed from the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5).",

The classic phenomena of hypnosis, such as sensory anaesthesias, analgesia, amnesia, and posthypnotic suggestion, provide prima facie evidence of altered consciousness, but some theorists contend that these are the products of normal mental processes, such as suggestion and expectation. In this article, hypnosis is viewed against a general framework for describing ASCs in terms of four converging operations: induction procedure, subjective experience, behavioural correlates, and physiological correlates. Although ŉeutral’ hypnosis, in the absence of specific suggestions, has few distinctive characteristics, many of the classic phenomena of hypnosis involve dissociations between explicit and implicit memory, or perception, such that percepts, memories, and thoughts influence ongoing experience, thought, and action outside conscious awareness and control.",

The presence of third parties or the use of tape recorders are not satisfactory for the prevention of delusion formation. Rather, the physician using hypnosis should focus upon: (a) preliminary psychological evaluation and selection of patients free from disposition to delusion formation; (b) awareness of his own emotional responses to the patient. Attention to these factors will minimize the chance of delusion formation after the use of hypnosis.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Background: Catatonia is a syndrome of altered motor behavior that is mostly associated with general medical, neurologic, mood and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The association of newly onset catatonic symptoms with hyponatremia has been rarely reported in the literature. Case Presentation: We present a rare case of a young female patient with schizophrenia, who presented with catatonic symptoms in the context of hyponatremia due to water intoxication. The symptoms were eliminated with the correction of hyponatremia. There are only a few reports of hyponatremia-associated catatonia in psychiatric and non-psychiatric patients. Sometimes, catatonic symptoms may co-occur with newly onset psychotic symptoms and confusion, suggesting delirium. In several cases, the catatonic symptoms responded to specific treatment with benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy. Conclusion: Hyponatremia may induce catatonic symptoms in patients, regardless of underlying mental illness, but this phenomenon is even more relevant in patients with a psychotic or mood disorder, which may itself cause catatonic symptoms. It is important for clinicians not to attribute newly-onset catatonic symptoms to the underlying psychotic or mood disorder without measuring sodium serum levels. The measurement of sodium serum levels may guide treating psychiatrists to refer the patient for further investigation and appropriate treatment.",

Phenomenological details of visitor experiences are expected to reflect the functions of deep temporal lobe structures; common details involve cosmic meaningfulness, vestibular experiences, flickering, complex visual sensations and alimentary references. After intense experiences, interictal-like behaviors similar to religious conversions (widening affect, sense of personal, desire to spread the word, concern about Man's destiny) emerge. Normal people who are prone to these experiences show frequent temporal lobe signs and specific personality characteristics that include enhanced creativity, suggestibility, mild hypomania, anxiety, and emotional lability. Learning histories that encourage the use of right temporal lobe functions for the consolidation of memory, such as compartmentalization of beliefs or repression due to early sexual abuse, predispose to intense visitor experiences. The most frequent precipitants are psychological depression, personal (existential) stress and proximal exposure to the focal tectonic strain fields that accompany luminous phenomena. Possible neuropsychological mechanisms are discussed.",

Behavioral measures are particularly important for neurotoxicity risk assessment since many known neurotoxicants do not result in neuropathology. The chlorinated hydrocarbon class consists of a wide variety of chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls, clioquinol, trichloroethylene, hexachlorophene, organochlorine insecticides (DDT, dicofol, chlordecone,dieldrin, and lindane), and phenoxyherbicides. Each of these chemicals has effects on motor, sensory, or cognitive function that are detectable using functional measures such as behavior. Furthermore, there is evidence that if exposure occurs during critical periods of development, many of the chlorinated hydrocarbons are developmental neurotoxicants. Developmental neurotoxicity is frequently expressed as alterations in motor function or cognitive abilities or changes in the ontogeny of sensorimotor reflexes. Neurotoxicity risk assessment should include assessments of the full range of possible neurotoxicological effects, including both structural and functional indicators of neurotoxicity.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

This is unfortunate because cannabis usage is often problematic. A dependency syndrome can develop, and then withdrawal symptoms can complicate the efforts to stop using the substance. There are many medical and mental health problems that occur with chronic cannabis usage, and these include, most seriously, psychoses (see Chapter 26) problems with memory, motivation, psychomotor coordination, irritability, anxiety, and a host of other psychological difficulties. Pulmonary problems can occur because of the smoking of the substance. Yet, despite the problems inherent in chronic usage and despite the large number of people who probably have developed dependency on the substance, there remains very little in the way of effective interventions. There are not enough trials to even attempt a meta-analysis of interventions. There are really no good pharmacologic interventions. Cognitive-behavioural therapy, enhanced by contingency management techniques such as the use of vouchers, seems most effective. There is some evidence that the longer the length of exposure to these behavioural interventions, the greater the chance of success in being able to stop using the substance.",

      "abstract": "Delayed awakening from anaesthesia remains one of the biggest challenges that involve anaesthesiologists. Most commonly, delayed awakening is due to drugs effects persistence. 1 The time taken to emerge to fully consciousness is affected by patient factors, anaesthetic factors, duration of surgery and painful stimulation. Non pharmacological causes may have serious sequel; thus recognising these organic conditions is important. 2 Unexpected delayed emergence after the use of general anaesthesia has a plethora of causes. 3 The most common cause for delayed awakening following anaesthesia is medications and anaesthetic agents used in the perioperative period. There may be an over dose of medications. Emergence from anaesthesia depends on the tissue uptake of the drug, average concentration used and the duration of exposure. Certain underlying metabolic disorders such as hypoglycaemia, severe hyperglycaemia, electrolyte imbalance especially hyponatremia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, central cholinergic syndrome, chronic hypertension, liver disease, hypoalbuminemia, uraemia and severe hypothyroidism may also be responsible for delayed recovery after anaesthesia. Preoperative medications such as opioids and sedatives and hypothermia can further interfere with postoperative recovery. Intraoperative cerebral hypoxia, haemorrhage, embolism or thrombosis also can manifest as delayed awakening from anaesthesia. The ultimate goal of treatment is to find the cause and treat the cause, but primary management is to maintain airway, breathing and circulation.",

      "title": "Arousal in Nocturnal Consciousness: How Dream- and Sleep-Experiences May Inform Us of Poor Sleep Quality, Stress, and Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "The term \"sleep experiences\", coined by Watson (2001), denotes an array of unusual nocturnal consciousness phenomena; for example, nightmares, vivid or recurrent dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations, dreams of falling or flying, confusional arousals, and lucid dreams. Excluding the latter, these experiences reflect a single factor of atypical oneiric cognitions (\"general sleep experiences\"). The current study is an opinionated mini-review on the associations of this factor—measured with the Iowa sleep experiences survey (ISES, Watson, 2001)—with psychopathological symptoms and stress. Findings support a strong relation between psychological distress and general sleep experiences. It is suggested that that they should be viewed as a sleep disturbance; they seem to represent involuntary intrusions of wakefulness into sleep, resulting in aroused sleep. These intrusions may stem from excessively thin boundaries between consciousness states (e.g., \"transliminality\"), or, conversely, they may follow an attempt at disconnecting mental elements (e.g., dissociation), which paradoxically results in a \"rebound effect\". The extent to which unusual dreaming is experienced as intrusive, rather than controlled, may explain why general sleep experiences are related to psychopathology, whereas lucid dreams are related to psychological resilience. In conclusion, the exploration of the interplay between psychopathology and sleep should be expanded from focusing almost exclusively on quantitative aspects (e.g., sleep efficiency, latency) to including qualitative conscious experiences which may reflect poor sleep quality. Taking into account nocturnal consciousness—including unusual dreaming and permeable sleep-wake boundaries—may unveil rich information on night-time emotional states and broaden our definition of poor sleep quality.",

Low dose use in the apathetic medically ill patient has been generally associated with only minimal, short lived side effects, which are detailed herein. Confusion may be worsened in already delirious patients. Anxiety, psychosis, cardiovascular effects, insomnia, and tremor may occur but infrequently require discontinuation. Appetite is normally stimulated in the medically ill. In fact, stimulants are frequently utilized in the medically ill largely because of their minimal toxicity. The history of U.S. stimulant abuse in the twentieth century is briefly discussed. Abuse of prescribed stimulants appears to be infrequent. Over-zealous concern regarding abuse has previously led to unfortunate declines in appropriate utilization of stimulants, e.g., for attention deficit disorder. Guidelines for prescribing stimulants in light of abuse potential are included.",

This article reviews the clinical effects and treatment of persons who use cocaine, methamphetamines, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), synthetic cannabinoids, and synthetic cathinones (\"bath salts\"). Cocaine blocks the reuptake of the monoamine transporters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Immediate clinical effects include increased energy and euphoria, as well as hypertension and arrhythmias. Acute myocardial infarction, seizures, hallucinations, hyperthermia, and movement disorders are among the possible adverse effects. Like cocaine, methamphetamine blocks reuptake of monoamine transporters, but also stimulates dopamine release and has a longer duration of action. Methamphetamine misuse is associated with severe dental problems. MDMA is a stimulant and psychedelic with a chemical structure similar to serotonin. Adverse effects include serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, long-term memory impairment, and mood disorders. Synthetic cannabinoids can have a more intense and long-lasting effect than natural cannabis. Acute intoxication may cause severe cardiac and respiratory complications and seizures. Synthetic cathinones are marketed as cheap substitutes for other stimulants. Their effects are similar to those of other stimulants, and they are addictive. Psychosocial intervention is the main form of treatment for addiction to these substances. Promising therapies include disulfiram and substitution therapy for cocaine misuse disorders, and mirtazapine for methamphetamine use disorder.",

The case of Emma, who was presented to the pediatric emergency room, with numerous physiological complaints, such as; dizziness, severe headache, unconsciousness, vomiting. Specific examinations showed the absence of any possible organic cause. Based on the sessions conducted with the patient, it appears that the girl was sexually abused. During the clinical conversation, the patient is very withdrawn, isolated and does not want to talk. Appreciating her silence, the use of art therapy was seen as appropriate. Art therapy reached very interesting findings, which were later confirmed by other medical examinations as well as subsequent conversations with the patient. Art therapy was used to assess her emotional, cognitive and rational state. Its use increased the efficiency of assessment and promoted the definition of treatment objectives.

The effects on sleep depend on the substance used, but it has been shown that both during use and in withdrawal periods consumers have various sleep problems, and basically more fragmented sleep. We know that sleep problems must be taken into account to prevent addiction relapses. Objectives To explain the different sleep disorders caused by substances such as alcohol and cannabis Methods As an example of this, two cases are introduced: the first one, a 17-year-old boy, who is diagnosed with ADHD with daily cannabis use since the age of 14. As a result of reducing consumption, he presents an episode of sleep paralysis that he had not previously had. The second one is a 50-year-old man diagnosed with a personality disorder and with dependence on cannabis and alcohol for years. He currently has abstinence from alcohol for months and maintains daily cannabis use. However, he has long-standing sleep pattern disturbances and frequent depersonalization phenomena at night. Results Alcohol at low doses has no clear effects on sleep architecture. At higher doses it decreases sleep latency, as well as awakenings. In chronic alcoholic patients, a decrease in deep slow sleep, and more fragmented sleep have been found. Cannabis withdrawal reduces sleep quality, increases latency, and produces strange dreams. Conclusions There is a positive relationship both between having a substance use disorder and suffering from a sleep disorder. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic, piperazinoazepine compound and is a noradrenergic, adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic-antagonist antidepressant that is used for the treatment of major depression and other psychiatric illnesses. There are several reported cases of manic/hypomanic episodes induced by mirtazapine withdrawal based on suspected clinical symptoms that were not confirmed by autopsy and toxicology. We present the first reported case of mirtazapine withdrawal-induced mania/hypomania associated with sudden death and confirmed by autopsy and toxicology. Our patient was a 26-year-old male who had been diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder, borderline intellectual functioning, polysubstance abuse, mild mental retardation, and attention deficit hyperactive disorder. He took only mirtazapine in the final and terminal weeks of his life and stopped taking mirtazapine 4 days before his death. He exhibited a sudden manic/hypomanic episode and died during a physical altercation during this episode. A full autopsy with comprehensive toxicologic analysis of his body fluids and tissues was performed. Autopsy revealed that he died from blunt force trauma of the head, neck, and trunk with extremely low and markedly subtherapeutic levels of mirtazapine and desmethylmirtazapine in the blood (mirtazapine: 0.005 mg/L; desmethylmirtazapine 0.011 mg/L). Advanced selective radioligand and neurochemical assays for density and affinity-binding parameters of dopamine transporter and heat shock protein 70 did not reveal any evidence of excited delirium or autonomic hyperactivity state. We recommend that toxicologic analysis of blood for antidepressants should become routine parts of autopsy protocols for the investigation of sudden death following terminal manic/hypomanic episodes for further elucidation of mania/hypomania induced by antidepressant withdrawal.",

The human desire to avoid suffering powerfully shapes our behavior, extremely so in the face of torture, more routinely when coping with chronic pain [1]. Thus, a suffering patient confronts the clinician with both a professional and personal dilemma, particularly in the context of the remnants of opiophobia in society (such as in sectors of the medical profession and in regulatory groups):\n\n“Should I withhold pain-relieving medication (e.g., engage in torture) and expose the patient to the well-established deleterious consequences of untreated pain; or, should I prescribe opioids, risking (hypothetically) consequences to the patient, such as addiction, and risking professional sanction or even criminal investigation?”\n\nWe now justify using opioids for pain control, in the face of opiophobia, with the notion that uncontrolled pain has a more deleterious effect on functioning than do the opioids themselves [2]. The work of Zaczny and others [3–4], which is primarily based upon studies of persons with opioid addiction, not chronic pain, suggests that cognitive impairment is minimal on stable doses of opioids. Our collective clinical experience in pain medicine suggests that the benefits of pain relief from opioids, for example, helping someone to concentrate on the tasks of driving, to remain at work, or to sleep at night to avoid fatigue-related impairment …",

The phenomenon became of concern when information became available about the first cases of tragic health consequences. Raising the awareness of youth about the level of imminent danger and serious consequences associated with the use of legal highs may be a very effective way to develop appropriate attitudes of young people, and in the light of their own health can help them take proper life decisions.\"Legal highs\" are substances of natural or synthetic origin having psychostimulating properties. These compounds may differ in chemical structure, potency, half-life, metabolism and severity of side effects. Their pharmacological activity is associated with changes in the neurotransmitter system. After higher doses of \"legal highs\" psychotic symptoms may occur: visual and auditory hallucinations resembling schizophrenic endogenous psychoses. An alarming fact is the underestimation of the adverse effect of these substances on human health. Any actions aimed at improving this situation are extremely important; therefore, in one of the key projects undertaken at the Institute of Rural Health in Lublin, in cooperation with other scientific institutes, concerned the analysis of a selected series of \"legal highs\".

      "title": "Promises of Caffeine in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: From Animal Models to Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common chronic childhood-onset psychiatric disorders. ADHD persists in many cases into adulthood, the occurrence which is associated with attentional deficits, hyperactivity, and/or cognitive impulsiveness. A primary role of disturbances in frontocortical dopaminergic neurotransmission in ADHD is the basis for the current pharmacological treatment with psychostimulants, mainly methylphenidate. However, there is considerable evidence that nondopaminergic alterations, including alterations in adenosinergic neuromodulation, also occur in different brain areas. We now examine findings reported in clinical and animal studies to provide a comprehensive summary of the effects of caffeine, a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, in ADHD. Additionally, we investigate the effects of caffeine and physical exercise on emotional impairments observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), a validated animal model of ADHD. Methods: Male SHRs were submitted from adolescence (30 days old) to adulthood to the association of caffeine intake (0.3 mg/mL in drinking water) plus voluntary physical exercise in running wheels during 6 weeks. After that, depressive- and hedonic-like behaviors were evaluated in the forced swimming test (FST) and splash test. Findings: The clinical use of caffeine remains poorly investigated so far and the available results have been generally positive but somewhat inconsistent, which can be largely attributed to methodological concerns. In contrast, many studies have shown that caffeine treatment improved memory and attention deficits and also normalized dopaminergic function in adolescent and adult SHRs. In this study, we provide a comprehensive view of the effects of caffeine in ADHD and in SHRs, and we include new findings from our research group supporting the potential of caffeine and physical exercise in improving depressive-like behaviors of SHRs. Conclusion: Altogether, the evidence indicates that caffeine is a promising therapeutic tool to improve cognitive and emotional symptoms in ADHD. Thus, further controlled clinical studies are necessary with a careful adjustment of the doses of caffeine to adequately exploit this potential.",

Researchers have identified cases of bipolar disorder in all age groups studied, including preschoolers. The existence of Bipolar Disorder in children and adolescents has been a controversial issue throughout the history of child psychiatry and there is few data on the natural course and long-term outcome of early-onset bipolar disorder, especially in the pre-pubescent age.\r\nManic episodes are defined as states of joy or excitement not consistent with the circumstances of the individual and range from increased animation (hypo mania) to an almost uncontrollable violent excitement. Although overall mania is associated with bipolar disorder, it is important to note that manic episodes may be secondary to metabolic or neurological disorders or the manifestation of an adverse reaction to a drug. Among the drugs which could cause the occurrence of episodes of mania and hypomania are: dopaminergic antiparkinsonian, sympathomimetic drugs, antidepressants, anticholinergics, steroids and antibiotics.

      "abstract": "Psychosis, a break in reality which is manifested as hallucinations, delusions or the disruption in thought process, is the hallmark of schizophrenia. Despite novel pharmacotherapy advancements of antipsychotic medications that have resulted in some patients having the ability to return to social settings and thereby decreasing psychotic symptoms and reducing hospital admissions, there is still a sub-population of patients who remain symptomatic. Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is defined as failure of treatment with at least two different antipsychotics with the proper length of treatment and titration. Clozapine has been heralded as a drug to resolve the puzzle of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine has one side effect that is well known, being the development of agranulocytosis. However, there is another side effect that can limit clozapine’s use and can also be life-threatening. Recently, at the end of January 2020, the FDA issued a communications statement which “[strengthened] an existing warning that constipation caused by the schizophrenia medicine clozapine can, uncommonly, progress to serious bowel complications.” After identifying ten cases of constipation from between 2006 to 2016 that progressed to hospitalization, surgery, and even death, the FDA focused their attention on this often overlooked, common side effect, especially when considering the strong anticholinergic effects of clozapine. Although patients are screened by their physicians for agranulocytosis by weekly lab monitoring, constipation is also a complication that needs to be identified and treated. Much like opioid-induced constipation, constipation can also be reduced with the use of laxatives and reduction in the co-prescribing of anticholinergic therapies with clozapine.",

Accepted for publication June 5, 1997.Address reprint requests to Dr. Gerancher: Assistant Professor, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University Hospital, Stanford, California 94305.Key words: anesthetic techniques, spinal/anesthetics, local, lidocaine/complications, neurologic, cauda equina syndrome/toxicity, neurotoxicity.Cauda equina syndrome has been recognized as a rare, devastating complication of spinal anesthesia since Ferguson et al. [1]focused attention on the syndrome in 1937. The syndrome results when diffuse injury occurs across the lumbosacral nerve roots, producing varying degrees of three specific symptoms: saddle anesthesia, sphincter (bowel and bladder) dysfunction, and paraplegia. [2]Cauda equina syndrome has complicated spinal anesthesia administered with a single injection of dibucaine, piperocaine, procaine, mepivacaine, and tetracaine. [3,4]Previously, lidocaine spinal anesthesia has been associated with cauda equina syndrome only when repeated, large doses of the drug were administered through a continuous spinal catheter. [5-10]We now report a case of cauda equina syndrome after single spinal injection of 100 mg lidocaine, 5%.A healthy 74-yr-old man was scheduled for elective inguinal hernia repair during spinal anesthesia. With the patient in sitting position, clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained at the L3-L4 interspace with a single insertion of a 25-gauge Whitacre spinal needle using an unexpired, custom-supplied spinal tray (B. Braun Medical, Bethlehem, PA). Approximately 0.2 ml of CSF were aspirated before the injection of 100 mg of 5% lidocaine in 7.5% dextrose (Astra USA Inc., Westborough, MA), with 0.2 mg of epinephrine (Elkins-Sinn Inc., Cherry Hill, NJ) added. The direction of the spinal needle side-port and the speed of injection were not noted, and CSF was not aspirated after injection. No blood or paresthesia was encountered during placement. A T8 upper sensory level was obtained to testing by pinprick, and adequate surgical anesthesia was present. The patient received 1000 cc of lactated Ringer's solution, 2 mg of midazolam (Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ) intravenously for sedation, experienced no hypotension, and required no pharmacologic blood pressure support.The patient's upper sensory spinal level receded to T10 in the postanesthesia care unit, and he was able to move his legs on arrival to his day surgery room 1 h after the completion of surgery. Approximately 12 h after initiation of spinal anesthesia, the patient was ambulating but complaining of a numb perineum and the inability to void. He was then easily catheterized, spent 24 h in the hospital, and was discharged with an indwelling urinary catheter and an initial diagnosis of mechanical bladder outlet obstruction. After 3 days, at follow-up examination with his surgeon, he had no improvement in his symptoms and complained of persistent constipation.Subsequent urologic evaluation 6 days after surgery revealed a saddle distribution of sensory deficit, a decreased bulbocavernosus reflex, an intact anal reflex, and a small prostate and normal bladder without evidence of mechanical obstruction on cystoscopic examination. Cauda equina syndrome was suspected, and neurologic consultation was obtained at 3 weeks. Neurologic assessment was consistent with a diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome, revealing hypesthesia in the S2-S4 dermatomes. Results of a magnetic resonance image (MRI) without contrast were normal, and those of a cystometrogram after 4 months were consistent with a diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome demonstrating normal sensation, normal capacity, and detrusor hyporeflexia. Five months after surgery, the patient is able to have spontaneous bowel movements on a high fiber diet but still has perineal hypesthesia and remains unable to void spontaneously. The manufacturers of the custom spinal trays and of the spinal medications have been contacted.This patient's symptoms of perineal anesthesia, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and decreased reflexes are consistent with cauda equina syndrome and are similar to all the previously reported cases (Table 1). Just how a modern spinal anesthetic might be associated with cauda equina syndrome has been the focus of considerable investigation and debate. Maldistribution of hyperbaric local anesthetics has been implicated [11]because many of the patients with cauda equina syndrome had inadequate continuous spinal anesthesia despite repeated and relatively large local anesthetic doses. Evidence generated in spinal models in vitro suggests that neurotoxic concentrations of local anesthetics are attainable when repeated doses of hyperbaric local anesthetic are administered through a continuous spinal catheter. [7,12,13]Single doses of hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, administered in spinal models through 25-gauge and 27-gauge Whitacre needles also can produce maldistribution [14]and potentially neurotoxic concentrations. [15]The neurotoxic potential of lidocaine has been most recently characterized in vivo in a rat model with the spinal administration of lidocaine, 5%, wherein toxicity is not altered by the presence of 7.5% glucose [16]but is enhanced by the presence of epinephrine.*When hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, has been used clinically in the absence of a spinal catheter, neurologic deficits consistent with maldistribution or neurotoxicity have been rare. Two instances of isolated sensory deficits have been reported. [15]One report was of a prolonged, but transient perineal hypesthesia in a volunteer who received 100 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, via a 25-gauge Whitacre needle; the other was a report of permanent perineal hypesthesia in a volunteer who received 200 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, in two administrations via separate 27-g Whitacre needles. Cauda equina syndrome not been described before the current report. Despite this record of clinical safety over the past 40 yr, Astra USA has revised the prescribing information for hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, as discussed in a recent \"Dear doctor\" letter (Table 2), [17]referring to the reported cases of cauda equina syndrome after repeated injection, animal and in vitro studies, and recent reports of \"transient postoperative radicular pain associated with 5% lidocaine.\"This new prescribing information was not present in the package insert used in this case report; these new guidelines were not followed, and there still remains no definite clinical evidence that following them would have prevented cauda equina syndrome in this patient. This report serves to document that spinal anesthesia administered in a single injection through a small gauge pencil tip needle, epinephrine, and as little as 100 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, have now been associated with cauda equina syndrome.*Hashimoto K, Nakamura Y, Hampl K, Ciriales R, Bollen A, Drasner K: Epinepherine increases the neurotoxic potential of intrathetically administered local anesthetic in the rat (Abstract pending publication per Drasner K).

      "abstract": "Asterixis (flapping tremors) is a movement disorder due to cortical or subcortical pathology that usually indicates serious underlying disease processes such as encephalopathy secondary to severe hepatic dysfunction, metabolic derangements, toxic agents, or serious adverse drug events. Mood stabilizers such as valproate and carbamazepine with or without concomitant administration of antipsychotics such as clozapine and risperidone have been implicated to induce asterixis. Lithium, a first-line mood stabilizer drug for geriatric mania, with its unique profile of side-effects due to narrow therapeutic window, is very rarely implicated to induce asterixis, especially when used as a monotherapy. We report a case of lithium-induced asterixis, ataxia, acute cognitive impairment, and altered sensorium in an elderly male with first-episode of mania, both during toxic and therapeutic serum levels of lithium. This case highlights the association between asterixis, ataxia, delirium, and lithium, substantiating the dictum “start low and go slow” in geriatric psychopharmacology.",

      "title": "Considering Ketamine for Treatment of Comorbid Pain, Depression, and Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "The use of ketamine for treatment of comorbid pain, depression, and substance use disorders (SUDs) is becoming an option of increasing interest, as multiple clinical studies demonstrate its efficacy. Ketamine's efficacy in this diagnostically complex population is mechanistically based on a wide array of affected brain areas in addition to presynaptic neurons of the spine. Efficacy has been shown in both depressive and pain disorders with durability lasting 3 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of ketamine. Although ketamine itself is a drug of potential abuse when used recreationally, its lasting effects without repeated daily use have also shown promise for patients with SUDs. Assisted psychotherapy concurrent with ketamine treatment can help dependent patients cultivate new perceptions and ideals consistent with sobriety. Decreased opiate cravings in patients with SUDs may be related to ketamine's effects on reducing opiate-induced hyperalgesia. Given this and additional properties, ketamine can help reduce opiate medication burden, augment opiates in the hospice setting, or acutely alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal.

      "abstract": "This study reports practice-based clinical evidence related to observations of two novel pathophysiologic visual phenomena reported by certain patients to have persisted following the psychological trauma of an acute-fear The initially obscure visual phenomena were initially investigated heuristically in psychiatric, psychological, and ophthalmic practices and subsequently characterized over 25 years.The first phenomenon:A visual image of what had been seen and felt during the most frightening moment of an acute-fear experience is immediately stored abnormally, and subsequently recalled abnormally as an experiential hallucinatory-like visual-image and other sensory-memory flashback. The second phenomenon:An abnormality of vision of peripheral oscillopsia, persisting from the time of the same acute-fear experience. The third phenomenon: A high probability of stepwise simultaneous elimination of both visual phenomena follows the maneuver of repeatedly exposing each voluntarily evoked visual-image and other sensory memory to volitional rapid side-to-side eye movements, as per one aspect of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.This maneuver leaves the memory stored and recalled normally (i.e., nonexperientially) and vision oscillopsia-free. Clinical features of patients with the visual phenomena are unique to each patient.The authors report further observations over 25 years on the wide spectra of difficulty, intensity, and/or obtrusiveness of each of the three visual phenomena and of three closely related clinical features. Relevant clinical findings pertaining to the visual phenomena in 100 recent consecutively referred patients are reported.The strong inference of these observations induces a schema: a further refinement of the construct posttraumatic stress disorder, together with a visual state marker.",

Objectives To reveal features of disease progression, interference of combined mental pathology, treatment specifics, markers of possible harmful behavior. Methods Psychopathological, Multichannel eyes closed resting EEG in interictal period. Results Patient N, 39 years old, manifested her illness at age 13 with affective bipolar disorder; phases lasted several months each. From age 19, rare recurrent generalized convulsive paroxysms preceded by an aura; non-convulsive paroxysms were observed. The patient was uncritical of paroxysms and discontinued anticonvulsive therapy. At age 29 and 30 she suffered two psychotic attacks (lasting several weeks) with sensory delusions of meaning, staging, persecution, megalomaniacal ideas of apocalyptic content (ideas that she was responsible for possible outbreak of nuclear war, coming of the Apocalypse, her son was the antichrist). Delusional behavior (tried to take the naked infant out into the cold, throwing him out of the window). Anticonvulsive therapy accompanied by antipsychotic medications. Schizoaffective disorder and epilepsy diagnosed. From age 35, acute psychotic attacks with apocalyptic delirium preceded by the same aura lasted maximum one day, followed by partial amnesia. Epileptiform polyspikes (up to 150 μV) registered in the right temporal-central EEG leads. Conclusions Presence of religious delusion in combined schizoaffective disorder and epilepsy, requires special approach: combination of anticonvulsants and antipsychotics. Religiosity of patient should be taken into account as well. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Results: data contributed by the PNSD reveal that more than 2% of the Spanish population admit to having consumed this substance that acts on the serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and glutaminergic neurotransmission systems. LSD and its analogues have been used as experimental psychotomimetics, although there are several disadvantages associated with them (rapid tolerance to subjective effects and visual hallucinations) that reduce the credibility of the hallucinogenicpsychedelic model of the schizophrenic syndrome. The most frequent psychiatric adverse effects that appear following LSD use-abuse are: anxiety disorders, mood disorders, perception disorders (persistent perception disorder due to hallucinogenic substances, flashbacks), and psychotic disorders. Treatment for these adverse effects is symptomatic, with anxiolytic and antipsychotic drugs being the most widely used. Finally, insofar as the potential therapeutic use of this substance both in psychedelic therapies and in alcoholism is concerned, few repercussions are found in both cases. Conclusions: LSD and other hallucinogenic drugs are substances used for recreational purposes, but that are not exempt of the potential to provoke psychiatric injury that can be prevented and adequately treated.",

      "abstract": "Clarithromycin-induced psychosis is a rare phenomenon; however, over the previous two decades, there has been increasing evidence linking psychotic episodes to the use of clarithromycin. The exact aetiology of this remains unclear, but several key hypotheses have arisen, including gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA-A) antagonism and active clarithromycin metabolites altering brain neurotransmitters such as glutamate. Recent evidence describes a broad range of symptoms, including delusions and catatonic states. Prior psychiatric comorbidities are a substantial risk factor. This case report describes the development of clarithromycin-induced psychosis in an 86-year-old patient with no prior psychiatric medical history, cognitive or functional impairment, and no other pathology found accountable for this neuropsychiatric disturbance. By acknowledging this rare adverse effect of clarithromycin and discontinuing the drug, the patient's psychotic symptoms resolved within 24 hours. Given the widespread use of clarithromycin, this case report demonstrates the importance of being aware of its rare neuropsychiatric adverse effects to diagnose this relatively unusual presentation.",

      "title": "Smartphone addiction through age and gender during Italian lockdown for COVID-19",
      "abstract": "Background: Nomophobia (no-mobile-phobia or Disconnection Syndrome) is the fear of not being able to consult your mobile phone, not being connected or traceable. This is an addiction to excessive smartphone usage related to the constant need to consult it to view notifications and updates. Like other forms of addiction, nomophobia is associated with excessive behaviors that lead to an increasing use of the phone to the point where it cannot do without it and the need to take it with it to any place or circumstance. The fear of not being connected consequently evokes reactions of excessive anxiety with specific physiological related (e.g., breathlessness, sweating, tremor, heart acceleration, sweating etc.). Nomophobia, however, is not included in anxiety disorders but is part of the pathological addictions to which it responds adequately. In fact, there are many behavioral and emotional analogies with other forms of addiction (including gambling) so the hypothesis that the abuse of the smartphone should be categorized as a real addiction can be accepted. The dependencies associated with the Internet and technologies that can be defined Dependencies 2.0, include the smartphone. During the Italian lockdown caused by COVID-19, the use of technologies has been the fundamental basis of adaptation for smart working, school and professional training, which has led to a change in the population lifestyle. Objective: The purpose of this work is to document the level of smartphone dependence that has occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Material and Methods: The NoMobilePhobia-Questionnaire (NMP-Q) was presented online to 1264 participants between the ages of 15 and 60. With regard to the selection of participants, approximately between the ages of 15 and 60, we used the method of random numbers: in fact, one participant for every hundred inhabitants was chosen in a randomized way. Finally, it was necessary for all participants to have access to the Internet. These dynamics have been acquitted in order to give us a valid representative sample. Results: The results show no significant main effects for the two factors taken into account (Gender and Age of participants). However the significant interaction shows that female participants reported on average higher scores on NoMobilePhobia-Questionnaire (NMP-Q) than males , for the younger age group (15 to 44), while for those over the age of 44, the average highest scores were for male participants. The main effects of the \"Sex\" factor [F(1,1256)= 3.179 and p=0.75] and \"Age_class\" [F(4,1253)=1.82 and p=0.12] are not significant; the interaction between the Sex-Age_class factors is significant with F(4,1253) =7.06 and p<.001 and an observed power close to 1 (0.99). The correlation between the Variable \"Score\" and the measure of the \"Age\" was found to be significant (negative) linear relationship (r of Pearson =-.093 and p<.001) considering the whole sample. Conclusions: One of the \"positive\" aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic is the use of the Internet and smartphones, and our analysis aimed to document the frequency of use in the Italian context with the NoMobilePhobia-Questionnaire. The results reveal the risk in some parts of the Italian population to develop forms of smartphone dependence, especially in circumstances that prohibit direct social interactions.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral components of altered consciousness include changed arousal, attention, motivation, sensory input, motor output, and cognitive and affective function. Cognitive hyperarousal predicts poor sleep quality, regardless of pain severity: Racing thought, intrusive thoughts, depressive cognitions, and worry. An accident causing concussion often is comorbid with an acute fearful or chronic generalized stress response that is initiated either acutely or after recovery of consciousness. Transient distortions of consciousness; cognition; speech, word-finding problems, and jargon; affect; sensory; and behavior. Parasomnias are unusual behaviors occurring during sleep: arousal disorders; sleep-wake transition disorders; disorders associated with rapid eye movement sleep; and other disorders. The risk of developing late posttraumatic seizures is strongly determined by the severity of brain injury. Hypersomnia is excessive sleepiness or sleeping and has a variety of psychological or physiological causes. Epilepsy is a recurrent brain disorder of multiple etiologies and is characterized by recurrent seizures due to the excessive discharge of cerebral neurones.",

      "title": "Interactions of Marihuana Constituents with Centrally-Acting Drugs.",
      "abstract": "Marihuana is a complex mixture containing various biologically active compounds in which cannabinoids are major components. The drug interaction of marihuana with other drugs is a serious problem in some cases since marihuana is often taken with other centrally-acting drugs. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is a main component responsible for most of the psychomimetic effects of marihuana, can potentiate the effects of many depressants, such as alcohol, barbiturates, anesthetics, morphine and anticonvulsants, in the central nervous system. The drug interaction of THC with other drugs is a functional mechanism in the central nervous system. THC has biphasic effects (stimulant and depressant) depending on, maily, doses. THC, therefore, interacts with stimulants as cocaine and phencyclidine in a complicated manner. Cross-tolerance in some effects of the components of marihuana and of other drugs has been recognized. Cannabidiol (CBD), which is another major component in marihuana but lacks psychomimetic activity, potentiates the effects of some specified drugs that terminates their effects through metabolic inactivation. The interaction of CBD with other drugs is considered to be metabolic in origin since the cannabinoid can suppress the gepatic microsomal drugmetabolizing enzymes. Drug interaction can also occur among cannabinoids, indicating the complexity of the combined effect of marihuana and other drugs. These are additives, synergistic or antagonistic, depending on the conditions used. This review describes the interactions of marihuana components with centrally-acting drugs in relation to their pharmacological and toxicological significance.",

In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

The relationship between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSDs) and catatonia has been previously discussed, with the three disorders interpreted as different manifestations of the same underlying brain disorder (the \"Iron Triangle\"). We discuss in this paper the diagnostic, clinical and therapeutic implications of this complex relationship in an adolescent with ASD, who presented an acute psychotic onset with catatonia, associated with mixed mood symptoms. Second-generation antipsychotics were used to manage psychotic, behavioral and affective symptoms, with worsening of the catatonic symptoms. In this clinical condition, antipsychotics may be useful at the lowest dosages, with increases only in the acute phases, especially when benzodiazepines are ineffective. Mood stabilizers with higher GABAergic effects (such as Valproate and Gabapentin) and Lithium salts may be more useful and well tolerated, given the frequent association of depressive and manic symptoms with mixed features.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

HIE is the term used to describe the resultant condition due to a deficit in the oxygen supply to the brain. The neonatal brain can have a lack of oxygen through two major pathogenetic mechanisms, hypoxemia, which is a diminished amount of oxygen in the blood supply, and ischemia, which is a diminished amount of blood perfusing the brain. During the perinatal period hypoxemia or ischemia or both occur as a result of asphyxia, an impairement in the exchange of respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide. The duration and severity of HIE depend of the severity of asphyxia. Neonatal asphyxial encephalopathy occurs in 1–2 per 1000 births in the high income countries (Marlow & Budge, 2005; Pierrat et al., 2005; Barkovich, 2005), in low-income countries, the incidence is much higher (Ellis et al., 2000; Black et al., 2010).",

All countries strive to fight it by any means necessary. The World Health Organization defines addiction as the compulsive desire to continue using or obtaining a substance by any means, with a tendency to increase the dose taken. This addiction causes psychological and physical dependence and a detrimental effect on both individuals and society. This complicates the treatment project process, especially if the patient/addict suffers from psychological and/or mental disorders associated with addiction. In particular, personality disorders have a direct impact on the behaviors, performance, functions and thinking patterns of the sufferer. As the latter adopts an unhealthy and rigid pattern that causes them and those around them to suffer several psychological, health, social, professional and relational problems... Relatedly, we decided to present a clinical case with a dual diagnosis, as this patient has been suffering from the consequences of addiction for many years accompanied by a personality disorder. As for the clinical symptoms that top the clinical board of the case, we find a complete aversion to his body as he has not looked in the mirror for nearly 30 years. The patient has lost the symbolic representation of his body as a physical reality through which it is located internally, externally and cognitively. This comes in addition to severe clinical suffering at the level of familial, social and professional relationships, which made him live in a state of permanent social isolation. In our therapeutic approach to the condition, we use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a common type of psychotherapy in a regular manner, through a limited number of therapeutic sessions. The therapeutic intervention was carried out at the level of perception of incorrect or negative thinking, which enabled difficult situations to be presented more clearly and responded to in a more effective manner.

      "abstract": "Neural hyperexcitability in the event of damage during early life, such as hyperthermia, hypoxia, traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, or a pre-existing neuroinflammatory condition, can promote the process of epileptogenesis, which is defined as the sequence of events that converts a normal circuit into a hyperexcitable circuit and represents the time that occurs between the damaging event and the development of spontaneous seizure activity or the establishment of epilepsy. Epilepsy is the most common neurological disease in the world, characterized by the presence of seizures recurring without apparent provocation. Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid derived from the subspecies Cannabis sativa ( CS ), is the most studied active ingredient and is currently studied as a therapeutic strategy: it is an anticonvulsant mainly used in children with catastrophic epileptic syndromes and has also been reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, supporting it as a therapeutic strategy with neuroprotective potential. However, the mechanisms by which CBD exerts these effects are not entirely known, and the few studies on acute and chronic models in immature animals have provided contradictory results. Thus, it is difficult to evaluate the therapeutic profile of CBD, as well as the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in epileptogenesis in the immature brain. Therefore, this review focuses on the collection of scientific data in animal models, as well as information from clinical studies on the effects of cannabinoids on epileptogenesis and their anticonvulsant and adverse effects in early life.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "title": "Human Pharmacology of MDMA",
      "abstract": "MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) is a widely misused psychostimulant drug abused among large segments of the young population. Pharmacologically it displays effects related to amphetamine-type drugs and a set of distinctive effects (closeness to others, facilitation to interpersonal relationship, and empathy) that have been named by some authors “entactogen” properties. MDMA is a potent releaser and/or reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). These actions result from the interaction of MDMA with the membrane transporters involved in neurotransmitter reuptake and vesicular storage systems. The most frequent effects after MDMA/ecstasy administration are euphoria, well-being, happiness, stimulation, increased energy, extroversion, feeling close to others, increased empathy, increased sociability, enhanced mood, mild perceptual disturbances, changed perception of colors and sounds, somatic symptoms related to its cardiovascular and autonomic effects (blood pressure and heart rate increase, mydriasis), and moderate derealization but not hallucinations. Acute toxic effects are related to its pharmacologic actions. The serotonin syndrome (increased muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, and hyperthermia), among others, is characteristic of acute toxicity episodes. MDMA metabolism is rather complex and includes 2 main metabolic pathways: (1) O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The fact that the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 partially regulates the O-demethylenation pathway prompted some expectations that subjects displaying the poor metabolizer phenotype may be at higher risk of acute toxicity episodes. In this metabolic pathway a mechanism-based inhibition of the enzyme operates because the formation of an enzyme–metabolite complex that renders all subjects, independently of genotype, phenotypically poor metabolizers after the administration of 2 consecutive doses. Therefore, the impact of CYP2D6 pharmacogenetics on acute toxicity is limited. One of the interesting features of MDMA metabolism is its potential involvement in the development of mid- to long-term neurotoxic effects as a result of progressive neurodegeneration of the serotonergic neurotransmission system.",

Two or more attacks could occur in a single night and were most common in the early morning hours. Family and personal histories did not show epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, or (with 1 exception) previous somnambulism. Electrographic investigation revealed that all patients had normal waking‐sleep cycles but that 4 of them had epileptiform abnormalities on their electroencephalograms. All patients were treated with either phenytoin or carbamazepine, with cessation of the abnormal nocturnal behavior during follow‐up periods ranging from 9 to 48 months. This syndrome appears to be distinct from more typical non–rapid eye movement dyssomnias and suggests an atypical form of epilepsy.",

In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities.

      "title": "Antidotes for Acute Cannabinoid Intoxication",
      "abstract": "The cannabis constituent Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), now being legalized for recreational and medical use, exerts its psychotropic effects (marijuana “high”) via CB1 receptor activation. Synthetic psychoactive cannabinoids (SPCs) such as JWH‐018, illegally sold as “designer drugs”, mimic the effects of THC, a CB1 partial agonist, with higher potency, acting via CB1 receptors. Although acute toxicity is benign for consuming high doses of THC, patients admitted to the ER may exhibit symptoms of hyperemesis, irritation of conjunctival and bronchial tissue, along with impaired cognition and motor skills. SPCs act as full CB1R agonists wherein clinical manifestations associated with their consumption include, neurotoxicity represented by several negative behavioral outcomes, and even death. While such adverse events may differ among patients, current adjunctive treatments include intubation, use of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antihistamines, adenosine, and hypnotics, along with i.v. saline, and supportive care. Currently, there are no effective treatments available for directly blocking and reversing the effects of cannabinoid poisoning. To address this critical public‐health issue, we have initiated a drug discovery program to develop antidotes that can counteract the intoxicating/adverse effects of CB1 activation and be therapeutically useful in an emergency setting. Although CB1 antagonists such as rimonabant appear to be promising pharmacotherapeutics, this class of drugs are known to produce nausea and unacceptable pro‐depressant effects. We have now discovered a novel class of potent, selective and brain penetrant CB1 antagonists, displaying better safety profiles as compared to rimonabant. In male CD‐1 mice, these novel CB1 antagonists represented by AM11503 (10 mg/kg, i.v), antagonized the hypothermic effect induced by THC (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and was equipotent to rimonabant (10 mg/kg, i.v.) in rapidly normalizing (≤ 60 min, post‐antagonist) the hypothermia induced by an acute dose of JWH‐018 (6 mg/kg, i.p). To mimic an ER‐like situation, antagonists were given i.v., 60 min post‐ JWH‐018, where the agonist effect is at its maximum. AM11503 (10 mg/kg, i.v or 18 mg/kg, i.p) displayed no side‐effects when compared to rimonabant and AM251, which, at similar doses, induced significant stereotypic behavior (pruritic responses). Remarkably, when tested for their ability to block the neurotoxic effects of SPCs, AM11503 (10 mg/kg, i.v.) fully blocked tremors and convulsions induced by “suprapharmacological” doses of JWH‐018 (18 mg/kg, i.p). Lead optimization efforts along with safety and efficacy studies are further underway. Here, we established proof‐of‐concept and present preliminary data towards developing the first specific antidote for cannabinoid intoxication.

This case was further complicated by the well-defined history of anorexia nervosa (binge-purge type), major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, migraine headache, and the initial denial of cannabis use. However, collateral history and a positive drug screen confirmed the diagnosis. The signs, symptoms and pathophysiological mechanisms of CHS are reviewed in light of clinical presentations that mimic eating disorder phenomenology complicated by addiction.

      "title": "The influence of stress on the transition from drug use to addiction.",
      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Acute psychotic states characterized by clinical lability and dream-like qualities are a staple of classic psychopatology. An excessive focus on diagnostic criteria for bipolar or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders risks missing this particular set of patients; defined through their dynamic presentation as much as by any cluster of symptoms or types of course. Objectives To explore the concept and relevance of oneroid-like cyclic psychosis through a clinical case and review. Methods We report the case of a 37 year old woman with bipolar disorder (three previous instances of manic episodes with psychotic symptoms) and various gynecological issues that required hormone therapy. After a couple of days having difficulty sleeping, the patient developed a clinical picture consisting of wide and sudden oscillations between hyperactive and inhibited psychomotor activity, moods of dread and ecstasy, and states of disorganized thought and childlike activities with perplexity and mutism. Frequent behaviors as if experiencing visual alucinations and repeated allusions to feeling as if in a dream. These symptoms lasted for 2-3 weeks, after treatment with risperidone and lithium. A narrative review concerning the case was also performed. Results Kleist’s ‘innate instability’ permeates much of the previous literature. Similar entities highlight different issues closely related to various biological rhythms: atypical psychosis and epilepsy, puerperal psychosis and estrogen dysregulation, cyclic psychosis and sleep disorders, delirious mania and effectiveness of electro-convulsive-therapy, etc. Conclusions Our findings point to the clinical relevance of oneiroid cyclic psychosis as innate instability. Further studies on the role of biological rhythms and its repercussions on daily practice are required. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

The average time of occurrence of psychotic symptoms in our 3 cases after beginning of MAP abuse was two or three years. 2.) Although the psychotic states (often schizophrenia-like) were stable for a short time, the symptoms recurred promptly after reinjection of a small amount of MAP, unspecific stress or drinking sake (flashback phenomenon). The recurrence may happen even after several years. 3.) In cases of chronic MAP-P disturbances of consciousness are rare. Chronic process of MAP-P cases may show acute transient disturbances of consciousness (flashback phenomenon). 4.) The change of affects and behaviour ranges between irritable and indifferent attitudes. While there are close connections between the disturbance of feeling and change of personality (Wesensänderung), it is very difficult to decide whether premorbid character traits are dominant or there is a change of personality or emotional disturbance. 5.) About acute psychic symptoms which are responsible for recurrence of MAP-P, MAP-abusers make the experience that their intimate personal affairs are overlooked and become public (uncovered defensive experiences). In chronic cases of MAP-P we often meet patients with hypertrophic self-feeling or delusion of grandeur predominant in the symptomatology. 6.) In our cases sensations were amalgamated into each other and there were hallucinatory experiences without clear division between them. 7.) In chronic cases the auditory hallucinations criticized or censured the patients for their behaviour. Thought echoing (Gedankenlautwerden) was found. We found signs of mind reading (Gedankenausbreitung).",

      "abstract": "Introduction It is difficult to establish whether a patient has late onset schizophrenia or frontotemporal dementia. The object of the following case report is to point out the difficulty of making a differential diagnosis between these two entities. Case summary A 49-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital after presenting with auditory and visual hallucinations, formal thought disorder, persecutory delusions, ideas of reference, insomnia. Memory, executive function and attentional tasks were severely compromised. Computerized tomography showed incipient frontal lobe atrophy. There were no significant abnormalities found in blood and urine samples or physical and neurological examinations. After showing no response to olanzapine, and extrapyramidal side effects to fluphenazine, risperidone was initiated which subsequently led to complete withdrawal of positive symptoms. Discussion Patients presenting with psychotic symptoms after the age of 40 presented a diagnostic quandary, as they were less likely to present with negative symptoms, formal thought disorder or affective blunting, and more likely to have systematised delusions and visual hallucinations. Frontotemporal dementia is a disorder that can present itself with cognitive decline and a large range of psychiatric symptoms. The risk of late onset schizophrenia is greater in women, possibly implicating a causative role of female sex hormones. Atypical antipsychotics risperidone and olanzapine seem to be an adequate treatment. Conclusion Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease with a large variety of clinical manifestations. Special care should be given to patients with age over 40, including neurocognitive assessment, laboratory and hormone tests, and a long-term follow-up.

      "abstract": "The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are the most frequent clinical conditions seen in practice. Up to 60% of these patients is also suffering from psychosocial problems. Therefore it is important to define the patient's complaints in terms of a biopsychosocial disorder, to acknowledge the relevance of the psychosocial aspects and to provide an integrated psychosomatic treatment or a psychotherapy if indicated. Most of the research on psychotherapy in FGID to date has focused on the irritable bowel syndrome and different methods of treatments were studied (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, dynamic psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, and relaxation). Randomised controlled studies have shown that psychotherapy is superior to conventional medical therapy. Hypnotherapy is successful not only for irritable bowel syndrome but also for functional dyspepsia. Predictors of a positive response to psychological treatment generally are: (1) awareness that stress exacerbates their bowel symptoms, (2) at least mild anxiety or depression, (3) the predominant bowel symptom is abdominal pain or diarrhea and not constipation, (4) the abdominal pain waxes and wanes in response to eating, defecation, or stress rather than being constant pain, and 5) the symptoms are of relatively short duration. Benefits persist over years, and in the long run, clinic visits and health care costs can be reduced.",

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

      "abstract": "Synesthesia is an extraordinary perceptual phenomenon, in which individuals experience unusual percepts elicited by the activation of an unrelated sensory modality or by a cognitive process. Emotional reactions are commonly associated. The condition prompted philosophical debates on the nature of perception and impacted the course of art history. It recently generated a considerable interest among neuroscientists, but its clinical significance apparently remains underevaluated. This review focuses on the recent studies regarding variants of color synesthesia, the commonest form of the condition.Synesthesia is commonly classified as developmental and acquired. Developmental forms predispose to changes in primary sensory processing and cognitive functions, usually with better performances in certain aspects and worse in others, and to heightened creativity. Acquired forms of synesthesia commonly arise from drug ingestion or neurological disorders, including thalamic lesions and sensory deprivation (e.g., blindness). Cerebral exploration using structural and functional imaging has demonstrated distinct patterns in cortical activation and brain connectivity for controls and synesthetes. Artworks of affected painters are most illustrative of the nature of synesthetic experiences.Results of the recent investigations on synesthesia offered a remarkable insight into the mechanisms of perception, emotion and consciousness, and deserve attention both from neuroscientists and from clinicians.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can produce various neuropsychiatric impairments and a high susceptibility to adverse effects of psychotropic medications. A 6-year-old boy developed symptoms of ADHD after head trauma at age 30 months. Three different psychostimulants, three tricyclic antidepressants, clonidine, bupropion, fluoxetine, and propranolol were either ineffective or produced adverse effects. Side effects mainly consisted of organic mood syndrome (despite the lack of apparent genetic or organic mood disorder), sympathomimetic intoxication, and sympathomimetic hallucinosis. Buspirone (10 mg q.i.d.) produced significant improvement in impulsivity and hyperactivity, but not in attention deficits. Methamphetamine (5 mg every morning), added to the buspirone, was effective in treating the remaining attentional symptoms. These treatments were readily tolerated, and the child has remained stable for 2 years on buspirone and methamphetamine. The symptoms of mood disorder were present only during stimulant or antidepressant treatment, and therefore the diagnosis of organic mood disorder did not apply. Apart from medication side effects, the child appeared to have an \"organically-based pharmacological vulnerability to mood disorder\" and postinjury ADHD (although comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions might have contributed to the complex clinical picture). This single case study was uncontrolled, did not involve drug withdrawal design, and used clinical observations rather than standardized measures. Further study is needed before buspirone can be viewed as safe or effective for treating TBI, but buspirone may be an attractive alternative for managing certain behavioral problems following brain injury, especially in patients sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic medications.",

Club drugs are chemical substances used recreationally in social settings. Use is increasingly frequent among young people, especially during all-night dance parties. All four agents have been classified as controlled substances. MDMA (\"ecstasy\") is available as a tablet, a capsule, and a powder; formulations may contain many adulterants. MDMA increases the release of neurotransmitters. The desired effects are euphoria, a feeling of intimacy, altered visual perception, enhanced libido, and increased energy. The most common adverse effects are agitation, anxiety, tachycardia, and hypertension. More serious adverse effects include arrhythmias, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis. Flunitrazepam is a potent benzodiazepine. At higher doses, the drug can cause lack of muscle control and loss of consciousness. Other adverse effects are hypotension, dizziness, confusion, and occasional aggression. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used primarily in veterinary practice. It may be injected, swallowed, snorted, or smoked. Like phencyclidine, ketamine interacts with the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel. Analgesic effects occur at lower doses and amnestic effects at higher doses. Cardiovascular and respiratory toxicity may occur, as well as confusion, hostility, and delirium. GHB, a naturally occurring fatty acid derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid, was introduced as a dietary supplement. Increasing doses progressively produce amnesia, drowsiness, dizziness, euphoria, seizures, coma, and death. Flunitrazepam, ketamine, and GHB have been used to facilitate sexual assault. Supportive care is indicated for most cases of club drug intoxication. The increasing abuse of MDMA, flunitrazepam, ketamine hydrochloride, and GHB, particularly by young people in social settings such as clubs, should put health care professionals on guard to recognize and manage serious reactions.",

Mechanisms underlying narcolepsy are not fully understood. Experimental data indicate that the disease is caused by a loss of hypocretin neurons in the hypothalamus, likely due to an autoimmune process triggered by environmental factors in susceptible individuals. Most patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy have very low hypocretin-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. An appropriate clinical history, polysomnogram, and multiple sleep latency test are necessary for diagnosis of the disease. Additionally, two biological markers, i.e., cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels and expression of the DQB1*0602 gene, are used. The treatment of narcolepsy is aimed at the different symptoms that the patient manifests. Excessive daytime sleepiness is treated with psychostimulants (amphetamine-like, modafinil and armodafinil). Cataplexy is treated with sodium oxybate (GHB), tricyclic antidepressants, or selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and fragmented sleep may be treated with sodium oxybate. Patients with narcolepsy should follow proper sleep hygiene and avoid strong emotions.",

      "title": "Kleine-Levin Syndrome with Rapid Cycling - Case Report and Review of the Literature (P5.294)",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Describe a patient with Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) with rapid cycling of hypersomnia episodes and autonomic changes.\nBACKGROUND: KLS exists in the borderland between psychiatry and neurology. It is often misdiagnosed as depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis or seizures. It is estimated to be a rare disorder (1.5 cases per million population), typically in adolescent males and preceded by a triggering event, such as infections or head trauma.\nDESIGN/METHODS: We describe the case of a 14 yo boy with a previous history of childhood absence epilepsy, off medications for 1 year at presentation. A few days after an upper airway infection, he developed hypersomnia, sleeping over 15h/day. When awake, he exhibited bradyphrenia and altered perception, stating “things are not right, I feel as if I am not here”. Family reported dishinhibition, alternating hypo/hyperphagia and speaking in “baby talk” in a regressed fashion.\nSymptoms improved without specific treatment but he relapsed every 2-3 weeks, with cycles lasting 10-14 days each. Investigation included two lumbar punctures, with non-inflammatory results and negative bacterial/viral studies. Serological studies were unrevealing. Imaging was unremarkable. Long-term EEG was normal. Toxicology, thyroid function, vasculitis, paraneoplastic panel and autoimmune panel were all negative. B12, thiamine and folate were normal. Psychiatric evaluation did not elicit diagnostic criteria for mood, somatic or other mental health conditions.\nRESULTS: A repeat EEG showed intermittent delta slowing. Heart rate monitoring displayed alternating periods of bradycardia with tachycardia. HLA typing was positive for DQB1*0201 which has been reported in patients with KLS patients and may support autoimmune etiology. Symptoms were suggestive of KLS and he was started on modafinil with improved hypersomnia. He was tried on valproic acid and lithium for treatment of the rapid cycling of symptoms without improvement.\nCONCLUSIONS: KLS has significant morbidity if unrecognized. We review and discuss updated diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology and management. This case exemplifies an unusual rapid cycling pattern of hypersomnia episodes associated with classic KLS symptoms.

      "title": "Key Facts About Tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external sound present, often described as a ringing, buzzing, humming, clicking, or cicada-like sound. Less commonly, tinnitus can be heard as a musical tune or a pulsing sound in time with a person's heartbeat. It may be one or multiple sounds, and it may be constant or intermittent. It can be heard as coming from one or both ears or from within the head. Research shows that most people hear tinnitus when they are asked to listen in a very quiet environment (i.e., when sitting in a sound-proof booth). Tinnitus is common and reported in all age groups. CAUSE AND HABITUATION The exact cause of tinnitus is hard to pinpoint, but it is generally understood that it results from some type of change, either mental or physical, but not necessarily related to the ear. Tinnitus can be associated with noise exposure, hearing loss, middle ear pathology or dysfunction, impacted wax, head or neck injuries, some medications, or a period of high stress. In many instances, the cause or the trigger is unknown. Tinnitus may dissipate over time or a person may habituate to it such that even though it may be audible, it is of little consequence. In some people, the tinnitus can be intrusively bothersome and significantly affect their general well-being. Seek assistance if the tinnitus: is associated with hearing difficulties. presents or changes suddenly. becomes intrusive and bothersome. interferes with sleep and/or your ability to concentrate. impacts general well-being. is in one ear only. Individuals with tinnitus are often told that “there is nothing that can be done” or that “you will have to learn to live with it,” but this is not the case. While there is no cure, treatment options are available, and patients can successfully manage the tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a concern. Consult a general practitioner to address any underlying medical factor that may be contributing to the tinnitus. Some people require a more involved intervention, and those with distressing tinnitus often benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to a general practitioner, an ENT specialist, and an audiologist/a tinnitus specialist, others who may be involved in the rehabilitation process include physiotherapists, counsellors, sleep specialists, and/or temporomandibular joint dental specialists. Factors influencing your ability to get used to the tinnitus include current stress levels and coping abilities, emotional and physical support systems, and insight into the mechanisms of the tinnitus. Plus, understanding how all of the above interact. FINDING SUPPORT Your experience of tinnitus and its impact on your life are unique, so it's important to seek the assistance of a tinnitus specialist who can offer a holistic, evidence-based tinnitus program designed specifically for your personal situation. A tinnitus management program should provide you with a deeper understanding of tinnitus and strategies you can use to manage and reduce the symptoms. These strategies may include a combination of: sound enrichment hearing devices neuromonics treatment behavioral techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance commitment therapy stress reduction and relaxation strategies sleep solutions TINNITUS AND HEARING If the tinnitus is accompanied by any hearing loss, the use of hearing aids can be helpful on a number of levels. Well-fitted hearing aids assist with communication, help reduce the stress and fatigue associated with intensive listening, and amplify low-level background sound. This can result in a reduction in tinnitus awareness. There are also devices that combine a hearing aid and a noise generator in a single unit, and these can provide the benefits of both. The timing and sequence of different types of intervention can play an important role in how individuals respond to treatment. A person with chronic tinnitus may be grieving for the perceived loss of silence and how this is affecting his or her life. This person may not be ready for certain types of intervention (e.g., hearing aids, maskers), and may even reject any early intervention. Before the rehabilitation process begins, it is helpful for the individual to be in a place of acceptance and to start coping emotionally.

      "title": "Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the situation and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Often patients have more than one specific phobia. Children may be less able to spontaneously articulate their fears and the presenting symptoms may include nonspecific behaviors such as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. A specific phobia can be distinguished from a developmentally appropriate fear by the persistence, severity, and degree of associated functional impairment. The treatment of choice for specific phobia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure therapy and systematic desensitization.",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

When the \"long-term syndrome\" is severe, at times it is necessary to stop the drug; the secondary effects are thus decreased and, when the medication is given again, the therapeutic effectiveness is temporarily restored. When the drug is stopped the patients should be watched, since a \"withdrawal syndrome\" may appear.",

      "title": "Cocaine Addiction as a Neurological Disorder: Implications for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Clinical and preclinical studies provide convincing evidence for persistent neurological/psychiatric impairments and possible neuronal degeneration associated with chronic cocaine/stimulant abuse. These impairments include multifocal and global cerebral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhages, infarctions, optic neuropathy, cerebral atrophy, cognitive impairments, and mood and movement disorders. These findings may encourage the placement of stimulant addiction into the category of organic brain disorders. Functional and microanatomical anomalies in the frontal and temporal cortex as well as other brain regions may be responsible for certain aspects of phenomenology and neuropsychopathology that are characteristic of stimulant polydrug addictions. These may include broad spectrum of deficits in cognition, motivation, and insight; behavioral disinhibition; attention deficits; emotional instability; impulsiveness; aggressiveness; depression; anhedonia; and persistent movement disorders. Although it is still debated whether the hypofrontality and other brain anomalies observed in stimulant abusers are a consequence or an antecedent of drug abuse, this debate seems purely academic and irrelevant with respect to the importance of compensating for these deficits in the development of treatment strategies. The neuropsychiatric impairments accompanying stimulant abuse may contribute to the very high rate of relapse in addicts that can take place after long periods (years) of abstinence. It is possible that the neurological deficits present in stimulant addicts, whether they are primary or secondary to stimulant abuse, are responsible for perpetual drug abuse which may be a form of self-medication (Weiss et al. 1991, 1992). In this context, addiction to stimulants, once fully developed, may represent a true biological dependency on drugs that temporarily compensate for existing neurological deficits. The concept of self-medication by drug addicts is supported by major theories of biological psychiatry. While a majority of drug addicts are polydrug users, there seems to be a preference for a particular type of drug among different populations of addicts. Addicts who experience distress, anxious dysphoria, and turbulent anger prefer the calming actions of opiates, whereas addicts with preceding attention deficit disorder, depression, or bipolar disorder often prefer stimulants (Khantzian 1985). Figure 1 presents conceptual relationships between brain damage and cocaine/stimulant abuse. More clinical studies are needed to establish unequivocally the epidemiological relationships between preexisting neurological deficits-resulting either from genetic, developmental, traumatic, or neurotoxic factors- and vulnerability to drug addictions. Nonetheless, deducing from the results of preclinical studies, it is conceivable that individuals with neurological deficits associated with attention deficit disorder, developmental neuroanatomical abnormalities, lead poisoning, alcoholism, posttraumatic brain lesions, and PTSD may be more vulnerable to stimulant addiction. This notion has significant empirical support as preclinical studies have shown that animals with lesioned prefrontal cortex became supersensitive to cocaine (Schenk et al. 1991) and animals with lesions at the amygdala, VTA, or raphe nuclei manifest more rapid acquisition of amphetamine self-administration than control rats (Deminiere et al. 1989). The above arguments, postulating neuropathology as an intrinsic component of stimulant addiction, should be taken into consideration with the caveat that the clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogenous and addicts may express varying stages and degrees of the disease as determined by environmental and genetic factors. Therefore, it is likely that stimulant addicts who have less advanced neuropathology may recover spontaneously after detoxification with proper nutritional and psychotherapeutic support if they can sustain abstinence.

After excluding the other possible causes of chorea, phenytoin was withdrawn which resulted in a dramatic subsidence of chorea .On rechallenge with phenytoin patient again developed chorieform movements which again subsided after drug withdrawl, thus implicating phenytoin as the possible etiological agent for chorea Conclusion:Phenytoin rarely induces involuntary movements as adverse effect.During phenytoin therapy,if a patient develops involuntary movements,phenytoin toxicity should be suspected. Drug withdrawl leads to complete symptomatic improvement thereby avoiding extensive workup for other secondary causes. Key words: phenytoin induced chorea, drug induced movement disorders, antiepileptics induced dyskinesias, phenytoin and involuntary movements, anticonvulsants and dyskinesias , phenytoin toxicity",

      "abstract": "Acoustic shock is a recently recognised clinical entity: following an abrupt, intense and unanticipated acoustic stimulus, usually delivered by a telephone handset or headset, some individuals report a symptom cluster that includes otalgia, altered hearing, aural fullness, imbalance, tinnitus, dislike or even fear of loud noises, and anxiety and/or depression. Symptoms start shortly after the triggering acoustic incident and can be short-lived or can last for a considerable time. If persistent, the condition can lead to significant disability. Proposed mechanisms include involvement of the tensor tympani muscle, hyperexcitability of central auditory pathways, and a precursive state of raised anxiety or arousal. A formal treatment programme has not yet been proposed, but the potential utility of modern therapeutic techniques for tinnitus and hyperacusis are considered. Given the large number of UK residents working in telephone call centres, this condition is of considerable clinical importance.",

      "abstract": "As a factor of recurrence of drinking in patients with alcoholic dependence, emotional disorders accompanied by alcohol dependence has been noted in many reports. Particularly, it is noted to be very likely that depression after abstinence is an incentive to re-start drinking. In this study, we investigated depressive feeling in aspects of psychiatric and physical subjective symptoms after abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence, and compared the symptoms with those in patients with involutional depression. On analysis of the major component of psychiatric subjective symptoms, a sense of alienation, emotional instability, anxiety, and aggressiveness were observed. In involutional depression, depressive feeling, somnipathy, anxiety, self accusation/sense of guilt, delusion of culpability were observed. On analysis of the major component of physical subjective symptoms, autonomic nervous symptoms accompanied by feebleness, hysterical neurosis-like autonomic nervous symptoms, reduced sexual libido, anorexia, hydrodipsia/sweating were observed. Similarly, in patients with involutional depression, hysterical neurosis-like autonomic nervous symptoms, anorexia, elevation of tonus, general malaise, and hydrodipsia were noted. Differences in status were emphasized in comparison between the two groups in both analyses. Unlike involutional depression that exhibits the current features of depression, patients with alcohol dependence showed a sense of alienation, emotional instability, anxiety, and aggressiveness, reflecting self-uncertainty and loss of self-respect. Drinking may be re-started to relieve or reduce tension and frustration in such conditions.",

      "abstract": "Varying resistance to psychotherapy occurred in patients fantasying that the rapid removal of depressions was effected by a “miracle drug” which could be relied upon for “magical” solutions to future problems. Most patients easily transferred their desires for assistance from the medication to the psychotherapist who prescribed it (and might possibly have to do so again). The administration of adrenocorticosteroids, however, may result in undesirable complications. The medical contraindications to steroid therapy must be heeded, and constant watchfulness for the possible development of harmful physical side-effects is essential. Psychiatric and neurologic disturbances may follow the administration of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropin( 4, 5). A too rapid tapering of steroid dosage may result in a period of relative hypoadrenalism, thereby exacerbating and compounding psychiatric difficulties(5). During this study, reappearance of severe depressions occurred in 1 manicdepressive and 2 neurotic-depressives, in each case about 2 months after the discontinuation of medication. These relapses may indicate the necessity for maintaining the recovered depressive patient on small doses of steroids for periods approximating the average duration of previous phases of severe depression. In this study the rapid relief of depressive symptomatology afforded by therapy with prednisone accentuated the patients’ basic personality problems. In schizo-affectives, adequate doses of phenothiazines were needed to treat the intensification of psychotic thought disorders which began concurrently with the remission of depression. The treatment of patients having involutional psychotic depressions with some paranoid features likewise required phenothiazines to suppress the paranoid thought disorders which replaced their affective disorders.",

      "abstract": "This contribution reviews the international literature about dual diagnosis, meaning patients who have simultaneously mental health problems and substance use disorders and discusses epidemiology, clinical characteristics, but primarily etiopathogenesis and different treatment models and interventions. The epidemiological data coming from large-scale studies in the general population in USA, Australia and UK demonstrate the close relationship between mental health problems and substance use disorders. Also, the results from Greek research projects support this close relationship, but their research designs have significant limitations. Multiple and high risks are common in this population, like violent or suicidal behavior, self-harm, physical problems, while they appear less responsive to treatment. Subsequently, different models for etiopathogenesis of dual diagnosis have been suggested: (a) Causal relationship: secondary substance use disorder is subsequent of primary mental illness (self-medication hypothesis, supersenstivity model) or vice versa (alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine use trigger or contribute to development of mental illness). (b) Third factor as the cause of both mental and substance use disorders (genetic factor, neuropathology, traumatic experience, personality characteristics, multiple factors). (c) Comorbidty is due to chance. (d) Each disorder mutually exacerbates the other, regardless the cause. Here, the relationship between alcohol and depression is discussed further as example. The ideas and the research-evidence which support each of these models are presented. Also there is an overview of different treatment models: (a) Consecutive treatment: mental health treatment and substance misuse treatment are provided consecutively. (b) Parallel treatments: the patient attends programs of both mental health and substance use services simultaneously. (c) Integrated treatment: the same clinical team addresses both mental health issues and substance use disorders. The first two models have significant weaknesses due to lack of focus on the interaction of the different disorders or to administrative and managerial barriers. On the other hand, integrated programs appear to overcome these limitations. They use modified interventions provided by the same team in order to address the multiple needs of the patients. Different types of integrated programs are discussed. More pragmatist inter ventions should also be taken into consideration. It is expected that some direction for research and clinical practice to Greece will emerge from this contribution.",

Many of these will yield a history consistent with, and similar to their present endocrine status, which can be traced back to early life before the onset of alcoholism. Some spouses, of drinking alcoholics, succumb to the unremitting emotional stress and develop the cortical insufficiency syndrome. The incidence of the syndrome in cosanguinous relatives suggests that it is hereditary.(4) Adrenal cortical insufficiency must be differentiated from muscular dystrophy, disease of a psychic basis, chronic brucellosis etc. A positive blood culture is necessary before the latter can be diagnosed.(11) (11A) Bacteriological cure can leave hypoadrenocorticism even if its existence prior to infection did not render the patient susceptible through immunity failure.(9) Present methods of treatment would yield greater success if endocrine homeostasis could simultaneously be achieved through carbohydrate withdrawal combined with the other measures described.

Epileptic convulsion is the disorder characterised by a staring spell, uncontrollable jerking movement of the arms and legs, loss of consciousness or awareness, fatigue, body ache, Persistent EPILEPSY, weight loss, discomfort feeling, weakness &amp; temporary confusion. Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety. Homoeopathic constitutional treatment based on the individual case is the most suitable treatment and would aim to heal the underlying physical crisis causing the Epileptic convulsion. The remedies work by stimulating the body’s natural ability to heal itself, acting as a catalyst for healing. Homeopathy can be of assistance in retrieving normal health and treating any other physical issues and sequel related to Epileptic convulsion. Homoeopathic medicines can also prevent relapse of Epileptic convulsion. Methods: Randomised controlled trial study design has been adopted to know the efficacy of homoeopathic treatment in cases of Epileptic convulsion and its complication. A total number of 30 patients, showing features of uncontrollable jerking movement of the arms and legs body ache, low grade EPILEPSY, discomfort, temporary confusion&amp; weakness were selected who were fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      "title": "The safety of cannabinoids for the treatment of multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "The evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) is increasing but is not as yet convincing. Although several trials have reported no significant effect, the majority of the evidence which supports a beneficial effect on spasticity and pain is based on subjective measurements in trials where unblinding was likely to be a problem. The available clinical trial data suggest that the adverse side effects associated with using cannabis-based medicinal extracts (CBMEs) are generally mild, such as dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, nausea and intoxication, and in no case did toxicity develop. However, most of these trials were run over a period of months and it is possible that other adverse side effects, not seen in these short-term studies, could develop with long-term use. Despite the evidence that cannabinoids can disrupt cognitive function and promote depression, on the basis of current data, such adverse effects seem unlikely to be associated with the use of CBMEs. Likewise, there is no evidence to suggest that their effects on balance and motor control, or immune function, may be clinically significant. There is, however, reason to be concerned about the use of therapeutic cannabinoids by people predisposed to psychosis and by pregnant women, given the increasing evidence of their adverse effects on the fetus. In conclusion, given the modest therapeutic effects of cannabinoids demonstrated so far, and the risk of long-term adverse side effects, there is reason to be cautious about their use in the treatment of MS.",

      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

      "title": "Tension-type Headache and Migraine as Manifestations of Chronic Post-Traumatic Headache",
      "abstract": "Introduction: A subsequent headache within seven days of a head injury (or after regaining consciousness after the head trauma)is referred to as a post-traumatic headache (PTHA); it is referred to as chronic or chronic post-traumatic headache (CPTHA) if it lasts longer than three months after the injury. Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

      "abstract": "Constituents of the Cannabis plant, cannabinoids, may be of therapeutic value in neurologic diseases. The most abundant cannabinoids are Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which possesses psychoactive properties, and cannabidiol, which has no intrinsic psychoactive effects, but exhibits neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies. A small number of high-quality clinical trials support the safety and efficacy of cannabinoids for treatment of spasticity of multiple sclerosis, pain refractory to opioids, glaucoma, nausea and vomiting. Lower level clinical evidence indicates that cannabinoids may be useful for dystonia, tics, tremors, epilepsy, migraine and weight loss. Data are also limited in regards to adverse events and safety. Common nonspecific adverse events are similar to those of other CNS 'depressants' and include weakness, mood changes and dizziness. Cannabinoids can have cardiovascular adverse events and, when smoked chronically, may affect pulmonary function. Fatalities are rare even with recreational use. There is a concern about psychological dependence, but physical dependence is less well documented. Cannabis preparations may presently offer an option for compassionate use in severe neurologic diseases, but at this point, only when standard-of-care therapy is ineffective. As more high-quality clinical data are gathered, the therapeutic application of cannabinoids will likely expand.",

The most important toxic effect of the a-adrenergic agonist phenylpropanolamine is hypertension, which may result in hypertensive encephalopathy or intracerebral hemorrhage. The therapeutic index of phenylpropanolamine is low, and severe hypertension may occur after ingestion of less than three times the therapeutic dose. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine may also cause hypertension, as well as tachyarrhythmias due to β-adrenergic stimulation. Toxic reactions from caffeine are characterized by agitation, seizures, tachyarrhythmias, and hypotension. Management of toxic reactions to over-the-counter stimulants includes control of hypertension with a rapidly acting vasodilator, β-blockers for tachyarrhythmias, and control of seizures.

In this review, the authors attempt to determine whether there is enough evidence in the literature to support the notion that illicit drug use can cause chronic psychotic disorders. They conclude the literature strongly suggests that a number of drugs of abuse in different classes (psychostimulants, hallucinogens, marijuana, and possibly industrial inhalants) can cause or increase the susceptibility for a state of chronic psychosis. It is also likely that the abuse of combinations of these drugs is capable of inducing similar syndromes.",

      "title": "The Temporal Dynamics of Dissociation: Protocol for an Ecological Momentary Assessment and Laboratory Study in a Transdiagnostic Sample",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Dissociation is a ubiquitous clinical phenomenon. Dissociative disorders (DD) are primarily characterized by dissociation, and dissociative states are also a criterion for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the dissociative subtype of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dissociative reactions such as depersonalization/derealization and amnesia (e.g., gaps in awareness/memory) across diagnostic categories are believed to be affect contingent and theorized to serve affect regulation functions. What is not clear, however, is how self-reported affect and physiological reactivity unfold within dissociative episodes. To address this issue, the present project aims to investigate the hypothesis (1) whether self-reported distress (as indicated by arousal, e.g., feeling tense/agitated, and/or valence, e.g., feeling discontent/unwell) and physiological reactivity increase before dissociative episodes and (2) whether self-reported distress and physiological reactivity decrease during and after dissociative episodes in a transdiagnostic sample of patients with DD, BPD, and/or PTSD. Methods and analyses: We will use a smartphone application to assess affect and dissociation 12 times per day over the course of one week in everyday life. During this time, heart and respiratory rates will be remotely monitored. Afterwards, participants will report affect and dissociative states eight times in the laboratory before, during, and after the Trier Social Stress Test. During the laboratory task, we will continuously record heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory rate, as well as measure blood pressure and take salivary samples to determine cortisol levels. Our hypotheses will be tested using multilevel structural equation models. Power analyses determined a sample size of 85.",

      "title": "Testing olfactory function and mapping the structural olfactory networks in the brain.",
      "abstract": "We perceive the world through our senses. The dependence on these sensory stimuli becomes obvious when we see a visually impaired individual with a guide dog or an individual using sign language. However, individuals with olfactory deficits suffer from a more concealed impairment without any opportunity for diagnostics or treatment in the Danish healthcare system. Around a fifth of the population experience olfactory deficits, of which 1-2% are functionally anosmic. The personal consequences for anosmics can be extensive, lacking not only in hedonic yield related to eating and drinking, but also the socialization during dinners can become niggling. Similarly, social attraction and repulsion can be affected, however, effects linger beyond social consequences and quality of life. An olfactory deficit is a common early symptom in several neurologic, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric diseases. These associations may be due to the central location of the primary olfactory cortex, tugged in and between hedonic hotspots of the brain, and its hard-wired structural connections to key hubs of consciousness and memory in the brain. A better knowledge of olfactory receptors and odour perception has emerged during the past few decades. This has given rise to a deeper understanding of the etiologies behind olfactory deficits, to the anticipation of utilising the diagnostic potential of olfaction as a prodromal marker of disease, and ultimately to the prospect of improving treatment options for these patients. Much has been accomplished within the field, but much is still beyond our grasp. In Denmark, the focus on olfaction and olfactory testing has been scarce, at best. The first step of my PhD was therefore a review in Danish, published in the most widely distributed and read Danish journal, \"Ugeskrift for Læger\", in order to raise awareness on olfactory testing and on a clinical olfactory focus in Central Denmark Region. Secondly, we validated a tool for assessing olfactory function in Danish. The Danish 12-odourant \"Sniffin' Sticks\" identification test (SIT-12) was modified, validated and published, which allowed us to focus on other aspects of olfactory perception and olfactory testing. One focus has been to investigate the possible role of overlapping volatile chemical molecules in differentiating closely related descriptors. This study was conducted in order to emphasize the need for a meticulous approach when conducting validation stud-ies of olfactory tests, especially the need for revalidation after a modification process. Another focus has been on investigating the differences between olfactory identification abilities in adolescents relative to adults. Previous international studies have shown that the identification skills of adolescents are significantly different from their adult compatriots. Earlier validation studies on adolescents have used the adult version of odorant descriptors as the starting point. In our study we examine the role of odour familiarity in the difference between adult and adolescent identification abilities. The main focus of this PhD has been to develop a method for evaluating central olfactory patency and processing, where indi-vidual preferences and sensitivity to specific odours could be removed from the equation, as these parameters has proven trou-blesome in functional neuroimaging of the olfactory system. We identified that a reference area for investigating primary olfactory processing in neuroimaging included several non-primary struc-tures and lacked the structural neural connections to key secondary olfactory areas. Consequently, we redefined the template for olfac-tory processing by combining findings from anatomical and func-tional neuroimaging studies. This has led to the creation of a struc-tural olfactory fingerprint, which is already integrated in six on-going studies as a tool to investigate pathologic and benign chang-es in structural olfactory pathways. .",

Patients presented to the author after an episode of confusion, amnesia, or somnambulism. Legal defendants were being prosecuted for driving under the influence, and the author reviewed the cases as expert witness for the defense. Potential predisposing factors including comorbidities, social situation, physician instruction, concomitant medications, and patterns of medication management were considered.Patients and defendants exhibited abnormal behavior characterized by poor motor control and confusion. Although remaining apparently interactive with the environment, all reported amnesia for 3 to 5 hours. In some cases, the episodes began during daytime wakefulness because of accidental or purposeful ingestion of the zolpidem and are considered automatisms. Other cases began after ingestion of zolpidem at the time of going to bed and are considered parasomnias. Risk factors for both wake and sleep-related automatic complex behaviors include the concomitant ingestion of other sedating drugs, a higher dose of zolpidem, a history of parasomnia, ingestion at times other than bedtime or when sleep is unlikely, poor management of pill bottles, and living alone. In addition, similar size and shape of two medications contributed to accidental ingestion in at least one case.Sleep driving and other complex behaviors can occur after zolpidem ingestion. Physicians should assess patients for potential risk factors and inquire about parasomnias. Serious legal and medical complications can occur as a result of these forms of automatic complex behaviors.",

On withdrawal of the drug, one patient recovered normal cognitive function and independence in activities of daily living, whereas mild cognitive impairment persisted in the other patient. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score was 6 out of 13 for the first patient and 5 out of 13 for the second, suggesting a probable causal relationship between the adverse event and lenalidomide administration. Lenalidomide may induce particular cognitive disorders (notably episodic memory impairments) in some patients. The drug's putative neurotoxicity is probably promoted by specific risk factors (such as previous chemotherapy, prior mild cognitive impairment, age and the presence of cerebrovascular lesions).",

Despite the failure of the opiate model, recent evidence suggests that persistent drug-induced changes in the physical brain may underlie addictive behavior, consistent with the general notion of addiction as a physical disease.",

      "title": "Cannabinoid1 (CB-1) receptor antagonists: a molecular approach to treating acute cannabinoid overdose",
      "abstract": "Abstract The legalization of cannabis for both recreational and medical use in the USA has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of emergency department visits and hospital admissions for acute cannabinoid overdose (also referred to as cannabis intoxication and cannabis poisoning). Both “edibles” (often sold as brownies, cookies, and candies) containing large amounts of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol and synthetic cannabinoids (many possessing higher potencies and efficacies than Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol) are responsible for a disproportionate number of emergency department visits relative to smoked cannabis. Symptoms of acute cannabinoid overdose range from extreme lethargy, ataxia, and generalized psychomotor impairment to feelings of panic and anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, and psychosis. Treatment of acute cannabinoid overdose is currently supportive and symptom driven. Converging lines of evidence indicating many of the symptoms which can precipitate an emergency department visit are mediated through activation of cannabinoid 1 receptors. Here, we review the evidence that cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonists, originally developed for indications ranging from obesity to smoking cessation and schizophrenia, provide a molecular approach to treating acute cannabinoid overdose.",

      "title": "Mechanism of brain concussion, contusion and laceration",
      "abstract": "Injury to the head and intracranial structures may occur as a result of direct or indirect forces. An injury by a direct force occurs when an object strikes the head. Indirect injury to the head may take place when an object accelerates or decelerates the body, with injury to the head and contents occurring indirectly. The significance of direct and indirect types of injury lies in the fact that with direct injury, there is a greater likelihood of involvement of the head and contents only, whereas, in indirect injury to the head the entire body may be involved and the possibility of injury not only to the head but to other parts of the body as well is likely. As energy is absorbed by the head upon impact, the skull deforms and the head is either accelerated or decelerated. With regard to the production of injury the following may result. (a) There will be deformation of the skull with possible fracture or compression of the intracranial contents or both. This compression of the intracranial contents results from a decrease in the volume of the head due to deformation of the skull. (b) Sudden increase in intracranial pressure due to the acceleration or deceleration of the head at the time of impact; (c) mass movements of intracranial contents due to different acceleration rates of the skull and its contents; (d) distortion of the skull and dural septae as seen particularly in birth injuries; (e) shearing off a portion of the head without necessarily producing an appreciable increase in intracranial pressure; (f) shearing and tearing of intracranial contents due to greatly increased intracranial pressure as in bullet and shell fragment injuries; (g) a combination of any of these effects, (5). This last possibility is probably the most common mechanism as one or more of the above effects combine to cause the head injury in most cases. The injury to the head and intracranial contents occurs as a result of the following mechanisms: (a) There may be compression or squeezing of the tissues. (b) There may be tension or tearing apart of the tissues. (c) There may be shearing or sliding of the tissues over each other. These three mechanisms may operate simultaneously or in combination in different areas or in different directions in the same area. Concussion is a term describing a state of post-traumatic unconsciousness associated with pallor and a shock-like state in the human. It may be of varying intensity from completely recoverable states to those of continued coma and death. Concussion is caused by derangement of brain stem reticular formation. Open wounds of the head, contusions and lacerations of the brain may or may not be associated with concussion or such derangement. The mechanism of contusions and lacerations of the brain, electrical changes and chemical alterations after head injury are discussed and evaluated.",

      "abstract": "One of the most serious adverse reactions to benzodiazepines is their potential respiratory depressant effect on the subcortical levels of the central nervous system. When used in the accepted oral therapeutic dosage required for healthy patients, this drug does not usually produce any clinically significant respiratory depression and does not potentiate the depressant effects of opiates. In addition, benzodiazepines produce virtually no changes in cardiovascular function. ~ Ataxia and sedation develop only at doses above those required for anxiolytic effects. The reason for this is that the benzodiazepines depress the limbic system, which affects the emotions and behavior at much lower dosages than drugs that depress the reticular activating system and the cerebral cortex. This fact gives the benzodiazepines a very wide margin of safety between the therapeutic and toxic doses.~ The most frequently reported adverse reactions following oral administration of benzodiazepines for anxiety reduction include transient drowsiness, fatigue, and ataxia. Paradoxical reaction, though rare, may occur and is manifested by excitement, hallucinations, and rage. Discontinuation of drug administration will terminate these reactions.~ The aim of this report is to describe an unexpected adverse reaction to local anesthesia in a sedated patient during dental treatment in order to increase the awareness to the possible side effects associated with this situation.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

      "abstract": "WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT • Body sway increases in older adults and may lead to an increase in the risk of falling. • The problem of impaired stability in the elderly may be compounded by the use of hypnotics, which have been associated with an increased risk of next‐day falls as well as drowsiness. • The potential adverse effects of hypnotic drugs on steadiness may be exacerbated during the night, in the event that an individual needs to get out of bed. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS • This study examines the effects of gaboxadol (an investigational treatment for insomnia), zolpidem (a current hypnotic included as an active control) and placebo on body sway and attention/information processing ability following bedtime dosing in elderly subjects who were woken during the night for assessments. • Zolpidem and gaboxadol increased body sway at various time points during the night relative to placebo; at 1.5 h post dose, the time of peak concentrations of both drugs, gaboxadol produced less impairment than zolpidem. • Compared with placebo, neither gaboxadol nor zolpidem impaired attention/information‐processing ability as assessed by critical flicker fusion. AIMS To evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics and night‐time effects on body sway and critical flicker fusion (CFF) of gaboxadol following bedtime dosing in healthy elderly subjects. METHODS Subjects (17 women, seven men) aged 65–75 years received gaboxadol 10 mg, zolpidem 5 mg (active control) or placebo at 22.00 h in a three‐period, randomized, double‐blind crossover study. They were awakened during the night for evaluation of body sway and CFF. Pharmacokinetics of gaboxadol were assessed during a fourth single‐blind treatment period. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS The number of subjects with adverse events was 14 for gaboxadol 10 mg, seven for zolpidem and nine for placebo; most were mild or moderate in intensity. Two women discontinued the study following gaboxadol; one vomited and one experienced a severe vasovagal syncope after venepuncture. Mean gaboxadol t max was 2 h, t ½ was 1.7 h, AUC 0–∞ was 430 ng·h ml −1 and C max was 139 ng ml −1 . At 1.5 h and 4 h post dose, zolpidem increased body sway relative to placebo ( P &lt; 0.01). Gaboxadol increased body sway at 4 h ( P &lt; 0.001) and 8 h ( P &lt; 0.05) relative to placebo. At 1.5 h, the time point closest to peak drug concentrations, zolpidem increased body sway compared with gaboxadol ( P &lt; 0.01). Gaboxadol and zolpidem had no effects on CFF vs. placebo. CONCLUSIONS A bedtime dose of gaboxadol 10 mg was generally well tolerated. Changes in body sway at 1.5 h after bedtime dosing were smaller with gaboxadol 10 mg than with zolpidem 5 mg, whereas changes were similar at 4 h for both treatments and returned to near baseline at 8 h.",

Despite distinct pharmacological targets, all have the common property to stimulate the brain reward circuitry, which results in an increase of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. The stimulation induced by drugs of abuse is much more important in intensity and duration than the stimulation induced by natural rewards. The positive reinforcement resulting from this stimulation promotes repeated drug intake, which induces cellular and molecular adaptations in the brain reward circuit and other regions associated with this circuit. Enduring changes are more particularly observed in regions involved in pleasure, motivation, memory, conditioning, executive functions, judgement and self-control. A tolerance to the reinforcing effects of natural rewards is observed in parallel to a hypersensitivity to the motivational effects of drugs and drug-associated stimuli. Behaviour focuses more and more exclusively on drug research and drug consumption. Drug privation can induce a negative emotional state, withdrawal signs and craving which are key elements of relapse",

      "abstract": "Severe headaches or migraines are a common neurological disorder that can significantly affect people's daily lives and is serious problem for individuals and society. A migraine is intense headache lasting 4-72 hours, typically localized on one side of the head and accompanied by nausea, sensitivity to light (phonophobia), sound (photophobia), and smell (osmophobia). The pathophysiology of migraines is complex and involves neurovascular and biochemicals mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms that trigger the transition from a headache-free state to the headache phase is important to understand the underlying causes of migraine attacks and developing effective treatment methods. Caffeine can have both positive and negative influence on individuals suffering from migraine. It is use as adjuvant component in migraine treatment, but it can also act as a trigger for migraines. The therapeutic mechanisms of caffeine in migraine headaches are multidirectional and include: vascular effects, modulation of NO production, adenosine antagonism, potential interactions with the gut-brain axis and inhibition of leukotrienes and prostaglandins’ synthesis. On the other hand, the onset of migraine attack may be related to caffeine consumption or withdrawal. The purpose of this study is to review and systematize the available data about relation caffeine use to migraine.",

      "title": "Protracted Hiccups Induced by Aripiprazole and Regressed after Administration of Gabapentin",
      "abstract": "Hiccups are sudden, repeated, and involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle (myoclonic contraction). It involves a reflex arc that, once activated, causes a strong contraction of the diaphragm immediately followed by the closure of the glottis translating into the classic “hic” sound. Hiccups can be short, persistent, and intractable depending on the duration. The most disabling hiccups often represent the epiphenomenon of a medical condition such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders; central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities; ear, nose, and throat (ENT) conditions or pneumological problems; metabolic/endocrine disorders; infections; and psychogenic disorders. Some drugs, such as aripiprazole, a second-generation antipsychotic, can induce the onset of variable hiccups. We describe herein the cases of three hospitalized patients who developed insistent hiccups after taking aripiprazole and who positively responded to low doses of gabapentin. It is probable that aripiprazole, prescribed at a low dosage (&lt;7.5 mg/day), would act as a dopamine agonist by stimulating D2 and D3 receptors at the “hiccup center” level—located in the brain stem—thus triggering the hiccup. On the other hand, gabapentin led to a complete regression of the hiccup probably by reducing the nerve impulse transmission and modulating the diaphragmatic activity. The present case series suggests the use of low doses of gabapentin as an effective treatment for aripiprazole-induced hiccups. However, our knowledge of the neurotransmitter functioning of the hiccup reflex arc is still limited, and further research is needed to characterize the neurotransmitters involved in hiccups for potential novel therapeutic targets.",

      "title": "Coma",
      "abstract": "Abstract Coma is defined as a state of profound unconsciousness caused by disease, injury, or poison. A medical description would also include a patient that cannot be awakened, fails to respond to painful stimuli (or light and sound), and does not initiate voluntary actions. Coma is a medical emergency, unlike most diagnostic processes that follow an orderly progression. Two overriding principles apply to the comatose patient. The first is that coma is a true medical emergency. The second principle follows from the first principle. Managing the coma patient requires beginning diagnostic and therapeutic measures at the same time to improve patient outcome.",

Definite correlations between psychopathological and sexual pathological manifestations have been ascertained. Sexual disorders were of a secondary systemic nature and were undetected if the endogenic process began after the completion of all stages of normal psychosexual development.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder is a form of anxiety disorder which is poorly known in children and manifests as a series of symptoms occurring after an extraordinary event outside the range of usual human experiences and responsible for a feeling of terror. Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

      "abstract": "Three patients, men aged 30, 33 and 32 years respectively, died in police custody in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. According to autopsy reports, all patients died from excited delirium syndrome induced by cocaine use. Excited delirium is a state of mental and physiological hyperarousal commonly associated with the use of cocaine. Patients suffering from excited delirium can be extremely hostile and violent. If a physical struggle arises with police or medical personnel, the episode can end in death due to adrenergic overstimulation. Patients in acute excited states should be regarded as a medical emergency with a serious mortality risk, and should be transferred to the hospital rather than the police station. Medical and police staff should aim to reduce confrontation. When patients are too agitated to cooperate, benzodiazepines should be used for sedation of the patient. Beta blockers and antipsychotic medication should not be administered, as these medications can exacerbate the fatal cardiac effects seen in excited delirium.",

      "title": "Putative changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission following nicotine induced behavioural sensitisation",
      "abstract": "Behavioural sensitisation is a progressive enhancement of stereotypic or locomotor behaviour following repeated intermittent administration of a psychostimulant or stress. It is a phenomenon thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, addiction, depressive disorders, dyskinesia, and psychosis) although its own mechanism remains contentious. In this thesis a multidisciplinary approach was used to investigate the role of dopamine in behavioural sensitisation. Different in vivo and ex vivo techniques were used to assess and elucidate putative changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission of behaviourally sensitised animals. If so, this improved understanding of behavioural sensitisation could provide a better understanding of the pathophysiologies of neuropsychiatric disorders and provide more insight into why existing pharmacotherapies for these disorders are able to confer only modest benefit. Moreover, this improved understanding can lead to development of new medication and more effective therapies to treat neuropsychiatric disorders and therapies that address the specific problems associated with them.\r\nPreviously, an oversimplified view of neurotransmitter release was used for the development of current available drugs, i.e. stabilising either the attenuated or increased release of neurotransmitters without considering the involvement of synaptic plasticity. Therapies being used with modest effectiveness regulate dopamine transmission levels, suggesting a putative role for dopamine. The present study used chronic intermittent nicotine administration in rodents to induce behavioural sensitisation which was monitored behaviourally by measuring locomotor activity. Further studies were performed ex vivo assessing receptor binding, intracellular cAMP accumulation and electrically stimulated dopamine release. Prior to the pharmacological assessments, a novel LC-MS/MS method to measure (cyclic-) nucleotides was developed and a fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV) technique was established to measure real-time neurotransmitter release. Specific pharmacological tools were used to identify the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in behavioural sensitisation. Finally, the ex vivo findings using tissue from sensitised and non-sensitised animals were compared to those findings obtained in vivo.",

Drugs used by alcoholics, in decreasing order of frequency, are marijuana, cocaine, and other stimulants, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and hallucinogens. Evaluation of intoxication and treatment or detoxification in alcoholics should always include consideration of other drugs. Multiple drug use in alcoholics does not preclude the short- or long-term treatment that traditionally is available for alcoholics, such as programmatic treatment and AA and NA and psychotherapy. The existence of poly-drug addiction in alcoholics and of alcohol dependence in families of drug addicts and alcoholics suggest a common genetic vulnerability to alcoholism and drug addiction.",

      "title": "Gamma oscillations as a biomarker for major depression: an emerging topic",
      "abstract": "Abstract Identifying biomarkers for major depression is of high importance for improving diagnosis and treatment of this common and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder, as the field seeks to move toward both personalized and more effective treatments. Here we focus on electroencephalography (EEG) or direct scalp voltage recordings as such a biomarker, with an emphasis on gamma and high gamma oscillations (or “rhythms”). In the last several decades, alpha and theta band rhythms have been found to provide information on depressive state as well as recovery, but the gamma band is less well characterized with respect to depression. We summarize some key findings on gamma rhythms (especially their amplitude) as a biomarker or endophenotype for major depression. These studies suggest: (1) under certain conditions gamma rhythms can distinguish subjects with major depression from healthy controls, (2) gamma may distinguish bipolar disorder from unipolar depression, (3) various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that counteract depression also alter gamma, (4) animal models of depression-like behavior show gamma abnormalities, with changes in gamma associated with therapeutic recovery. The most informative approaches in the future may combine profiles of gamma band power across the brain to assess ratios of activity across regions. Overall we have good evidence to suggest that gamma rhythms may provide objective information on major depressive disease status, but we will need further work to better define the precise measures to follow.",

She was treated for anxiety disorder and reaction to severe stress in our clinic for 1 year. Five days after husband’s nursing home placement our patient developed the abnormal thought, that someone might tell her neighbou rs of her laziness and failures. She believed that she was under constant surveillance. These ideas grew rapidly into delusions and hallucinations. She was diagnosed as having transient psychosis with associated acute stress and was treated with risperidone. The psychosis lasted for two months. Careful differential diagnosis is necessary in the cases of transient psychosis. Psychotic symptoms in overloaded individuals may be more common than was previously thought.",
