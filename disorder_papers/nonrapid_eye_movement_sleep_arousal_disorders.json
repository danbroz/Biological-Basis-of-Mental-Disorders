      "title": "The baby with a suspected seizure",
      "abstract": "All those involved in the care of babies need to maintain a high index of suspicion regarding the possibility of seizures. Not only are seizures common in the first few days of life, but they are also difficult to diagnose because the clinical manifestations are varied, subtle, and unlike those seen at other times of life. The diagnosis of seizure should be considered if a baby makes odd repetitive stereotyped movements of the limbs or face. Subtle seizures can manifest as repetitive blinking, chewing, eye-rolling or darting tongue movements. Seizures can also involve a stare without blinking, forced eye deviation, peculiar limb postures, apnea or a fixed smile. Ocular manifestations are common, and eye closure during a suspicious event makes the diagnosis of seizure less likely, although it does not exclude it completely [1]. Myoclonic jerks can be normal in sleep but myoclonic epilepsy does occasionally manifest in the neonatal period. Clinical seizures are often short-lived in babies; typically the baby becomes still, there is a change in breathing pattern (sometimes apnea), and a change in level of alertness followed by subtle repetitive movements involving the face or limbs. The whole episode may be over in less than a minute, but the same pattern does tend to recur, in which case it becomes more suspicious.",

      "title": "Parasomnias and Abnormal Sleep-Related Movements",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical phenomena or behavior that develop during the sleep period. These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2. Parasomnias usually associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including REM sleep behavior disorder (including parasomnia overlap disorder and status dissociatus), recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorder 3. Other parasomnias, including sleep-related dissociative disorder, sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning (catathrenia), exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder.",

      "title": "Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

      "abstract": "Dreaming, very possibly, begins as far back as the child's first year, for even the sleeping infant shows at times reactions such as screams, sudden sucking movements, etc., which lead us to infer a dream-concept, no matter of how indefinite a character. Only suppositions are possible with regard to the frequency of childhood's dreams. Most likely only the lighter sleep periods, just after falling asleep, or shortly before awakening, the restless sleep of sickness, are accompanied by vivid dream-fantasies. That such nervous fantasies are especially violent in feverish attacks is a matter of common knowledge. But, quite apart from health, even outer circumstances likely to disturb sleep may affect the child's dream-fantasy by producing terror; of this we have a very plain instance in Hilde. In one case the Scupins could very plainly observe the transition of a real dream-account into a confabulation; at the same time this example is interesting from the wealth of detail in the dream-account.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors are disorders involving partial arousal from deep, non–rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in which individuals simultaneously display characteristics of both sleep and wakefulness. Sleepwalking represents the milder form of arousal, while night terrors are distinguished by the intense physiological experiences associated with alarm: screaming, pounding heart, rapid breathing, sweating, extreme terror or panic, and possibly frenzied motor activity. Both sleepwalking and night terrors usually occur during the first 3 hours after falling asleep but may occur at any time of night. They arise from non-REM sleep, generally sleep stages 3 or 4. There may be physical signs of traumatic injuries sustained during episodes of sleepwalking or night terrors. Most patients with sleepwalking/night terrors have a childhood history and/or a family history of these behaviors. There may also be a history of bedwetting.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved. Mrs. Neylan (Brandon General Hospital School of Nursing, Manitoba, Canada; B.N., McGill University) is senior lecturer at the University of British Columbia School of Nursing in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.",

      "title": "Suvremeno liječenje paničnog poremećaja",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

The main differential diagnosis of parasomnias are the nocturnal epilepsies, which may require video electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment if suspected. Night terrors The child will appear afraid, inconsolable, and often moaning or whimpering repetitively. They will usually be either unresponsive or only partially responsive to attempts to intervene or communicate. Characteristically, the child will remember nothing of the event in the morning.

      "abstract": "3 Days In infants between the ages of 1 month and 1 year convulsions are usually associated with fever. If there is no fever, fits secondary to a structural brain abnormality, hypoglycaemia, and hypocalcaemia should be considered. Fits can be divided into generalised or partial seizures. Generalised seizures include tonic-clonic and myoclonic fits. Partial seizures include focal motor and temporal lobe fits. During some episodes partial seizures may be followed by generalised seizures. Generalised tonic-clonic fits are the most common type. The child may appear irritable or show other unusual behaviour for a few minutes before an attack. Sudden loss of consciousness occurs during the tonic phase, which lasts 20-30 seconds and is accompanied by temporary cessation of respiratory movements and central cyanosis. The clonic phase follows and there are jerky movements of the limbs and face. The movements gradually diminish and the child may sleep for a few minutes before w-aking confused and irritable. Although a typical tonic-clonic attack is easily recognised, other forms of fits may be difficult to diagnose from the mother's history. Infantile spasms may begin with momentary episodes of loss of tone, which can occur in bouts and be followed by fits in which the head may suddenly drop forward or the whole infant may move momentarily like a frog. Recurrent episodes with similar features, whether they are changes in the level of consciousness or involuntary movements, should raise the possibility of fits. Parents are very frightened by a fit and may fear that their infant is dying.",

The notion of confusional arousals in children has received less attention overall compared with that concerning adults. The impression gained in adults is that, especially in response to forced awakenings, the behavioral disturbance in adult episodes is more forceful, vigorous and resistive, sometimes leading to violent behavior. Childhood confusional arousals do not usually require treatment, only advice to parents that they can be considered to be a passing phase. The same cannot necessarily be said of confusional arousals in adult life when they have more of a tendency to persist, depending on their etiology and relationship to other sleep disorders.",

Fragmentation and repetitive arousals/awakenings characterize the sleep of persons with dementia. Confusion, agitation, and wandering can occur at night (“sun downing”), further contributing to sleep disruption (Box 10–1). Sleep complaints may be due primarily to the underlying dementia or to related sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements of sleep, or secondary depression. Reversal of the sleep-wake rhythms can be seen with patients complaining of nocturnal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance. Short-term use of hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone, may be tried for insomnia.",

In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "Tics are sudden, abrupt, short, nonrhythmic, repetitive, involuntary movements or vocal productions that serve no recognizable purpose. They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders: Disorders of Arousal?",
      "abstract": "In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism, the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues, overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date, it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.",

In recent years,1 a diagnosis of insomnia has also included a report of decreased daytime function associated with the poor sleep at night to differentiate a patient with insomnia from an individual who simply requires less sleep. Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "title": "Things that go bump in the night: diagnosing sleep-related movement disorders without a sleep laboratory",
      "abstract": "NON-RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (REM) SLEEPNon-REM sleep parasomnias are very common in childhood and are usually benign, rarely coming to medical attention.They typically arise from the first period of deepest non-REM (slow wave) sleep, around an hour after sleep onset.Over time, a spectrum of behaviours may be seen, even in the same subject, varying from brief confused arousals to frank sleepwalking.Agitated events may be seen, especially in younger age groups, leading to disturbing 'night terrors'.Despite apparent severe distress and intense autonomic activation, the child rarely recalls the nocturnal events.Because they are thought to reflect an incomplete transition from deep sleep to wakefulness, non-REM parasomnias are often termed 'arousal disorders'.Most non-REM sleep parasomnias improve through adolescence but may persist on a regular basis in at least 1% of adults.An enormous range of behaviours may be reported, some of which are complex and potentially hazardous.In adulthood, subjects appear to be more prone to exhibiting activities which may be considered 'goal-seeking' in nature, including eating or cooking.Males, in particular, while in a state of parasomnia, may engage in intimate relations with bed partners or display violence.Subsequent recall is invariably absent or severely diminished although some report dream-like or hallucinatory images, particularly if the parasomnia is associated with significant agitation.Common themes include spiders or other unpleasant visual imagery.Often, there is simply a sense of 'impending doom' causing the subject to rush from the bedroom, often vocalising and disturbing partners.It is usually possible to communicate at a limited level with subjects in this state although they typically display a degree of confusion and appear only partially awake.Typically, an adult with a significant non-REM sleep parasomnia will have events from deep slow wave sleep within an hour or two of sleep onset.Events rarely occur more than once a night but may cluster with several symptomatic nights in a week.Often, there are more prolonged spells free of disturbances.The behaviours across nights might be similar but are not precisely stereotyped.Triggers or precipitants are often identified and include internal factors that tend to deepen non-REM sleep (such as sleep deprivation) or external factors (such as an uncomfortable or noisy environment) which may partially arouse the deeply sleeping subject.Although controlled evidence is limited, short-acting hypnotics such as zolpidem may induce sleepwalking or similar behaviours in predisposed individuals.Similarly, alcohol in some may appear to trigger parasomnias, potentially through secondary factors such as sleep deprivation, increased snoring or a full bladder.By contrast, in clinical ABSTRACT It is common for general physicians to experience diagnostic doubt and trepidation whenever faced with patients who exhibit abnormal nocturnal behaviours or excessive movements at night.There is also a perception that expensive and often poorly available overnight tests are usually required for diagnostic precision.In fact, the majority of conditions, whether they be parasomnias or, more rarely, nocturnal seizures, can be reliably diagnosed from a directed history, if available.Although the evidence base for treating parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders remains minimal, accurate recognition is important for a variety of reasons.This review covers the diagnostic features of the full range of parasomnias and movement disorders that might present to a multidisciplinary adult sleep clinic.Throughout, it will be argued that the recognition of key or salient features obtained from a good history is the most important diagnostic tool.Indeed, when diagnostic doubt remains after a thorough sleep history, it is relatively rare for detailed tests to add much in the way of useful information.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep paralysis is one of the many conditions of which visual hallucinations can be a part but has received relatively little attention. It can be associated with other dramatic symptoms of a psychotic nature likely to cause diagnostic uncertainty. Methods and results: These points are illustrated by the case of a young man with a severe bipolar affective disorder who independently developed terrifying visual, auditory and somatic hallucinatory episodes at sleep onset, associated with a sense of evil influence and presence. The episodes were not obviously related to his psychiatric disorder. Past diagnoses included nightmares and night terrors. Review provided no convincing evidence of various other sleep disorders nor physical conditions in which hallucinatory experiences can occur. A diagnosis of predormital isolated sleep paralysis was made and appropriate treatment recommended. Conclusions: Sleep paralysis, common in the general population, can be associated with dramatic auxiliary symptoms suggestive of a psychotic state. Less common forms are either part of the narcolepsy syndrome or (rarely) they are familial in type. Interestingly, sleep paralysis (especially breathing difficulty) features prominently in the folklore of various countries.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

In the waking state, these muscles generally respond to loud sound (middle ear reflex). Middle ear muscle activity typically erupts before or at the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and persists throughout the REM period in a discontinuous pattern resembling that exhibited by rapid eye movements. Approximately 80 percent of all nocturnal middle ear muscle activity is contained in REM sleep. Half of the remaining 20 percent occurs in the 10-minute intervals just prior to the onset of REM sleep. Middle ear muscle activity is often associated with other phasic events such as momentary enhancement of electromyogram inhibition, apnea, and K complexes. Rapid eye movements and middle ear muscle activity, though significantly correlated in REM sleep, are not always simultaneous.",

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

      "abstract": "This study reports practice-based clinical evidence related to observations of two novel pathophysiologic visual phenomena reported by certain patients to have persisted following the psychological trauma of an acute-fear The initially obscure visual phenomena were initially investigated heuristically in psychiatric, psychological, and ophthalmic practices and subsequently characterized over 25 years.The first phenomenon:A visual image of what had been seen and felt during the most frightening moment of an acute-fear experience is immediately stored abnormally, and subsequently recalled abnormally as an experiential hallucinatory-like visual-image and other sensory-memory flashback. The second phenomenon:An abnormality of vision of peripheral oscillopsia, persisting from the time of the same acute-fear experience. The third phenomenon: A high probability of stepwise simultaneous elimination of both visual phenomena follows the maneuver of repeatedly exposing each voluntarily evoked visual-image and other sensory memory to volitional rapid side-to-side eye movements, as per one aspect of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.This maneuver leaves the memory stored and recalled normally (i.e., nonexperientially) and vision oscillopsia-free. Clinical features of patients with the visual phenomena are unique to each patient.The authors report further observations over 25 years on the wide spectra of difficulty, intensity, and/or obtrusiveness of each of the three visual phenomena and of three closely related clinical features. Relevant clinical findings pertaining to the visual phenomena in 100 recent consecutively referred patients are reported.The strong inference of these observations induces a schema: a further refinement of the construct posttraumatic stress disorder, together with a visual state marker.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

      "title": "Transient Ischemic Attacks",
      "abstract": "FigureDiagnosing transient ischemic attack is not always simple or straightforward. History may help, as with many entities, but then again, it might not. A patient whose arm was numb, swollen, limp, or “dead” earlier might have actually had a motor problem. Onset of neurologic deficit is generally sudden, and deficits are typically of short duration (less than 30 minutes). Involvement of different body parts affected in succession is more characteristic of migraine or seizure. Preceding seizure may cause a post-ictal (Todd's) paralysis. One paper listed signs and symptoms likely not due to TIA: loss of consciousness, vague weakness or dizziness, mental confusion, and incontinence of urine and feces. (Lancet 1992;339:402.) Similarly, vertigo, diplopia, loss of balance, tinnitus, sensory symptoms confined to part of one limb or the face, drop attacks, and amnesia, all in isolation, are unlikely to be caused by TIA. Symptoms from multiple sclerosis typically last longer, and may be characterized by different neurologic manifestations at different times. (Ann Emerg Med 2004;43:592.) How Much Work-up is Necessary? A few remarks on definitions for a moment: The classic definition of a transient ischemic attack entails a focal neurologic symptom lasting less than 24 hours, resulting from a transient decrease in blood supply making the brain ischemic in the area producing the symptom. With advances in neuroimaging, however, especially diffusion-weighted imaging on magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to identify ischemic brain injury very early. The classic TIA implies restoration of blood flow in a timely enough way to avoid infarction. Transient neurologic symptoms lasting for more than an hour usually imply that some sort of infarction has set in, and these events should not be considered TIAs. Switching from the classic definition to a tissue-based definition would decrease the annual incidence of TIA by approximately 33 percent and increase the annual incidence of stroke by approximately seven percent. (Stroke 2003;34:919.) Diffusion-weighted imaging has the advantage of distinguishing acute infarction from chronic lesions. Some of these are very small; the mean infarct volume detected in TIA patients was less than 1 mL in one report. In fact, this has led some to distinguish transient symptoms with infarction (TSI) from transient symptoms without infarction. (Ann Neurol 2005;57:679.) Clinical TIA duration may not correlate with signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging. Back to Basics: Why the Hurry? It doesn't make sense to perform expensive tests for an entity that has no emergency treatment and that depends on the results of these tests. (“My back has been killing me for three years. I want an MRI to see what it is once and for all.”) Certainly, it makes sense to put patients on warfarin who have atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke, and an EKG is not a time-consuming or expensive test. Symptomatic patients with greater than 70 percent carotid stenosis, on the other hand, may well derive benefit from endarterectomy. Should all patients be admitted? This is probably the question of the hour for the emergency physician. A debate on this topic appeared in Stroke. (2006;37:1137.) As noted last month, the risk of stroke may be 10 percent to 20 percent in the 90 days after TIA. Perhaps half of the risk of early stroke accrues in the first two days after TIA, however. This is hardly enough time to expect a timely outpatient work-up by a neurologist or a patient's primary care provider. Potential benefits for hospitalization include expedited work-up, opportunity for risk factor modification, monitoring patients for deterioration and possible thrombolysis and especially facilitation of early carotid artery revascularization. Carotid surgery has been shown to be most effective when performed within two weeks of the index ischemic event. (Lancet 2004;363:915.) As for medical therapy with antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) or a statin, studies to be published soon may shed some light on their efficacy in the hyperacute state after TIA or minor stroke. For patients with atrial fibrillation and TIA, the rate of stroke appears to be approximately five percent in the first two to four weeks, a figure that may not be affected by anticoagulation. (Stroke 2002;33:2722.) There is some evidence that patients with motor or speech deficits of less than 10 minutes' duration, who are over 60, or who have diabetes are at higher risk for early stroke. Clinical risk stratification models for TIA have been developed and are used in some settings. (Stroke 2006;37:1137.) Sending Some Patients Home As with other disease entities, it is useful to confirm the diagnosis of TIA, identify and treat the cause, and especially prevent a disabling or fatal vascular event. Disposition from the emergency department often will be contingent on whether the patient is stable in other ways and prompt follow-up is available. This all presupposes that the emergency physician has made an accurate diagnosis, so that the neurologist isn't trashing the EP for tying up a precious hospital bed for someone with hypoglycemia, Todd's paralysis that resolves by the time the admitting physician comes in, or some benign vestibular disorder. Some experts say brain imaging for the most part can be performed on an outpatient basis, as can carotid scanning and echocardiography, perhaps even in a timely way. (Stroke 2006;37:1139.) Patients do not need to be in the hospital to be taught the value of exercise and cessation of smoking. They can certainly be started on any statin, diuretic, or ACE inhibitor without being hospitalized. Then there are the dangers of being in the hospital at all for anyone: exposure to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, risk of deep venous thrombosis, and deconditioning from being confined to a hospital bed. At any rate, many patients with TIA and normal imaging on diffusion-weighted imaging do well. One study of 83 consecutive patients listed th incidence of recurrent cerebral ischemic event after approximately 13 months at 30 percent if infarction was present, but only 14 percent if no infarction was present on diffusion-weighted imaging. (Stroke 2004;35:2313.) More convincingly, in a case series of 57 patients presenting with TIA, the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients who had TIA with infarction during their hospital stay (3 to 5 days) was 14.8 percent, while no recurrent or new stroke occurred in patients with TIA and normal imaging. (Cerebrovasc Dis 2002;14:177.) The Bottom Lines There will be ongoing debate about how TIA should be defined and what technology is needed to determine whether a TIA actually occurred. From our perspective, there are some therapies which may prevent stroke and enough science to justify testing. It certainly adds more value to prevent neurologic deficit than to hospitalize someone after a CVA for rehabilitation purposes. There is a dearth of evidence on exactly what to do with the TIA patient in the emergency department. Patients with clear neurologic deficits such as aphasia or hemiparesis may be at higher risk than those with sensory events or vertigo. TIA work-up clearly lends itself to a brief hospital observation stay. Because the persistent concern is for tight carotid stenosis requiring revascularization, the case could be made for sending TIA patients home as long as their carotid arteries have been evaluated. Clearly, the last word has not been issued about whether all TIAs should be admitted. The fact that there has been a debate published this year (pro and con) in the stroke literature attests to this. In fact, the con position in the debate over hospitalization for TIAs was held by a geriatrician who works in a national health service country (Australia). If he thinks he can get a timely work-up there, surely we might be able to do so in the U.S. EMN on the Web Looking for Dr. James Roberts' article on kidney stones?

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Abnormal Movements at Night?",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of parasomnias occurring in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.Disorders of arousal are characterized by dissociated sleep, with wake and sleep phenomena intermingling, and local sleep, in which different areas of the brain exist simultaneously in different states of wakefulness or sleep. The frequency of arousals from slow-wave sleep with delta or mixed-frequency activity has a high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for the diagnosis of arousal parasomnias.Disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) are characterized by incomplete awakenings from slow-wave sleep, limited recall of imagery, and partial or complete amnesia. They occur most frequently in childhood. Management includes correction of precipitating factors, attention to safety, behavioral techniques, and medications. Sleep-related eating disorder is a variant of arousal disorders and may be associated with the use of short-acting hypnotics and restless legs syndrome. Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations can occur with visual loss, dementia with Lewy bodies, use of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and anxiety. Exploding head syndrome occurs at wake-sleep transition or on waking during the night, is usually benign, and requires treatment only if significant sleep disruption occurs.",

One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "title": "A PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY OF NIGHTMARES AND NIGHT TERRORS",
      "abstract": "Anxious arousals originate from all sleep stages and can be classified as: a) stage 4 night terrors; b) rapid eye movement (REM) nightmares; c) stage 2 awakenings; and d) hypnagogic nightmares. We have confirmed Broughton's finding that the night terror, the most severe type of episode, does not occur in sleep but as part of the \"arousal response,\" a complex of autonomic discharge and behavioral symptoms. The full blown night terror is a fight-flight episode combining sleep utterances, sleep walking and hallucinated or delusional mental content associated with terror. There is a significant positive correlation between intensity of night terror and the amount of delta sleep preceding arousal, e.g., stage 4 arousals designated as night terrors are preceded by longer periods of stage 4 than arousals of lesser intensity (p <.05). About two-thirds of both stage 4 and night terrors occurs in the first non-REM (NREM) period. The night terror arises out of physiologically quiescent sleep as indicated by the normal or slightly less them normal cardiorespiratory rates during the first NREM period and absence of skin resistance changes prior to the attack. The night terror is ushered in by sudden loud piercing screams, the subject passing into an aroused state characterized by alpha rhythm, motility, often somnambulism, intense autonomic discharge (precipitous doubling or even tripling of heart rate, great increase in respiratory amplitude, marked decrease in skin resistance), brief duration (1 to 3 minutes), varying degrees of amnesia for the episode, and rapid return to sleep. The night terror is a much more severe phenomenon than the REM nightmare although the latter is far more frequent. The nightmare occurs in REM sleep, is characterized by slight autonomic fluctuations, compared to the night terror, and, in half of instances, a \"desomatization\" of the anxiety response, that is, absence of its physiological concomitants. The REM state is physiologically activated to begin with, constituting a preparation for fright, possibly a buffer against the extreme terror of the stage 4 variety. The important problem of the triggering mechanisms of the night terror remains unsolved: whether the attack is precipitated by ongoing mental content during delta sleep, or represents a psychosomatic \"arousal response\" (Broughton). The fact that it can be induced artificially by sounding a buzzer speaks in favor of the latter, the finding of significant mental content in favor of the former. The night terror is not a dream but a symptom emerging from stage 3-4 sleep, associated with a rift in the ego's capacity to control anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Several studies in the last ten years have been directed towards a better understanding of sleep disorders in childhood. Defining sleep disorders in this age is difficult in dependence of relevant differences in sleep patterns at subsequent developmental stages. In new-borns total sleep time is fairly equal during night and day. Normally, day-time sleep gradually decreases over the first three years of life, such that night-time sleep progressively increases till the age of four, and similar to adult sleep-time by adolescence. The most frequent sleep disorders observed in childhood are parasomnias, that, thought to be a CNS sign of immaturity, tend to be quite predictable, recurring in the same families and not even influenced by environmental stimuli. These disorders included: a) arousal disorders, that generally emerge from delta sleep or relate to arousals occurring during NREM sleep, very common in childhood and fairly common in adulthood either; b) somnambulism and somniloquy, that have many common characteristics: first of all, they have the potential to generate a great sense of discomfort and fear in parents watching a child who suddenly sits up in bed eyes-opened but 'unseeing'; c) nocturnal enuresis, that is substantially not a problem of depth of sleep, despite many parents believe. Although narcolepsy is more common in adolescence, many studies have demonstrated that narcoleptic symptoms may begin in childhood. Narcoleptic symptoms in children are similar in their appearance to those predominant in adults, but their expression may be different because of CNS maturational factors. Historical descriptions of the OSAS evidenced since the beginning the importance of neurobehavioral complications associated with the cessation of airflow at the nose and mouth accompanied by respiratory effort, deriving from upper airway obstruction which occurs during sleep.",

PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Sleep-disordered Breathing in Neuromuscular Disease",
      "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases is due to an exaggerated reduction in lung volumes during supine sleep, a compromised physiologic adaptation to sleep, and specific features of the diseases that may promote upper airway collapse or heart failure. The normal decrease in the rib cage contribution to the tidal volume during phasic REM sleep becomes a critical vulnerability, resulting in saw-tooth oxygen desaturation possibly representing the earliest manifestation of respiratory muscle weakness. Hypoventilation can occur in REM sleep and progress into non-REM sleep, with continuous desaturation and hypercarbia. Specific characteristics of neuromuscular disorders, such as pharyngeal neuropathy or weakness, macroglossia, bulbar manifestations, or low lung volumes, predispose patients to the development of obstructive events. Central sleep-disordered breathing can occur with associated cardiomyopathy (e.g., dystrophies) or from instability in the control of breathing due to diaphragm weakness. Mitigating factors such as recruitment of accessory respiratory muscles, reduction in REM sleep, and loss of normal REM atonia in some individuals may partially protect against sleep-disordered breathing. Noninvasive ventilation, a standard-of-care management option for sleep-disordered breathing, can itself trigger specific sleep-disordered breathing events including air leaks, patient-ventilator asynchrony, central sleep apnea, and glottic closure. These events increase arousals, reduce adherence, and impair sleep architecture. Polysomnography plays an important role in addressing pitfalls in the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases, identifying sleep-disordered breathing triggered by noninvasive ventilation, and optimizing noninvasive ventilation settings.",

      "abstract": "Reflex epilepsy is a condition, wherein epileptic seizures are triggered by specific stimuli such as flashing lights, music, reading etc. Stimuli may be exogenous (sensory) or endogenous (e.g.: praxis induced, solving calculations). Very rarely, the act of urination can set off seizures and this may often be confused with micturition syncope, when loss of consciousness occurs early. Our patient is a 5-year-old boy who was born to non-consanguineous parents by normal delivery. He had a smooth perinatal transit and an unremarkable first year of life. He had delay in acquisition of language milestones and began to speak bi-syllables by 2.5 years of life. Development in other domains was relatively normal. At the age of 4 years, he was noticed to have brief episodes of posturing of his upper limbs with up-rolling of eyes during sleep. These events lasted for a few seconds and occurred 5–6 times during the night. The child was treated with sodium valproate (SVA) and levetiracetam (LEV) at weight appropriate doses elsewhere. Despite good compliance, he continued to suffer from daily nocturnal brief tonic seizures. About 4 months into the illness, he developed another symptom. When the child commences to urinate, he loses consciousness and slumps to the floor. His mother reported that his limbs appeared to be tightly held in extension and his eyes looked to the right. This phenomenon occurred when child urinated in both sitting and standing position. The possibilities considered were micturition induced reflex seizures vs. micturition syncope. In view of pre-existing developmental delay and co-existing nocturnal seizures, the former differential diagnosis appeared to be more likely. His scalp EEG showed a posterior dominant rhythm of 4−5 Hz. He had frequent spikes in the right temporal (F8, T4) and frontocentral (FC) regions (F4,C4) and rare spikes in the left FC leads (F3,C3). To precisely characterize the nature of his symptoms, he underwent video-EEG telemetry. A total of 6 stereotyped events were recorded, all during micturition. Within a few seconds of starting to urinate, the child had slow neck flexion, looked to the right side with eye version to the right and had posturing of his upper limbs (right in extension and left in flexion). Its counterpart ictal EEG showed low amplitude fast activity in the midline centroparietal leads which increased in amplitude and culminated into bilateral centroparietal slowing towards the end of the attack. He regained consciousness 10 s after the cessation of ictal activity (Fig. 2). EKG recording during the ictus did not show any alteration in rhythm. It is likely that these seizures were originating from near the midline, possibly from the left hemisphere. Given that the micturition centers are also in the mesial frontal regions, this finding is not surprising. MRI done with a 3 T scanner was normal and PET-MRI did not show any areas of focal hypometabolism (Fig. 1a, ). Interictal MEG showed equivalent current dipoles clustered in the left midline posterior parietal region just above the corpus callosum (Fig. 1b). Though this is an interictal finding, it appears to be concordant with the hypothesis generated from VEEG. LEV was tapered and was prescribed lamotrigine (3 mg/kg) along with SVA (25 mg/kg). There was complete cessation of both reflex and non-reflex nocturnal seizures for the past 9 months.Fig. 2Clinical semiology and ictal EEG.Show full captiona. Clinical semiology b.

Fast activity in Cz,Pz with spread to bilateral FC leads(arrow – child starts to urinate, arrow head – onset of fast activity). Biparietal slowing noted at the end of ictus. Micturition is a complex physiological process which is controlled by the spinal cord, brainstem and the cortex. The higher centers for micturition lie in the pons, periaqueductal grey, mesial frontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortex. Though the exact mechanism of reflex seizures during urination has not been elucidated, one might intuitively assume that mesial frontal activation could set off seizures in susceptible individuals. An ictal EEG and ictal PET study from Japan [[1]Okumura A. Kondo Y. Tsuji T. Ikuta T. Negoro T. Kato K. et al.Micturition induced seizures: ictal EEG and subtraction ictal SPECT findings.Epilepsy Res. 2007; 73: 119-121https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2006.09.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar] observed changes in the mesial frontal region in the ictal PET scan. Clinical semiology was also suggestive of ictal onset from the left supplementary motor area. Only a handful of cases have been reported in literature, whose clinical features have been reviewed [[2]Jang H.-J. Kwon M.J. Cho K.-O. Central Regulation of Micturition and Its Association With Epilepsy.Int Neurourol J. 2018; 22: 2-8https://doi.org/10.5213/inj.1836040.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar]. Interestingly most patients have co-existing neuro-developmental issues. Seizure onset though commonly is seen in the midline in EEGs, case reports have mentioned other areas of EEG changes namely frontotemporal and occipital regions. Semiology and ictal EEG similar to our patient has been reported from another center in southern India [[3]Rathore C. Teaching Video NeuroImage: Electroclinical characteristics of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Neurology. 2008; 70: 20https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000312283.88683.0dCrossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. In another study, urodynamic testing during the ictus identified detrusor over activity [[4]Seth J.H. McLaughlin C. Eriksson S. Fowler C.J. Walker M.C. Panicker J.N. Blackouts in the toilet: a case of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Pract Neurol. 2014; 14: 261-263https://doi.org/10.1136/practneurol-2013-000733Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. To the best of our knowledge, no MEG data in this type of reflex epilepsy is currently available in literature. The MEG cluster has localized to the midline left parietal region, which is posterior to the 'known micturition center' in the frontal region. The interictal MEG corresponds fairly to the region ictal EEG onset. It may only be hypothesized that this region is closely networked with the frontal micturition center. This case highlights an unusual semiology of asymmetric tonic seizures during micturition in a child with mild developmental delay and normal imaging. Overall, VEEG and MEG has suggested the role of midline structures possibly in the left parietal region. The importance of video-telemetry is emphasized, as it can help differentiate between epileptic seizures vs non-epileptic conditions. Lamotrigine and valproate combination resulted in sustained seizure freedom for 9 months. Further studies are required to elucidate treatment algorithms for these patients, but may be cumbersome as this condition is exceedingly rare.",

The amnesia in this case is presumed to result from conflict and repression, and its presentation varies from individual to individual. Typically, a patient is admitted to the hospital in a confused or frightened state. Memory for the past has been lost, especially personal, autobiographical memory. Often, the patient cannot produce his or her own name. Yet, the ability to learn new material is almost always intact. After the disorder clears, usually within a week, the lost memories return except for the events of the day or two just prior to hospital admission.

      "title": "Neuroanatomical and Etiological Approaches to Secondary Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is one of the most significant of human behaviors, occupying roughly one-third of human life. Sleep disorders are one of the most common clinical problems encountered in outpatient settings and inpatient settings. Lack of sleep can lead to the inability to concentrate, memory complaints, and deficits in neuropsychological testing. Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients. Patients with delayed and advanced sleep phase insomnia can be treated with proper timing of bright light and behavioral changes. Hypersomnia related to a mental disorder is usually found in a variety of conditions such as the early stages of mild depressive disorder, grief, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

      "title": "Public health and insomnia: economic impact.",
      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

      "title": "Psychophysiological Control of the Functional State of the Human Operator",
      "abstract": "The effectiveness of the activity of an operator controlling a complex technical system depends not only on his professional qualifications and his vested interest in obtaining a high rating but also on his actual functional state, the most important characteristics of which are: level of alertness, degree of emotional tension, and fatigue. These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

      "title": "Physiological and psychological factors in sleep-onset insomnia.",
      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

Death occurred between the 28th and 120th hr. Body motility, eye movements, respiratory and cardiac rhythms, chin myogram, electroencephalogram (EEG), and crying were evaluated by careful observation and by polygraphic recordings for periods of from 1 to 2 hr. A very rich and continuous motility is described consisting of rapid jerks, either diffuse or localized, and of slow movements. Rhythmic movements of the chin or peribuccal area occur in bursts and are particularly striking. The paucity of rapid eye movements (REM) is also remarkable. The EEG is composed of silent periods interrupted by discontinuous polymorphic activity. The fixation of the cardiac rate, the absence of periodic respiration and of apneic periods are the most important vegetative phenomena. Crying occurs in short periods rarely lasting more than 20 sec. The state of these previable prematures cannot be considered as waking; it seems to be a very immature state of sleep that differs from both the quiet and the active sleep of full‐term newborns. This atypical sleep, which appears to be present in other species characterized by a great degree of immaturity at birth, does not give any evidence of cyclic organization.",

The subject usually is readily aroused to full alertness and is able to recall much of the content of the dream. This distinguishes nightmares from night terrors, which are associated with a prolonged transition to wakefulness and scant recall of dream narrative. Although nightmares are featured prominently in literature and descriptive psychoanalytic writings, there is limited empirical research on this phenomenon. This fact is driven in part by pragmatic scientific limitations that make it difficult to observe neurocognitive events during the actual dream. Dreams can only be recalled following an awakening, and the fidelity of recall is not known. For example, it is possible that dream recall is limited to dream events occurring in the immediate period just prior to arousal. Further, dream recall is subject to retrieval biases in which the subject imposes order on what has been a chaotic mental experience.",

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a long-term sickness in which a person has trouble sleeping. Every person has trouble sleeping every once in a while. But for people with insomnia disorder, sleep problems happen at least 3 nights each week for at least 3 stretch. Insomnia disorder can affect daily life. It can affect job and personal relationships. Insomnia disorder may also increase risk for heart disease. There are many things that trigger insomnia like stress, anxiety, alcohol, tobacco, looking at bright screens, working shifts and too much of caffeine. Once these tricks go away, the insomnia may continue and head to insomnia disorder. This may happen because of habits formed because of insomnia (such as napping, getting in bed before being sleepy, and lying-in bed awake for long periods of time). Insomnia disorder can also sometimes appear on its own with no known cause.",

      "title": "Characteristics of Accidents Attributed to the Driver Having Fallen Asleep",
      "abstract": "Even in non-sleep-deprived persons, sleepiness occurs at two particular periods of the day, i.e., during the night at the time of normal sleep and in the early afternoon, at the time of the siesta in certain cultures. This can be shown by measuring the physiological tendency to sleep as the latency to sleep in brief naps (Richardson, et al, 1982). Increases in sleepiness can result from sleep deprivation (inadequate sleep) or from sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. Subjects who are excessively sleepy, from whatever cause, have performance lapses and slowed reaction times and an accelerated loss of attentional vigilance (Dinges, 1992). They, moreover will exhibit the phenomenon of microsleeps, i.e., sleepy subjects may fall asleep in an unpredictable fashion and be temporarily unaware of their surroundings. These behavioral changes that occur in sleepy individuals can have important consequences. The consequences will depend on the environment that the subject is in. Perhaps the most dangerous situation is while driving. Crashes occur in individuals who fall asleep at the wheel. Such crashes can be serious with resulting fatalities (Parsons, 1986). That this occurs has been known for some time (for review of earlier work in this area, see Shinar, 1978). The goal of the study described in this report was to investigate, in detail, the characteristics of accidents attributed on the police report to the driver having fallen asleep. The study was a retrospective analysis of data from the state of North Carolina. We analyzed data for the years 1990 to 1992, inclusive. The data are maintained in the data base at the Highway Safety Research Center (HSRC), University of North Carolina. Language: en",

      "title": "Awareness Under General Anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Background: Awareness while under general anesthesia, and the later recall of what happened during surgery, can be experienced by patients as horrific events that leave lasting mental trauma behind.Patients may have both auditory and tactile perception, potentially accompanied by feelings of helplessness, inability to move, pain, and panic ranging to an acute fear of death.For some patients, the experience of awareness under anesthesia has no sequelae; for others, however, it can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, consisting of complex psychopathological phenomena such as anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, irritability, and depression possibly leading to suicidality.Methods: The literature on the subject was selectively reviewed.Results: In the absence of risk factors awareness phenomena occur in one to two per 1000 operations under general anesthesia (0.1% to 0.2%) and are thus classed as an occasionally occurring critical event.In children, the risk of such phenomena occurring is 8 to 10 times higher.These phenomena are due to an inadequate depth of anesthesia with incomplete unconsciousness.They can be promoted by a number of risk factors that are either patient-related (ASA class III or above, medication abuse), surgery-related (Caesarean section, emergency procedures, surgery at night), or anesthesia-related (anesthesia without benzodiazepines, use of muscle relaxants).Conclusion: Strategies for avoiding awareness phenomena under anesthesia include the training of staff to know about the problem and, specifically, the use of benzodiazepines, the avoidance of muscle relaxants if possible, and shielding the patient from excessive noise.EEG monitoring is effective but provides no guarantee against awareness.If awareness under anesthesia occurs despite these measures, the patient must be given expert, interdisciplinary treatment as soon after the event as possible in order to minimize its potential sequelae.",

      "title": "Provoked and reflex seizures: Surprising or common?",
      "abstract": "Most patients with epilepsy report that seizures are sometimes, or exclusively, provoked by general internal precipitants (such as stress, fatigue, fever, sleep, and menstrual cycle) and by external precipitants (such as excess alcohol, heat, bathing, eating, reading, and flashing lights). Some patients describe very exotic and precise triggers, like tooth brushing or listening to a particular melody. Nevertheless, the most commonly noticed seizure increasers by far are stress, lack of sleep, and fatigue. Recognized reflex seizure triggers are usually sensory and visual, such as television, discotheques, and video games. Visually evoked seizures comprise 5% of the total of 6% reflex seizures. The distinction between provocative and reflex factors and seizures seems artificial, and in many patients, maybe all, there is a combination of these. It seems plausible that all of the above-mentioned factors can misbalance the actual brain network; at times, accumulation of factors leads then to primary generalized, partial, or secondarily generalized seizures. If the provoking factors are too exotic, patients may be sent to the psychiatrist. Conversely, if the seizure-provoking fluctuating mechanisms include common habits and environmental factors, these may hardly be considered as provocative factors. Awareness of precipitating factors and its possible interactions might help us to unravel the pathophysiology of epilepsy and to change the notion that seizure occurrence is unpredictable. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, treatment, and especially similarities in the variety of provocative and reflex factors with resulting general hypotheses.",

MemoryDefects of memory are either in the registration of new experience (antegrade) or the recall of past experience (retrograde).In gross dementia the patient may lose the ability to repeat a series of numbers he has just heard.This immediate type of defect is also seen in dysphasia, or whenever attention or concentration is dis- tracted-as in depression or acute confusional states.Short term memory deficit is tested by inviting the recall of a few numbers and two or three names after five minutes of other conversation.The limbic system, including the mamillary bodies and hippocampus, must be intact for new experience to be registered and recent events recollected.In Korsakow's amnesia, where the main damage is in the mamillary bodies, antegrade amnesia-learning ability-is permanently damaged and several years ofexperience are lost.After head injury an antegrade defect is noted but this is temporary.The retrograde amnesia shrinks until minutes or seconds before the accident.Deep memory, including childhood events, can be retained and recalled when limbic structures no longer function.The long term memory is tested by asking for details of the patient and his family and about important people or events.Moments of great personal pleasure or poignancy can be recalled most clearly.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "title": "Dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

For some of us, loss of sleep is short-lived; for others, it is chronic and we’ve come to anticipate losing sleep on a regular basis.

We discuss two patients with complex presentations. The first patient was diagnosed with sleep syncope, a relatively unknown type of reflex syncope. The prodromal symptoms of discomfort and the subsequent loss of consciousness occurred while the patient was in bed or got up to go to the toilet due to abdominal symptoms. The onset in supine position was misleading, since this is a well-known alarm symptom of a possible cardiac cause. The second patient had vasovagal syncope followed by a psychogenic pseudosyncope. This resulted in frequent loss of consciousness of long duration with typical and atypical triggers and uncommon syncopal signs, including eye closure. These conflicting symptoms can be a pitfall and clinical expertise is required to identify the type of syncope.",

      "title": "[Disruptive nocturnal behavior in elderly subjects: could it be a parasomnia?].",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are sleep-related abnormal behaviors. They are frequent and overlooked causes of nocturnal disruptive behavior in the elderly, especially when patients are cognitively impaired. Confusion and violence can result in sleep disruption, injuries for the patients or their bed partners, caregivers distress, and they can be a motive for institutionalization. Parasomnias include the NonREM sleep disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleep-related eating disorder), the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and more rarely the parasomnia overlap syndrome, which associates both NREM and REM parasomnias. Patients with NREM sleep parasomnias are confused, eyes open, with a glazed look during their nocturnal behaviors, and they have a post-episode amnesia. They shout and bolt from the bed (night terrors), look about in a confused manner, walk and speak (sleepwalking), and eat peculiar or inedible food (sleep-related eating disorders). These behaviors, which are frequent in young adults, may be triggered by short-half live hypnotics in elderly. During the parasomnia, the brain is partially awake (enough to perform complex motor and verbal action), and partially asleep (without conscious awareness or responsibility). RBD is characterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia that accompanies REM sleep. Patients have excessive motor activity such as punching, kicking, or crying out in association with dream content. RBD are frequent in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and may precede the cognitive or motor symptoms of these diseases by 5 to 10 years. RBD can also be promoted by antidepressants. When combined with thorough clinical interviews, the video-polysomnography is a powerful tool, especially for discriminating the parasomnia from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, sleep apneas and periodic leg movements. Ensuring safety and withdrawing deleterious treatments are useful in patients with violent activities, potential injurious or bothersome to other household members. Clonazepam and melatonin (3-12 mg) are highly effective for treating RBD.",

      "abstract": "Patients with mental disorders exhibit a range of abnormal movements. The severely depressed are given to hand wringing, pacing, and restlessness. Others lie in bed, stare into space, and posture for hours or days. At times, this behavior is so extreme as to be a stupor. Psychotic patients exhibit tremors or peculiar facial and body movements described as parkinsonism, dystonia, or dyskinesia. Manic patients are in constant motion. Children and adolescents bang their heads and pick at their skin, injuring themselves. Little attention is paid to such behavior unless it overwhelms the patient’s life, but it does distress the patient, the family, and the community. These motor symptoms often bring psychiatric patients to medical care. Catatonia is the motor syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity, unusual posturing, negativism (refusal to obey simple commands), mutism (persistent silence), echolalia (repetition of what has been said), echopraxia (imitation of movements), and repeated stereotyped mannerisms. It appears suddenly and quickly immobilizes the patient or it appears insidiously. When it dominates behavior and threatens the patient’s life by the failure to eat or drink, treatment becomes compulsory. Forced feeding, bedsores resulting from immobility, muscular atrophy, bladder catheterization and consequent infection, and blood clots in immobilized limbs all take a terrible toll. If the clots move to the lungs or brain, stroke or death may ensue. Catatonia was first described as a consequence of intense emotional anguish and tension. Although the movements frequently respond to sedative drugs, ECT is a more complete and effective treatment. The condition is frequently seen in patients with affective illnesses— both depression and mania—in patients with systemic disorders, and in those with toxic brain states caused by hallucinogenic drugs. For decades, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that each instance of catatonia represented a type of schizophrenia. The major classification systems in psychiatry—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases—assigned to all patients with catatonia the diagnosis of schizophrenia, catatonic type. As a consequence, few patients were treated with anticonvulsant sedatives or with ECT, because those treatments were not recognized as effective in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Daytime breathing problems caused by neurologic lesions always worsen during sleep, and in certain cases abnormal breathing patterns are only seen during sleep or specific sleep states. The first clinical manifestation of maltase deficiency, myopathy, or myotonic dystrophy is often a sleep-related complaint, such as unexplained waking from sleep (insomnia) or daytime somnolence. Thus, systematic investigation during sleep of disorders impairing the loop involved in breathing is strongly encouraged. Lesions may involve sensory receptors, sensory pathways, brainstem-controlling neurons, upper motor neurons, descending motor pathways, lower motor neurons, motor nerves, neuromuscular junctions, or respiratory muscles. Most of these lesions lead to a decrease in or absence of inspiratory efforts (diaphragmatic apnea or hypopnea) during sleep. These events differ from the classic obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the recently described upper airway resistance syndrome, which usually involve mild or significant anatomic abnormalities of the upper airway and craniofacial region. The treatment of abnormal breathing during sleep has been improved by the development of nasal ventilation methods: continuous positive airway pressure, intermittent positive pressure, and volume ventilation. These therapeutic approaches can prevent tracheostomy and diaphragmatic pacing and are more efficacious than drug treatments. Long-term compliance is generally much better in breathing disorders secondary to neurologic impairments than in cases of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.",

Two broad types of insomnia may often be distinguished: (1) difficulty falling asleep and frequent wakening, characteristic of anxiety states or obsessive worrying; and (2) early morning wakening, sometimes in a panic, suggestive of endogenous depression. The first group of patients respond well to minor tranquilizers and psychotherapy, whereas the second do well with tricyclic anti-depressants. Many studies in sleep laboratories have declineated the stages and cycles of sleep physiology and pathology, especially the importance of REM or dreaming sleep. The clinician should be cautious in the use of hypnotics like barbiturates which suppress REM sleep and produce a rebound increase on withdrawal, as well as problems of dependence of habituation. Flurazepam and chloral hydrate are considerably safer in this respect. Understanding sleep neurophysiology and biochemistry permits appropriate individual clinical management for both psychiatric patients and medical patients with conditions like peptic ulcer and nocturnal angina pectoris.",

      "title": "Sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders",
      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness of sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders. Most of the sleep disturbances in neuromuscular disorders are secondary to sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is commonly associated with a slowly developing chronic respiratory failure, particularly in the advanced stages, but the condition often remains unrecognized and untreated. The most common sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is sleep-related hypoventilation which initially manifests during REM sleep and later as the disease advances, it is also noted during non-REM sleep and even during daytime. In addition to the hypoventilation, central and upper airway obstructive apneas as well as hypopneas occur. Hypoventilation during sleep gives rise to hypoxemia and hypercapnea causing chronic respiratory failure. The abnormal blood gases may later persist during the daytime. Some patients may, however, have sleep onset or maintenance insomnia as a result of associated pain, muscle immobility, contractures, joint pains and muscle cramps as well as anxiety and depression.The commonest complaint in patients with neuromuscular disorders associated with sleep-disordered breathing is excessive daytime somnolence as a result of repeated arousals and sleep fragmentation due to sleep hypoventilation and transient nocturnal hypoxemia. Sleep-disordered breathing causing sleep disturbance is well known in patients with poliomyelitis, postpolio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, primary muscle disorders including muscular dystrophies and myotonic dystrophy, congenital or acquired myopathies, neuromuscular junctional disorders and polyneuropathies. All of these conditions may cause weakness of the diaphragm, the intercostal and accessory muscles of respiration causing breathlessness and other respiratory dysrhythmias. As a result of the respiratory and upper airway muscle weakness, the normal sleep-related respiratory physiologic vulnerability becomes pathological in these patients with neuro-muscular disorders causing hypoventilation or central and upper airway obstructive apneas during sleep. Multiple factors are responsible for sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders causing sleep hypoventilation and other respiratory dysrhythmias, and these include: impaired chest bellows, increased work of breathing, hypo-responsive respiratory chemoreceptors, increased upper airway resistance, decreased minute and alveolar ventilation, REM-related marked hypotonia or atonia of the respiratory muscles except the diaphragm, respiratory muscle fatigue and kyphoscoliosis secondary to neuromuscular disorders causing extrapulmonary restriction of the lungs. Nocturnal hypoventilation and chronic respiratory failure in neuromuscular disorders may present insidiously and initially may remain asymptomatic. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed. Clinical clues suggesting sleep-disordered breathing include daytime hypersomnolence, breathlessness, disturbed nocturnal sleep and unexplained leg edema. If the clinical clues strongly suggest sleep-disordered breathing, a physical examination must be directed to uncover bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness. Patients with neuromuscular disorders showing these clinical features must be investigated to uncover nocturnal hypoventilation to prevent serious consequences of chronic.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

The paradox refers to the disparity between the alert EEG pattern, implying that the person is awake or nearly so, and the indications that the person is actually more deeply asleep than at other times (difficulty in arousing, reduced muscle tone). The lack of muscle tone prevents the sleeper from performing the activities reflected in the alert EEG pattern.

The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition.

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

This has potentially serious consequences for the individual, employers, and society as a whole. Apnea refers to short spells when breathing stops. In obstructive sleep apnea, the throat constricts during sleep, preventing breathing; the apnea episode often ends with a loud snore and/or gasp. Such an event is sufficient to open the throat muscles to allow breathing, and the patient usually falls asleep again so quickly that the event is not remembered. This cycle repeats itself throughout the night as the muscles relax and the throat blocks again, and the frequency of the episode is used to determine the severity of the syndrome.",

Movements typical of the wake pattern were seen occasionally during unequivocal sleep in all but two completed studies, and in each condition reappeared under similar circumstances. The movements were most likely to occur after awakenings or lightenings of sleep, or in stage one sleep. The movements were very rare during the deeper phases of sleep. Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves. The control group showed normal \"semipurposeful\" movements under the same conditions during sleep. The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway.",

      "abstract": "Non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) parasomnias are common across the lifespan. This article describes the manifestations, diagnosis, and management of non-REM parasomnias in adults and discusses the social implications of these conditions.Non-REM parasomnias represent a hybrid state of wakefulness and sleep, often triggered by events that increase the frequency of arousals or make it more difficult to fully arouse from sleep. Sleep deprivation, certain medications, and untreated obstructive sleep apnea are known to provoke parasomnias, particularly in those who are genetically predisposed. Non-REM parasomnias include disorders of arousal (ie, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals), sleep-related eating disorder, and exploding head syndrome. Clinical overlap exists between sleep-related eating disorder and disorders of arousal, suggesting that sleep-related eating disorder may be a fourth disorder of arousal or a manifestation of sleepwalking. Exploding head syndrome is a unique parasomnia of uncertain etiology.Non-REM parasomnias can range from minor nuisances to severe, life-altering events. While some patients with non-REM parasomnia experience significant consequences during sleep, wakefulness, or both, non-REM parasomnias do not pose a major risk to most patients. For all patients with non-REM parasomnias, safety should be explicitly discussed and addressed. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be prioritized, as increasing total sleep time, avoiding triggering substances, and treating comorbid sleep disorders is often sufficient for the management of non-REM parasomnias. If symptoms persist despite these interventions, treatment with clonazepam or other medications can be considered.",

      "title": "Excessive Sleepiness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Persons are considered excessively sleepy if they are unable to consistently achieve and sustain wakefulness and alertness to accomplish the tasks of daily living. Sleep occurs unintentionally or at inappropriate times or places. In children, sleepiness may manifest as hyperactivity. Excessive sleepiness can be defined using either clinical or Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) criteria, namely hypersomnolence occurring almost daily for at least 3 months, and mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, respectively. Although the likelihood of falling asleep is greater during inactive monotonous situations, severe sleepiness can manifest precipitously as sleep attacks, recurrent episodes of microsleep, or automatic behavior during which there is no memory of semiconscious activities. It is important to distinguish excessive sleepiness from fatigue, exhaustion, tiredness, weariness, listlessness or weakness, which may closely mimic it. Excessive sleepiness is estimated to affect 5% of the general population. Occasional excessive daytime sleepiness may be present in up to a third of the general adult population. Prevalence is greater among adolescents and older adults. Both genders appear to be affected equally. Among young adults, hours of weekday sleep predict daytime sleepiness, as do snoring, depression, marital status (those who are single are more likely to develop daytime sleepiness than married individuals), and employment status (sleepiness is more prevalent among persons employed full-time compared with those who are employed part-time or unemployed).",

Although nighttime awakenings are common in the second half year and beyond, this is not a developmental necessity; rather, most normal infants gain the capacity to \"sleep through the night\" by 6 months of age. 2. There is not a single cause of (or a single treatment for) nighttime awakenings and crying; many factors may be responsible, and these must be identified and individually treated if there is to be resolution. 3. What are often perceived as abnormal awakenings are really only the normal awakenings associated with normal sleep stage cycling, and, parents' \"treatment\" of these awakenings with interventions, such as rocking or feeding, only make it more difficult for the child to go back to sleep without them after subsequent awakenings. 4. No evaluation of a sleepless child is complete without a thorough understanding of the child's daily schedule. The child's sleep schedule may be consistent and his sleep normal, and only the timing may be shifted from that desired by the parents. The bedtime difficulties or early morning awakenings generated in this setting may be handled inappropriately by the family, creating even more complicated problems. Or, the schedule may be irregular, sleep/wake rhythms may not adjust, and any of a variety of apparent sleep disorders may appear.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be \"things that go bump in the night\", or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders can be broadly classified into: (a) insomnia, (b) parasomnia, (c) sleep disorders associated with psychiatric, neurologic and other medical disorders, and (d) proposed sleep disorders (e.g. pregnancy and menstrual related sleep disorders).1 Insomnia is a common encounter in primary care consultations2 and constitutes the commonest sleep problem3,4 that presents to the general practitioner. Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

      "abstract": "Abstract A common denominator in psychosomatically induced death is stress. Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "abstract": "The unusual aspect of dream consciousness which has been called \"dream bizarreness\" may be defined as impossibility or improbability in the domains of dream plot, cognition and affect. The bizarre features of dreams may be divided into three broad categories: discontinuities, incongruities and uncertainties. Discontinuities are interruptions in orientational stability; incongruities are inappropriate syntheses of mismatching plot elements; uncertainties are confusions of distinct conceptions. Dream bizarreness appears to be the manifestation of some state-dependent cognitive process which is probably rooted in REM sleep neurophysiology. In the waking state, our brain/minds are capable of remaining focused on the normal flow of ongoing information, and such features of life as plot and time unfold in a linear sequence. In REM sleep/dreaming, this function appears to be interfered with, and disparate elements of consciousness are suddenly interjected as the brain/mind cannot maintain its orientational focus in the usual way.",

      "abstract": "Background : Abnormal eye movements can occur in patients with neurological diseases. These have been described in unconscious patients due to anoxic coma and often disappear as the patient regains consciousness. Ocular dipping movements are rarely seen in practice in pediatric patients. Methods : A one year old male patient was brought unconscious with electrocution injury. With resuscitation, he became hemodynamically stable. He could not recognize his mother or respond to visual/auditory stimuli; and had generalized hypertonia. Cranial nerves were normal. He showed abnormal involuntary conjugate vertical saccadic eye movements, consisting of slow downward movement (for 1-2 seconds) followed by a relatively faster return to the primary mid-position. These persisted continuously for 48 hours at irregular intervals of 1-2 seconds. The patient was awake but non-responsive and not interested in surroundings. Results : These eye movements are called ocular dipping (OD) . In a normal person, saccadic movements are meant for stable fixation and are maintained by pause-cell neurons positioned in the pontine raphe. These prevent the occurrence of unwanted saccadic pulses by inhibiting the saccadic premotor burst neurons in the paramedian pontine reticular formation and midbrain. Injury to pause cells leads to extraneous saccades without fixation. It appears that cortical and basal ganglia malfunction causes ocular dipping. OD is mainly seen in anoxic coma and creuztfelt Jacob disease. A 53-year-old man developed ocular dipping following prolonged hypotension.Our patient was in vegetative state with normal respiratory and cardiac function suggesting that major midbrain and medullary centers were intact. Conclusion : The self limiting nature of OD suggests that these are caused by diffuse dysfunction rather than a single structural locus.",

      "title": "Consciousness in Non-REM parasomnia episodes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of Non rapid eye movement (Non-REM) sleep. Non-REM parasomnia behaviors have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream-like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterize the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental disconnection associated with behavioral episodes, 35 adult patients with Non-REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in-depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviors (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterized by delusional thinking of varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni- or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%) and variable, but often pronounced amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (‘awake dreaming’). Surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people) or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness and sensory disconnection in Non-REM parasomnias is variable and graded. In their full-fledged expression, Non-REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep-related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "abstract": "Le sommeil est un état physiologique et comportemental caractérisé par une isolation partielle de l'environnement. Lors du sommeil, un événement perturbateur comme la douleur peut provoquer une réaction de microéveil brève et inconsciente vers un réveil comportemental caractérisé par une réactivation thalamocorticale complète et un niveau plus élevé de conscience. Le sommeil devient alors fragmenté et les plaintes de douleur se trouvent souvent exacerbées. La continuité oscillatoire de 90–110 minutes, rythme ultradien du sommeil léger et profond (non-REM: rapid eye movement) vers le sommeil paradoxal (REM), est alors rompue. Chez un patient souffrant de céphalée, on observe trois périodes durant lesquelles surviennent les crises en relation avec le sommeil: 1) dans les heures avant l'initiation du sommeil, 2) durant et, 3) après le sommeil. La céphalée de tension et la migraine, la céphalée de type hypnique, l'algie vasculaire de la face (cluster headache) et l'hémicrânie paroxystique chronique peuvent survenir en relation avec le sommeil. Soulignons que la céphalée du réveil est parfois associée à du bruxisme (serrement et grincement des dents), à un abus de médications antalgiques, à de l'hypertension, à un trouble de l'humeur ou à des réductions du flux respiratoire lors du sommeil. Les céphalées suite à un traumatisme crânien sont fréquentes et causent de l'insomnie, des réveils subits et prématurés et surtout des matins pénibles avec délai de phase circadienne. Dans le contexte d'une céphalée survenant en relation avec l'insomnie ou la somnolence diurne, la recherche de troubles respiratoires du sommeil, d'intrusions sous forme de mouvements périodiques des membres ou de bruxisme est indiquée. La polygraphie peut être effectuée en laboratoire ou en ambulatoire. La gestion de ces céphalées suit les grands principes de la médecine contemporaine tout en visant une hygiène du sommeil maximale par thérapie cognitive et comportementale, le maintien d'un rythme circadien idéal, la prise de mélatonine, la correction du phénomène respiratoire.

Accurate diagnosis of RBD requires a history of abnormal sleep behaviours and nocturnal video-polysomnographic (VPSG) demonstration of prominent tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity associated with abnormal vocal and motor manifestations in REM sleep. VPSG is required because dream-enacting behaviours resembling those typically seen in RBD may occur in people affected by obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder, visual hallucinations, isolated nightmares, confusional awakenings in demented subjects and more rarely by somnambulism and nocturnal epilepsy. Patients with Parkinson’s disease, particularly when associated with dementia, had non-RBD episodes of sleep-enactment behaviours occurring upon arousals from either REM or non-REM sleep.",

This rapid eye movement (REM)-intrusion phenomenon occurs when the muscle atonia from REM sleep pervades into wakefulness. Patients often experience a conscious awareness of their surroundings, coupled with a sense of suffocation and significant clinical distress, usually lasting for seconds up to several minutes. Though it is often associated with narcolepsy, sleep paralysis can be seen in any condition where there is sleep disruption and is most commonly seen in younger patients who have significant sleep deprivation or insufficient sleep. It is also associated with other common sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, and can be part of the differential diagnosis for numerous other related conditions such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and nocturnal panic attacks. Obtaining a comprehensive sleep history is essential in accurately characterizing episodes, and for determining the underlying etiology. Treatment of sleep paralysis is largely focused on preventing sleep disruption, and with reassurance and education. Pharmacologic therapy with tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be considered in severe and refractory cases.",

Es frecuente que durante el sueño se presenten en los niños episodios desconcertantes para la familia, tanto por la distorsión que producen sobre el descanso nocturno, como por la preocupación por la posible repercusión de esos eventos sobre la salud y el desarrollo. Describiremos algunos de los más frecuentes y revisaremos su manejo clínico. Desarrollo. Hablaremos en primer lugar de algunos trastornos del movimiento relacionados con el sueño y frecuentes en la infancia. El mioclono nocturno benigno del lactante es motivo de consulta habitual en Pediatría. El síndrome de piernas inquietas, relacionado a menudo con los movimientos periódicos de piernas en el sueño, se asocian con frecuencia a ferropenia. Los movimientos rítmicos del sueño, que se realizan en la conciliación, no suelen requerir ningún tipo de intervención aunqueresultan muy llamativos para las familias. En el apartado dedicado a las parasomnias, diferenciamos las que tienen lugar en el sueño No REM (Rapid eye movements), como el sonambulismo, los terrores y los despertares confusionales, de las que tiene lugar en el sueño REM.

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human consciousness, the awareness of oneself and one’s environment, is an artificial construction. In a normal state of consciousness, the brain seamlessly integrates sensory perceptions, emotional states, current thoughts, and past memories. The essential feature of the various dissociative disorders is that these elements have become disrupted, dissociated, from each other. The distinctions between the different types of dissociative disorders are based on which particular aspect of subjective experience has become dissociated from the others. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by dissociation of memory. The affected individual demonstrates an inability to recall important biographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. The memory deficit is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forget-fulness. Dissociative fugue is characterized by an even greater dissociation of memory, such that the individual dissociates not only key historical information but also his own sense of identity. Affected individuals may engage in sudden, unexpected travel away from their homes or customary places of work, accompanied by an inability to recall their past, confusion about their personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity.",

      "title": "Consciousness in non‐<scp>REM</scp>‐parasomnia episodes",
      "abstract": "Summary Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of non‐rapid eye movement (non‐REM) sleep. Non‐REM parasomnia behaviours have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream‐like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterise the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental (dis)connection associated with behavioural episodes, 35 adult patients with non‐REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in‐depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviours (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterised by delusional thinking to varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni‐ or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%), and variable, but often pronounced, amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (“awake dreaming”). The surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people), or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness, amnesia and sensory disconnection during non‐REM parasomnia episodes is variable and graded. In their full‐fledged expression, non‐REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep‐related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "abstract": "Should emergency surgery be performed in the case of a unilateral congenital cataract in order to preserve the functional future of the anatomically intact eye? The answer may be found in congenital “Monophtalme” syndrome which appears during the first months of life with severe unilateral congenital organic amblyopia. The vision of the “sound” eye does not develop normally because there is no symmetrical binocular stimuli during these first few months of life. The fixation thus remains immature with an attraction of the fixation-pursuit system towards adduction. The clinical complications that result are: (a) a preference towards adduction which induces a torticollis; (b) a manifest/latent nystagmus (Drift/Adduction) of variable intensity with impaired vision in the Primary Position (PP). The more severe the organic defect, the more pronounced the visual functional defect of the viewing eye. Very early cataract extraction seems to attenuate the symptoms, probably because it allows more symmetrical (light?) retinal stimuli during the development of monocular fixation.",

      "abstract": "Transient recurrent confusional and stuporous states of nonepileptic origin are clearly less frequent than epileptic ones. They are relatively common in diseases of disturbed vigilance, like narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnolence, and sleep apnea. These patients often suffer from attacks of hypovigilance, characterized by altered awareness, automatic behaviour and partial or complete amnesia for the attack. Because of the memory 'black outs' and the frequently associated hypnagogic hallucinations, the patients behave inappropriately and often appear confused. Confusional states also typically arise during basilar artery migraine attacks. This special form of complicated migraine predominantly affects young females and is characterized by symptoms and signs of brain stem dysfunction such as vertigo, ataxia, paresthesia, limb weakness, dysarthria; in 75% of the cases, disorders of consciousness dominate. Transient ischemic attacks are sometimes recurrent and, when involving the cranial basilar territory, may result in confusional states without significant motor dysfunction. Attacks of transient global amnesia are possibly also ischemic in nature and are assumed to arise from transient bilateral limbic failure. Affecting only memory functions, they are strictly spoken not confusional, but must nevertheless be taken into consideration when proper observation during the attack was not possible.",

Asphyxia, including transient birth depression, may cause either episodic or prolonged apnea. Malformations of the brain or less likely, the spinal cord, should be considered in an otherwise healthy infant who presents with apnea at birth. Infections (bacteremia possibly accompanied by meningitis) may cause unstable breathing patterns and should prompt the appropriate evaluation and possibly antibiotic therapy. In the older infant, the onset of a viral illness such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection sometimes is heralded by apnea, although the precise mechanism whereby RSV presents with apnea is unclear. Anemia, another frequent problem in preterm infants, whether iatrogenic or due to bleeding, is a potential precipitating factor. Blood transfusions have been demonstrated to improve irregular breathing patterns in preterm infants, although the risk of blood transfusion has limited its use as treatment for apnea. It has been assumed, although unproven, that enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity, as with red blood cell transfusion, may decrease the likelihood of hypoxia-induced respiratory depression.

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

      "title": "Health Effects of Sleep Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Electrical lighting and increasing capital intensiveness have helped undermine the importance that society previously placed on obtaining adequate sleep. Even modest amounts of daily sleep loss accumulate as “sleep debt.” Sleep debt manifests in a myriad of ways, the most common being an increasing tendency to fall asleep, increased risk of accidental injury, impaired mood, and reduced psychomotor performance. Sleep debt can have far reaching consequences, both to an individual in terms of increased cardiovascular risk and to society at large, because of sleepiness-related fatigue and errors. Sleep specialists need to further their understanding of the physiologic and behavioral consequences of total, partial, and selective sleep stage deprivation, because they affect many organ systems. Studies of selective sleep stage deprivation also provide insights into the function of sleep. Evaluating the effects of sleep deprivation must take into account the following factors: (1) the duration of prior sleep, (2) circadian time frame, (3) arousal influences, and (4) subject and test characteristics. Sleep deprivation has been extensively studied in the acute experimental setting. Under extreme conditions, sleep deprivation is associated with mortality in laboratory animals. In the natural human environment, the behavioral consequence of chronic sleep debt in shift work intolerance is well described. The link between electrophysiological sleep disturbance and pathogenesis of disease is less well understood in both acute and chronic states. Additional investigation into the relationship between sleep deprivation and disease mechanisms, such as impaired glucose tolerance, hormonal dysregulation, and cytokine imbalance, will enhance our comprehension of this link.",

Hemicrania was later changed to Latin words - hemigranea and migranea;\neventually the French cognate, migraine, gained acceptance in the eighteenth century and has\nprevailed ever since. A working definition of migraine is benign recurring headache and/or\nneurological dysfunction usually attended by pain-free interludes and often provoked by\nstereotyped stimuli (1). Migraine may be triggered by certain factors (red wine, menses, hunger,\nlack of sleep, glare, perfumes, periods of let down) and relieved by others (sleep, pregnancy).\nPremonitory symptoms occur hours to a day or two before a migraine attack with or without\naura. Migraine is more common in females, with a hereditary predisposition towards attacks and\nthe cranial circulatory phenomenon appears to be secondary to a primary central nervous system\n(CNS) disorder.\nThe Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS)\npublished the classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders in 1988 (Table 1.1) (2).\nThe terms “common migraine” and “classical migraine” have been replaced by “migraine\nwithout aura” and “migraine with aura”, respectively. These operational criteria have been\nvalidated by different approaches and have enabled us to distinguish different headache entities\nin a reliable manner (3-6). In recent years, the IHS criteria have been used world-wide in several\nmulticentre double-blind drug trials, which have shown a reasonably consistent response rate to\ntriptans (7), reflecting a consensus in the defined migraine group. In a recent MAZE survey, the\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire has been used to assess the impact\nof migraine on work, home and social lives. MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of\nmigraine; >50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe\ndisability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently\neffective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy (8).

      "title": "Sleep-related painful erections: pitfall on the interface between neurology and psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related painful erections (SRPE) are characterized by penile pain occurring during nocturnal erections, without apparent penile pathology. Sleep loss caused by the disorder may result in severe anxiety, mood disorders, irritability, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Until now, the phenomenon of SRPE has not been well understood. The rarity of the published cases probably does not reflect the actual prevalence, which is presumably over 1 percent. Because of the bizarre nature of the complaints, patients are often referred to a psychiatrist. The authors present the case of a 69-year-old patient, who, during frequent nocturnal awakenings, experienced hard-to-define burning, tingling sensations in symmetric hypogastric localisation. Sometimes the skin of both legs, and, occasionally, the arms and hands was involved, too. Initially, however, no definite erection-associated penile pain was present. Micturating quite a small amount just after awakening consistently resulted in immediate and complete relief. After two years, painful nocturnal erections reoccurring at stable intervals of 90–120 minutes during sleep developed to be the leading complaint. In default of urological or gastroenterological pathology, the patient has been referred to a psychiatrist. Quite futilely, mianserin and alprazolam, later sertralin and carbamazepine, respectively, were administered. Clozapine has also been tried out; however, it has to be rejected due to some adverse effects. Finally, 10 mg baclofen in the evening resulted in complete and permanent remission. This is consonant with the literature data stating that only clonazepam, baclofen and clozapine are likely to have long term beneficial effects in SRPE.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together.

      "abstract": "Possible interactions between the sleep-wakefulness cycle and a new kind of spontaneous epilepsy, expressed as absence-like seizures and spike-wave bursts in FMUSP rats, are evaluated. The electro-oscillograms of some cortical and subcortical regions of the brain were recorded, as well as head, rostrum/vibrissae and eye movements. Recordings were performed uninterruptedly during 24 hours. The seizures were mostly concentrated in the wakefulness state but they could occur in any other phase, including paradoxical sleep. After the seizure, the rats usually returned to the same phase that was interrupted, although they often returned to wakefulness. There was an intense fragmentation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. The incidence of each cycle phase was significantly reduced, except SIII of synchronized sleep and paradoxical sleep, thus maintaining the overall duration and architecture of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. The fragmentation of the cycle seems to be due to an impairment of the very processes that generate sleep and wakefulness. Electrophysiological and behavioral profiles of the FMUSP rats recommend accurate and comprehensive study of the animal model owing to its resemblance to seizures in humans and also to discrepancies with existing genetic or experimental epilepsy models.",

Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

Psychogenic non-epileptic attacks present for the first time most frequently in teenage or young adult females, but there is increasing recognition that they also present in elderly patients.

Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "title": "Chronic insomnia, <scp>REM</scp> sleep instability and emotional dysregulation: A pathway to anxiety and depression?",
      "abstract": "Summary The world‐wide prevalence of insomnia disorder reaches up to 10% of the adult population. Women are more often afflicted than men, and insomnia disorder is a risk factor for somatic and mental illness, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Persistent hyperarousals at the cognitive, emotional, cortical and/or physiological levels are central to most theories regarding the pathophysiology of insomnia. Of the defining features of insomnia disorder, the discrepancy between minor objective polysomnographic alterations of sleep continuity and substantive subjective impairment in insomnia disorder remains enigmatic. Microstructural alterations, especially in rapid eye movement sleep (“rapid eye movement sleep instability”), might explain this mismatch between subjective and objective findings. As rapid eye movement sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep, it might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. In consequence, mentation during rapid eye movement sleep may be toned more as conscious‐like wake experience, reflecting pre‐sleep concerns. It is suggested that this instability of rapid eye movement sleep is involved in the mismatch between subjective and objective measures of sleep in insomnia disorder. Furthermore, as rapid eye movement sleep has been linked in previous works to emotional processing, rapid eye movement sleep instability could play a central role in the close association between insomnia and depressive and anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are two distinct types of sleep—non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—a balance of which is needed to function well during the day. During the night, these two types of sleep alternate with each other. Probably everyone dreams but the purpose of dreaming is generally unclear. The pattern of wakefulness and sleep is controlled by an internal clock in the brain (the body clock). Your level of alertness varies within each 24 hours. The tendency to sleep is greatest in the early hours of the morning (corresponding to deep NREM sleep) and (although less so) in the early afternoon. People vary in the time of day when they are most alert: ‘larks’ in the morning and ‘owls’ in the evening. Most people show neither of these patterns. Daytime naps can make it difficult to get to sleep at bedtime if they are too long or too late in the day. Long naps can make you feel groggy afterwards. Sleep has some features in common with other states of relative inactivity, such as coma or, in some species, hibernation. All of these states usually occur while lying down with little movement and reduced awareness of the environment to varying degrees. However, sleep is very different from the rest.",

      "title": "Diagnostic Tools for Insomnia",
      "abstract": "In a general sense, insomnia suggests inadequate sleep quality or quantity when one has an adequate opportunity to sleep. When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society. This chapter will provide an overview of current perspectives on the causes, consequences, and associations of insomnia.ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND PATHOGENESIS",

      "title": "[Dangerous snoring. Sleep-apnea syndrome].",
      "abstract": "Snoring usually is trivial and unimportant, but it can turn into a social or medical problem. Obesity, hypertension and heart disease are more frequent among snorers than among nonsnorers, and especially snorers with hypersomnia during the day are at risk. Hypersomnia in association with snoring usually signifies obstructive sleep apnea. Increased resistance in the upper airways, together with negative inspiratory pharyngeal pressure and muscular hypotonia during deep non-REM and REM sleep, lead to collapse of the pharynx, hypoxia and hypercapnia. Only after arousal from sleep does muscle tone return, pharyngeal obstruction reopen and airflow resume. Since this process can occur 300 or 400 times a night, repetitive alveolar hypoventilation leads to pulmonary-arterial hypertension and cor pulmonale, and the repetitive sympathetic activations can cause systemic hypertension or serious cardiac arrhythmias. The countless arousals deprive the sufferer of deep non-REM and REM sleep and their consequence is sleep fragmentation. The symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, intellectual deterioration and personality and behavioral changes. Oronasomaxillofacial, endocrine and neuromuscular anomalies and diseases predispose to sleep apnea, and alcohol or CNS-depressant drugs can favour its occurrence. Diagnosis is made by nighttime oxymetry, and if this is abnormal, by polysomnography. After polysomnography it is possible to distinguish between obstructive and nonobstructive sleep apnea, and the decisions for an adequate treatment can be made.",

      "title": "Sleep and circadian difficulties in schizophrenia: presentations, understanding, and treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is common in mental health care to ask about people’s days but comparatively rare to ask about their nights. Most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia struggle at nighttime. The next-day effects can include a worsening of psychotic experiences, affective disturbances, and inactivity, which in turn affect the next night’s sleep. Objective and subjective cognitive abilities may be affected too. Patients commonly experience a mix of sleep difficulties in a night and across a week. These difficulties include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping at all; nightmares and other awakenings; poor-quality sleep; oversleeping; tiredness; sleeping at the wrong times; and problems establishing a regular sleep pattern. The patient group is also more vulnerable to obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. We describe in this article how the complex presentation of non-respiratory sleep difficulties arises from variation across five factors: timing, mental state, need for sleep, self-care, and environment. We set out 10 illustrative patterns of such difficulties experienced by patients with non-affective psychosis. These sleep problems are eminently treatable with intensive psychological therapy delivered over approximately eight sessions. We describe key techniques and their typical order of implementation by presentation. Sleep problems are an important issue for patients. Giving them the therapeutic attention patients often desire brings both real clinical benefits and improves views of services. Treatment is also very likely to lessen psychotic experiences and mood disturbances while improving daytime functioning and quality of life. Tackling sleep difficulties can be a route toward the successful treatment of psychosis.",

Parasomnias are classified according to the type of sleep in which they occur, namely non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep parasomnias (1). The first includes disorders of arousals, namely confusional arousals (and their recently identified variants of sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviors), sleep terrors, and sleepwalking. REM sleep parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorders. Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

Gastroesophageal reflux usually presents as recurrent vomiting in infants and young children. A small subgroup of infants develop apnea and cyanosis accompanied by posturing of the limbs, deviation of the eyes, or opisthotonos, which leads to the incorrect diagnosis of epilepsy. Breathholding spells and pallid infantile syncope, common in infants and young children, may also be mistaken for epileptic attacks. The parasomnias, including pavor nocturnus and somnambulism, are frequently mistaken for epilepsy, since these nocturnal episodes are paroxysmal in nature, may be associated with automatic behavioral mannerisms, and tend to be recurrent. Migraine is especially difficult to differentiate from epilepsy because its manifestations, particularly in children, are so diverse. Other disorders that may superficially mimic epilepsy include transient ischemic attacks, syncope, and transient global amnesia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hyperekplexia (startle disease) is a rare non-epileptic disorder characterised by an exaggerated persistent startle reaction to unexpected auditory, somatosensory and visual stimuli, generalised muscular rigidity, and nocturnal myoclonus. The genetic basis is a mutation usually of the arginine residue 271 leading to neuronal hyperexcitability by impairing glycinergic inhibition. Hyperekplexia is usually familial, most often autosomal dominant with complete penetrance and variable expression. It can present in fetal life as abnormal intrauterine movements, or later at any time from the neonatal period to adulthood. Early manifestations include abnormal responses to unexpected auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli such as sustained tonic spasm, exaggerated startle response, and fetal posture with clenched fists and anxious stare. The tonic spasms may mimic generalised tonic seizures, leading to apnoea and death. Consistent generalised flexor spasm in response to tapping of the nasal bridge (without habituation) is the clinical hallmark of hyperekplexia. Electroencephalography may show fast spikes initially during the tonic spasms, followed by slowing of background activity with eventual flattening corresponding to the phase of apnoea bradycardia and cyanosis. Electromyography shows a characteristic almost permanent muscular activity with periods of electrical quietness. Nerve conduction velocity is normal. No specific computed tomography findings have been reported yet. Clonazepam, a gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist, is the treatment of choice for hypertonia and apnoeic episodes. It, however, may not influence the degree of stiffness significantly. A simple manoeuvre like forced flexion of the head and legs towards the trunk is known to be life saving when prolonged stiffness impedes respiration.",

      "title": "Jet Lag, Sleep Timing, and Sleep Inertia",
      "abstract": "This chapter explores the causes, consequences, and countermeasures of jet lag, mistimed sleep, and sleep inertia. Jet lag can occur when rapidly crossing multiple time zones (e.g., trans-meridian travel for long-haul pilots). The desynchrony between the body's biological clock, or circadian rhythm, and the new day-night cycle can lead to indigestion, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive impairments. Mistimed sleep can also occur within a time zone. In the case of night shiftwork, sleep is displaced to the daytime which leads to poor sleep and increased fatigue at night due to the combination of pressures from the two-process model of sleep regulation: sleep loss (homeostatic pressure) and being awake when the body is promoting sleep (circadian pressure). There is also a third process of sleep regulation called sleep inertia, which refers to the brief period of fatigue and impaired cognitive performance experienced after waking. Sleep inertia can be a fatigue risk for transportation workers who work on-call (e.g., emergency services) or who nap on shift (e.g., long-haul truck drivers) and are required to perform a safety-critical task soon after waking. For each of these fatigue risks, strategic exposure to bright light can be used to help realign sleep timing and to promote alertness.",

      "title": "Convulsiones y epilepsia—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Las convulsiones son causadas por un ataque de actividad excesiva en el cerebro. Un niño que tiene una convulsión puede perder el conocimiento (desmayarse) durante un período breve, temblar violentamente con todo su cuerpo, tener movimientos corporales reiterados y poco comunes, sufrir crisis atónicas (episodios de caída), tener convulsiones mientras duerme o tener la mirada perdida.La epilepsia se define como 2 o más convulsiones en las que el niño no tiene fiebre ni ningún otro motivo médico para sufrir una convulsión.Alrededor de 1 de cada 4 niños con trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene convulsiones. Las convulsiones suelen comenzar en la primera infancia o en los primeros años de la adolescencia. Los niños con TEA que tienen un coeficiente intelectual más bajo o que no pueden hablar son los que corren mayor riesgo de tener convulsiones.Con frecuencia los niños con TEA tienen movimientos reiterativos y episodios en los que se quedan mirando el vacío. A menudo un médico puede detectar qué comportamientos reiterativos podrían ser convulsiones. Una prueba llamada electroencefalograma (EEG) puede registrar la actividad eléctrica del cerebro y ayudar a un médico a verificar la presencia de convulsiones. El electroencefalograma puede registrar la ocurrencia de una convulsión solo cuando el equipo de EEG está conectado al niño. No es posible detectar con un EEG las convulsiones que ocurran en otros momentos. A veces es necesario hacer un EEG durante un tiempo prolongado para ver si los movimientos o desmayos son convulsiones.La mayoría de los niños con TEA no necesitan un EEG. Es probable que el médico solicite un EEG si un niño tiene desmayos que el médico crea que son convulsiones o si el niño perdió recientemente destrezas de habla o de otro tipo. El electroencefalograma se hace generalmente cuando el niño está despierto y luego dormido. Hay distintos tipos de EEG; algunos se completan durante una visita más corta al hospital y otros se realizan durante toda la noche en el hospital o en el hogar. El médico decidirá qué tipo de EEG es adecuado para cada niño.En la mayoría de los casos, los medicamentos llamados anticonvulsivos pueden ayudar a controlar las convulsiones. Por lo general estos medicamentos reducen la cantidad de convulsiones, pero no siempre pueden eliminarlas. Algunos niños obtienen resultados anormales en sus EEG, pero no tienen convulsiones evidentes. Aún no está claro si los anticonvulsivos pueden ser útiles en esas situaciones.Uno de 2 tipos específicos de aceite de cannabidiol (conocido como aceite CBD) está actualmente aprobado por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (US Food and Drug Administration) para el tratamiento de convulsiones en niños con 2 tipos de epilepsia grave (los síndromes de Lennox-Gastaut y de Dravet). El aceite de cannabidiol no está aprobado para el manejo del TEA en niños que no padezcan las afecciones específicas que se mencionaron anteriormente.Para obtener más información sobre las convulsiones, comuníquese con la Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsyfoundation.org).La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

      "title": "Sleep Disorders and Headache",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, difficulty with falling or staying asleep, is the most common sleep complaint among patients with frequent headaches. Insomnia can be related to conditions common among headache patients, such as depression, anxiety, lack of exercise, and medications that make good sleep harder to achieve. Patients with chronic migraine, which includes headache 15 or more days per month, report having almost twice the rates of insomnia as those with less frequent headaches. Rates of sleepiness in the daytime and snoring are also more frequent in those with frequent headaches. Patients with chronic headaches are more likely to be depressed or anxious, which can further worsen sleep problems. Separating out all these issues is sometimes necessary, but also addressing all of the problems without just focusing on only one area is more likely to result in success. Clues to there being a primary sleep disorder in addition to a headache disorder include snoring, gasping during the night, falling asleep during the day, and not feeling rested upon awakening. The overwhelming need to move one's legs when trying to sleep can further disrupt sleep, and is frequently associated with restless legs syndrome. Before a doctor visit to address a possible sleep disorder, it is useful to have a sleep diary in hand. Write down the activities in the hour before bed, the time it takes to get to sleep, the number of awakenings, the total sleep time, and the impression of being rested or tired the next day for each day of the week. Include evening meal times, exercise, and activity in the 4 hours prior to falling asleep. Caffeine intake, energy drinks, weight loss supplements, and any migraine medications, especially those containing caffeine, need to be recorded. Bringing this diary to the office visit can sometimes lead to effective changes that do not involve taking another medicine, and targeted changes can enhance well-being and function throughout the day. Many find that if they can improve sleep time and quality of sleep, headaches do improve. If the sleep log seems to suggest possible sleep apnea, restless legs, or another sleep disorder that requires monitoring for a definitive diagnosis, a formal sleep evaluation will be recommended. While sleeping, the patient is monitored for irregular breathing, temporary obstruction of the airway while relaxed, levels of oxygen, or involuntary movement of the arms or legs while sleeping. Based on these findings, behavioral changes, airway devices, or medicines may be recommended. Many times, consistent behavioral changes are needed for those with headaches and sleep problems. Those with chronic headache tend to cut back on physical activity because exercise temporarily seems to worsen headaches. People with frequent headaches often spend more time resting, lying down, or sitting. This in turn results in being less tired at night. Naps during the day are common. Lack of activity and exercise can worsen depression and anxiety, further adding to difficultly falling and staying asleep. Engaging in restful and non-stress producing activities before going to sleep can set the stage for a better night's sleep. Computer activities, mobile phone devices, and stress-producing work should be avoided in the hour before sleep. The aim is to set aside enough time for 7-8 hours of sleep. This is better achieved by going to bed within an hour of the same time every night, and getting up at similar times. A not uncommon migraine problem is sleeping in on weekends after a long week of not getting quite enough sleep. Catching up on sleep often leads to a wake-up weekend headache, which is frustrating, as this is the time people want to be with their families, run errands, and have fun. This headache coming on after stress has decreased is called let-down headache, and it is unfortunately common. Also common is wake-up headache. The most common time for migraine to occur is in the early morning, and many times people will sleep through the time when a headache is beginning to emerge. By missing the best time to take migraine medicines, which is early in the headache, the medicines are less likely to be effective. Individuals who take their pain and headache medications too frequently, that is, have medication overuse headache, can experience their medications wearing off during the night, triggering a headache. Most over-the-counter and narcotic pain medications wear off in 4-8 hours, making people most vulnerable during the early morning, particularly if overusing these medications. There are unusual headache disorders closely timed to sleep hours. For instance, cluster headache is often called the alarm clock headache, as it will wake a sufferer at a similar time every night with excruciating pain. There may be a link between cluster headache and sleep apnea, with the drop of oxygen while sleeping possibly triggering an attack. Another headache disorder linked to sleep, typically occurring a few hours after falling asleep, is hypnic headache, mostly affecting the elderly. This is sometimes treated with a dose of caffeine before bed, which is sort of a paradox. For most people, frequent intake of caffeine leads to a worsening of a sleep disorder. The caffeine wears off during the night, resulting in a caffeine withdrawal headache. If caffeine is taken too close to bedtime, it can worsen insomnia with trouble falling asleep and restless awakenings. Many over-the-counter migraine medications, as well as butalbital combination tablets, contain caffeine, leading to rebound headaches, withdrawal headaches, and insomnia. If behavioral changes are insufficient, medications can be helpful. It is best to go with a medication that is not habit forming, and will not have side effects the next day. The sleep-inducing effect of some medications wears off over time, so these would not be best for long-term use (Table). In summary, headaches and sleep disorders can be closely linked. Examine your activities as you prepare for sleep, exercise habits, intake of caffeine, and other stimulants. Keep a log of your sleep patterns and your headaches, and bring it in to discuss with your provider. Note whether you snore or gasp at night. Behavioral changes are safe and can lead to better health. Medications, carefully chosen, can improve sleep if behavioral changes are not fully effective.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in pregnancy: Why and how should we manage them?",
      "abstract": "Maternal sleep quality worsens during pregnancy, already from the first trimester on and especially in the third trimester.1, 2 Nevertheless, the sleep quality is often ignored by both physicians as well as by women themselves as sleep quality is generally assumed to improve after delivery. However, sleep disturbances may continue during postpartum period or even become chronic. The most important sleep disturbances during pregnancy are primary insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS).2, 3 Sleep disturbances typically cause sleep fragmentation and deterioration of sleep architecture leading to sleep loss and daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties and increase risk for accidents.2, 3 The algorithm of the diagnose and treatments of the most important sleep disturbances in pregnancy is illustrated in Figure 1. Primary insomnia includes both initiation insomnia, which shows as difficulties to fall asleep, and maintenance insomnia, which includes nightly awakenings and too early morning awakenings (being unable to fall asleep again). The etiology of primary insomnia during pregnancy is multifactorial, and might be associated with physical (hyperemesis, nocturia, joint and back pain, heartburn, nasal congestion, thermoregulatory problems, contractions, fetal movements, uncomfortable or unusual sleeping positions, dreams and nightmares) and mental (especially depression and anxiety) causes. Poor sleep quality has shown to be associated with the increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, prolonged labor and increased risk of cesarean section.2, 3 Constant snoring is a typical feature of SDB, which includes sleep apnea and partial upper airway obstruction. In pregnant women, SDB is often caused by partial upper airway obstruction rather than of episodes of frank obstructive apnea.2 Gestational weight gain and estrogen-induced hyperemia, mucosal edema and mucus hypersecretion lead to the narrowing of upper airways exacerbating the risk for SDB. However, progesterone-induced stimulation of breathing, sleeping in lateral position, and decrease in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (during which breathing is more unstable) may protect against SDB. Furthermore, micrognatia and loose throat and larynx are important risk factors for SDB. In addition to snoring, other typical symptoms are headache and dry month in the morning and daytime sleepiness (most typically irresistible falling asleep when inactive). SDB has shown to be in association with increased risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, cesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.2, 4 RLS is a nocturnal neurosensory movement disorder, which is connected with dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the etiology is still unclear, RLS may be idiopathic, genetic, or linked to various disorders, especially iron deficiency. RLS is characterized by unpleasant irritation, creeping, crawling, burning, pins-and-needles or itching sensations, most commonly in the legs. The sensations occur at rest and worsen towards the evening and night. Also smoking, use of caffeine, some medications or alcohol may initiate or exacerbate the symptoms. Transient RLS in previous pregnancies is associated with an elevated risk of new transient symptoms in future pregnancies, as well as with an increased risk for future development of chronic idiopathic RLS.2, 5 An association between RLS and hypertensive pregnancy disorders has been shown.2 Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are known risk factors for anxiety/depression both during pregnancy and postpartum period.1, 2, 6 Sleep disturbances often herald mood disturbances, and pregnant and postpartum women with mood symptoms typically suffer from sleep disturbances, especially from primary insomnia which may increase recurrence of a preexisting mental illness.6 Detection of the origin of the symptoms is the crucial first step in the management of maternal sleep disturbances. For the diagnosis of primary insomnia, questionnaires are feasible and sufficiently adequate tools in clinical practice. Because of the mismatch between subjective symptoms and objectively measured sleep quality, polysomnography, which measures sleep stages, is rarely needed.2 Of note is, that the patient may express having \"worse sleep quality\" or \"insomnia symptoms\", which may not stem from primary insomnia, but are secondary for instance for SDB (maintenance insomnia), RLS (initiation insomnia) or mental symptoms (initiation and maintenance insomnia). If SDB is suspected, ambulatory sleep polygraphy, which measures breathing and blood oxygen level is nessessary.2 In RLS, type and occurrence time of the symptoms and relief of the symptoms by movement, such as walking or stretching the limbs, are diagnostic. As iron deficiency may induce RLS, measurement of serum hemoglobin and ferritin (+C-reactive protein) is essential.5 To detect mental problems, especially depression and anxiety, structural questionnaires can be used.2 Good sleep hygiene is the basis of the treatment of all sleep disturbances. It includes convenient temperature in bedroom, reduced late fluid intake to prevent nocturia, suitable diet in case of gastro-esophageal reflux, massage in case of muscular pain and use of comfortable mattress and pillows. For primary insomnia non-pharmacologic treatments, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, is recommended and effective. It can be carried out as individual or group therapy. Additionally, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise are safe and effective. In case of severe or persistent insomnia, a short-term use of sedatives (including sedative antihistamines), sleeping pills (especially benzodiazepine–like drugs) or low dose antidepressants (with sedative properties) can be prescribed after risks and benefits consideration. However, all these drugs pass the placenta and although no teratogenic effects has been shown, they may be harmful for fetus and new-born. A long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills should not be offered, since they often leads to noxious effects, like deterioration of sleep architecture and dependence on medication. Melatonin or herbal preparations, like valerian, are not recommended for treatment of insomnia during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of safety and efficacy data. In cases of insomnia due to aggravating of mood symptoms, antidepressants, especially serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be warranted.2 The gold standard treatment for SDB is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and it is shown to be safe and effective also during pregnancy. After the diagnosis of SDB, CPAP treatment should be initiated without a delay. Positional treatment, especially lateral sleep posture, is recommendable. In general rule, surgical procedures should not be performed during pregnancy for the treatment of SDB. Local nasal congestive and corticosteroid treatments reduce nasal mucosal edema and thus improve nasal ventilation. In addition, treating respiratory infections effectively and gastro-esophageal reflux with tilted position of the upper body while in bed or proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are also important.2 For the treatment of RLS, per oral iron supplementation (accompanied with C-vitamin for better iron absorption; serum ferritin level <75 μg/L) is recommended. However, in severe RLS (and with serum ferritin level <30 μg/L), oral iron is often insufficient or has a too slow effect and thus intravenous iron, safe also during pregnancy, may be needed. In addition, folate supplementation is favorable for RLS and it is also advisable during the periconception and early pregnancy period for fetal development. In addition, the use of magnesium may be beneficial, although the efficacy data is insufficient. Furthermore, relaxation procedures, walking, stretching, massage, use of compression stockings while sleeping or a warm bath before going to bed may also relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, pramipexole, levodopamin/carbidopamin, opioids, bensodiazepins or gabapentin beyond the first trimester may be needed under a consultation of a neurologist, with the lowest efficient dose, although all these medications may induce risks and side-effects for fetus and new-born.2, 5 Although sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, the sleep quality is not systematically assessed during pregnancy follow-ups. Furthermore, the research evaluating the reasons and consequences of maternal sleep disturbances and the safety and efficacy of the treatments are scant. Good sleep quality is, nevertheless, essential for good quality of life and good health state and thus additional research in the field is indispensable.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug.

      "title": "GELASTIC PRESYNCOPE: AN UNUSUAL MANIFESTATION IN AN ELDERLY PATIENT",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Laughter (gelastic) resulting in presyncope or syncope is a recognized, although rarely reported, cause of situational syncope. Characterized by an index event, laughter-induced presyncope or syncope persists and is amenable to behavioral modification. A case of recurrent presyncope precipitated by laughter in an elderly man and corrected using behavioral modification is presented. A 67-year-old man was seen in consultation for the complaint of near blackout spells with laughter. The first episode occurred while listening to a radio program while driving, when his laughing heavily resulted in blurring vision, darkening of visual field, feeling faint, and sensation of imminent loss of consciousness. He slowed his vehicle and pulled off the road, and the symptoms soon resolved. He denied complete loss of consciousness, uncontrolled movement of limbs, bowel or bladder incontinence, headache, or other associated symptoms. Since this index episode, patient reports recurrent episodes of near loss of consciousness associated with vigorous laughing. Episodes last only a few seconds. He had similar symptoms, but of lesser severity, in relation to straining during defecation and micturition. The patient denied any palpitations, irregular heartbeat, chronic cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, other systemic or constitutional symptoms, having had stroke in the past, any history of seizures, or any sleep disturbances, including any symptoms suggestive of narcolepsy or cataplexy. His medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prolonged posttraumatic disorder, which were stable. The patient was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging and a magnetic resonance angiogram of the brain, which showed only mild periventricular white matter changes that were nonspecific. Carotid Doppler studies were unremarkable. Chest X-rays were normal. No further diagnostic investigation was pursued because behavioral modification of avoiding vigorous prolonged laughter resolved his symptoms completely. Gelastic presyncope or syncope is a relatively uncommon type of neurally mediated event with a drop in systemic vascular resistance due to arterial dilation in the setting of a relative or absolute bradycardia. During prolonged laughter, there is repetitive Valsalva effect with reduced venous return secondary to increased intrathoracic pressure with associated systemic arterial dilatation and bradycardia resulting in reduced cardiac output and cerebral hypoperfusion. If the Valsalva effort is not aborted during the presyncopal phase, it is likely that it will culminate in a syncopal episode. This mechanism is similar to that seen with cough syncope. In addition, emotional factors and cerebral vasoconstriction secondary to systemic hypocapnia could be contributing to the syncope in this situation.1 This patient also had presyncopal sensations to straining from defecation and urination, suggesting Valsalva effect as the most likely mechanism. Laughter or gelastic syncope can potentially be misdiagnosed as cataplexy related to laughter. There have been only a few case reports of laughter syncope previously reported, mostly in the elderly population, in healthy adults and people predisposed to dysautonomia.1–4 Possible contribution of dysautonomic neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus can not be excluded in the current patient. A more-serious underlying mechanism of severe vascular disease involving the brachiocephalic trunk was noted to be the mechanism in the first reported case of laughter syncope.3 Syncope resolved after percutaneous angioplasty. Falls in elderly people can lead to devastating consequences, and hence it is essential to diagnose and prevent syncope in this age group. Beta-blockers and midodrine were noted to have beneficial effects in controlling symptoms in one described case of neurally mediated syncope.4 Behavioral modification may be the best initial approach before exposing the patients to medications.

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be “things that go bump in the night”, or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities.

      "abstract": "Insomnia symptoms are the most common medical complaints, affecting up to a third of the general population. Insomnia symptoms include sleep problems (initiating or maintaining sleep) as well their repercussions on wake-time functioning. Insomnia Disorder can be diagnosed when insomnia symptoms are recurrent (>3 times a week), persistent (> 3 months), cannot be attributed to sleep-disrupting circumstances, and impair daytime functioning. Insomnia Disorder affects approximately 10% of the population and tends to persist over months or years. Insomnia Disorder severely reduces the quality of life and carries an increased risk of severe, long-lasting health problems, including cardiovascular and mood disorders. Given its high prevalence, persistence and impact on health, it is highly important to study the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder during wakefulness and sleep. Overall, the study of the endogenous EEG dynamics in Insomnia Disorder revealed that hyperarousal of the central nervous system occurs not only during sleep but also during wakefulness. During wakefulness, Insomnia Disorder is characterized by stronger cortical oscillations in a broad beta band and by increased cortical sensitivity to cardiac activity. Furthermore, people with more severe insomnia complaints show stronger Long-Range Temporal Correlations of the amplitude fluctuations of cortical oscillations; which is consistent with a weaker inhibitory bias in the cortical balance between excitation and inhibition. During sleep, the shallow and more fragmented sleep that characterizes Insomnia Disorder may particularly involve N2 instability. Resolving the causal relationship between sleep fragmentation and excitation/inhibition balance is the next key-step in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder.",

      "abstract": "The use of muscle relaxants in E.C.T. constitutes an important advance in psychiatric practice. The merits of the method are not only due to the beneficial effects of the relaxant itself; the anaesthetic, that is invariably administered at the same time, plays an essential part in the procedure. Every phase of the treatment is greatly improved. Anxiety, which so often develops during unmodified E.C.T., is greatly reduced if not abolished altogether. There is no cry or other noise that might disturb other patients awaiting treatment; the convulsion is attenuated to a reaction that may be varied at will from a mild modified convulsion to a mere flicker of facial muscles or complete absence of muscular activity. Cyanosis is absent and the colour remains good throughout, and—perhaps most important of all from the therapeutic point of view—there is no restlessness or confusion after the treatment, the patient sleeping quietly after the treatment until he wakes up without any unpleasant sensations or memories.",

      "title": "Parasomnias and Movement Disorders of Sleep",
      "abstract": "Neurologists are often enlisted to help diagnose, evaluate, and manage a spectrum of abnormal spells during the night ranging from parasomnias to motor disturbance that span the sleep-wake cycle. Parasomnias are undesirable emotional or physical events that accompany sleep. These events typically occur during entry into sleep from wakefulness, or during arousals from sleep, and are often augmented by the sleep state. Some parasomnias, such as the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder may be extremely undesirable, while others such as somniloquy are often of little concern. The parasomnias include a spectrum of abnormal emotions, movements, behaviors, sensory perceptions, dream mentation, and autonomic activity. Basic physiologic drives, such as sex, hunger, and aggression, may manifest as sleep-related eating, sleep-related sexual behaviors, and sleep-related violence. Parasomnias have a very bizarre nature, but are readily explainable, diagnosable, and treatable. They are hypothesized to be due to changes in brain organization across multiple states of being, and are particularly apt to occur during the incomplete transition or oscillation from one sleep state to another. Parasomnias are often explained on the basis that wakefulness and sleep are not mutually exclusive states, and abnormal intrusion of wakefulness into non-REM (NREM) sleep produces arousal disorders, and intrusion of wakefulness into REM sleep produces REM sleep parasomnias and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), two closely related conditions that often result in disturbed sleep onset and sleep maintenance, are also reviewed in this article. Although the mechanisms that underlie idiopathic RLS or PLMD are not fully understood, there is currently substantial evidence that dopaminergic dysfunction is likely involved in both conditions. The discussion will conclude with the \"other parasomnias\" and sleep-related movement disorders of clinical interest to the neurologist.",

      "title": "Nystagmus: Diagnosis, Topographic Anatomical Localization and Therapy",
      "abstract": "Nystagmus is defined as rhythmic, most often involuntary eye movements. It normally consists of a slow (pathological) drift of the eyes, followed by a fast central compensatory movement back to the primary position (refixation saccade). The direction, however, is reported according to the fast phase. The cardinal symptoms are, on the one hand, blurred vision, jumping images (oscillopsia), reduced visual acuity and, sometimes, double vision; many of these symptoms depend on the eye position. On the other hand, depending on the etiology, patients may suffer from the following symptoms: 1. permanent dizziness, postural imbalance, and gait disorder (typical of downbeat and upbeat nystagmus); 2. if the onset of symptoms is acute, the patient may experience spinning vertigo with a tendency to fall to one side (due to ischemia in the area of the brainstem or cerebellum with central fixation nystagmus or as acute unilateral vestibulopathy with spontaneous peripheral vestibular nystagmus); or 3. positional vertigo. There are two major categories: the first is spontaneous nystagmus, i.e., nystagmus which occurs in the primary position as upbeat or downbeat nystagmus; and the second includes various types of nystagmus which are induced or modified by certain factors. Examples are gaze-evoked nystagmus, head-shaking nystagmus, positional nystagmus, and hyperventilation-induced nystagmus. In addition, there are disorders similar to nystagmus, such as ocular flutter or opsoclonus. The most common central types of spontaneous nystagmus are downbeat and upbeat, infantile, pure torsional, pendular fixation, periodic alternating, and seesaw nystagmus. Many types of nystagmus allow a precise neuroanatomical localization: for instance, downbeat nystagmus, which is most often caused by a bilateral floccular lesion or dysfunction, or upbeat nystagmus, which is caused by a lesion in the midbrain or medulla. Examples of drug treatment are the use of 4-aminopyridine for downbeat and upbeat nystagmus, memantine or gabapentin for pendular fixation nystagmus, or baclofen for periodic alternating nystagmus. In this article we are focusing on nystagmus. In a second article we will focus on central ocular motor disorders, such as saccade or gaze palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and gaze-holding deficits. Therefore, these types of eye movements will not be described here in detail.Unter einem Nystagmus versteht man rhythmische Augenbewegungen, die i. d. R. aus einer langsamen (ursächlichen bzw. pathologischen) Augendrift und einer schnellen kompensatorischen Rückstellbewegung (Rückstellsakkade) bestehen; die Richtung wird klinisch nach der schnellen Phase angegeben. Leitsymptome sind zum einen Verschwommensehen, „hüpfende oder laufende Bilder“ (Oszillopsien), verminderte Sehschärfe sowie manchmal Doppelbilder, die oft blickpositionsabhängig sind. Zum anderen können die Patienten, je nach Ursache, leiden unter 1. permanentem Schwankschwindel und Gangunsicherheit (wie beim Downbeat- [DBN] oder Upbeat-Nystagmus [UBN]), 2. Drehschwindel mit gerichteter Fallneigung (bei akutem Beginn) sowie 3. Lagerungsschwindel. Es lassen sich im Wesentlichen zwei Kategorien unterscheiden: 1. Spontannystagmus, d. h. ein Nystagmus, der in Geradeausblickposition auftritt, wie DBN oder UBN, und 2. verschiedene Nystagmusformen, die durch bestimmte Faktoren ausgelöst oder moduliert werden, wie Blickrichtungs-, Kopfschüttel-, Rebound-, Lagerungs-, hyperventilations- oder druckinduzierter Nystagmus. Daneben gibt es noch nystagmusähnliche schnelle Augenbewegungen wie Ocular Flutter oder Opsoklonus. Die häufigsten zentralen Formen eines Spontannystagmus sind DBN, UBN, infantiler Nystagmus, seltener sind Fixationspendelnystagmus, rein torsioneller, periodisch alternierender und See-saw-Nystagmus. Viele Nystagmusformen erlauben eine genaue anatomische Lokalisation, wie z. B. der DBN, der meistens auf einer beidseitigen zerebellären Flocculusläsion beruht oder der UBN auf einer Läsion im Mesenzephalon oder der Medulla oblongata. Beispiele einer Pharmakotherapie sind die Gabe von 4-Aminopyridin beim DBN und UBN, Memantin oder Gabapentin beim Fixationspendelnystagmus oder Baclofen beim periodisch alternierenden Nystagmus. Abschließend: in einem nachfolgenden Artikel werden in dieser Zeitschrift die häufigsten und klinisch relevanten zentralen Okulomotorikstörungen wie Sakkaden und Blickparesen, internukleäre Ophthalmoplegie oder Blickhaltedefekte dargestellt, sodass auf diese hier nicht detailliert eingegangen wird.",

      "title": "LMNB1-Related Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics LMNB1-related autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a slowly progressive disorder of central nervous system white matter characterized by onset of autonomic dysfunction in the fourth to fifth decade, followed by pyramidal and cerebellar abnormalities resulting in spasticity, ataxia, and tremor. Autonomic dysfunction can include bladder dysfunction, constipation, postural hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and (less often) impaired sweating. Pyramidal signs are often more prominent in the lower extremities (e.g., spastic weakness, hypertonia, clonus, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral Babinski signs). Cerebellar signs typically appear at the same time as the pyramidal signs and include gait ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysmetria, and nystagmus. Many individuals have sensory deficits starting in the lower limbs. Pseudobulbar palsy with dysarthria, dysphagia, and forced crying and laughing may appear in the seventh or eighth decade. Although cognitive function is usually preserved or only mildly impaired early in the disease course, dementia and psychiatric manifestations can occur as late manifestations. Affected individuals may survive for decades after onset. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LMNB1-related ADLD is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and MRI findings and either an LMNB1 duplication or (more rarely) a heterozygous deletion upstream of the LMNB1 promoter identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. For autonomic dysfunction: Neurogenic bladder may require management of urinary retention and/or urgency and recurrent urinary tract infection. Constipation may require good hydration, increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, and/or laxatives. Orthostatic hypotension can be minimized by pharmacologic intervention, compression stockings, physical therapy, and increased dietary salt. Erectile dysfunction is treated medically. Impaired sweating is managed with cool environment and attention to fever during infection. Spasticity may be treated with medications and physical therapy. Ataxia can be managed with strategies to minimize falls and increase strength, and adaptive equipment such as walkers or wheelchairs. Feeding difficulties can be managed with speech therapy and appropriate feeding interventions to assure adequate nutrition while preventing aspiration pneumonia. Surveillance: Routine assessment of: weight, nutrition, and feeding; pulmonary status (re possible recurrent pneumonia); bladder and erectile function; psychosocial well-being; and medications/doses to avoid iatrogenic polypharmacy. At least yearly assessment: by a neurologist for disease manifestations and progression; and by a physiatrist, orthopedist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist to address orthopedic, equipment, and functional needs. Genetic counseling LMNB1-related ADLD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all individuals diagnosed with LMNB1-related ADLD whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as the result of a large LMNB1 duplication (or a deletion upstream of LMNB1) inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with LMNB1-related ADLD has a 50% chance of inheriting the LMNB1 duplication (or deletion upstream of LMNB1). Once the causative pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for LMNB1-related ADLD are possible.",

      "abstract": "In the modern world, anxiety is an important part of life. Physiological anxiety is a normal emotional response to stress, a biological response to a threat. Anxiety allows you to protect yourself and your loved ones from harm and prepare for significant events, and also serves as an important signal to take strong action in a stressful situation. The study and understanding of the specifics of the clinical structure, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of stress-related disorders in persons who have suffered as a result of hostilities is indeed the main concern for social and medical issues of our society. As the results of the study showed, patients most often complain of the following symptoms: the affect of longing (boredom, despondency, sadness, sorrow), depressed mood, a feeling of tension, danger and tightness, difficulties in adapting to new surroundings, anxiety over small things, irritability and impatience, lack of hope and prospects, internal tension with the inability to relax, a sense of loss of control over one's life, obsessive fears, sleep disorders, psycho-traumatic memories, fears and fixation on subjectively significant negative information about events in the occupied territories. In the clinical structure of post-traumatic stress disorders in the examined patients, it was found: post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.1), adjustment disorders (prolonged anxiety-depressive reaction) (F43.21), anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and panic disorder (F41.0). The data obtained became the basis for the development of a comprehensive personalized program for the correction of anxiety disorders and rehabilitation of persons with forced displacement. The personalized program was with differentiated use of methods of psychopharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychoeducation.

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

      "abstract": "Abstract This disorder is characterized by recurrent, massive myoclonic jerks involving large muscle groups (ie, entire body, trunk, or extremities) that occur only during sleep (predominantly during quiet sleep) among infants during the first year of life, usually from birth to 6 months of age. The muscle jerks are not associated with arousals or awakenings. Prevalence is unknown but is believed to be rare. There is no difference between genders. It has a self-limited course, with resolution by 6 months of age in most infants. No specific therapy is necessary. Pathogenesis has been postulated to involve a possible developmental abnormality of the reticular activating system. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) monitoring during polysomnography demonstrate muscle activity with a frequency of four to five jerks per second, occurring in clusters lasting 3 to 15 minutes. It is generally observed during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but can sometimes occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. No seizure activity is present on EEG tracings.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are unexpected and undesirable motor activities during sleep. Parasomnias may occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nightmare disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM behavior disorder (RBD), and status dissociatus (agrypnia excitata) are some of the REM parasomnias. Parasomnia overlap syndrome is a term used for parasomnias that occur in both REM and NREM sleep stages, such as catathrenia. RBD is a parasomnia that occurs during REM sleep stage and is characterized by acting out dreams (oneirism), leading to unwanted motor actions such as kicking, punching, or slapping, or sudden abrupt movements that can cause unexplained injuries to self or bedpartner. Memory of the associated dream is usually preserved. Diagnosis is obtained via video polysomnography with findings of REM activity without atonia and video recording of the oneirism. Treatment starts with developing a safety plan, improving sleep hygiene, and identifying any medications or other triggers such as snoring or leg movements. Melatonin, benzodiazepines, and a few other medications are used for treatment of RBD and other REM parasomnias. [ Psychiatr Ann . 2021;51(12):560–565.]",

Physiologic sleep is simply a period of resting for all our organs, their functions being markedly lowered, central control diminished, and changes of reconstruction occurring in our nervous equilibrium. The nervous patient sleeps badly, but the nature of the insomnia varies in many ways. Some go to sleep the moment they lie down, only to awake an hour or two later, to toss throughout the night, and possibly to doze off at the hour when they should awake. Others sleep well till the first peep of day, rising ill-humored and cross, having lost two of their nine hours' sleep. Some patients apparently never sleep and remain calm and comfortable the entire night, get very restless and provoked, get up and walk around",

      "title": "Human consciousness and sleep/waking rhythms: A review and some neuropsychological considerations",
      "abstract": "Abstract The relevance of sleep/waking rhythms to issues of human consciousness is reviewed from data in the literature and from personal studies. Consciousness is often considered to be markedly attenuated or absent in sleep. There is, however, much evidence for a rich subjective experience during sleep, much of which is not recalled later. This implies that William James' \"stream of consciousness\" persists continuously throughout sleep as well as wakefulness, but that problems of memory recall interfere with its being reported as such. Sleeping subjects show selective awareness of external stimuli, with significant stimuli generally leading to awakening and relatively nonsignificant stimuli, at least at times, being incorporated into the ongoing mental activity of REM or NREM sleep. Mentation throughout sleep is characterized by a high degree of autonomy and little willful control. Creative insight and problem solving of a very high order may occur in sleep and involve either dreaming or thought-like mentation. Parameters of waking consciousness show possibly sleep-related rhythmic fluctuations at both circadian (24 hr sleep/ waking) and ultradian (90–120 min, NREM/REM sleep) rates. Moreover, waking consciousness is markedly influenced by the quality of temporal stability of preceding sleep. A substantial number of so-called \"altered states of consciousness\" is found to involve primarily or exclusively dysfunction of sleep/waking mechanisms. Cerebral lesions can produce selective impairment of aspects of sleep mentation. It is concluded that further analysis of subjective awareness in sleep or in partial sleep states is very relevant and indeed vital to a more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness.",

We report a case of recurrent falls in an elderly woman, occurring exclusively at night and caused by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. In this condition there is a loss of the normal atonia of postural muscles that usually occurs in REM sleep [2]. It results in complex, vigorous, dream-enacting behaviours during REM sleep [3]. These typical behaviours have the potential to cause serious injury at night, particularly from falls. This disorder appears to have been overlooked in the geriatric literature as a potential source of falls and injury at night.",

Extrinsic sleep disorders are caused by transient stress or disruptions in the sleep environment. Jet lag and shift work that temporarily disrupt the normal sleep cycle also are considered to be extrinsic sleep disorders. Daytime sleepiness is a very common presenting symptom. It is important to distinguish excessive daytime sleepiness from alterations in the level of consciousness, such as lethargy. During the night, a sleeper cycles through a series of sleep stages; this is called “sleep architecture.” Rapid-eye-movement sleep is the state in which most, but not all, dreaming experiences occur. Symptoms that seem bizarre and occur in association with nocturnal sleep or daytime napping should be considered as possible expressions of sleep pathology rather than psychopathology.",

      "abstract": "In briefIn mild concussion there is a transient disturbance of neurological function but no loss of consciousness. In the moderate form there is a loss of consciousness for less than five minutes, usually with some retrograde posttraumatic amnesia. The severe category covers loss of consciousness for longer than five minutes, wandering eye movements, and lack of purposeful responses. Loss of short-term memory and coordination are the two primary deficits that occur after concussion. An athlete who loses consciousness should not participate again that day; any athlete who remains unconscious for more than several minutes should be hospitalized. An athlete who has had more than one concussion in a season can return to play when he or she is free of neurological disturbance.",

      "abstract": "Fear is one of the four primary emotions. It represents an inborn defence mechanism as a kind of protection from different potential dangers, and it manifests on a physical, cognitive and behavioural level. Physically it shows through faster heart beat, redness, heavier breathing, sweating, muscle tension, etc. On a cognitive level it can manifestin form of forgetfulness, concentration difficulty, negative thoughts, self-consciousness, etc. In terms of behaviour it becomes apparent through crying and screaming, teeth chattering and lip twitching, stuttering, thumb sucking, etc. Fear occurs in the second half of the child’s first year, and according to available research, younger children and girls experience a bigger number of fears than older children and boys. We can commonly see developmental fears in children, what is a normal occurrence at a certain age. They occur, change and spontaneously disappear when a child outgrows a certain developmental phase. During every developmental phase there are specific fears that have a certain function for that age. Children can be afraid of unknown people, separation, darkness and imaginary creatures, injuries, catastrophes, failure, lack of acceptance, ridicule, etc. Although developmental fears usually pass by themselves, and are an integral part to a child’s development, they can become intense and lasting so that they interfere with the child’s everyday life. In those cases expert help is needed. Fears in children can be a result of crisis situations, such as illness or hospitalisation of the child, illness of family members, divorce of the parents, death of family members, violence in the family and abuse in the family. Traumatised children generally suffer from more visible fears and tension and often expert help is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Major sleep disorders, independent of whether the dominant complaint is excessive daytime sleepiness or initiating or maintaining sleep, include a sleep deprivation component. Awakenings and arousals were defined based on electroencephalographic recordings using central leads. Some investigators tried to define \"awakenings\" behaviorally by analyzing continuous video recordings. Periodic limb movement disorder, originally described by Symonds as \"nocturnal myoclonus\", was questioned as being an epileptic equivalent. Restless legs syndrome is a dysesthesia that presents an important circadian relationship. Objective evaluations of the consequences of the sleep fragmentation are few in number. Most of them have been performed through studies of sleep-disordered breathing syndromes: upper airway resistance syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Insomnias are a cause of sleep deprivation. Menopause is also associated with sleep disruption. Often the reaction to this component will lead to a worsening of abnormal sleep, impacting on sleep hygiene, circadian timing of sleep-wake, and/or conditioning against sleep.",

      "title": "Trigeminal neuralgia and other facial pain",
      "abstract": "Trigeminal neuralgia and other facial pain Trigeminal neuralgiaEssentialsTrigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysms of intense pain resembling electrical shocks on the other half of the face in the area of one or two of the branches of the trigeminal nerve.Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia is not caused by any other disease and there are no findings in imaging investigations.First line drug is carbamazepine.In some patients, the symptom is relieved within a period of a few months, and thus the medication can be gradually reduced after achieving treatment response.Symptoms Between the attacks the pain is totally absent (remission phase), and in the active phase it may be provoked typically by touching certain areas of the face (trigger zones) or by eating. A new pain episode can be provoked after a refractory period that lasts from some seconds to some minutes. The pain comes in very short attacks of shooting pain or ”pins-and-needles” sensations. Additionally, continuous pain may occur. In the idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, there are no permanent neurological deficiency symptoms. When at its worst, trigeminal neuralgia may prevent the patient from washing the face or brush the teeth and make her/him unable to speak or even eat and drink. Causes and diagnosis In idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia there is no underlying disease or vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve causing the condition. About 10% of the patients belong to this group. In the majority of patients the symptoms are explained by vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve in the brain stem. Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia has similar symptoms as the idiopathic form but it is caused by another disease, e.g. MS or a brain stem tumour. Classification of trigeminal neuralgiaPotential trigeminal neuralgia: the patient has a unilateral pain resembling electrical shocks, limited to the area of a branch of the trigeminal nerve.Clinically confirmed trigeminal neuralgia: the patient has a unilateral pain resembling electrical shocks, limited to the area of a branch of the trigeminal nerve, and the pain may be provoked by a typical stimulus (e.g. breath of wind, touch, eating, movement of the muscles of facial expression).Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia with confirmed aetiology: in addition to the criteria in item 2, vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve is detected by MRI, associated with morphological changes in the trigeminal nerve root (requires 3D reconstruction technique).Secondary trigeminal neuralgia: in addition to the criteria in item 2, an MS plaque or a tumour causing trigeminal neuralgia is detected by MRI.Treatment The drug of choice is carbamazepine which is dosed according to response. Oxcarbazepine is an alternative and may be tried especially if carbamazepine causes adverse effects (fatigue, dizziness) or when there is a need to avoid the interactions of carbamazepine with other drugs. It is a derivative of carbamazepine but better tolerated. Oxcarbazepine is as effective as carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia. The initial dose for carbamazepine is 100 mg × 2 and for oxcarbazepine 150 mg × 2. The dose can be increased up to 1 200 mg/24h with carbamazepine and up to 1 800 mg/24h with oxcarbazepine. In the beginning follow-up of blood cell counts and liver function tests is recommended. Carbamazepine concentration can be measured if there are signs of overdose (dizziness, tiredness, diplopia or nystagmus).Because trigeminal neuralgia has a tendency for spontaneous remission, a trial may be made to taper off the medication gradually after a few months.If trigeminal neuralgia remains refractory to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, the patient is referred to specialized care for therapeutic assessment (e.g. department of neurology or neurosurgery). The most commonly used neurosurgical treatment modalities include coagulation of the trigeminal ganglion and microvascular decompression, i.e. microsurgical release of the nerve compression caused by a small nearby artery . Other drugs may be tried if carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are ineffective or not tolerated and the patient is not willing to undergo neurosurgical treatment. There is evidence on the effectiveness of lamotrigine as an add-on drug to carbamazepine (note: risk for skin rash when increasing thedosage). Also baclofen has been shown to have effect in trigeminal neuralgia. Dosage may be increased up to 80 mg/24h if needed. Phenytoin, clonazepam, valproic acid, gabapentine or pregabalin may be tried as secondary alternatives, but there is no evidence of their efficacy. Intravenous phosphenytoin may be tried for severe exacerbations even if its efficacy has not been proven in randomized controlled trials. After the infusion the medication is continued orally aiming at an effective yet tolerable dosage. When one drug is not enough, a combination of several drugs with different action mechanisms may be tried in patients who are not willing to undergo neurosurgical treatment.Therapy with botulinum toxin A (25–100 units) may be tried in trigeminus neuralgia refractory to the first-line drugs. Other facial pains Other neuropathic pain in the facial area In another type of facial neuropathic pain, a damage to a branch of the trigeminal nerve has led to a neuropathic pain state. The pain is usually long-term steady aching or burning, and the patient may in addition experience pains resembling electrical shocks.The most common causes of facial neuropathic pain include facial injuries, sequelae of surgical interventions (e.g supraorbital nerve injury in association with Beck's trepanation of the frontal sinus) and postherpetic neuralgia . The pain may also emerge after a disturbance of the cerebral circulation (so-called central post stroke pain). In these patients, the pain and the sensory disturbance do not necessarily limit to the facial area. Careful sensory testing of the face or neurophysiological investigations will reveal abnormal findings.If a patient is diagnosed with facial neuropathic pain of unclear origin, he/she is referred to a neurologist for further investigations. Other facial pain Acute facial pain is most commonly caused by sinusitis or by factors of dental origin. The aetiology may also be a disturbance of the masticatory system, or the pain may be referred from the anterior neck (e.g. thyroiditis) or from the back of the neck (e.g. tension neck).So-called atypical facial pain, also called persistent (or chronic) idiopathic facial pain (PIFP), is a much more common type of prolonged facial pain than trigeminal neuralgia. The pain is usually constant and dull. It is not restricted to one half of the face and is also otherwise independent of dermatomal borders. The pain may be triggered by an intervention directed at the paranasal sinuses or at the teeth (not, however, being a complication of the intervention), infection or stress.PIFP most commonly occurs in middle-aged women. The patients are often subjected to psychosocial stress. Clinical examination of a patient with facial pain includes teeth, masticatory muscles, temporomandibular joints, cervical spine and muscles of the neck and shoulders. It may also be advisable to examine the ears, nose and throat as well as the eyes and the anterior neck.If neuropathic pain is suspected, a neurological examination is important especially concerning the cranial nerves.A patient with severe or progressive facial pain is referred for further investigations to specialized care either to the department of oral diseases, neurology or ENT or to a special pain clinic, according to the local practice guidelines. See also cluster headache . TreatmentOther neuropathic pain in the facial area The treatment of other neuropathic pains in the facial area follows the same conventional principles as the treatment of any neuropathic pain .First-line drugs for neuropathic pain are gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants and antidepressants of the SNRI group.Persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP)PIFP is treated primarily with antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants are used in small dosages, venlafaxine in similar dosage as in the treatment of depression.Other facial painTreatment is determined by the cause of the pain. If the pain is suspected to originate from dental occlusion or from the teeth, the patient is referred to a dentist for assessment.

      "title": "Practical Consequences of Fatigue-Related Performance Failures",
      "abstract": "THE FACT THAT TIRED PEOPLE DO NOT PERFORM AS WELL AS WELL-RESTED PEOPLE DO IS A TRUISM THAT HAS BEEN LONG CONFIRMED BY CAREFUL EMPIRIC study in the laboratory.1 What is less obvious is the way in which fatigue manifests itself in performance changes. At one extreme, the fatigued subject may be in a microsleep (or, indeed, full sleep), in which case there will be a missed or tardy response. Such effects are often best detected by measuring lapses (unduly slow responses), for example, in the Psychomotor Vigilance Task. This was shown nicely in a study of repeated sleep restriction,2 in which the number of lapses increased as the week of restricted sleep progressed. However, even without microsleeps, there can be a general slowing in information-processing speed.3 Others4 have argued that sleep loss results in a loss of cognitive creativity, as indicated by a tendency to use old information processing strategies, even though they are no longer optimal or even practical. Certainly, from all viewpoints, the more extreme (and/or chronic) the sleep loss and the longer and more boring the task, the more likely performance decrements are to occur.5\r\n\r\nIn most real-world situations, the worst consequences of fatigue result not from a response slowing from 200 milliseconds to 750 milliseconds, for example, but from a major cognitive or attention failure—something many in the field refer to as a loss of situational awareness.6,7 This loss manifests itself in the operator no longer responding appropriately, or perhaps even responding completely inappropriately, to the situation. Thus, in hindsight, it is clear to the individual concerned that an error was made or that an important feature of the situation was missed. Sometimes this loss of situational awareness results in a catastrophe such as Three Mile Island or Exxon Valdez8; at other times, the situation is saved by additional levels of safety control, resulting in only a near miss. A recent (4/10/2007) public letter from Mark Rosenker, the chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), to Marion Blakely, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and to the Air Traffic Controllers' (ATC) union gives a useful insight into such real-world examples. The letter discusses one recent catastrophe and four recent near misses in the field of commercial aviation that may have resulted from a loss of situational awareness related to fatigue. It also gives the sleep community a compelling case for continuing their public campaign against chronic sleep loss and in furthering the study of the performance consequences of such loss. The full text of the letter is available on the NTSB public website at http://www.ntsb.gov/recs/letters/2007/A07_30_32.pdf.\r\n\r\nIn his letter, NTSB Chairman Rosenker expressed concern about accidents and near misses perhaps attributable to ATC personnel working while fatigued. He noted that the NTSB had long been concerned with the effects of fatigue in persons involved in critical functions and the dangers to safety that arose as a consequence. He also documented the large number of suggestions that the NTSB had made to the FAA over the years with the aim of improving the situation and noted that few of them appeared to have been acted upon. In the beginning of his letter, Chairman Rosenker discussed a recent (8/27/2006) fatal air crash at Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe airplane had been cleared by air traffic control (ATC) for takeoff on runway 22, which is 7,003 feet long and equipped with high-intensity runway lights; however, the crew mistakenly taxied onto runway 26, which is 3,500 feet long and unlighted, and attempted to take off. The airplane ran off the end of runway 26, impacted the airport perimeter fence and trees, and crashed. Of the 47 passengers and 3 crew members on board the airplane, 49 were killed, and one received serious injuries… During its ongoing investigation of this accident, the Safety Board has learned that the air traffic controller who cleared the accident airplane for takeoff had worked a shift from 0630 to 1430 the day before the accident, then returned 9 hours later to work the accident shift from 2330 until the time of the accident at 0607 the next morning. The controller stated that his only sleep in the 24 hours before the accident was a 2-hour nap the previous afternoon between these 2 shifts.\r\n\r\nThe NTSB chairman also gave four examples of near misses from Chicago (3/23/2006), Los Angeles (8/19/2004), Denver (9/25/2001), and Seattle (7/8/2001), all potentially involving fatigued ATCs. In all four cases, a loss of situational awareness may have been to blame. In three cases, the ATC put two planes on a collision course on the same runway; in the fourth, the controller failed to notice that the pilot had selected the wrong runway (which was closed for repair). Here is the Los Angeles example.\r\n\r\nA controller cleared a Boeing 737 passenger airplane to taxi onto and take off from runway 24L at the same time that another passenger airplane, a Boeing 747, had been cleared to land on the same runway and was on a short final approach. The pilots in the landing airplane saw the 737 taxi onto the runway and discontinued their approach about 12 seconds before the impending collision would have occurred, passing approximately 200 feet above the 737 during the go-around. The investigation determined that when the controller began working the local control position, he received a correct position-relief briefing that the 747 was approaching runway 24L. The controller later indicated that he subsequently developed a mistaken belief that the 747 was landing on the adjacent parallel runway 24R. The investigation determined that the controller had worked a shift the previous evening from 1530 until 2330, then went home and slept between 5 and 6 hours before returning to work the incident shift, which began at 0730. The controller described the portion of his shift before the incident as a “hard day” and attributed his error, in part, to fatigue.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem may concern shift work and overtime, both of which can have a potentially negative impact on the amount of sleep obtained. It is perhaps no coincidence that all 5 incidents occurred immediately after a short return, i.e., a break of only 9 hours between the end of one shift and the start of another. Short returns have been cited as the major problem with regard to backward (phase advance) rotating shifts.9 Such issues can often be worsened by a shortage of qualified personnel to fill positions and an aging workforce. Many in the FAA undoubtedly care deeply about the ATC fatigue issue, and there has been some FAA research activity in this regard and have been a few attempts at employee education. However, as the NTSB letter notes, “The findings that controllers have minimal recollection of the FAA's previously disseminated fatigue-related information and poor awareness of fatigue-related issues and that they inconsistently apply personal strategies for maximizing restorative sleep suggest that safety could be improved by providing more intensive training to controllers on shift-work and fatigue-related issues.”\r\n\r\nThe examples given in the NTSB letter reinforce the need for the sleep community to continue to study the issue of insufficient sleep leading to a loss of situational awareness, even though such experiments may be difficult to design and execute. The NTSB letter also suggests a useful roadmap by which elected officials, the FAA, their employees, other government agencies and the traveling public can be better educated regarding the negative consequences of fatigue and the various ways in which such negative consequences can be ameliorated or avoided. The sleep community is ideally suited to take an active role in this endeavor by ensuring the development and implementation of scientifically accurate education and outreach tools.",

      "title": "REM sleep behavior disorder - past, present, and future",
      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a fascinating experiment of nature predicted by animal experiments nearly 40 years ago. Active paralysis of somatic muscles is one of the defining features of REM sleep. In the catmodel of REM sleep behavior disorder, bilateral perilocus ceruleus lesions result in loss of the expected atonia of REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting (oneiric) behaviors. In humans, REM sleep behavior disorder presents as complex behaviors arising from REM sleep, as the persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep permits the acting out of dreams, often with violent or injurious consequences to the patient or bed partner. These behaviors include talking, yelling, swearing, grabbing, punching, kicking, jumping, or running out of the bed and may result in lacerations, ecchymoses, or fractures. The acute, or transient, form is usually drug-induced (most commonly tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). REM sleep behavior disorder may also be a manifestation of narcolepsy. The chronic form is seen predominantly in men (80-90%) over 50 years of age. Initially felt to be idiopathic, it is now becoming apparent that spontaneous REM sleep behavior disorder is often a harbinger of degenerative neurological conditions, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or dementia with Lewy body disease). Interestingly, the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder precede any other manifestations of the underlying neurodegenerative disorders by an average of over 10 years. It is readily diagnosed by formal sleep studies which reveal persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep. Most cases of REM sleep behavior disorder respond dramatically to clonazepam administered at bedtime.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of arousal and parasomnias of sleep-wake transition are revisited. Disorders of arousal are: Sleepwalking (SW), confusional arousals (CA) and sleep terrors (ST). SW, CA and ST are different clinical manifestations of the same disorder being ST the most severe and SW the mildest manifestation. Disorders of arousal are typical parasomnias of NREM sleep, mainly slow wave sleep. Pathophysiological mechanism of these disorders is the state's dissociation of wakefulness and sleep. The conjunction of the constitutional factors (genetic, age, sleep privation, drugs, psychological, etc.), and precipitant factors (light, sound, temperature, touch, apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, seizure, fever, psychological, etc.) permit three possible arousal behavioral response: A full awakening, a shift stage of sleep or a partial arousal. Clinical significance of arousal parasomnias depend on the age. In children are caused by developmental and genetic factors and usually are autolimited. In adults usually are caused by psychopathology. In the elderly are often caused by organic brain syndromes. Parasomnias of sleep-wake transition are: Rhythmic movements of sleep, sleeptalking, starts and the nocturnal cramp. Most of them are mild disorders, almost physiological phenomena that usually don't need any treatment.",

      "abstract": "Altered sleep patterns are prominent in the majority of psychiatric disorders. This article examines the psychiatric disorders that are most often associated to sleep dysfunction as it is related in clinical practice and describes the polysomnographic findings. Patient's main complaints are related to difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep (initial or middle insomnia, respectively) and poor quality of sleep. Early awakening or terminal insomnia is most described in the depressive conditions. Hypersomnia may be the main symptom in some depressive disorders, as seasonal depression, depression with atypical features or depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Polysomnographic evaluation shows, in general, a significative reduction in the efficiency and total time of sleep, in detriment to the amount of slow wave sleep. The reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency is mainly described for the depression, but has also been reported in other psychiatric disorders.",

Rhythmic head, limb or body movements are common in children before falling asleep, but they very rarely persist into adolescence and adulthood, or appear de novo later in life as sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders. A 22-year-old female with migraine without aura and history of early childhood pre-dormital body rocking (jactatio) discovered that unilateral slow rhythmic movements of her right foot greatly facilitated falling sound asleep while reclining. Sleep served every time to terminate her migraine attack. Rhythmic movements may serve on occasion as a therapeutic hypnotic maneuver in migraine sufferers.",

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

Neurological complications increase the length of ICU and hospital stay, and reduce the likelihood of return to independent living. Minor neurological complications are very common and often go undiagnosed. It is now recognized that transient and early postoperative problems such as confusion, agitation, and delirium – previously considered self-limiting nuisances – are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a decline in cognitive function in the early postoperative period is predictive of late (five-year) cognitive decline. General considerations Clinical spectrum The spectrum of central nervous system injury during and after cardiac surgery encompasses a wide range of clinical entities ranging from death or persistent vegetative state to subtle changes in memory and concentration: Neurological injury may be: immediate – apparent soon after the patient recovers from anaesthesia; or delayed – with onset after a...",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "abstract": "Aim. To describe a clinical case of differential diagnostics of motor phenomena during sleep. Materials and methods. Patient B., 37 years old. Visit to a somnologist at the University Clinic. Complaints were mainly made by the patient’s wife, since the patient himself does not remember these episodes. According to the wife, sudden sweeping movements of the arms and legs, incoherent speech are noted during sleep, then the patient gets up, can grab his hands, behaves aggressively, shifts things. These complaints have been noted for more than 10 years, with a gradual worsening of symptoms. A neurologist at the place of residence suggested a possible epileptic nature of these episodes,but no further examination was carried out. Results. From a semiological point of view, motor phenomena during sleep can imitate epileptic seizures, parasomnias, rapid eye movement behavior disorders, and normal sleep motor phenomena such as fragmentary sleep myoclonus, periodic limb movements, bruxism, etc. A differential diagnostic search is provided, a comparative characteristic of motor phenomena during sleep and wakefulness is given, as well as a scale of frontal epilepsy and parasomnia, which can help the doctor in making the correct diagnosis. Conclusion. Conducting a comprehensive examination of the patient and clarifying the clinical diagnosis made it possible to choose the correct management tactics, avoid unjustified prescription of antiepileptic drugs, and reduce emotional stress in the family due to the ambiguity of the manifestations of night motor phenomena. The established clinical diagnosis allows monitoring the patient in terms of the possible debut of a neurodegenerative disease.",

      "title": "Combining Methods of CBT and Progressive Relaxation for Treating Primary Insomnia: A Case Study",
      "abstract": "Primary insomnia is a mental health problem that is often reported due to the combination of either difficulty in falling asleep or maintaining sleep.It is known that people with primary insomnia experience an increased arousal of physiological, cognitive or emotional process, combined with negative conditioning that is associated with sleep.Progressive relaxation is one of the methods known to be effective in minimizing primary insomnia due to the person's need to release their tension.Frequently, the problem that causes primary insomnia derives from anxiety and muscle tension.Further work on the field is needed to show more the effectiveness of progressive relaxation in primary insomnia, especially in Indonesia, due to the lack of papers showing an intervention effect toward mental health problems.This paper presents a single case study of a graduate student who was diagnosed with primary insomnia.Graduate students are more likely to experience sleep deprivation, due to academic pressures and poor sleeping habits.Primary insomnia was diagnosed in this participant because they met the criteria of primary insomnia, such as frequent complaints of inability to fall asleep, and maintaining sleep for at least one month and an impairment in social and occupational functioning.It was shown during counseling that the participant was experiencing distress mainly caused by family problems.The participant felt burdened about the future due to their family's expectations on several subjects such as career, relationships and academic performance.The participant felt the need to fulfill all of the family's requirements.Another intervention, such as the ABC model from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), was needed due to the participant's negative core belief that made them unable to see their own positive traits.The participant also learned a mantra to cancel out unnecessary negative thoughts that caused sleep disturbance.The intervention was conducted for five sessions over a period of three weeks.The participant reported that before she was introduced to progressive relaxation, she had difficulty maintaining her sleep, she woke up five or six times during her sleep, and she was able to sleep only after midnight.After being taught progressive relaxation, the participant reported that her primary insomnia symptoms had decreased.She was able to sleep without any disturbance and fall sleep at 10 p.m.The participant's anxiety toward her family's expectations also decreased markedly.She reported that she was able to focus on what matters in the present, able to distinguish between her own needs and her family's expectations.Mantras were constantly used by the participant even a year after the intervention.She reported that using a mantra was the most efficient way for her to cancel out negative thoughts.This single case study showed that a short-term intervention was capable of providing an effective outcome for an individual with primary insomnia.It was also shown that progressive relaxation was successful in treating primary insomnia.This single case study showed the need to reduce anxiety for people with poor quality of sleep.It is suggested for further study to replicate progressive relaxation for reducing primary insomnia symptoms due to the successful outcome of this single case study.",

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "title": "Sleep Problems Among Infants and Young Children",
      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children's sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child's period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

The eyes of infants roll back into their heads; they refuse to take the breast and die after only several months of life (they are called sa-sik ). Women – as well as men – remain infertile, and are subject to bouts of confusion and temporary madness. Pregnancies often come to bad endings: there are spontaneous abortions, death in childbirth ( sugup ), an inability to produce milk. Men complain of stomach aches, tremendous headaches, vertigo, and various other troubles: they too are stricken with temporary madness, with loss of consciousness, and with inexplicable terrors that lead to fatal accidents or that even drive the victim, in a fit of rage, to murder or suicide ( sogha ). People of both sexes and all ages are affected. At home the family chickens often die suddenly and pigs choke to death.",

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep.

Nocturnal enuresis and sleep terrors tend to be more common in childhood anxiety disorders, such as separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism. Poor sleep quality is seen in adults with anxiety disorders such as specific phobia, social phobia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Objective data obtained from polysomnograms support this claim in many instances. Nocturnal panic occurs frequently in patients with sleep apnea and may predispose to the development of panic disorder. Insomnia is a trait marker for depression, and may also be one for anxiety disorders.

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

There are other disorders such as shift work disorder and jet lag disorder in which the circadian clock timekeeping mechanism is normal but the problems arise due to mismatch caused by extrinsic factors (night or early morning shift work and air travel across multiple time zones).

      "abstract": "Sleep inertia (SI) defines a period of transitory hypovigilance, confusion, disorientation of behavior and impaired cognitive and sensory-motor performance that immediately follows awakening. SI, the cognitive and behavioral correlate of the transition from sleep to wakefulness, has been incorporated in several models of sleep and vigilance regulation. Monitoring of several physiological parameters during the awakening period clearly indicate that this transition process is very slow. On the cognitive and behavioral side, SI has relevant operational implications. SI is one of the most serious contraindications to the use of napping during quasi-continuous operations if the individual may be required to perform complex tasks immediately after sudden awakening at unpredictable times. The studies on SI modulating factors showed that SI is strongly affected by slow wave sleep amount and sleep depth, while the outcomes concerning the modulation of SI by circadian factors are not consistent. Cognitive tasks involving high attentional load seem to be much more affected by SI than simple motor ones, performance accuracy being more impaired than speed. Finally, some possible countermeasures against the detrimental effects of SI to be applied in operational settings have been provided.",

      "abstract": "Approximately one third of our lives are spent in sleeping.Although largely an enigma, sleep is an important component of human behavior and provides an emotional and physical restoration to the body.Abnormalities in the normal physiology of sleep often cause a sleep complaint (e.g., difficulty falling asleep) or result in a sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea, narcolepsy).The prevalence of sleep difficulties in the general population is estimated to be 30% to 35%.Sleep is complex psycho-physiologic phenomenon that can be documented in sleep laboratory studies.During sleep the brain is extremely active and produces a characteristic pattern of stages, that cycle during the night.There is a wide inter-individual variability in the amount of sleep required per night (i.e., 3 to 10 hours.)A circadian rhythm of sleep and walking is established shortly after birth and changes over the life cycle.A deceleration of the 24 cycle occurs during adolescence and is typified by difficulty falling asleep.The rhythm returns to 24 hours during adulthood and accelerates with increasing age.Thus elderly individuals commonly complain of falling asleep early in the evening and waking early in the morning.Two oscillators with different period lengths control the suprachiasmic nucleus and the other occurs through neurobiologic mechanism.Two peptides, δ-sleep inducing peptide and factor S appear to be involved in the biochemical regulation.Synchronization of the oscillators with the 24-hour cycle imposed by the earth's rotation requires a routinely occurring zeitgeber (e.g., clock, light, shower, breakfast) to set the internal clock.Practically, young person should awaken at the same time daily to shorten the oscillators, and elderly persons should delay the onset of sleep until a set time to stretch the oscillators.The neurotransmitter norepinephrine is involved in wakefulness and dreaming, while serotonin is active during non-dreaming sleep.The interaction between the cholinergic system and the noradrenergic system also may play a role in sleep.The pharmacological treatment of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are updated through this review article.",

      "abstract": "A prerequisite to the diagnosis of vegetative state is the exclusion of apparently similar syndromes, in which the patient retains the consciousness partially or even completely. Some syndromes are not separate nosological entities and should be abandoned: the apallic state, the neocortical death, the decerebrate and decorticate state, the alpha-coma, the vigil or prolonged or irreversible coma are among them. Three conditions deserve special consideration. The term locked-in syndrome describes a patient completely paralysed and mute, but fully conscious, and is usually caused by ischemic lesions of the pons. Several variants do exist, either in the causes and site of lesion. Some patients may become paralysed and mute, but conscious because of polyneuropathies, that is in the absence of any lesions of the central nervous system. The akinetic mutism is a rare condition characterised by loss of speech and nearly absent bodily movements. Painful stimulation may cause appropriate withdrawing, and wakefulness and self-awareness may be preserved, but cognitive impairment is usually present. It must be emphasised that this condition can be due to potentially treatable lesions, such as hydrocephalus and craniopharyngioma. The term \"minimally responsive\" or \"minimally conscious\" describes severely disabled patients in whom meaningful responses can be demonstrated, although inconstantly. This condition, the true diagnostic challenge, often represents a transition phase of vegetative patients recovering consciousness. Physicians, physiotherapists and patient's relatives should work all together to reach a correct diagnosis, by using current available methods to monitorize the recovery of consciousness.",

The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

      "abstract": "The visitor experience, a more intense form of the normal sense of presence, emphasizes the deep belief of personal contact with an extraterrestrial (or religious) entity. Phenomenological details of visitor experiences are expected to reflect the functions of deep temporal lobe structures; common details involve cosmic meaningfulness, vestibular experiences, flickering, complex visual sensations and alimentary references. After intense experiences, interictal-like behaviors similar to religious conversions (widening affect, sense of personal, desire to spread the word, concern about Man's destiny) emerge. Normal people who are prone to these experiences show frequent temporal lobe signs and specific personality characteristics that include enhanced creativity, suggestibility, mild hypomania, anxiety, and emotional lability. Learning histories that encourage the use of right temporal lobe functions for the consolidation of memory, such as compartmentalization of beliefs or repression due to early sexual abuse, predispose to intense visitor experiences. The most frequent precipitants are psychological depression, personal (existential) stress and proximal exposure to the focal tectonic strain fields that accompany luminous phenomena. Possible neuropsychological mechanisms are discussed.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea, polysomnography, and split-night studies: consensus statement of the Connecticut Thoracic Society and the Connecticut Neurological Society.",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a state-dependent syndrome. It is characterized by repeated collapse of the upper airway as the result of the loss of waking neuromuscular drive as the brain changes from wakefulness to sleep. This produces a state-dependent decrease in muscle tone, which, together with other predisposing factors such as obesity and anatomical narrowing of the upper airway, results in the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing describes the continuum from simple snoring (pharyngeal vibration), to flow limitation (hypopnea), to complete cessation of breathing (apnea). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the common description of what is now appreciated as the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. The cardinal symptoms are snoring, observed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The immediate physical consequences are hypoxia, repeated sympathetic discharges, increased cardiac load, and repeated brain arousals. The repetitive arousals are required to restore airway patency, resulting in severely fragmented sleep and consequent sleep deprivation. The syndrome, untreated, produces significant cognitive and cardiorespiratory morbidity, and potential mortality. Compared to matched controls, patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea use twice the health resources and spend double the health-care dollars in the 10 years prior to diagnosis. Both trends are reversed by successful treatment. It is by definition a sleep-related illness and can be observed and evaluated only when the patient is asleep. Polysomnography is the laboratory procedure to study sleep and its protean dysfunctions. Multiple physiologic parameters are required to document the various types of sleep disorders as well as to establish the origin of pathologic sleep fragmentation. Complete polysomnography includes (but is not limited to) electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram ((EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory effort, air flow, and oxygen saturation. Treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, uvulopalatal and/or maxillomandibular surgery, positional control, and weight loss. The efficacy of each depends on the individual anatomy and the severity of the sleep-disordered breathing. CPAP is accepted as the most reliable treatment regardless of anatomy and severity. It is currently the only treatment modality which can be titrated during sleep and requires simultaneous polysomnography.",

As the patient matures into adult, sleep disorders continue to be common and an important factor in development, both social and cognitive. Sleep disorders can adversely impact physical and mental health. Nonrestorative sleep can hamper a child's ability to concentrate and control emotions and behavior. Sleep disorders vary among age groups, but most can occur with varying frequency at any age. Several disorders are typically seen only during the first few years of life, including colic, excessive nighttime feedings, and sleep onset association disorder. A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age. Sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respirations are not found only in adults but are, in fact, quite common in the pediatric population. While these disorders can occur at any age, treatment options vary substantially by age.",

      "title": "Circadian aspects in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia",
      "abstract": "Summary Because the endogenous circadian pacemaker is a very strong determinant of alertness/sleep propensity across the 24 h period, its mistiming may contribute to symptoms of insomnia (e.g., difficulties initiating sleep and maintaining sleep) and to the development of insomnia disorder. Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co‐morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.",

      "title": "[Sleep disorders and dementia].",
      "abstract": "A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases. Greatly increased daytime sleepiness or striking insomnia at the very beginning of suspected dementia should thus prompt the search for other, possibly treatable causes of dementia. Neuropathological and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis of a deteriorated hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (harbouring the biological clock) as a cause for the deranged circadian sleep-wake system in dementia. Management of sundowning behaviour includes restriction of daytime sleep, exposure to bright lights, and social interaction schedules during the day. The benzodiazepines and analogues usually not being sufficiently effectual, low doses of mild neuroleptics are often needed. Whether recent reports on efficacy of melatonin in elderly insomniacs also apply to demented patients is yet uncertain. The careful search and treatment of possible extracerebral physiologic factors causing reversible hypersomnia or insomnia is an important requisite. Polysomnographic studies are needed to recognise treatable sleep disturbance which could deteriorate or mimic dementia and sundowning. Particularly, a sleep-apnea-hypopnea syndrome must be searched for at the beginning of a suspected dementia, when successful treatment is still possible. Sleep studies should also identify periodic leg movements of sleep with restless legs and/or increased daytime sleepiness, and hyperkinetic parasomnias such as REM sleep behaviour disorder which may complicate or imitate sundowning.",

Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "Psychosocial problems observed in older adults after disaster",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural disasters are large‐scale catastrophic events that seriously disrupt the functioning of a community or society. The frequency and severity of disasters are increasing and involve widespread human, material, economic, or environmental impacts that exceed the ability of the society affected by them to cope using its resources. In addition, disasters significantly affect the physical, emotional, and psychological health of individuals and cause numerous deaths, injuries, and economic losses. One of the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of disasters is the elderly. The increase in the elderly population worldwide brings with it the problems specific to this period and the service needs for these problems. The population consists of older adults, who are among the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of natural disasters. During the social traumatisation process triggered by natural disasters, elderly people experience intense feelings of anxiety, fear, anger, helplessness, loneliness, hopelessness, futurelessness, and insecurity. Reactions such as unresponsiveness, alienation, inability to focus, and inability to remember are normal during this process. The normality of these feelings and responses in the acute period, which can last up to 3 months, will give way to abnormality unless the necessary physical and psychosocial conditions are provided. When the necessary psychosocial conditions are not provided, elderly individuals who experience a disaster may experience mental problems such as post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression, somatisation disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. In this context, providing the necessary psychosocial support for older adults to cope with psychosocial problems after a disaster and facilitating access to this support is very important in terms of adapting to the post‐disaster period.",

      "abstract": "Advanced and delayed sleep phase disorders, and the hypersomnia that can accompany winter depression, have been treated successfully by appropriately timed artificial bright light exposure. Under entrainment to the 24-h day-night cycle, the sleep-wake pattern may assume various phase relationships to the circadian pacemaker, as indexed, for example, by abnormally long or short intervals between the onset of melatonin production or the core body temperature minimum and wake-up time. Advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome have been variously ascribed to abnormal intrinsic circadian periodicity, deficiency of the entrainment mechanism, or—most simply—patterns of daily light exposure insufficient for adequate phase resetting. The timing of sleep is influenced by underlying circadian phase, but psychosocial constraints also play a major role. Exposure to light early or late in the subjective night has been used therapeutically to produce corrective phase delays or advances, respectively, in both the sleep pattern and circadian rhythms. Supplemental light exposure in fall and winter can reduce the hypersomnia of winter depression, although the therapeutic effect may be less dependent on timing.",

      "abstract": "This study describes the clinical features, natural history and treatment of 100 patients with narcolepsy. Over half had one or more affected relatives. Symptoms commenced in adolescence or early adult life in most patients, and remissions were uncommon. Narcolepsy occurred several times each day, often in unusual circumstances and sometimes with little warning. The mean total sleep time of narcoleptics was a little over 9 hours in each 24 hour period, as compared with under 8 in normal subjects. Cataplexy occurred in 93 patients, most commonly when subjects were tired. Attacks were similar in nature to physiological weakness with laughter, although other sudden sensory or emotional stimuli did not cause paralysis of voluntary movement nor loss of muscle tone in normal subjects. Half these patients had frequent dreams before the onset of proper sleep, and 62 had sleep paralysis. This was often frightening, with feelings of suffocation, accompanied by dreams, and of uncertain length. A minority of patients with narcolepsy had muscle aches and jerks before sleep, double vision or loss of focus during cataplexy, went sleep-walking by day, and had daytime hallucinations. Amphetamines had been given to 71 patients for periods of up to 33 years with adequate, but rarely complete, control of narcolepsy. Side effects were common and almost half these patients became tolerant, needing higher dosage to control symptoms. Three patients had a cerebrovascular accident whilst taking amphetamines. Imipramine or clomipramine had ben given in combination with amphetamines to 33 patients for periods of up to 6 years with considerable improvement in both cataplexy and sleep paralysis, and few side effects. Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension as a result of amphetamines or combined treatment did not occur.",

      "abstract": "Major or complete loss of eyesight is a serious interference with the activity and life of the affected subject. It is generally assumed that these subjects are quite helpless and that they suffer general deterioration. This is at variance with results of training and rehabilitation during which many thus affected subjects become independent, which is essential for their social integration. Despite this they have to experience sociopsychological attitudes which are prejudices with a typical stereotype which ignore the unique structure of everybody's potential who lost eyesight. The source of prejudices is general lack of information of people as regards actual sequelae of loss of eyesight and the emotional reaction of people with normal eyesight. A certain part is also played by tradition which does not take into account results of modern care of thus affected subjects. Prejudices cause in subjects with severely affected eyesight and in blind persons mental stress and render their actual social integration (employment, partnership etc.) more difficult. The solution is to train resistance against prejudices in thus affected subjects and to intensify health education on the given problem.",

Patient's clinical features may support a specific dissociative disorder subtype diagnosis associated with sleep-related episodes, specifically dissociative identity disorder, dissociative fugue, or dissociative disorder NOS.

Events like natural disasters, wars, rapes are traumatic for all people, but chlidren may almost equally be affected by separation, abusing, divorce, death of parents and testifying against abusers or parents. Posttraumatic stress disorder is the most recognizable manifestation of state caused by trauma. Traumatic event is relived on different ways: through frequently recalling events and flashbacks of that experience, avoiding of situations related with trauma, appearing of general insensitivity, that manifests as losing of interests for important activities, impossibilty of emotional binding and sense of isolation from others. The simptomes of posttraumatic disorder are: increased arousal, irritability, anxiety, difficulties with concentration, overemphasized shock. Quality relationship parent-child, support that child had in family before the traumatic experience and current support from social surroundings may be protection factors and prevent occurrence and advancemenet of negative trauma effects.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders in childhood are frequent and usually harmless. They rarely point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders, it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g. psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).",

Syncope results from an abrupt decrease in cerebral perfusion or essential substrate delivery. It can be difficult to differentiate syncope from seizure activity or, sometimes, episodes of transient weakness. Syncope is often associated with sudden exertion or excitement. Limb stiffening, opisthotonic posture, micturition, and vocalization are common. Syncope occurs when cerebral blood flow falls below a critical level; this is about 30–50% of normal in people, although it might differ for quadripeds. Reduced cerebral blood flow also can result from cerebrovascular or other intracranial disease. Cardiac arrhythmias, as well as organic heart disease, commonly are involved. Quadrupedal posture makes this less likely in companion animals, although it does seem that sudden excitement might precipitate this in dogs. Arrhythmic causes of syncope can occur during sleep such that a loss of consciousness might not be observed, but might result in seizure-like activity, opisthotonus, urination.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness. This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed.",

      "title": "<i>Retro-active Hypermnesia and other Emotional Effects on Memory. (Psych. Rev., November</i>, 1919.) <i>Stratton, M.</i>",
      "abstract": "As effects of excitement may be noted—( a ) those which are transitory, occurring during the excitement, and (b) those which persist. As transitory effects there may be an apparently general hypermnesia, in which there is a marked freshening of all memories, or there may be a selective hypermnesia, where certain rather narrow lines of association are followed. The lasting effects may be hypermnesia, hypomnesia, or total amnesia for events experienced during the excitement. The following lasting effects may also be noted upon experiences that have occurred before the emotion: (1) The well-known retro-active amnesia; (2) The opposite, retro-active hypermnesia to which little attention has formerly been paid; (3) a combination of both these effects; for the same person the stretch preceding the critical event may show vivid recollections followed by a period of utter blank. The retro-active hypermnesia in the author's cases rarely goes beyond the events of the day preceding the excitement. It occurred in 25 out of 225 cases. The antecedent events are unusually vivid—more vivid than any other of the patients' memories. The vividness is not confined to visual images, although these are more frequent; sounds, the mood, the general state of the mind may be clearly represented. There is some indication that women experience it more frequently than men. In some cases the effect has come at some crisis at early childhood, in others at a later date. The quality of the emotion seems of less importance than the intensity of the shock. Fear, or fearless surprise, or pleasurable surprise may be the cause. If the intensity be exceeded the experiences connected with it are in some degree suppressed; while if it be not reached the experiences are lost probably by a mere failure to gather up the events into the mesh of interest. Emotion facilitates the recall of whatever is noticed during the excitement, and it seems probable that memory images may be treated by the emotional onrush in the same way as perceptive images. The experiences of the preceding day, however, probably do not exist as actual images at the time of the emotion but as psycho-physical dispositions or traces, so that where there is retro-active hypermnesia the emotion would seem to have the power to strengthen these dispositions and the connections by which they may be called into life. The author gives illustrative cases.",

      "title": "Hiccups as a myocardial ischemia symptom",
      "abstract": "A hiccup is involuntary, paroxysmal inspiratory movements of the chest wall associated with diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscle contractions, with the synchronized closure of glottis. The mechanism underlying this common primitive reflex plays an important role in protecting airways against esophageal aspiration. The hiccup reflex mechanism is based on the afferent pathway (vagus and phrenic nerve and sympathetic fibers innervating chest organs, the abdomen, the ear, the nose and the throat stimulation, and the stimulation of hiccup center in the central nervous system, mainly reflecting psychogenic or metabolic disorders) and the efferent pathway (phrenic nerves). An incidental hiccup is a common problem, usually resolves spontaneously and does not present a clinical issue. The clinical issue arises in the case of pathologic persistent hiccups or symptomatic secondary hiccups which may lead to significant fatigue, insomnia or depression. Generally, pathologic hiccups are associated with considerable discomfort concerning both the \"stigmatized\" person and his or her personal surroundings in which it evokes different emotions, from amusement through impatience to uneasiness and the suggestion of a medical visit as an expression of concern for a given person. The most common causes of pathologic symptomatic hiccups are nervous system diseases, either the central nervous system (proliferative, angiogenic, inflammatory disorders), or the peripheral nervous system: the irritation of the phrenic nerve (proliferative disorders, goitre) and the vagus nerve (otolaryngologic diseases, meningitis, esophageal, stomach and duodenal diseases, hepatitis, pancreatitis, enteritis). The vagus nerve irritation with subsequent hiccups may be caused by chest disorders (injury, surgery) and heart diseases (myocardial infarction). In the present paper we describe the case of a 62-year-old male with recurrent hiccups associated with exertion as a secondary symptom of myocardial ischemia.",

In obstructive sleep apnea, the upper airway becomes blocked and marked effort on the part of the individual is required until the obstruction is broken, allowing respiration to occur again. If the apnea is sustained and frequent, one may see end organ damage. Muscle tone and neural output is changed during sleep. In obstructive sleep apnea, the majority of people have no difficulty breathing during the day, however during their normal sleeping time, these neuromuscular inputs are altered in such a fashion that the obstruction occurs. It is not uncommon for a Mueller type maneuver to occur, which increases vagus tone leading to bradycardia, sinus arrest and even asystole. Hypoxemia leads to increased sympathetic discharge which in turn can lead to systemic hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by spontaneous and unexpected occurrence of panic attacks, the frequency of which can vary from several attacks per day to only a few attacks per year. Panic disorder is usually qualified with the presence or absence of agoraphobia. Panic disorder with agoraphobia is an anxious disorder where repeated attacks of fear and anxiety appear at places and situations out of the family surrounding, places where the escape is difficult and where someone would be helpless, as for an example crowded places, passing over bridges, traveling by public transport, walking in an open space. Depressive episodes, as well as obsessive-compulsive procedures, can also follow this condition. A female person aged 25 years presents with a classical panic disorder with an agoraphobia and a classic and secure behavior. She also suffers from dysthymia and a chronic fluctuating mood and low self-confidence. The patient gets panic attack when traveling by public transport in the morning when going to work, in a restaurant, in a supermarket, in a disco, when walking in an open space. The symptomatology started half a year before going to the psychiatrist, after several close persons died. A short description of CBT. CBT is based on the cognitive model of an emotional answer and aspects of stoic philosophy. CBT is based on an idea that our thoughts cause emotions and different behavior, so that we can change the way of thinking, and after that feelings/behavior unchanged situations. CBT uses Socrates' method and some techniques from psychodrama, as well as relaxing techniques. Giving «homework» and keeping a diary is also a very important part of this therapy. Seven therapeutic sessions of a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy in a combination with the antidepressants (one session weekly) were performed. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a leading therapy in dealing with agoraphobia and panic attacks. In combination with SSRI, it gives excellent results in reduction of the symptomatology. At the end of the treatment, the mental state was significantly improved. The patient came in contact with her beliefs and the basic models developed in childhood, and learned how to cope with negative thoughts, feelings and maladaptive behavior.",

Dreams help to show the connection with the object and to maintain a protection against the fear of an omnipotent maternal figure. Night terrors are not dreams. They point to what is missing and thus to what it takes for a person to be able to dream. Night terrors do not take place in sleep, though they are initiated out of it, but in a dissociated state characterised by a waking alpha rhythm during which the subject is disoriented and may be delusional or hallucinating. Some children never attain the ability because of a lack of containment of their disorganised and often traumatising experiences. D. W.

      "title": "Anesthetics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anesthesia, which constitutes a state in which noxious events such as surgical procedures are imperceptible, may or may not be accompanied by loss of consciousness. A complete or general anesthetic given by the inhalation or intravenous routes produces hypnosis (profound sleep), analgesia, muscle relaxation, and protection against the increase in blood pressure and heart rate resulting from surgical stress (maintains homeostasis). An anesthetic which blocks the neural transmission of painful stimuli through afferent nerves and does not affect the level of consciousness can be classified as a local anesthetic. Induction of general anesthesia produces a progressive deepening of the anesthetic state and represents a descending desensitization of the central nervous system (CNS). A progression of clinical signs useful for estimating the depth of anesthesia. Four stages can be defined: first, a state of altered consciousness and analgesia begin; second, loss of consciousness, accompanied by irregular respiration and motor movement from depression of higher motor inhibitory centers with release of lower motor mechanisms, occurs; third, surgical anesthesia is reached, in which spinal cord and spinal reflexes are abolished, providing relaxation of skeletal musculature, and loss of corneal, conjunctival, pharyngeal, and laryngeal reflexes occurs progressively; fourth, onset of respiratory paralysis resulting from significant depression of the medullary respiratory center occurs, and subsequent cardiovascular collapse ensues. Monitoring via an electroencephalogram (EEG) and hemodynamic and blood gas monitoring help assess the depth of anesthesia. The potency of inhaled agents is expressed as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) that is required to prevent spontaneous movement in response to a surgical or equivalent stimulus in 50% of patients. The onset of action is fast (within 60 s) for the intravenous anesthetic agents and somewhat slower for inhalation and local anesthetics. Although the modern practice of anesthesia is exceedingly sophisticated, identification of the basic molecular mechanism underlying it is still lacking. Inhalational anesthetics are very diverse chemically and extrapolation from the effect of a particular agent to the physiological state of anesthesia is problematic. Anesthesia theories may be divided into two categories: lipid theories and protein theories. Lipid theory postulates that inhalational anesthetics exert their primary effects by dissolving in the lipid portions of nerves, altering the conductivity. In protein theories, the direct interaction of inhalation anesthetics and proteins has been proposed as the cause of anesthesia. All inhalation anesthetics agents introduced after 1950, except ethyl vinyl ether, contain fluorine. Agents such as ether, chloroform, trichloroethylene (Trilene), cyclopropane, and fluoroxene (Fluoromar), which were once used, have been displaced by the newer fluorinated anesthetics. The intravenous (iv) anesthetic agents are of two types: those which are used to induce, but not maintain, anesthesia, and those useful for induction and also maintenance. The need is for an anesthetic agent having an extremely fast rate of onset and limited side effects. Fast onset minimizes the stress and agitation. Among the various classes of compounds that have been used are barbiturates, opioids, steroids, benzodiazepines, and hindered phenols. Balanced anesthesia, a potent opioid combined with an inhalation agent, is often used. The inhalational agents probably exert their biological activity through physical effects, while function through a biological receptor‐mediated pathway. At the end of a surgery, the primary concern is to eliminate respiratory depressant effects. This reversal can also diminish analgesic effects. There are two types of reversal agents: pure antagonists and mixed agonist–antagonists. The antagonists naloxone and naltrexone are the most commonly used. Local anesthetics act by inhibiting the channel opening allowing influx of sodium ions. The degree of blockage depends not only on the amount of drug, but also on the rate of nerve stimulation. In the clinically useful agents the polar group is an ester or an amide, although activity may be maintained when the polar function is an ether, thioether, ketone, or thioester. The ideal agent should have a short onset of nesthesia and be useful for multiple indications.",

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation. Agrypnia excitata is the term that aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias can often be confused for seizures and vice versa, but differentiating between them is often necessary. Seizures, in general, occur more frequently during sleep or sleep-wake transitions, so having nocturnal events is not uncommon. Limb movements or other behaviors during sleep are not always seizure-related. Some parasomnias such as sleep enuresis, somnambulism, and somniloquy are more common in children. Sleep terrors, nightmares and rapid eye movement behavioral disorder can be confused with seizures. A careful history can often help differentiate between seizures and parasomnias, but in many cases polysomnography and/or video-EEG is required for definitive characterization. As the approach to treatment can be different, it is important to correctly diagnose the condition.",

      "title": "Seizures",
      "abstract": "Seizures occur when bursts of uncontrolled electrical activity translate into motor activity. Seizure activity takes on a variety of presentations, depending upon the patient and the degree to which one or both cerebral hemispheres are involved. Generalized seizures are characterized by whole-body involvement, collapse, and loss of consciousness. Patients often exhibit extensor rigidity in all four limbs. Limbs also frequently demonstrate paddling behavior. Unconscious behaviors, such as chewing, licking, swallowing, and vocalizing, may emerge during seizure activity. Autonomic signs may also appear. It is not uncommon for patients to lose control over their urinary bladders or bowels. At times, seizures may be difficult to differentiate from syncopal episodes. Thorough history taking may help to distinguish the two. Partial seizures, on the other hand, may resemble dyskinesias. Partial seizures involve one region of one cerebral hemisphere, and may therefore target any part of the body. The neck, trunk, or limbs are most commonly involved. There are many causes of seizures, regardless of whether they are generalized or partial. For ease of consideration, causes of seizure activity may be described as being intra- or extracranial. These categories prioritize differentials differently based upon the patient's age. In a pediatric patient, meaning one that is less than one year of age, seizures are most likely due to a developmental defect or traumatic injury. Other common causes of pediatric seizures include hepatic encephalopathy (HE), as from a portosystemic shunt (PSS) or neonatal hypoglycemia. Young adult to middle-aged patients, on the other hand, are more likely to develop idiopathic epilepsy, as compared to seniors, which are more likely to develop intracranial neoplasia. Most seizures are self-limiting. However, a fraction of seizures may become protracted, either in terms of their duration or frequency. Cluster seizures occur when the frequency of seizures exceeds two over a 24-h period. Status epilepticus occurs when either a seizure lasts for more than 5 min, or multiple seizures overlap such that patient recovery time between events is eliminated. Status epilepticus is a medical emergency.",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

They include non-rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnias (eg, confusional arousals, sleep terrors, sleepwalking) and REM-related parasomnias (eg, nightmare disorder, REM sleep behavior disorder, sleep paralysis). Notable among these is REM sleep behavior disorder, which is closely linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease. Early detection of this disorder is essential because it often precedes the motor symptoms of neurodegenerative conditions. Diagnostic evaluation of parasomnias typically involves polysomnography, in some cases with video monitoring, to differentiate parasomnias from other conditions. Nonpharmacologic treatments, including sleep hygiene and sleep safety measures, are first-line approaches. Cognitive behavior therapy is also effective. Pharmacotherapy may be required in severe cases. Referral to a sleep specialist is recommended for patients with complex or dangerous parasomnias and for patients with frequent sleep paralysis.",

      "abstract": "of hypnotic ecstasy, though no relation seems to exist between hypnosis and normal sleep, in spite of Bechterew's statement °that hypnosis is nothing but a modification of normal sleep.Yet it appears from a study of our cases that the spontaneous, semi-drowsy hypnagogic state is practically identical with the experimental hyp- notic state.In both there is increased suggestibility, a tendency to paralysis, cataleptiform conditions may appear, and if the state is pro- longed, as in the semi-drowsiness of patients suffering from protracted insomnia, hallucinations of sight may arise.Sudden awakening from a sound sleep seems to bear no relation to the origin of the disorder.In some personal observations on sleeping animals that were suddenly awakened by a loud noise, no temporary muscular rigidity took place, for the animal would frequently jump up and regain its feet at once.If the animal were only half awakened by the stimulus, in a few seconds it would again pass into a natural sleep without any intervening palsy.This nocturnal palsy, therefore, on clinical evidence at least, seems to possess the following characteristics:1.It appears only in the hypnagogic state and runs parallel with it.2. When it occurs in normal individuals it is a transitory and rare phenomenon.3. Sometimes it follows a strong emotional shock and assumes the characteristics of a recur- rent mental state, as in the case published in my first paper.4. The symptom-complex may occur in hysteria, neurasthenia or psychasthenia.In neuras- thenia it appears to be merely symptomatic of the underlying neurosis with its concomitant sense of exhaustion.In hysteria and psychasthenia it is an equivalent disorder in the sense of replacing the narcoleptic attacks in the former disease or the peculiar crises of anxiety in the latter.5. This nocturnal palsy has a varying duration, from a few seconds in normal individuals, to several minutes or even a quarter of an hour, in pathological cases.6.The entire symptom-complex is a mental dissociation reacting most strongly on the motor mechanism, and as a purely functional disorder, it is distinctly amenable to psychotherapcutic treatment.",

In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live.

An impressive aspect of this phenomenon is that, during the meditation, the intense emotional affect that would ordinarily accompany this ideation, e.g., when obtained by free association, seems to be markedly reduced or almost absent. During meditation, thoughts and ideas may appear that are ordinarily repressed, such as intense hostile-aggressive drives, murderous impulses, and, occasionally, libidinal ideation. Evaluation of electroencephalogram records in patients and subjects using the relaxation techniques reveals remarkable periods of intrahemispheric alpha and theta synchrony at times, even for inexperienced subjects. In a Transcendental Meditation meditator who has been meditating for more than 4 years, there occurs synchronous alpha activity upon closing the eyes, even before starting to meditate on the temporal, central, and occipital cortical areas.",

Janz studied the relation between seizures and thesleep/wake cycle and divided the epilepsies into three categories: nocturnal,awakening, and diffuse. Since then, the effect of sleep on the ictal andinterictal manifestations of epilepsy has been studied extensively. Manyseizures are activated by sleep or arousal from sleep. Interictal dischargesare also seen more commonly during sleep, with the greatest activation seenduring nonrapid eye movement sleep. Sleep not only increases the frequency ofepileptiform abnormalities, but also may alter their morphology anddistribution. Sleep deprivation also facilitates both epileptiformabnormalities and seizures. Seizures, on the other hand, also impact sleep.Epileptic patients demonstrate multiple sleep abnormalities, including anincreased sleep latency, fragmented sleep, increased awakenings and stageshifts, and an increase in stages 1 and 2 of nonrapid eye movement sleep.These disturbances may in turn be modulated by antiepileptic treatment. Thisreview summarizes the interactions between sleep and epilepsy, including thetiming of seizures during the sleep/wake cycle, the influence of sleep onvarious seizure disorders, the effects of sleep deprivation, and the changesin sleep patterns caused by seizures and theirtreatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases affecting the respiratory system are usually present during the day and the night; however, sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a disease manifesting only during sleep. It is defined as a cessation (apnea) or a reduction of breathing (hypopnea) of 10 seconds or more during sleep. Each of these apneas or hypopneas is usually terminated when the person awakens for a few seconds. Typically, patients do not remember these transient awakenings. There are two general categories of apnea: central and obstructive. These categories are classified according to the presence or the absence of respiratory effort. Central sleep apnea is a result of the absence of nerve impulses from the brain to the respiratory muscles and therefore occurs in absence of respiratory effort. Obstructive sleep apnea is much more common. This condition is caused by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway (pharynx) during sleep. Therefore, respiratory efforts are still present during apnea and usually increase throughout the apnea. The individual makes larger and larger respiratory efforts until they arouse from sleep apnea and reopen their upper airway so breathing can resume. As will be discussed, some overlap exists between obstructive and central apnea in both disease presentation (so‐called mixed apnea) and in pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors are considered to be manifestations of the same nosologic continuum. It has been proposed that a sudden arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is the cause of these disorders. Benign forms of NREM arousal parasomnias occur frequently in childhood and attenuate in teen years; however, they can persist into or begin in adulthood. The available literature documents high levels of psychopathology in adult patients. Sleepwalking and night terrors are most likely to manifest during the first episode of slow wave sleep, but may also appear any time during NREM sleep. The hypersynchronous delta activity, previously considered to be a hallmark of somnambulism, has proven to be unspecific. Post-arousal EEG activity reveals altered consciousness during sleepwalking and sleep terror episodes. Pathophysiology of NREM arousal parasomnias consists of predisposing factors, which may be a genetically determined tendency for deep sleep, facilitating factors which deepen sleep and increase slow wave sleep, and triggering factors which increase sleep fragmentation, such as stress, environmental or endogenous stimuli, and stimulants. Recently published data on low delta power in the first sleep cycle and slow decline of delta power in successive sleep cycles suggest a chronic inability to sustain slow wave sleep.",

      "abstract": "It has long been known that short-term (days) insufficient sleep causes decrements in mental effectiveness that put individuals at increased risk of committing errors and causing accidents. More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "abstract": "Key Clinical Message This study suggests that severe obstructive sleep apnea can present as sleep‐related epileptic or non‐epileptic seizures. A detailed history and physical examination, along with polysomnography and video electroencephalography findings can lead to the correct diagnosis. Abstract Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined by recurrent episodes of the upper airway complete or partial collapse while sleeping. The obstructive episodes result in gradual suffocation that increases breathing attempts till the person is awakened. The main manifestations are excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, observed episodes of stopped breathing, and abrupt awakenings accompanied by gasping or choking. Nevertheless, there are very few reports of patients with OSA, manifesting other symptoms such as seizure‐like movements. Differentiating OSA with nocturnal seizures could be challenging due to their overlapping features. A 53‐year‐old man presented to the clinic, experiencing seizure‐like involuntary movements during nocturnal sleep for the past 2 years with a frequency of 2–3 times per night. Neurologic examinations were normal. Further evaluation with polysomnography revealed impaired arousal followed by seizure‐like movements during sleep. Video electroencephalography (EEG) did not show any epileptiform discharges, ruling out the nocturnal seizure diagnosis. The patient was diagnosed with OSA. Subsequently, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment resolved all symptoms.",

Epilepsy is thus best considered a symptom of an underlying brain disorder. A single seizure is not usually considered sufficient to make a diagnosis of epilepsy. Epileptic seizures occurring solely in association with precipitants or triggering factors are termed acute symptomatic or situation-related seizures. Partial seizures arise from a localized region of cerebral cortex. The clinical manifestations of a partial seizure depend on where in the cortex it begins, and how fast and how far it spreads. Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner. Lip smacking or chewing movements, grimacing, undressing, the carrying out of purposeless activities or of aimless wandering may all occur on their own or in different combinations.",

      "abstract": "Complex visual hallucinations may affect some normal individuals on going to sleep and are also seen in pathological states, often in association with a sleep disturbance. The content of these hallucinations is striking and relatively stereotyped, often involving animals and human figures in bright colours and dramatic settings. Conditions causing these hallucinations include narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, peduncular hallucinosis, treated idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia without treatment, migraine coma, Charles Bonnet syndrome (visual hallucinations of the blind), schizophrenia, hallucinogen-induced states and epilepsy. We describe cases of hallucinosis due to several of these causes and expand on previous hypotheses to suggest three mechanisms underlying complex visual hallucinations. (i) Epileptic hallucinations are probably due to a direct irritative process acting on cortical centres integrating complex visual information. (ii) Visual pathway lesions cause defective visual input and may result in hallucinations from defective visual processing or an abnormal cortical release phenomenon. (iii) Brainstem lesions appear to affect ascending cholinergic and serotonergic pathways, and may also be implicated in Parkinson's disease. These brainstem abnormalities are often associated with disturbances of sleep. We discuss how these lesions, outside the primary visual system, may cause defective modulation of thalamocortical relationships leading to a release phenomenon. We suggest that perturbation of a distributed matrix may explain the production of similar, complex mental phenomena by relatively blunt insults at disparate sites.",

      "abstract": "This video teaching course presents several patterns of frontal lobe seizures recorded in a number of Italian Epilepsy Centers*. The general features of frontal lobe seizures are outlined in the introduction. Sixteen video-EEG sequences involving 10 different patients are shown. A short presentation of the clinical history precedes each case report. The electroclinical characteristics of seizures implicating the frontal lobe are extremely variable. According to the literature, general characteristics allowing differentiation between seizures of different topography include: appearance of seizures in clusters; seizures predominantly nocturnal or while the patient is falling asleep; short duration of each episode (approximately 30 s); abrupt onset and end; relatively short post-ictal phase, when present; frequent secondary generalization and falls; frequent subjective sensations, usually difficult to describe; impairment of consciousness is not a constant feature; episodes of status are frequent; differentiation from pseudo-seizures may prove to be difficult. When confirmation of the epileptic nature of paroxysmal phenomena is needed, video-EEG recordings may be of some help. Possible subjective manifestations are: cephalic and neuro-vegetative (even epigastric) manifestations, as well as pensee forcee, fear, olfactory hallucinations, non-lateralized visual disturbances. Motor manifestations include tonic, dystonic, postural, oculocephalic deviations and falls. Verbal and more often gestural automatisms can be complex, very brief and often violent, but elementary automatisms, such as automatic hand and mouth movements, or bimanual and pedaling movements, are also frequent. In this video teaching course, we first present seizures featuring minimal motor signs, followed by seizures with a more complex semiology. The most significant clinical and EEG features are discussed. (Published with videosequences.)",

      "title": "Depression: some proposals for future research.",
      "abstract": "The argument has been advanced that pathological states of anxiety and mania are both characterized by a failure on the part of the patient to attach appropriate levels of significance to changes occurring in the immediate environment. There is, it is suggested, a tendency for environmental features to be regarded as important even though, viewed objectively, they may have little relevance to the patient and his needs. Depression, it is further proposed, may be viewed as an extreme defense reaction to the intense anxiety which results from attaching too much significance to environmental events. In depressive state, patients are often characterised by their lowered responsiveness to stimulation and their lack of interest in, or concern about, their surroundings: it may be that, in such state, information processing has been blocked or reduced. The daytime drowsiness of the depressed patients, as well as his night-time sleep disturbance and the frequently observed recurrent or cyclic nature of certain kinds of depressed state, suggest that this blocking of sensory processing may be brought about by the involuntary intervention of mechanisms responsible, under normal circumstances, for sleep induction. This view of the nature of depression has been recast into the form of five potentially testable hypotheses. Speculation is always easy; providing convincing demonstrations that those speculations are reasonable is less easy. It is in the nature of psychological investigation that laboratory-based studies distort and may even destroy the phenomena about which information is sought, and many a perfectly reasonable theory has foundered upon the rocks of translation into experimental terms. In those areas of psychology which have implications for psychiatry and the conceptualisation of psychopathological states, this danger is particularly evident: psychiatric syndromes are complex, variable, and have social referrents, but laboratory experiments are limited in their capacity to reflect all these attributes, and consequently they may never provide really adequate tests of a theory about a psychiatric state. We have to try to come to terms with this apparent impasse--in the first place by being circumspect in translating psychiatric concepts into experimental terms, and secondly by exercising caution in interpreting the results to which the experiments give rise. More importantly, however, we have to accept the essential inadequacy of the majority of experimental paradigms in psychiatric research and to regard theorizing--even when it is not linked to explicitly testable hypotheses--as having inherent value.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in type one, cataplexy, often accompanied by disrupted nocturnal sleep, parasomnias, and other impairments. This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

      "title": "Mechanisms Producing Ventilatory Periodicities",
      "abstract": "Ventilation is disturbed in sleep even in healthy individuals. In rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) disburbances in ventilation are coupled to phasic events. In 10 normal subjects respiratory frequency was found to be positively correlated and rib cage motion was inversely correlated with eye movement density during REMS. Abdominal motion was little affected, and hence the adverse effects of phasic events on overall ventilation were limited. Ventilation during non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) is characterized by regular periodicities. 'Itro mechanisms are thought to be involved. First, instability of the chemical feedback system caused by high overall loop gain leads to ventilatory oscillations. Second, removal of the wakefulness stimulus leads to reductions in ventilation at sleep onset. It is likely that these two mechanisms interact to produce periodicities in ventilation during early stage 1-2 NREMS. Ventilation is commonly disturbed in sleep. This both occurs in normal individuals, and is particularly severe in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. The mechanisms underlying this are likely to be different in the different stages of sleep. In rapid eye-movement sleep, the disturbances are coupled to the phasic events that occur in this state. One method to measure these phasic events is by recording rapid eye-movements. We have developed a method to examine the interrelationship between ventilation and its components and eye-movements. This method is based on computing separately a running average of ventilation and its components and eye movement density (number of eye movements/second). The window length of the running average, the degree of overlap between adjacent windows and the delay (or lag) between the ventilation and eye movement measures is adjustable. The latter is to allow for asynchrony between the ventilatory changes and the occurrence of eye movements. We have found that a window length of",

Some disturbances of the circadian system are responsible for clinical syndromes characterized by chrono-fatigue, one of them being the sleep delayed phase insomnia. Circadian sleep disorders, either functional or structural, are characterized not only by disturbances in sleep architecture and/or sleep quality, but also by the inability to fall asleep and stay awake at desired times. Similarly, sleep and fatigue present in those circadian disorders typically exhibit a daily cyclic pattern. Night workers and shift workers do have chronic sleep deprivation and desynchronisation of their circadian system with the entraining environment. Those phenomena are responsible for severe vigilance problems, a decrease in work productivity and deleterious health side effects. Fatigue and sleep problems in circadian disorders can now benefit from treatments based on the programed use of synchronizers of the circadian clock, like chronotherapy, bright light and melatonin, combined with adequate sleep hygiene recommendations.",

The arousal disorders, common in children, are usually benign and disappear by puberty. Sleep-wake transition disorders such as sleep starts are benign as well, and may occur at any age. The parasomnias comprise different entities such as nightmares, REM-sleep behavior disorder, sleep enuresis, and bruxism. Diagnosis and treatment often require a multidisciplinary approach. Virtually every psychiatric, neurologic, or medical disease, when of sufficient severity, leaves its specific fingerprint on sleep; some disorders, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, or epilepsy, tend to be exacerbated during sleep.

Rhythmic body movements during sleep are commonly observed in infancy and early childhood, and spontaneous resolution is expected after the age of 4 years. Rarely, the body movements persist until adulthood. Rhythmic body movements characteristically occur during the wake-sleep transition period, rather than during other sleep stages. Some psychiatric diseases can co-occur with sleep-related movement disorders. A relationship between parasomnias and dissociative disorders has been recently reported. Herein we present a 33-year-old male with nocturnal repetitive rolling body movements and daytime fatigue. The patient also had loss of memory of some important events (such as the day his daughter underwent surgery), and reported that he sometimes confused reality with dreams had fantasies during which he experienced his spirit rising above to watch his body and fantasy. Detailed neuropsychological assessment showed that the patient also had a dissociative disorder.

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal (1 ) that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep (2, 3). During a sleepwalking episode, the individual seems confused, detached, and relatively unresponsive. Night terrors are more dramatic; patients manifest terror and panic, and there is extreme autonomic discharge and vocalization. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. A genetic component underlies these disorders in that patients often have a family history of sleepwalking, night terrors, or both (4). Sleepwalking and night terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually ‘ ‘outgrown’ ‘ by the end of adolescence, suggesting a delay in CNS maturation (5). When sleepwalking or night terrors have a postpubertal onset or continue into adulthood, however, psychopathology is a more significant causative factor (6, 7). These shared characteristics have led us to propose that sleepwalking and night terrors have a common etiology and are part of the same pathophysiologic spectrum (8). In this paper. we report on febrile illness as a precipitating factor for the onset of sleepwalking or night terrors. To our knowledge. this is the first report establishing this relationship. We have evaluated five children or adolescents who began to sleepwalk or to experience night terrors during or immediately after a febrile illness. The following three case reports illustrate our observations of this phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

Although the association between sleep restriction and memory disorders is well known, there is insufficient information regarding alterations in executive functions, specifically those of social cognition in subjects with sleep restriction.

A less frequently reported symptom is oscillopsia, an illusion of movement of stationary objects, when enquiries need to be made whether the movement is horizontal or vertical, and does it become maximally apparent in certain positions of gaze, as for example in downbeat nystagmus when the oscillopsia is maximal on down gaze.

      "abstract": "Depression and Anxiety Disorder in Children and AdolescentsDepression and anxiety are common in children and indicate a problem with mood or anxiety processing.Everyone has moods and fears.Some people have intense moods or feelings that interfere with their lives in their family, with peers, at school, and in play.Importantly, both depression and anxiety disorders can be treated.Depression is mostly a problem of moods.Sadness or irritability are the core symptoms, and thinking, sleeping, eating, and energy are also affected.Anxiety disorders are difficulties with worries or fears that make it hard for a child to participate in their day-to-day life.Extreme fears can focus on specific types of situations, such as social situations or being away from parents, or can be generalized about almost anything.Anxiety can also include panic attacks with rapid heartbeat or trouble breathing.Depression and anxiety can cause difficulties with sleeping, thinking, or managing frustration.It is common for anxiety or depression to first be noticed with disruptive behaviors such as trouble with rules, talking back, or tantrums.Depression and anxiety disorders can develop in children at any age, from preschool through adolescence.A combination of life experiences, inherited genes, and other factors influence who develops anxiety or depression and when.While depression and anxiety are more likely to develop in stressful situations or run in families, both can develop any time and in anyone.During the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of anxiety and depression have doubled, with depression rising to 1 in 4 children and youth and problematic anxiety to 1 in 5. Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

      "abstract": "Amnesia is the name given to disorders of memory. Amnesia normally involves severe forgetfulness which goes beyond the everyday forgetting observed in normal people, to the extent that it may interfere with the activities of normal life. We are all prone to moments of forgetfulness, but most people with intact cognitive functioning can remember quite a lot about the events in their lives, especially their most recent experiences and events which are important to them. However, a person suffering from amnesia may be quite unable to remember any recent events in their lives, even the most important ones. You can probably recall quite easily where you were five minutes ago, or the person you just chatted with, or even what you did yesterday evening. Many amnesics would be unable to remember these simple things, and may have no idea of what they have done with their day so far. In severe cases they may be quite unable to commit any new experiences to memory, and this can be very disruptive to their lives. Without an intact memory it can become impossible to keep a job, to keep up relationships with family and friends, or even to look after oneself and maintain an independent existence. In fact it is clear from the study of severely amnesic patients that memory is quite crucial to our ability to function properly as human beings. Amnesia is a very disruptive and distressing condition. However, it is also a disorder from which a great deal can be learned about the nature of memory function.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.\n\nLike seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.\n\nSeizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.\n\nBHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, …",

      "title": "Insomnia: Causes and Diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep problem affecting nearly one-third of the population as either a primary or comorbid condition. Insomnia has been defined as both a symptom and a disorder, and is characterized as sleep that is chronically unrestorative or poor in quality often due to difficulty in initiating sleep, in maintaining sleep, or with waking up too early. Insomnia results in some form of daytime impairment in the patient's normal activites. Although the exact pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood, it is often believed to arise from a state of hyperarousal in multiple neurophysiological and/or psychological systems. Population-based studies suggest that while about one-third of the general population complains of sleep disturbance, only 10-15 percent has associated symptoms of daytime functional impairment, and even fewer, only 6-10 percent have impairments sufficient for the diagnostic criteria of insomnia. The cornerstone of the insomnia evaluation and diagnosis is a comprehensive history obtained by the clinical interview with patient and/or family. Additional assessment tools, such as sleep diary or log, various questionnaires, actigraphy, and multichannel polysomnography (PSG) have been used as an aid to diagnosis, although many are limited in their validation. Insomnia causes a significant burden of medical, psychiatric, societal consequences on the individual and societal level. Clinicians in either primary settings or specialized clinics should have knowledge to manage insomnia with confidence.",

      "title": "Electroencephalographic characteristics of Dravet syndrome",
      "abstract": "Summary In Dravet syndrome, interictal and ictal electroencephalography (EEG) recording may remain misleading, and are not specifically altered. Moreover, there is a great polymorphism of clinical and EEG seizure types. Some can be observed in other epileptic syndromes, but others are more specific—particularly the peculiar unilateral seizures, the falsely generalized seizures, probably with a focal onset, and the unstable seizures. In some cases, the ictal manifestations are characterized by the persistent predominant recurrence of convulsive seizures, often induced by body temperature increase, eventually associated with partial complex seizures. The myoclonic events, absences with myoclonic component, obtundation status, and photosensitivity and/or pattern sensitivity are absent or appear relatively late and recur transiently for short periods. In these cases interictal EEG is characterized by the persistent paucity of paroxysmal discharges. In other cases, on a background of convulsive seizures and body temperature sensitivity, one may find a variable association of (1) myoclonic seizures of different types, (2) a strong sensitivity to light and pattern stimulations, with early onset and persistent in time. In these cases, interictal paroxysms and spontaneous and induced (intermittent photic stimulation, patterns, and eye closure) stimulation tend to appear early and to be frequent and persistent during the evolution. According to these electroclinical patterns it is possible to divide the population into two subsets, both sharing common genetic mechanisms but with a different clinical outcome.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that involves impairment in three broad areas as identified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition [1]: socialization, communication, and repetitive or restricted behaviors and interests. With regard to socialization, individuals with autism may show limited use of nonverbal behaviors, such as eye contact or facial expressions directed to others. They may demonstrate limited social and emotional reciprocity, may not seek to share their enjoyment of activities and interests with others, and often fail to develop appropriate peer relationships. In the area of communication, individuals with autism may have a significant language delay and have difficulties with symbolic play. Those individuals with strong verbal skills still tend to have communication impairments, including difficulty with reciprocal conversation, and use of unusual or repetitive language. Finally, in the area of restricted and repetitive behaviors, individuals with autism may show a preoccupation with parts of objects (e.g. repeatedly spinning the wheel of a toy car), or an intense preoccupation with an unusual topic of interest (e.g. radiators, train schedules). In some individuals, these areas of interest become almost all-consuming, such that it is difficult for them to relate to others without bringing up their preoccupation. Individuals with autism often show a need for routine and predictability, and may exhibit ritualistic behavior or become upset by disruptions in their usual routine. Finally, some individuals with autism exhibit repetitive movements, such as hand-flapping or body-rocking.",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Millions of patients are afflicted by a variety of sleep disorders. Sleep can be measured electrophysiologically and described in terms of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with REM sleep being dream sleep. Overall, sleep is a cyclic phenomenon, showing a 90-minute periodicity. Sleep disorders are divided into four groups: disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, disorders of excessive somnolence, disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and the parasomnias. The parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep terror, and nightmares. The classic disorders of excessive somnolence include obstructive sleep apnea (an impairment of respiratory function during sleep) and narcolepsy (a genetically transmitted dysregulation of REM sleep). Insomnia may be either transient (eg, associated with jet lag, work shift change, or a disturbing or exciting situation) or chronic (eg, associated with psychiatric disorders or periodic leg movements during sleep). Hypnotics are generally reserved for the treatment of transient or short-term insomnias. Although a number of hypnotics are available, the benzodiazepines are currently accepted as the drugs of choice; selection within the group is based primarily on differences in pharmacokinetic profiles. The practicing pharmacist has the opportunity to play an important role in assessing, recommending treatment, or recommending further evaluation for the many patients who present with insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness.",

      "title": "Factors Affecting Sleep and Wakefulness in People with Epilepsy: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "The importance of sleep has been reported for decades. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder comprising multiple elements that might influence sleep and wakefulness. Notably, animal studies show disruptions of the circadian molecular system in different models of epilepsy, along with altered rest-activity and other circadian rhythms. So far, studies of molecular circadian systems in people with epilepsy are lacking, prompting further research. Seizures-the primary and most debilitating symptom of epilepsy-and interictal activity disrupt regular sleep and sleep-wake rhythms. Alterations in one's sleep structure are seen in both drug-naïve and drug-resistant patients with epilepsy. In particular, low sleep efficiency, a reduction in total sleep time, and changes in sleep stages were found in both homogenous and mixed samples of epilepsy patients. Both ictal and interictal activity were also shown to be associated with changes in peripheral circadian phase biomarkers such as melatonin and cortisol. Moreover, epilepsy comorbidities, antiseizure medications, and a variety of syndromes can be a cause of sleep problems or even sleep disorders. Sleep disorders vary depending on various comorbidities and syndromes, and encompass all major groups of sleep disorders defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Controversial findings on the effects of various antiseizure medications were found in the literature. However, medications such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and barbiturates are particularly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Overall, a sleep evaluation must be included in the management of every patient with epilepsy.",

      "title": "Postcardiotomy Delirium: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

      "title": "0978 I Cannot Stay Still - A Case of Sleep-Related Rhythmic Movement Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder (SRRMD) is characterized by repetitive rhythmic motor behaviors involving large muscle groups that occur predominantly during stage N1 sleep. SSRMs are common in infants and children but they usually spontaneously resolve before adolescence. This case presents a rare adult case of SRRMD. Report of case(s) A 60-year-old man initially presents to clinic for evaluation of repetitive movements needed to initiate sleep. Patient reports the problem starting in his childhood, where he needs to rock and roll intentionally in bed to fall asleep. He had been prescribed clonazepam 2mg and had been taking this along with doxylamine and melatonin nightly, but still reports frequent nocturnal awakenings due to body rolling. He specifically denies any hypnic kicking/jerking, or discomfort in legs while falling asleep. Patient has no excessive alcohol consumption, marijuana, or illicit drug use. Differentials for the patient’s condition include hyperarousal, chronic anxiety, iron deficiency, sleep-related breathing disorder, and rhythmic movement disorder. Patient consequently underwent an in-lab diagnostic polysomnography study which showed no evidence of sleep-related breathing disorders with AHI of 1.6 (AASM 3%). Sleep efficiency was low at 60.8% and sleep architecture showed decreased REM sleep and decreased N3 sleep. Rhythmic movements were noted during sleep and it was manifested by excessive transient muscle activity in both limb &amp; chin EMG leads and also whole body rocking in the video recording. Moderate periodic limb movements were noted with PLM index to 17. Patient was seen in clinic 6 months later with persistent symptoms and his dose of clonazepam was increased slowly to 2.5 mg and then 3 mg. On the 3 mg of clonazepam, patient had resolution of symptoms. Conclusion Our case describes a patient who had SRRMs that commenced in childhood persisting well into adulthood. Reported adult cases of SRRMD are few, and have been associated with sleep apnea, REM sleep behavior disorder, and RLS, while many remain idiopathic such as the case with this patient. While benzodiazepines are still first line for SRRMD, further work up and investigation into possible comorbid conditions could yield insight into the etiology and offer alternative treatment options to patients.

      "abstract": "All memory disturbances, especially those developing suddenly, cause anxiety of the patient. Transient global amnesia is a form of amnesia of interest in many aspects. The amnesia was described in 1964 by Fisher and Adams, and as yet about 1000 cases have been reported. Middle aged or elderly patients prevail. The attack of amnesia lasts from several to about 20 hours and begins suddenly being regarded as mental confusion. The amnesia covers recent and remote events in many years. During the attack the patient is not appearing to be ill, but is depressed not knowing what has happened. The awareness of own personality, the ability to solve logical problems and visuospatial functions are preserved. The ability to execute complex activities, e.g. car driving, is normal. The aetiology of the disorder is completely unknown. The hypotheses for explaining the syndrome are: 1. ischaemia in the posterior cerebral arteries region with transient fall of blood supply through the vertebrobasilar system, 2. epilepsy or migraine, 3. disturbed aggregation of platelets in the cerebral vessels leading to loss of vessel patency. The first hypothesis seems least plausible. Attacks of this amnesia were noted after triazolam, after thalamic infarction and cerebral angiography, in brain tumours, hydrocephalus, scleroderma, frontal lobe haemorrhage. After an attack the events occurring in it are not remembered. Recurrence of attacks is very rare. Most authors consider that the disorder is benign and regresses without sequelae or only with slight changes in cognitive functions and memory fixation.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Narcolepsy is a central disorder of hypersomnia with a bimodal peak incidence at ages 15 and 35. Onset in early childhood has been reported, but rarely under the age of 5. We present a case of Narcolepsy Type 1 in a 2.5-year-old with dropping spells. Report of case(s) A 2.5-year-old African American healthy male presented with acute onset sudden drops, unsteady gait, and staring spells. These episodes lasted a few seconds, occurred multiple times a day, and were associated with eye fluttering and dysarthric speech. History was notable for increased daytime sleep/sleep attacks, disrupted nocturnal sleep with confusional arousals, nightmares and sleepwalking, weight gain and mood instability with aggressive behavior. No preceding head injury or illness. Physical examination demonstrated frequent atonic episodes with loss of deep tendon reflexes. A clinical suspicion of myoclonic/atonic epilepsy prompted video- electroencephalogram (EEG) which showed frequent bursts of generalized intermittent slowing representative of NREM 1 sleep lasting several seconds. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and infectious workup was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Orexin was &amp;lt;50 pg/mL. While 76–98% of patients with narcolepsy type-1 have HLADQB1*06:02, our patient tested negative. Due to lack of MSLT validity at this age, only diagnostic PSG was performed which showed REM without atonia and sleep fragmentation. Prior to sleep onset, cataplexy was observed in the patient while laughing, though EMG tone was relatively preserved during this episode. We had limited treatment options considering lack of FDA approved medications for ages less than 7. A helmet was prescribed to prevent head injury. Methylphenidate 5mg/day improved sleepiness and slightly stabilized mood. For cataplexy, neither Fluoxetine nor Imipramine helped. His mother disapproved further medication trials. Continuing methylphenidate, the family was referred to behavior psychology for support, coping with the diagnosis and behavioral changes. Conclusion This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of Narcolepsy Type 1 in a toddler initially thought to have epilepsy. Video-EEG and low CSF orexin led to the diagnosis. His age, severity of cataplexy, mood changes, and parental concerns made treatment challenging. Furthermore, this case highlights the importance of early recognition of Narcolepsy in young children to provide appropriate treatment during critical developmental stages. Support (if any):",

      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

Primary insomniacs have a good response to hypnotics, but feel out of control if they use them continuously. Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful. A hypnotic can be prescribed for use every third night during this regimen - zolpidem and zopiclone are preferred. Referral to a sleep specialist may be necessary if this approach does not work.",

Many case histories are lacking in clear description of historical facts, conduct disorders, stream of speech, etc. 3. Undiagnosed cases should be followed up most carefully. The average hurried and perfunctory note is only a little better than no note at all. 4. Conclusions without a statement of facts are misleading. Terms such as rambling, confused and violent should be used very cautiously in the primary case record. 5. Undiagnosed cases should be represented as often as new facts discovered will warrant. 6. In a considerable percentage of undiagnosed cases, disagreement and hesitation upon the part of the staff indicate, though oftentimes unwittingly, a good prognosis. 7. Confusion and apprehension in an acute psychosis would seem to indicate dementia præcox more often than any other disorder. 8. The absence of definite hallucinosis in a case otherwise doubtful contributes to failure in classification. 9. There are depressions of psychogenic origin that are not manic-depressive in nature and these types often occur between the ages of 40 and 60 with recovery. 10. The senile-presenile state is uncertain ground. A return should be made to the Kraepelinian presenile grouping. 11.

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are abnormal behavioral or physiological events that intrude into the sleep process disrupting its continuity. Parasomnia associated to REM sleep include REM sleep behavior disorder, nightmare disorders, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (SP), and sleep-related painful erections. The quality of life of patients suffering from parasomnias may vary according to the disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder patients experience recurrent vivid and violent dreams and frequent sleep-related injuries for themselves or bed partners, with possible impacts on personal, couple, and social life. Despite the possible awakening from REM sleep, sleep architecture is usually preserved in RBD. Idiopathic RBD may often precede a neurodegenerative disease, and its diagnosis might imply a psychological burden for patients and their family. The increased risk for neurodegenerative illnesses poses the ethical dilemma whether the patient should or should not be told about, especially in view of the current lack of effective neuroprotective strategies and the lack of knowledge about the precise extent of this risk. Nightmares are intensely disturbing dreams involving a variety of dysphoric emotions, most often fear and anxiety. Nightmares have been correlated to various measures of psychopathology, namely neuroticism, anxiety, depression, but not all studies support this relationship. Personality factors, such as nightmare frequency, nightmare distress (ND), and coping style, appear to be important in modulating the clinical severity of nightmare disorder. Parasomnias, especially nightmare and SP, can lead to postawakening anxiety with difficulty returning to sleep, sleep avoidance, and sleep deprivation, with subsequent insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and intensification of the parasomnia REM-rebound related.",

      "abstract": "Sleep in dementias has been mainly studied in Alzheimer disease (AD). Sleep disturbances are found in 25 to 35% of subjects with AD. Subjective and objective disturbances are described. Long nocturnal awakenings disrupt sleep; total sleep time and sleep efficiency are reduced. Slow wave sleep is decreased and sometimes disappears. REM sleep percentage is also reduced and at a later stage of the disease, REM latency is increased. Sleep fragmentation can be associated with excessive daytime napping and sleepiness, and with other behavioral symptoms such as the sundowning syndrome and nocturnal agitation. Sleep abnormalities closely parallel the level of severity of dementia. The rest/activity ratio and the sleep-wake rhythms are more and more disturbed; the phase delay of the temperature rhythm is associated with the severity of the sundowning syndrome. Sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms are the main reasons to institutionalize the patient. Sleep disturbances are related to multiple factors. Pathophysiological changes resulting of the disease itself, such as damage to the cholinergic pathways and to the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contribute to sleep changes in AD. Associated medical and psychiatric illness and their different treatments as well as environmental factors also induced sleep disturbances. Sleep-disordered breathing is a highly prevalent condition in AD patients and restless leg syndrome may account for nocturnal agitation. In Parkinson and in Lewy body dementias, sleep disturbances are more severe than in DA and REM sleep behavior disorder can precede by several years these diseases. Sleep attacks and sleepiness are very frequent in Parkinson disease. Specific etiologies should drive specific treatment. Several non pharmacologic treatments are usually associated to treat sleep disturbances in AD: information, increased daytime physical, social activities to minimize daytime naps and exposure to bright light. Some studies found advantages to associate melatonin in the evening.",

In primary insomnia, the term insomnia constitutes a diagnostic entity. In other disorders it is considered a symptom and not a primary diagnosis. Insomnia is frequently a component of the symptom complexes of other primary sleep disorders, and is listed among the diagnostic criteria for the following dyssomnias: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, central sleep apnea syndrome, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and restless legs syndrome (RLS). Disrupted sleep is among the diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy. The complaint of insomnia can also accompany parasomnias, and is listed among the diagnostic criteria for sleep starts and nightmares (1). As in other forms of insomnia, in order to be considered a clinically significant problem, the complaint of sleep disturbance must be associated with adverse daytime consequences such as fatigue, decreased concentration, or irritability.",

      "abstract": "Concussions are caused by a physical blow or jolt to the head resulting in either forces applied directly to the head (eg, a pitcher being struck by a batted ball) or movement of the brain within the skull (eg, anterioreposterior deceleration or rotational forces experienced in motor vehicle crash). Such forces disrupt normal cellular processes in the brain. Concussions are seen in all age, gender and ethnic groups but, because they are commonly sustained during sports and recreational activities, they have frequently been described in children. The estimated incidence of sports-related concussions in the USA ranges from 300000 to 3.8 million annually. 2 Estimating incidence is difficult because sports-related concussions frequently go undetected due to a lack of recognition of symptoms or intentional underreporting of symptoms. 34 Symptoms include physical complaints (eg, headache, fatigue, dizziness, noise intolerance), behavioural changes (eg, mood swings, depression, anxiety, irritability) and cognitive impairment (eg, inability to concentrate, decreased memory). While initial symptoms typically resolve in several days to occasionally several months after the injury, 5e8 in 10e15% these symptoms can persist much longer. Because of the heterogeneity of these injuries and their recovery, as well as the recognition that the length of time until symptoms resolve is more important clinically than the type of symptoms, grading scales and classification schemes have been abandoned. Of primary concern is determining when it is safe for the concussed patient to return to normal activities. Such activities mayincludemorephysicallystrenuousgameplayforathletes,but also simply the cognitive exercise of classwork for students or work for adults. Currently accepted guidelines indicate that return should not occur until the concussed patient can accomplish a stepwise progression of increased activity while remaining symptom free. 9 The risks of premature return to activities has",

Under all specified conditions, intensive audiogenic clonic or clonic-tonic convulsions caused long-lasting and pronounced sleep disorders in rats associated with disorganization of the mechanisms of starting the fast-wave sleep phase in the first place. But after experimental deprivations of sleep the audiogenic paroxysmal seizures run only as initial motor excitement without obvious convulsions. Such sort of seizures promote a faster beginning of recovery process after deprivations and did not cause any disorganization of the function of the brain systems responsible for starting and shaping (maintenance) fast-wave sleep.",

      "title": "REM sleep and emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a period of relaxation and repair. During sleep, waste products of brain metabolism are removed. It plays central role in maintenance of physiological homeostasis and psychological balance. Sufficient sleep helps us think more clearly, complete complex tasks better and more consistently. One of the important function of sleep is to promote synaptic plasticity and neuronal recovery for proper brain functioning. Memory consolidation, brain growth and repair are other functions proposed for sleep. Problems related to sleep deprivation are being increased in today's modern society. Every day there seems to be twice as much work and half as much time to complete it, this results in a decrease in sleep or extended periods of wakefulness. Sleep deprived individuals may not have difficulty of verbal disturbances but research studies have shown that individuals have more difficulty in reacting well, to taking biological discussion and implementing the task with efficiency of action. Although day time performance due to sleep loss is experienced universally but in professionals such as paramilitary forces, army personals, who work under stressful conditions are more vulnerable to the sleep deprivation. These conditions become more stressful during emergencies and war because, after periods of extended wakefulness neurons may begin to malfunction, visibly affecting person's behavior. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep plays a role in learning due to an activation of the hippocampus involved in encoding new memories. Many experiments have shown that the day after a good night's sleep, one may retain newly acquired knowledge or a newly learned skill more effectively. An enriched environment (EE) which is a complex combination of social, cognitive, and physical stimulation, improves learning and memory. Many changes such as increased brain weight, synaptic plasticity, gliogenesis, growth of dendritic spine as well as change in neurotransmitter content, up regulation of neuronal signaling molecules, neurotrophin levels and adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been reported.",

Acute symptomatic seizures differ from epilepsy in several\r\nimportant aspects. First, unlike epilepsy, these seizures have a clearly\r\nidentifiable proximate cause, to the extent that one can never be certain of\r\na causal association. When one considers the temporal sequence of acute\r\nsymptomatic seizures (e.g.uremia, head injury, or stroke immediately\r\npreceding a seizure), the biologic plausibility (acute disruption of brain\r\nintegrity or metabolic homeostasis) and in many cases the dose effect\r\n(severity of injury correlated with the risk for seizures) all quite\r\ncompellingly indicate causation. Although a risk ratio for the immediate\r\nassociation between cause and effect has not been calculated, it must be\r\nenormous. Second, unlike epilepsy, acute symptomatic seizures are not\r\ncharacterized by a tendency to recur. The risk for subsequent epilepsy may\r\nbe increased in individuals experiencing such insults; in general, one does\r\nnot expect seizures to recur unless the underlying condition recurs. \r\nThe maximum incidence of seizures occurred in the age group of 60\r\nto 70 years in the study.\r\nCerebrovascular disease was the most common etiology observed in\r\nour study. Among cerebrovascular disease, ischemic cerebral\r\ninfarction was the most common cause. Central nervous system\r\ninfections, was the second most common cause followed by\r\nmetabolic causes in our study. So all efforts should be taken to\r\nevaluate the patients who presented with seizures in the elderly\r\npatients to identify the etiology, for accurate management.\r\nPartial seizures was the most common seizure type encountered in\r\nthe study.\r\nImmediate non contrast CT brain was useful, for emergency\r\npatients, presenting with seizures to guide appropriate acute\r\nmanagement.

From the moment clinicians first see patients, they quite naturally notice many things about their motor behavior: body posture, degree of muscle tension, amount of fidgeting or pacing and facial expression. The muscles of the eye and face are innervated by cranial nerves that originate in the brain. Consequently, disturbances in facial or eye muscle functioning provide crucial clues about whether individua's difficulties originate in the nervous system outside the brain or within brain. Neurological soft signs are subtle, lifelong abnormalities in motor and sensory functioning that are likely caused by imperfect embryonic development or minor, early brain injury. “Automatic behavior” refers to rote movement behaviors that are carried out by individuals in an altered state of consciousness.

Approximately 20% of employed adults in the United States are engaged in shift work. Shift work sleep disorder is diagnosed if there is a report of insomnia or excessive sleepiness for at least 3 months associated with a recurring work schedule that overlaps the usual time for sleep. Shift work is associated with an increased occurrence of metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, and it has been implicated in weight gain and cognitive impairment. There is evidence of increased absenteeism in night workers compared with day workers. A planned sleep schedule, timed bright light exposure, timed melatonin administration, and stimulants or drugs promoting alertness can be used to manage shift work sleep disorder. Jet lag is characterized by a misalignment between internal circadian rhythms and local time caused by rapid travel across at least two time zones. Not all travelers experience jet lag; risk factors include age, number of time zones crossed, and circadian preference. Management includes timed melatonin along with optional timed and dosed bright light exposure.",

      "abstract": "Detailed history taking is of paramount importance to establish a reliable diagnosis in patients with transient loss of consciousness. In this article the clinical symptoms and signs of the successive phases of a syncopal episode are reviewed. A failure of the systemic circulation to perfuse the brain sufficiently results in a stereotyped progression of neurological symptoms and signs culminating in loss of consciousness; when transient, this is syncope. Prior to loss of consciousness the affected individual tends to exhibit unclear thinking, followed by fixation of the eyes in the midline and a 'frozen' appearance. Narrowing of the field of vision with loss of colour vision ('greying' out) and finally a complete loss of vision (hence 'blacking' out) occurs. Hearing loss may occur following loss of vision. This process may take as little as approximately 7 s in cases of sudden complete circulatory arrest (e.g. abrupt asystole), but in other circumstances it may take longer depending on the rate and depth of cerebral hypoperfusion. Complete loss of consciousness occurs with the 'turning up' of the eyeballs. Profound cerebral hypoperfusion may be accompanied by myoclonic jerks.",

      "abstract": "Sleep starts, also known as hypnic or hypnagogic jerks, are a physiological accompaniment to falling asleep [1]. They are brief body jerks mainly bilateral and sometimes asymmetric. When sleep starts are excessive, they are considered a parasomnia and included in the category of sleep-wake transition parasomnias by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders [2]. They can cause frequent awakenings and sleep onset difficulty. The syndrome was first described by S Weir Mitchell [3]. This peculiar type of event consists of a massive myoclonic jerk in which the main muscles involved are the axial ones. Sleep starts can be accompanied by a dream, or the impression of falling. Epileptic seizures and parasomnias are the two major groups of sleep-related paroxysmal disorders in childhood. Epileptic seizures are usually characterized by random occurrence, stereotyped behavior, brief duration, and hypertonus or clonic jerks [4]. The pathogenesis of sleep starts is unknown. However, they involve partial activation of the central nervous system producing skeletal muscle activity. This could arise as a consequence of a synchronous volleys of pyramidal tract activity arising during the transition from wakefulness to sleep [5]. However, the involvement of axial muscles, the possible reflex origin, and",

Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

The condition occurs in otherwise normal children, mainly boys, and usually during the second or more rarely the third month of life. In all cases described the preganancy and delivery was normal. The attacks consist of tonic contractions predominantly of the limbs provoked by shaking, tactile stimulation or sudden postural changes, whether involving forward, upward or downward movements obviously, such stimuli occur during normal childcare. Upright rhythmical movements appear to be particularly likely to provoke attacks and some mothers are aware of the likely occurrence of the attacks if they descend stairs while holding their child in a vertical position. The attacks themselves consist of a sudden sustained diffuse tonic contraction with extension and abduction of all four limbs,although most noticeable in the upper limbs. This is accompanied by apnea and cyanosis but no impairment of consciousness. Attacks usually last between 3 to 10 sec and are usually followed by a brief cry. They may be repeated if the stimulus is repeated the phenomenon",

Patients with acute or chronic pain often complain of difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, shorter sleep duration, unrefreshing sleep, and poor sleep quality in general. According to the majority of the experimental human studies, sleep deprivation may produce hyperalgesic changes. The selective disruption of slow wave sleep has shown this effect more consistently, while results after selective REM sleep deprivation remain unclear. Patients with chronic pain have a marked alteration of sleep structure and continuity, such as frequent sleep-stage shifts, increased nocturnal awakenings, decreased slow wave sleep (SWS), decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and alpha-delta sleep. Many analgesic medications can alter sleep architecture in a manner similar to the effects of acute and chronic pain, suppressing SWS and REM sleep.",

Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable.

      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that presents significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by the following: (1) Social communication difficulties: challenges in understanding and responding to social cues, initiating and maintaining conversations, and developing and maintaining relationships. (2) Repetitive behaviors: engaging in repetitive actions, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or lining up objects. (3) Restricted interests: focusing intensely on specific topics or activities, often to the exclusion of other interests. (4) Sensory sensitivities: over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, such as sounds, touch, tastes, smells, or sights. These challenges can significantly impact individuals' daily lives and require specialized support and interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked (≥2) seizures that occur >24 h apart. Single seizures are not considered epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is often idiopathic, but various brain disorders, such as malformations, strokes, and tumors, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. While these two conditions were once considered distinct, growing evidence suggests a substantial overlap in their underlying neurobiology. The prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with ASD is significantly higher than in the general population. This review will explore the epidemiology of this comorbidity, delve into the potential mechanisms linking ASD and epilepsy, and discuss the implications for diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In previously conscious patients seizures are usually easily detected. Critically-ill patients are frequently sedated and a proportion are paralysed with neuromuscular blocking agents, in such patients it may be hard or impossible to detect seizures clinically. An urgent electroencephalogram (EEG) should be obtained whenever seizures are witness or suspected, especially if the patient does not rapidly return to baseline, when non-convulsive status epilepticus must be excluded. Unless the cause of the seizure activity is already known, an urgent CT, or MRI is indicated. If central nervous system infection is suspected a lumbar puncture may be needed. Status epilepticus is diagnosed when there is recurrent or continued seizure activity without intervening recovery. Most seizures are self-limiting and stop after 1–2 minutes, seizures that continue for more than 5 minutes should be treated. Treatment priorities for any seizure are to stop the patient hurting either themselves or anyone else. General supportive measures include attention to the airway, breathing, circulation, exclusion of hypoglycaemia and an EEG to exclude non-convulsive status epilepticus. A variety of drugs can be used to terminate seizures; parenteral benzodiazepines are the most commonly used agents although propofol and barbiturates are alternatives. Emergent endotracheal intubation may well be necessary, hypotension can be expected and may need treatment with intravenous fluids and vasopressors.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias, as described in the recent second edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, are “undesirable physical events or experiences” occurring during sleep transition, during arousal from sleep, or within the sleep period. These events encompass abnormal sleep related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Parasomnias are classified as: 1) disorders of arousal (from non-rapid eye movement, or NREM, sleep); 2) parasomnias usually associated with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep; and 3) other parasomnias. This sleep disorders in childhood are common, and often more frequent than in adults. Clinicians should be aware that many pediatric parasomnias have benign and self-limited nature. Most of the parasomnias may not persist into late childhood or adolescence. Parasomnias in adults often differ in type from childhood parasomnias and may portend significant psychiatric disturbances or neurodegenerative disorders. A reliable diagnosis can often be made from a detailed history from the patient and, if possible, the parents or bed partner. Detailed overnight investigations of parasomnias are usually not required. The non-REM parasomnias are more common in community although REM parasomnias are more likely to be",

Insomnia is associated with a disturbance in one or more of the three systems that regulate sleep: homeostatic, circadian and arousal. A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues. A number of treatment methods have been developed that use behavior modification and cognitive restructuring to facilitate homeostatic and circadian mechanisms of sleep, and to reduce arousal during bedtime. These methods actively engage the patient to implement life style changes, attitudes and beliefs that promote sleep.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

Its diagnosis is purely clinical and rests on the sudden occurrence of retention amnesia associated with retrograde amnesia without disturbances in speech or other neurological deficits. The amnesia totally regresses within less than 24 hours. Paraclinical examinations add nothing to the diagnosis. The cause of transient global amnesia is unknown, and the various hypotheses that have been put forward (e.g. epilepsy, transient ischaemia or migraine) have not been confirmed by clinical and epidemiological studies. Despite a low, but real risk of recurrence, the prognosis is perfectly benign, and there is no need for curative or preventive treatment.",

The misalignment between the internal circadian timing system and the external environment is typically due to either an alteration in the functioning of the circadian timing system (e.g., delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome) or to changes in the external environment (e.g., jet lag). However, the clinical presentation of most of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is influenced by a combination of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. These disorders lead to complaints of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with impairment in important areas of functioning and quality of life. Current treatments primarily involve the use of circadian synchronizing agents, such as light, to realign the internal and external environment. These treatments are limited by the availability of adequate diagnostic tools and well-controlled clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders is required to develop more effective treatments.",

REM sleep also is referred to as paradoxical sleep, because the brain paradoxically seems to be in an activated state that is similar to, but not identical to, the waking state. REM sleep is characterized by an activated electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (low‐voltage, fast‐frequency brain waves), muscular paralysis (with the exception of diaphragmatic and ocular muscles), periodic bursts of rapid eye movements, and autonomic nervous system instability (e.g., variable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration).

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam.

States of agitation are mainly due to simple or pathological inebriety. Any case of acute alcoholic intoxication requires a full clinical examination and a simple laboratory work-up. Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states. States of anxiety generally regress with non-neuroleptic tranquilizers, and attempted suicide mainly requires close surveillance or intensive care.",

The brief-lasting out-of-character homicidal episode with flat affect is typically associated with first-time formed or unformed hallucinations of various modalities and with overactivation of the autonomic nervous system.

The boundaries between waking and REM sleep become blurred resulting in REM phenomena in wakefulness and features of wakefulness during sleep. Narcolepsy is not rare, with a prevalence of 25–50/100,000 in Western Europe, however many individuals remain undiagnosed for many years after the onset of symptoms [1]. One third of adults with narcolepsy describe their first symptoms appearing before the age of 15 and there is a clear peak of onset in the teenage years [2]. The classic narcolepsy tetrad comprised excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotion, most frequently laughter), sleep paralysis and hypnagogic (on falling asleep) and hypnopompic (on waking) hallucinations. Disturbed nighttime sleep was often added to make up a pentad. These symptoms apart from excessive daytime sleep and cataplexy are not uncommon in unaffected individuals and other sleep disorders. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders defines narcolepsy without cataplexy as excessive daytime sleepiness and multiple sleep onset REM periods on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) [3].

An excessive focus on diagnostic criteria for bipolar or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders risks missing this particular set of patients; defined through their dynamic presentation as much as by any cluster of symptoms or types of course. Objectives To explore the concept and relevance of oneroid-like cyclic psychosis through a clinical case and review. Methods We report the case of a 37 year old woman with bipolar disorder (three previous instances of manic episodes with psychotic symptoms) and various gynecological issues that required hormone therapy. After a couple of days having difficulty sleeping, the patient developed a clinical picture consisting of wide and sudden oscillations between hyperactive and inhibited psychomotor activity, moods of dread and ecstasy, and states of disorganized thought and childlike activities with perplexity and mutism. Frequent behaviors as if experiencing visual alucinations and repeated allusions to feeling as if in a dream. These symptoms lasted for 2-3 weeks, after treatment with risperidone and lithium. A narrative review concerning the case was also performed. Results Kleist’s ‘innate instability’ permeates much of the previous literature. Similar entities highlight different issues closely related to various biological rhythms: atypical psychosis and epilepsy, puerperal psychosis and estrogen dysregulation, cyclic psychosis and sleep disorders, delirious mania and effectiveness of electro-convulsive-therapy, etc. Conclusions Our findings point to the clinical relevance of oneiroid cyclic psychosis as innate instability. Further studies on the role of biological rhythms and its repercussions on daily practice are required. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Reconsidering sleep perception in insomnia: from misperception to mismeasurement",
      "abstract": "Summary So‐called ‘sleep misperception’ refers to a phenomenon in which individuals have the impression of sleeping little or not at all despite normal objective measures of sleep. It is unknown whether this subjective–objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture ‘wake‐like’ brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro‐ and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non‐rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought‐like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake. We discuss the significance of these correlates and conclude with open questions and possible ways to address them.",

      "title": "Stay Awake! Understanding, Diagnosing, and Successfully Managing Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. (1) When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. (2) Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. (3,4) In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. (5) The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; TABLE 1). (6,7) Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness (FIGURE 1). This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed. Overview of narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a chronic, neurologic sleep disorder that results from the dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles. (8,9) Its 4 classic symptoms are EDS, cataplexy (a sudden drop in muscle tone that is triggered by emotional factors), sleep paralysis (a generalized flaccid paralysis that happens slightly before or at the time of falling asleep or on awakening), and hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur while falling asleep). (8,10,11) EDS is the symptom that is experienced by almost all patients with narcolepsy. (10) Cataplexy is present in about 70% of patients with narcolepsy, whereas sleep paralysis (30% to 50%) and hypnagogic hallucinations (20% to 40%) are experienced less often; all 4 symptoms are present in an estimated 11% to 14% of patients with narcolepsy. (11) Although the origins of narcolepsy are still not well known, clinical understanding of the neurologic dysfunction that underlies narcolepsy as well as treatment options have increased markedly in the last decade. Prevalence and risk factors According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, narcolepsy is the third most frequently diagnosed primary sleep disorder found in patients who seek treatment at sleep clinics, after obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. (8) Narcolepsy appears throughout the world in every racial and ethnic group, but prevalence rates vary. (8,12) Reports in the United States estimate a prevalence of 1 per 2000 population, whereas the prevalence in Japan is considerably higher (about 1 per 600 population) and in Israel it is much lower (about 1 per 500,000 population). (8,9,11,12) Its incidence has been estimated to be about 0.74 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with cataplexy, and 1.37 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. (13) Although narcolepsy is about as common as multiple sclerosis, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated (8,12); the delay between the emergence of the initial symptoms and diagnosis is usually more than 10 years. (14) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The initiating event for narcolepsy is not well understood, but infection, immune system dysfunction, trauma, hormonal changes, or stress may be present before narcoleptic symptoms become manifest. …",

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep physiology begins with development of the sleep/wake cycle, and the origins of active versus quiet sleep. The 24-hour circadian cycle becomes established at 3-6 months. Sleep disorders during infancy commonly include mild, usually self-limited conditions such as sleep-onset association disorder, excessive nighttime feedings, and poor limit-setting. These require behavioral management to avoid long-term deleterious sleep habits. In contrast, other sleep disorders are more ominous, including SIDS, central congenital hypoventilation syndrome, and sleep apnea. Childhood is generally considered the golden age of sleep, with brief latency to sleep onset, high efficiency, and easy awakening. Yet parasomnias, psychological factors, and sleep disturbances associated with common disorders such as ADHD disrupt the idealistic notion of childhood being a period of unfettered sleep. Adolescents have sleep requirements similar to adults, posing a challenge for them to adapt to school schedules and increasingly demanding lifestyles. Narcolepsy, usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood, is a lifelong sleep disorder and has led to the identification of the hypocretin/orexin neurotransmitter system. Research advances in the complex interrelationships between developmental neurobiology, sleep disorders and behavior will lead to an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of sleep problems and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for sleep disturbances in children.",

      "title": "Response to Koutroumanidis",
      "abstract": "To the Editors: We appreciate the comments from Dr. Koutroumanidis about our article on autonomic symptoms (AS's) during partial seizures in children. Dr. Koutroumanidis raises some important questions, and we will try to address them briefly below. Regarding the predominant (most important) ictal manifestations seen in our population of children – Typical psychomotor or motor seizures were predominant. Autonomic symptoms occurred frequently, but were not the predominant feature of these seizures. Regarding the timing (early or late in the seizure sequence) of AS's – Most of the AS's appeared later in the seizures. Some of them were typically postictal (or occurred at the end of the ictal episode) – e.g., nose-wiping, vomiting, coughing, hiccupping. Other signs occurred within the ictal period, but late in the session – e.g., genital automatisms, flushing, pallor, hypersalivation. Only a few AS's appeared at an early stage – e.g., epigastric aura and apnea. In short, the occurrence of AS's in these children followed the typical adult pattern of late-appearing AS's, as cited by Dr. Koutroumanidis. Regarding the duration of seizures with and without AS's – The duration of the AS's was usually short and constituted a minor part of the seizure. We did not see any seizures with autonomic status epilepticus, and none of the seizures were characterized exclusively by AS's. Rather, the AS period appeared as part of the whole psychomotor or motor seizure attack. We did not measure the exact length of seizures (an enormous undertaking for 514 attacks), and therefore cannot compare statistically the length of seizures with and without AS's. Regarding signs typical of Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) – Loss of muscle tone or awareness, a typical sign of PS, was noted in our semiological seizure classification of “atonic seizure.” Only 4 of 514 seizures (<1%) contained atonic components, so loss of muscle tone was clearly not a characteristic symptom of this patient group. We believe that the differences of our seizure with AS's, as compared to the longer autonomic seizures of PS, result from our special patient population. In our study, all the children had focal, well-localized, therapy-resistant epilepsy – a group very much different from the idiopathic childhood epilepsy population.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by dream enactment and complex motor behaviors during rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep atonia loss (rapid eye movement sleep without atonia) during polysomnography. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal “soft” signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long‐term prognosis of community‐dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep‐related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3‐12 mg or clonazepam 0.5‐2.0 mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence‐based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder as a prodromal synucleinopathy represents a defined time point at which neuroprotective therapies could potentially be applied for the prevention of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",

      "title": "Vasovagal Fainting: A Diphasic Response",
      "abstract": "Vasovagal (vasodepressor) fainting was studied in three different situations: in persons donating blood, in persons having a simple venipuncture, and in patients undergoing pneumoencephalography. Ten faints were observed in the first situation, 7 in the second and 6 in the third. In all instances, the faint itself, characterized by low blood pressure and bradycardia, was the second phase of a diphasic response; the first phase was characterized by rapid or rising heart rate, and by rising blood pressure, especially diastolic. The data are compatible with the view that the first (hyperdynamic) phase is a reflection of anxiety, while the second phase begins with the sudden cessation of anxiety. It is suggested that physiologically the faint reflects the action of reflex mechanisms activated by the first phase, and then left suddenly unopposed. The other psychobiological interpretations exhibit inconsistencies because they fail to recognize the diphasic nature of this response. Fainting and dying resemble each other closely, and there is reason to think that some vasovagal faints are fatal. Cardiac asystole is not rare in faints and is often associated with convulsions. Apnea was observed in 2 of our subjects. Disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including A. V. nodal rhythm, interference dissociation, and asystole (in 1 instance for 18 sec.) were observed. Generalized convulsions were seen on four occasions, always in association with asystole.",

      "title": "Blackout",
      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

      "title": "Your Loved One Has Migraines",
      "abstract": "There are few things more distressing than seeing your loved one in pain. Migraine, which causes repeated attacks of severe head pain associated with other disabling symptoms, affects not only the person who has it but also impacts the people close to them. It is not just a headache. Migraine produces episodes of moderate to severe head pain that is often throbbing, and generally accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise, nausea and/or vomiting, and is worsened with movement or routine activity. There may be other symptoms, such as sensitivity to odors, inability to concentrate, trouble producing speech, numbness, balance problems, weakness, double vision, and dizziness. About 25% of patients with migraine experience an aura of visual symptoms or other neurologic symptoms, usually occurring prior to their headache pain. The headaches usually last several hours and sometimes persist for days. Some patients identify triggers, such as food triggers, alcohol, food additives, certain odors, and artificial sweeteners. Patients with migraine have a genetic predisposition to having migraines, and most have a family history of migraine. The migraine brain is “sensitive” and reacts to things that do not generally bother people who do not have migraine. The migraine brain also hates change. Thus, stress or let-down from stress, change in sleep pattern (too much, too little, changing sleep onset or awakening time), heat, bright lights, loud noises, missing meals, and dehydration may provoke migraines as well. Migraines often occur with menstrual periods in women and worsen around menopause when hormones are fluctuating. Weather changes are often blamed but the scientific data supporting this are inconsistent. The most common reason that migraines worsen over time is overuse of symptomatic medications, which is called medication overuse headache. Over-the-counter as well as prescription medications can produce this condition, which turns episodic migraine into headaches that become more frequent and ultimately become daily. Even seemingly “safe” medications such as acetaminophen, anti-inflammatory medications and caffeine-containing compounds can cause worsening of migraines over time. It is important to limit symptomatic medication use (all medications combined if there is more than one medication used) to twice weekly. If someone requires symptomatic more often than twice a week, their preventive medication is not optimized. Stressful life events and chronic internalized stress are other common causes of worsening migraine. The medical profession used to talk about a “migraine personality” occurring in type A, driven, controlling, detail-oriented people. This is not true; anyone can have migraine. As migraine is episodic, often severe, and interferes with activities, many people with migraine have anxiety related to the fear of future migraines. Having frequent pain and feeling like a burden to one's family also leads to depression. Sometimes the loved ones wonder if patients with migraine are using their headaches to be manipulative missing school, not attending events, requiring help for daily tasks. This is generally not the case but some people with frequent headaches (particularly those overusing symptomatic medications) develop pain behaviors and assume a “sick role.” Well-meaning relatives and friends may sometimes worsen this, catering to all the needs of their loved one and focusing the majority of interactions on their pain. This is draining on loved ones as well as patients and may create a downward spiral of deteriorating relationships and social withdrawal. Patients with migraine do not require 24 hour care or observation (even in the hospital). It is important for people with severe migraines to keep living life, getting out of bed and doing something every day, and emphasizing what they CAN do, rather than what they CANNOT do every day. Exercise helps, and need not be vigorous walking, light yoga, tai chi, pilates, and water exercise are all good options. Patients are encouraged to pursue hobbies and interests, even if they don't feel well. Children should go to school. Cognitive behavioral therapy, stress management, mindfulness meditation, and biofeedback are helpful. Anxiety is best addressed by these methods combined with counseling, as opposed to medications. Counseling and antidepressants are helpful to treat depression; while patients with depression are more likely to have migraine and vice versa, improvement of pain often helps mood. Each patient needs to take charge of their own care, including managing (and knowing) their own medications, speaking for themselves at office visits, sending and responding to their own medical office communications, and contacting the office themselves (unless the circumstances are dire). That said, others may want to be on the lookout for medication overuse, hiding or hoarding medications. Migraine is inherently a treatable problem. Successful treatment of frequent migraines requires more than pills and procedures, although they help substantially. Other aspects of care include physical therapy, exercise, counseling and mental health care, and focusing on a healthy lifestyle and happy living. Realistic expectations are important: we are aiming for a reduction in migraine frequency, with infrequent migraines that are effectively treated with symptomatic medications when they occur.",

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "abstract": "One of the most common symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder is retraumatization, also known as secondary traumatic stress. Retraumatization became especially relevant for Ukrainians on the anniversary of the full-scale invasion, when there were many videos and photos of last year's events on the Internet and memories of the psychological shock of the first days, feelings of panic and hopelessness were especially acute. There is a so-called anniversary syndrome, which manifests itself in sleep problems, weakness, irritability, eating disorders, panic attacks, lack of strength and energy. According to the definition of experts, retraumatization is the opening of old emotional wounds and the anxious anticipation of this process. Retraumatization can be even more severe than the primary trauma, because it does not simply consist of a time-limited painful experience that has begun and ended, but of a feeling of endless agonizing and meaningless tension [1]. Retraumatization affects not only individuals, but the entire society. It is very widespread among Ukrainians, especially among those who lived in the east of the country and once fled their homes because of the war. Constant stress exhausts Ukrainians materially, physically, and psychologically, and people lose their internal resources, and the question of how to replenish them becomes more and more urgent with each passing day of the war.",

Respiratory dysfunction in sleep is common in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurring at a significantly higher rate than in the general population. Regulation of sleep is mediated by opposing actions of the anterior and posterior/lateral regions of the hypothalamus. Insomnia is characterized as difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, awakening in morning, or non-restorative sleep. The negative effects of shift work include sleepiness and insomnia, reduced alertness, and greater risk of re-injury, overall poor health, low work productivity, and poor quality of life. The sleep diary has been used in the TBI population for assessing sleep quality and quantity, and for identifying factors that may affect sleep and wakefulness. Sleep in TBI represents something of a challenge to investigate because of the broad array of possible diagnoses for the manifested problems.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu.

      "abstract": "Recurrent lucid dreaming is unusual and may be associated with an underlying sleep disorder. These are clear, emotionally pleasant dreams where the person is aware they are dreaming and capable of controlling content. They are usually initiated from REM sleep, but without loss of atonia. However, pathologic lucid dreams are associated with negative content and can result in sleep disruption with excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue. The etiology is unknown and we present a case of pathologic lucid dreams occurring after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. A 58-year-old man presents with complaints of sleep fragmentation beginning 15 years earlier since he was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. He experienced lucid dreaming since young adulthood without negative symptoms. Since his fibromyalgia, he complains of frequent purposeful awakening from his dreams due to unpleasant content and difficulty controlling them. He now feels as if he is awake throughout the night and has excess daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography showed increased REM and absent slow wave sleep without obstructive sleep apnea, REM behavior disorder or abnormal movements, or seizures. Treatment for fibromyalgia included various opiates, antidepressants, and pregabalin without improvement in sleep. We initiated prazosin and very low dose methadone, which resulted in improvement sleep fragmentation, tolerance to dream content, and frequency of dreams. Additionally, he had improved daytime function, decreased pain and daytime sleepiness. Lucid dreams are unusual, but are considered normal. However, pathologic lucid dreams are abnormal. The etiology and prevalence are unknown. Patients may be misdiagnosed with nightmares or hypersomnia with possible narcolepsy. Because he responded to prazosin and methadone treatment, we hypothesize that increased hypersensitivity of the monoaminergic system secondary to uncontrolled fibromyalgia may have been the reason behind these pathologic lucid dreams.",

      "title": "Hypnosis as an Adjunct to Anesthesia in Children",
      "abstract": "Most children anticipate the prospect of submitting to surgery and anesthesia with fear and apprehension. Youngsters who have to be given an anesthetic are afraid that something disastrous may happen to them while they are asleep. The child fears not only what he can understand but also what is less understandable, such as will he ever wake up or is he going to be killed? There are many connections in the child's mind between anesthesia, sleep, and death.1 When a child is brought to the operating room heavily premedicated or asleep, without having his fears allayed or his anxieties resolved, he will usually experience a nightmare of restlessness on recovery. During such a confused and stressful state, a child is more subject to psychic trauma than one who will recover quickly and quietly to a state of full consciousness and awareness.2 Sleep disturbances, temper tantrums, hallucinatory phenomena, and dependency reactions have been reported after surgical procedures where anesthesia was administered.3 In order to cope with this situa¬ tion, anesthesiologists in recent years have become more aware and better oriented to the psychological aspects of anesthesia for children.4·5 It is but a short step in inducing anesthe¬ sia in children with the use of stories, music, and flavoring agents to the superior effec¬ tiveness of an hypnotic induction. With children, relaxation by means of hypnosis is worth while. The comparative ease of inducing hypnosis in many children is a surprising finding. More than half of them can reach a sufficient hypnotic depth to permit minor surgical procedures, such as venipuncture, spinal tap, and reduction of simple fractures, to be performed. Hypnosis is a valuable method of inducing anesthesia or achieving basal anesthesia in children.6·7 Hypnotic inductions permit the use of posthypnotic suggestions that render recovery from anesthesia less distressing and more pleasant. Results in such cases are gratifying, because on recovery these children are quieter, more comfortable, and more cooperative than those who undergo anesthesia induced by chemical agents alone. Although hypnosis may be performed suc¬ cessfully in younger children on occasion, youngsters between the ages of 7 and 14 years are the most susceptible. These chil¬ dren usually make good subjects because of their heightened powers of imagination and their ability to play a role or create a fantasy. I try to use the child's own experiences—things with which he is famil¬ iar, so that better imagery can be produced. If children are admitted the day prior to surgery, a visit may be made in the after¬ noon or evening in order to take advantage of the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the child and to ascertain his area of interests. If it is possible to have a pre¬ liminary rehearsal of the hypnotic induction, it will serve the anesthesiologist well. How¬ ever, no attempt should be made to force the situation.

      "title": "Dynamics of recovery sleep from chronic sleep restriction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep loss is common in our 24/7 society with many people routinely sleeping less than they need. Sleep debt is a term describing the difference between the amount of sleep needed, and the amount of sleep obtained. Sleep debt can accumulate over time, resulting in poor cognitive performance, increased sleepiness, poor mood, and a higher risk for accidents. Over the last 30 years, the sleep field has increasingly focused attention on recovery sleep and the ways we can recover from a sleep debt faster and more effectively. While there are still many unanswered questions and debates about the nature of recovery sleep, such as the exact components of sleep important for recovery of function, the amount of sleep needed to recover and the impacts of prior sleep history on recovery, recent research has revealed several important attributes about recovery sleep: (1) the dynamics of the recovery process is impacted by the type of sleep loss (acute versus chronic), (2) mood, sleepiness, and other aspects of cognitive performance recover at different rates, and (3) the recovery process is complex and dependent on the length of recovery sleep and the number of recovery opportunities available. This review will summarize the current state of the literature on recovery sleep, from specific studies of recovery sleep dynamics to napping, “banking” sleep and shiftwork, and will suggest the next steps for research in this field.

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

      "abstract": "Sleep difficulties are often leading symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients.

      "abstract": "Abstract 1 D. Kasteleijn-Nolst Trenité ( 1 University La Sapienza (Rome), Italy and University of Utrecht, Netherlands ) Epileptic activity can disturb cognition even when no clinical signs or symptoms are present. These short-lasting discharges of 10 seconds or less are called subclinical EEG-discharges and can occur during sleep or wakefulness. Not only are these discharges an expression of underlying brain dysfunction, but also they have themselves a negative effect on performance of tasks. Since 1939 research has been undertaken to unravel the impact of these subclinical discharges, either isolated and focal or long-lasting and generalised. It is by far easier to determine the direct impact of short lasting epileptiform discharges on cognition when the patient is awake than when asleep and most studies were performed even during evoked epileptiform discharges using hyperventilation or photic stimulation. The more complex the task, the more disturbance can be found. Individual differences are important and interaction between performance of the task and occurrence of epileptiform discharges complicates matters further. Much more recently long-term follow-up studies have been undertaken in patients with rolandic and occipital epilepsy and those with epileptic activity during sleep to determine their cognitive evolution. Mainly transient deficits were found and these appeared to be correlated in time with worsening of the EEG in the active phase Besides scientific purposes, insight into the various factors involved in cognitive impairment in patients with subclinical EEG-discharges is of practical importance.

Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) may occur normally, but is considered indicative of disease when it occurs at a level of activity that is usually well tolerated. Dyspnea should be differentiated from tachypnea, hyperventilation, and hyperpnea, which refer to respiratory variations regardless of the patients subjective sensations. Tachypnea is an increase in the respiratory rate above normal; hyperventilation is increased minute ventilation relative to metabolic need, and hyperpnea is a disproportionate rise in minute ventilation relative to an increase in metabolic level. These conditions may not always be associated with dyspnea.Orthopnea is the sensation of breathlessness in the recumbent position, relieved by sitting or standing. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) is a sensation of shortness of breath that awakens the patient, often after 1 or 2 hours of sleep, and is usually relieved in the upright position.Two uncommon types of breathlessness are trepopnea and platypnea. Trepopnea is dyspnea that occurs in one lateral decubitus position as opposed to the other. Platypnea refers to breathlessness that occurs in the upright position and is relieved with recumbency.",

The ability to mentalize, associative thinking is poorly expressed, moreover, according to A. Green they have a central phobic position in the form of avoidance of associativeness. Such avoidance leads to mental mortification, the extreme expression of which is a marginal version of psychosomatic functioning – operativeness, machine-likeness. Dreams of such patients are either absent, or amaze with their scarcity and deserted spaces (the patient himself, people and living creatures are absent in such kinds of dreams). Often, we observe recurring dreams – traumatic, reproducing real traumas of the past. Raw dreams are presented as an undisguised realization of drives, without the slightest sign of mental elaboration.",

Both often display hallucinations, delusions, loss of capacity to test reality, implausible thoughts and implausible thought connections, loss of volitional control over onset or termination of an episode, etc. Because of these similarities, it has been suggested that the same mechanisms may underlie both states. Hughlings Jackson expressed this notion in his famous dictum, \"Find out about dreams and you will find out about insanity.\"1(p269) In the past 15 years, empirical data about dreaming has increased enormously because of the discovery by Aserinsky, Kleitman, and Dement of reliable physiological indices of dreaming.<sup>2-4</sup>It is now well established that dreaming, and particularly that kind of dreaming which in its bizarreness and visual qualities most resembles florid psychosis,<sup>5-7</sup>takes place during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; REM sleep is an inexorable",

Closing the eyes precipitated a flood of visual imagery that immediately roused the patient and prevented sleep. The imagery was predominantly visual, but there were auditory and narrative components suggesting a relationship to dreaming. An electroencephalogram showed that the hallucinatory activity was related to a recurring sequence of drowsiness, a few vertex slow waves, a myoclonic jerk, and arousal. Morphine was a prime suspect as the causative agent. The basic disturbance probably lay in the sleep–dream system. The syndrome has not been fully defined in the past.",

Patients act out during their dreams while being in the REM stage of sleep. Clinical features during sleep include abnormal vocalizations, abnormal motor behavior, and altered dream mentation. This enactment may be violent and can lead to injury to themselves or others without any conscious awareness. A patient can recall the contents of the dream upon awakening. Most patients with REM behavior disorder will eventually manifest neurodegenerative diseases like parkinsonism, dementia with Lewy body, or multisystem atrophy.There are also secondary causes of RBD associated with narcolepsy or use of antidepressant medications.A patient may be warned about the future development of these neurological disorders. Treatment consists of preventive measures while sleeping to avoid injury to the patient as well as the bed partner. In severe cases, the patient may be prescribed melatonin or clonazepam.",

      "abstract": "Sleep starts, also called hypnagogic or hypnic jerks, are bilateral, sometimes asymmetric, usually single, brief body jerks that coincide with sleep onset. We describe sleep starts occurring repetitively in three epileptic children with spastic-dystonic diplegia and mental retardation. Repetitive sleep starts began at age 18 months in two children and at 9 months in the third. All three children had had feto-neonatal asphyxia; two presented with spastic and one with dystonic tetraparesis. One had West syndrome and two had partial motor seizures in the first year of life. Seizures were controlled in all three patients by antiepileptic drug therapy. Video/EEG recordings of all the children during the afternoon nap revealed clusters of sleep starts during the transition between wakefulness and sleep. Cluster lasted 4-15 min and comprised from twenty to twenty-nine contractions. The EEG counterpart of the event sometimes showed an arousal response, at times inducing complete awakening. Repetitive sleep starts should be recognized and clearly differentiated from epileptic seizures, especially if they appear in epileptic subjects. In neurologically compromised patients, they could represent an intensification of an otherwise normal event, due to the lack of strong inhibitory influence of the pyramidal tract resulting from the pyramidal lesion.",

      "abstract": "A young woman with intense longings for love was unable to satisfy these desires by a normal sexual relationship with a man because of her fears and inhibitions. She developed urticaria at times when her longings were especially stimulated and frustrated. Twelve attacks were observed during analysis and their emotional settings are described. Eight of them occurred in connection with dreams. These dreams invariably ended on the verge of frustration in an \"almost but not quite\" situation. Other types of dreams out of a total of 94 were never followed by urticaria and vice versa, with the exception of a repetitive dream of reaching for an object or person who slipped from the patient's grasp. This dream was followed by weeping, when not by urticaria. The urticaria appeared when weeping was repressed and often terminated when the patient wept. Some of the observations are somewhat suggestive concerning the choice of sites for the urticaria. The findings were confirmed by a second analyzed case and by a few observations on five cases seen in interview. In connection with other observations, particularly on asthma, they led to the supposition of a possible relationship between certain states of allergic sensitivity and states of intense frustrated longing.",

      "abstract": "Any long journey gives rise to travel fatigue, regardless of the number of time zones that are crossed.10-12 The main symptoms are a sense of disorientation and increases in weariness and the likelihood of suffering from a headache. These difficulties are due to spending time in a cramped environment with little opportunity for exercise, altered (and often unpalatable) food, and dehydration. Delays and detours during the journey, and possible difficulties after reaching one's final destination after the journey, are likely to exacerbate the problem, as is the dry and slightly hypoxic air in the cabin when the journey is by plane. It has been suggested that the risk of deep-vein thrombosis is also increased in these circumstances, although the extent to which dehydration, lack of activity, and hypoxia are individually or collectively responsible is unclear.13-22If the number of time zones that has been crossed is small (less than three), travel fatigue is the only problem, jet lag (see below) being absent. The symptomsare transitory and can quickly be remedied on arrival at the final destination. Important measures include rehydration (water and fruit juices, not tea or alcohol which promote urine loss), a rest or short nap, some light physical activity, and a shower. Some of these measures (brief bouts of exercise and drinking to minimize dehydration) can be practised also during the journey. Any nap that is taken on arrival should not be too long, so that a full sleep can be taken when it is night; such a nocturnal sleep can be taken as easily as in the departure zone, since night at the destination and place of departure coincide.",

Approximately 10% of the general population and 20% of primary care attendees suffer from severe insomnia. Clinical hallmarks of sleeplessness are the patients' complaints about insufficient and non-restorative sleep, severe daytime consequences without any tendency to fall asleep and presence of symptoms on three days per week for more than one month. Insomniacs tend to suffer from psycho-physiologic hyperarousal that prevents physical and mental relaxation. They are more susceptible to stress and seem to have a high sympathetic drive. Insomnia therefore has been compared to chronic caffeine intoxication. It must he pointed out that insomnia is probably more a qualitative rather than a quantitative disorder of sleep. Neither doctors nor patients routinely talk about disturbed sleep during consultations which might he one reason why insomnia very often goes undiagnosed. Consequently, physicians should routinely inquire afoul their patients' sleep and sleeping habits and take, if appropriate, a full sleep history on the basis of which further investigational and therapeutic steps can be planned: well-established tools of proved efficacy are available to treat both primary and secondary insomnia. Acute or transient insomnia lasting less than four weeks can he treated with hypnotics. Chronic insomnia is the domain of nonpharmacological psychotherapy, which can be conducted in a single or group setting.",

      "title": "Central s sleep a apnoea, p pathogenesis a and ttreatment: a an o overview and p perspective",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of reported sleep disturbances in a general popula- tion is high. Many of the complaints are the result of sleep-related breathing dis- orders, due mainly to the occurrence of obstructive and central apnoeas. Obstructive sleep apnoea is a fully described and well-recognized entity. Central sleep apnoea (CSA) however, has been poorly studied. There is accumulating evidence that central sleep apnoea should be considered as the end of a spectrum. Instability in the breathing pattern is the main under- lying mechanism and is due to the interaction of many factors. Breathing during sleep is dependent on metabolic control and the activity of the respiratory muscles. Decreased chemical drive and/or failing respiratory muscle function are associated with CSA and usually also with ongoing hypoventilation during wakefulness, char- acterized by chronic daytime hypercapnia. Central respiratory drive can also be inhibited by upper airway reflexes. Mostly, however, CSA occurs as the hallmark of unstable breathing during sleep brought about by an overall increase in loop gain (especially in light sleep stages) and the unmasking of a CO 2 threshold. Arousal following central apnoeas acts as an amplification of the instability. Micro electroencephographic (EEG) arousals are often observed as a consequence of CSA. They are responsible for sleep fragmentation and hypersomnolence during the day. The daytime hypersomnolence and complaints of awakenings during sleep in patients with CSA can be striking. CSA can occur in specific pathologies, such as chronic heart failure and (post-traumatic) brain lesions, that are associated with irregular breathing. Treatment strategies are remarkably few in number. Use of nasal ventilation and the inhalation of CO 2 are mainly of theoretical interest, since patients do not often tolerate these more invasive therapies. Drug treatment, especially with aceta- zolamide, is easier to perform. Stimulation of upper airway reflexes, by less inva- sive methods, seems to be promising for the near future.",

      "abstract": "The neurobehavioral deficits of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are often attributed to the rate of respiratory disturbance or rate of arousals during sleep. However, sleep disordered breathing is also associated with other changes in sleep infrastructure that may account for cumulative waking deficits. This was illustrated in polysomnographic data from 1,521 patients with OSAS where increasing arousal indices were associated with increased duration of stage 1 sleep and concomitant reduction in total sleep time. Similar results have been found in paradigms in which sleep was experimentally fragmented in healthy individuals. It appears that chronic fragmentation of sleep, whether by apneas or acoustic stimuli, leads to cumulative homeostatic pressure for sleep, which may explain a number of phenomenan characteristic of both untreated OSAS patients and experimentally fragmented sleepers: (1) increased arousal threshold, (2) rapid return to sleep after arousal, (3) fewer awakenings over time, (4) increased sleep inertia on awakenings, (5) increased amnesia for arousals, and (6) daytime sleepiness. Elevated homeostatic drive for sleep appears to be a function of both the frequency of arousals within a night and the chronicity of sleep fragmentation across nights, neither of which have been adequately modeled in experimental studies of healthy subjects.",

An acute stress reaction occurs as a natural phenomenon. It is a consequence of prolonged experiences that are difficult to ignore. A person is in constant anxiety: he is scared, he feels heavy, he cannot concentrate, sleep normally. His entire body is in constant tension. This condition does not go away for weeks and results in a number of symptoms. The characteristics of stress directly depend on the personality, habits, and close environment. The stronger it is, the fewer negative processes occur in its life. A person has a simple reaction to stress only in cases where he has high stress resistance. He knows how to distance himself from difficulties, overcome difficulties without harming himself. Emergency response methods are abnormal reactions caused by constant internal tension. A person does not rest, does not discharge, does not calm down: internal organs, nervous and cardiovascular systems suffer due to constant stress. Acute reactions are the result of neglecting psychological problems that are a consequence of unfavorable environmental factors.

      "abstract": "The integrity of time consciousness is the condition of possibility of the identity through time of an object of perception as well as of the person who perceives it. I will present our findings about abnormal time experience (ATE) in people with schizophrenia. These data may support the following hypothesis: if the continuity of temporal experience disintegrates (of which ATE are experiential manifestations), overarching meaningful units are no longer available, thereby creating temporal gaps, e.g., in one's stream of consciousness. In some cases, thoughts that are no longer experienced as embedded in one's stream of thoughts are experienced as, e.g., thought interferences, blockages, insertion or withdrawal. These symptoms cannot be explained as a mere disturbance of attention or comprehension at the level of semantic combinations. Rather, the disturbance could be searched for at a more basic level where the temporal coherence of conscious awareness is constituted. A failure of the constitutive temporal synthesis may create micro-gaps of conscious experience. In the most severe cases, thoughts or other mental phenomena that are no longer embedded in the continuity of basic self-experience may appear in consciousness as “erratic blocks” and experienced as being inserted, or, if further externalized, as auditory hallucinations (“voices”). This coheres with the hypothesis that a breakdown of temporality may be bound up with the breakdown of prereflexive self-awareness.

This last symptom can be considered as an unspecific sign of brain-damage. For the disturbance of voluntary lid opening/closure, the term ,,cortical palsy\" of lid movements is proposed. Thus this symptom can be differentiated from other supranuclear disorders of lid movements where reflectory and/or spontaneous lid movements are also impaired.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organs with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Neuropsychiatric manifestation (NPSLE) is present among 28–40% of the SLE patients. Psychosis is rarely the only initial symptom of lupus, as neuropsychiatric lupus is often associated with systemic activity. We present two cases of young ladies presenting with acute psychosis as the predominant symptom and further diagnosed with SLE disease. Case reports: Case 1 A 20-year-old female, unmarried, presented to the Psychology Department with acute behavioral abnormality associated with staring, insomnia and, aggressive behavior, hearing voices for the last 3 days. No other psychiatric or neurological symptoms; she was taking 20 mg oral prednisolone prescribed according to a history of fatigue, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, pain in almost all joints, and myalgia for the last 1 month. There was no sign of focal neurological deficit or meningeal irritation. Examination of other systems did not find any clinical abnormality except for the presence of photosensitivity. A psychiatric consultation was ordered. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 3200 cell/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 9.2 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), C-reactive protein (CRP) 65 mg/l ( n ≤6), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 100 mm/h(range=0–20). anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) profile which was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with anti-ds-DNA positive (+), decreased C3 and C4. The diagnosis of SLE was done according to the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria (EULAR/ACR Criteria). Case2 A 37-year-old married female with 3 children presented to the Psychology Department with disorientation, staring, hearing voices, seeing images of people who want to hurt her, refusing to respond to people, and insomnia for the last 10 days. She had complained of fatigue and low-grade fever for last month. A psychiatric consultation was ordered, and the patient was managed with an injection of haloperidol 5 mg BD. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 7300 cells/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 8.7 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), reticulocyte:1.4, CRP 7 mg/l ( n ≤6), and ESR 50mm/h (range=0–20). The ANA profile was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with the anti-ds-DNA negative (−), decreased C3, and normal C4. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a high white matter signal around the lateral ventricles and in the semi-oval centers. Mild dilation of the lateral ventricles and slight elevation of the left insular and medial temporal lobe signal. Conclusion: Our case reports showed that organic disorders should be considered while evaluating acute psychosis, especially autoimmune disorders. The presence of laboratory features like anemia, elevated ESR, and elevated CRP should be taken with utmost importance.",

      "abstract": "Reflex seizures (RS) are epileptic events that are objectively and consistently elicited in response to a specific afferent stimulus or by an activity of the patient. The specific stimulus can be a variety of heterogenous intrinsic or extrinsic factors, ranging from the simple to the complex, such as flashing lights or reading a book. These seizures can take a variety of forms, comprising either general or focal onset, with or without secondary generalization. Reflex epilepsies (RE) are classified as a specific syndrome in which all epileptic seizures are precipitated by sensory stimuli. The few designated RE include idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy, other visual sensitive epilepsies, primary reading epilepsy, and startle epilepsy. RS that occurs within other focal or generalized epilepsy syndromes that are associated with distinct spontaneous seizures are classified by the overarching seizure type. Most patients experience spontaneous seizures along with their provoked events. RS originate from stimulation of functional anatomic networks normally functioning for physiological activities, that overlap or coincide with regions of cortical hyperexcitability. Generalized RS typically occur within the setting of IGEs and should be considered as focal seizures with quick secondary generalization via cortico-cortical or cortico-reticular pathways. In aggregate, activation of a critical neuronal mass, supported and sustained by cortico-subcortical and thalamocortical pathways eventually result in a seizure. Treatment includes antiseizure medication, commonly valproate or levetiracetam, along with lifestyle modifications, and when amenable, surgical intervention. High clinical suspicion and careful history taking must be employed in all epilepsy patients to identify reflex triggers.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

Scientifically, fainting is called a «syncope» state (the word «syncope» comes from the Greek syn meaning «with, together» and koptein — «to cut off, tear off»), and is characterized by a short-term loss of consciousness against the background of transient hypoperfusion of the brain and a drop in muscle tone. The duration of loss of consciousness is usually 20–30 seconds, after which people come to their senses on their own. After fainting, feelings of general weakness, overexhaustion, and fatigue are possible; for elderly people, the occurrence of retrograde amnesia is typical. In the vast majority of cases, syncope is of reflex origin, and only about 15 % of fainting is associated with pathology of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Notably, in some cases the cause of syncope cannot be established [4].",

      "abstract": "Mass hysteria is the common term used to describe a situation in which various people all suffer from similar unexplained symptoms1. Hysterical contagion consists of a quick dissemination within a collection of people of a symptom, or a set of symptoms for which no physical explanation can be found2. Mass hysteria typically begins when an individual becomes ill or hysterical during a period of stress. After this initial individual shows symptoms, others begin to manifest similar symptoms3. Symptoms recorded during outbreaks of mass hysteria include abdominal pains, chest tightness, dizziness, fainting, headaches, hyperventilation, nausea, vomiting, palpitations; anxiety, conversion disorder and screaming. Mass hysteria is a social phenomenon often occurring among otherwise healthy people who suddenly believe they have been made ill by some external factor. It spreads by sight and or sound and occurs most often among adolescents or preadolescents4. In groups of students, its incidence is reportedly higher among girls than boys. Symptoms often follow an environmental trigger or illness in an index case and spread rapidly by audiovisual cues, often aggravated by a prominent emergency or media response5. Symptoms frequently resolve after patients are separated from each other, removed from the environment in which the outbreak began and after being convinced that the illness is over or never existed. Literature suggests that mass hysteria episodes have frequently occurred in Africa. This paper provides a literature review of documented episodes of mass hysteria in African schools.",

Foods, medications, and insect stings cause most anaphylaxis for which a cause can be identified, but virtually any agent capable of directly or indirectly activating mast cells or basophils can cause it. This syndrome can consist of some or all the following signs and symptoms: diffuse pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and/or angioedema; bronchospasm; laryngeal edema; hypotension; and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Some of the other symptoms that can occur include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, headache, feeling of impending doom, and unconsciousness. Regardless of the presenting signs or symptoms, which usually present within 5–30 min following the administration of the offending agent, this reaction can progress to respiratory compromise and cardiovascular collapse resulting in human fatalities. Usually, the more rapid the onset of clinical manifestations, the more likely the anaphylaxis will be life threatening. Immediate and appropriate therapy, especially with epinephrine, is mandatory to reverse the reactions. While most reactions are uniphasic, some can be biphasic or protracted. This chapter discusses the immunopathologic mechanisms and effects of anaphylaxis.",

      "abstract": ". Istirahat dan tidur merupakan kebutuhan dasar yang dibutuhkan oleh semua\r\norang. Setiap orang memerlukan kebutuhan istirahat atau tidur yang cukup agar\r\ntubuh dapat berfungsi secara normal (Wicaksono, 2012). Tidur merupakan salah\r\nsatu fungsi biologis yang berperan penting dalam status kesehatan individu.\r\nSebagian individu mengalami masalah dengan tidurnya, dimana gangguan tidur\r\nyang sering terjadi salah satunya adalah insomnia (Putri dan Bayhakki, 2016).\r\nDi Indonesia, belum diketahui angka pastinya namun prevalensi pada orang\r\ndewasa mencapai 20% (Wicaksono, 2012). Insomnia merupakan keadaan tidak\r\ndapat tidur atau terganggunya pola tidur. Orang yang bersangkutan mungkin tidak\r\ndapat tidur, sukar untuk jatuh tidur, atau mudah terbangun dan kemudian tidak\r\ndapat tidur lagi. Insomnia umumnya merupakan kondisi sementara atau jangka\r\npendek. Dalam beberapa kasus, insomnia dapat menjadi kronis. Hal ini sering\r\ndisebut sebagai gangguan tidur yang paling sering terjadi yang berhubungan\r\ndengan situasional stres akut, seperti pekerjaan baru atau menjelang ujian.\r\nInsomnia ini biasanya hilang ketika stressor hilang atau individu telah beradaptasi\r\ndengan stressor. Namun, insomnia sementara sering berulang ketika tegangan\r\nbaru atau serupa muncul dalam kehidupan pasien (Kaplan dan Sadock, 2010).\r\nDalam TCM, insomnia yang diakibatkan sindrom hiperaktivitas Yang karena\r\ndefisiensi Yin disebabkan karena kebiasaan makan manis sehingga terjadi panas\r\npada lambung yang dapat mengganggu fungsi transformasi dan transportasi limpa.\r\nDisamping itu, insomnia juga disebabkan karena suka berpikir. Berpikir yang\r\nmelampaui batas mengakibatkan peredaran Qi terhalang dan fungsi transportasi\r\ndan transformasi Pi-limpa tidak berjalan dengan normal. Organ lambung yang\r\nekses dan organ limpa yang defisiensi (unsur tanah) tidak dapat membatasi organ\r\nginjal sehingga menyebabkan defisiensi Yin pada organ ginjal. Dengan adanya\r\ndefisiensi Yin ginjal menyebabkan Yin ginjal tidak dapat menguap ke atas untuk\r\nmembatasi Yang Qi jantung. Karena Yin ginjal tidak dapat membatasi Yang Qi\r\njantung menyebabkan terjadinya hiperaktivitas api jantung. Saat api jantung\r\nterganggu, Shen-jiwa ikut terganggu menyebabkan terjadinya insomnia.\r\nPenanganan yang dilakukan pada penderita insomnia yaitu terapi akupresur\r\ndan terapi herbal. Terapi akupresur dilakukan pada titik Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen\r\n(HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) dilakukan sebanyak 12 kali terapi yang diberikan\r\nsebanyak 3 kali dalam seminggu. Serta terapi herbal setiap hari selama 28 hari\r\ndengan menggunakan simplisia daun putri malu (Mimosa pudica) dengan dosis 10\r\ngram yang direbus dengan 750 mL air, diminum sehari 1 kali sebanyak 200 mL\r\nsebelum tidur.\r\nDari hasil setelah pemberian terapi kombinasi akupresur pada titik Neiguan\r\n(PC6), Shenmen (HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) serta pemberian herbal putri malu\r\n(Mimosa pudica) dapat memberikan hasil yang baik terhadap pasien dengan\r\nkeluhan insomnia.

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

The inability to focus or maintain concentration is the most disabling aspect of conditions causing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), described as 'brain fog' or even masquerading as dementia. The commonest causes of mild and severe EDS are probably insufficient sleep and poor quality overnight sleep, respectively. Sleep onset or sleep maintainance insomnia can reflect an idiopathic or primary phenomenon but is more often secondary to a variety of disorders, including other primary sleep disorders. In patients with underlying neuropathies, radiculopathies or demyelinating disease, restless legs syndrome (RLS) may be secondary to the primary diagnosis and should not be overlooked. The nocturnal disturbances are usually of more concern to the bed partner who may incur injuries from violent dream enactment.",

Nightmares are more likely to occur in REM sleep and, however unpleasant, are normal events suggesting that the maintenance of these emotional systems of the brain, which ensure our survival, may be one of the functions of brain activation in sleep. Sleep walking, sleep talking, tooth grinding, post-traumatic dreams, and REM sleep behaviour disorder are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

When individuals present with persistent cognitive dysfunction following concussion, it is important to address all potential concussion-related issues that may interfere with cognition, including mood disorder, sleep disorder, vestibular and oculomotor dysfunction, pituitary dysfunction, and pain. Additionally, individuals with persistent cognitive dysfunction may develop secondary anxiety because of fears of permanent brain damage or a neurodegenerative disease. When individuals present with prolonged cognitive complaints following concussion, a referral to a sports neuropsychologist may help to differentiate primary cognitive impairment from other persistent symptoms that may interfere with cognition.",

      "title": "Physiological Background of Muscular Pain During Skiing and Delayed Muscle Soreness after Skiing",
      "abstract": "Physiological Background of Muscular Pain During Skiing and Delayed Muscle Soreness after Skiing During intensive skiing, at each turn, in particular towards the end of the turning steering phase, eccentric work of the lower limb muscles occurs (predominantly of the quadriceps femoris), which is the direct cause of damage within muscle cells. A few or more than ten hours after intensive physical effort the symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness may appear, which is mainly a result of the micro-damage within the myocytes. The following procedure can be proposed for prevention of muscle soreness for skiers: around a week before first day of skiing in the season, skiers should perform a series of intensive physical exercises involving eccentric contractions, thus inducing delayed muscular soreness. The exercises may involve for example: downhill running, preferably down a steep slope, running down stairs, deep knee bend jumps, deep knee bend jumps over an obstacle, jumping to the ground from a certain height, sit-ups on one or both feet, etc. The exercises should lead considerable local fatigue, in particular of the lower limb muscles, so that muscle soreness occurs on the second day, in particular in the frontal part of the thighs. After approximately two days the pain will alleviate, while after a week the strength of the muscles will return to its pre-exercise condition. This should considerably reduce, or even remove, delayed muscle soreness after skiing, which will not only help skiers use their time more effectively but will also be crucial to the skiers' safety.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a widespread disorder affecting not only sleep quantity and quality, but also daytime well-being and performance, as well as having a negative impact on physical and mental health. Many people have problems falling asleep and maintaining sleep that do not reach the clinical criteria of insomnia. For all the prevalence of such sleep disorders, specialists often overlook a fundamentally important factor that affects sleep and wakefulness cycle, ease of falling asleep and daytime performance. These are circadian rhythms of the body under the control of the biological clock.This review highlights the specifics of the human biological clock and its relationship to insomnia and complaints of poor sleep. The phenomenon of the human chronotype as a set of individual preferences in sleep-wake rhythm is considered. Late chronotype, tat tends to wake up late and be active in the evening turns out to be the most vulnerable to the appearance of complaints of poor sleep and development of insomnia. This result is typical for different age groups. The reason for problems sleep for the late chronotype is the need to adjust to social demands and to fall asleep and wake up too early relative to the phase of one’s own circadian rhythm.Circadian rhythms may contribute to the formation and maintenance of insomnia. Both chronic and acute insomnia may have a chronobiological component that is not always considered. Late chronotype may be a factor further exacerbating the course of insomnia. The regularity of circadian rhythms may also be impaired in insomnia.The importance of the biological clock in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness also explains the successful approach to insomnia treatment with melatonin, which plays an important signaling role in the circadian regulation of the body.",

      "abstract": "A 59-year-old man with temporomandibular joint pain/dysfunction syndrome presented with a long history of nocturnal bruxism. All-night polysomnographic recordings with video monitoring showed episodes of teeth grinding or clenching occurring exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which were often associated with movements of the hands and fingers and/or brief vocalization. Throughout REM sleep, there was excessive phasic chin electromyographic twitching, without increased tone, and also excessive phasic electromyographic twitching in multiple muscle sites. The patient maintained a normal nonrapid eye movement-REM cycle, but showed increased REM density. Polysomnographic characteristics suggested that there may be a common pathophysiology in a certain type of sleep bruxism and the REM sleep behavior disorder. Sleep bruxism seen in this case is concluded to be a manifestation of subclinical REM sleep behavior disorder.",

      "abstract": "Sleep insufficiency, insomnia, and related sleep disorders are concerns that affect millions of US adults. The disorders also contribute to significant cognitive, emotional, and physical health challenges. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the US population. It is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and early-morning waking and is linked to daytime distress and impairment. Common sleep disruptors include environmental factors such as noise, light, and air pollution and also personal habits such as excessive screen use before bedtime. Evaluating patients with insomnia in primary care requires integrating sleep health assessments into routine visits and use of insomnia screening tools and sleep diaries for accurate diagnosis. Nonpharmacologic therapies such as sleep hygiene and cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia are the preferred treatments. Pharmacotherapy or combination therapy (with cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia and pharmacotherapy) may be considered when these interventions are ineffective. Family physicians should weigh the risks and benefits of insomnia medication use carefully for all patients but especially for older adults because of potential adverse effects. Managing insomnia effectively in primary care involves a comprehensive approach, prioritizing nonpharmacologic strategies, regular monitoring, and patient-centered care.",

We aimed to review the association between, and medical management of, narcolepsy and psychosis in children and adults.We reviewed the full text of 100 papers from 187 identified by a PubMed search on narcolepsy plus any of these keywords: psychosis, schizophrenia, delusion, side effects, safety, and bipolar disorder.Three relevant groups are described. (i) In typical narcolepsy, psychotic-like symptoms include predominantly visual hallucinations at the sleep-wake transition (experienced as \"not real\") and dissociation because of intrusion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena into wakefulness. (ii) Atypical patients (\"the psychotic form of narcolepsy\") experience more severe and vivid, apparently REM-related hallucinations or dream/reality confusions, which patients may rationalize in a delusion-like way. (iii) Some patients have a comorbid schizophrenia spectrum disorder with psychotic symptoms unrelated to sleep. Psychostimulants used to treat narcolepsy may trigger psychotic symptoms in all three groups. We analyzed 58 published cases from groups 2 and 3 (n = 17 and 41). Features that were reported significantly more frequently in atypical patients include visual and multimodal hallucinations, sexual and mystical delusions, and false memories. Dual diagnosis patients had more disorganized symptoms and earlier onset of narcolepsy.Epidemiological studies tentatively suggest a possible association between narcolepsy and schizophrenia only for very early-onset cases, which could be related to the partially overlapping neurodevelopmental changes observed in these disorders. We propose a clinical algorithm for the management of cases with psychotic-like or psychotic features.",

      "abstract": "Flurazepam, temazepam, and triazolam are compared in terms of initial and short term efficacy, effectiveness during intermediate and long term use, withdrawal effects, and general side effects. The usefulness of temazepam is considerably restricted since the drug is slowly absorbed; peak blood concentrations are not reached until 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Consequently, while the majority of insomniac patients complain primarily of difficulty falling asleep, temazepam is not effective for this sleep complaint. Further, the drug has an intermediate elimination half-life and induces a significant degree of morning sleepiness (hangover). Rebound insomnia of a moderate degree occurs with some frequency following withdrawal of temazepam. Triazolam is effective initially and with short term use both for inducing and maintaining sleep. However, much of this effectiveness is lost with continued nightly use over an intermediate period (2 weeks). The drug has a rapid elimination rate; during drug administration, sleep may worsen in the final hours of the night (early morning insomnia), and following drug withdrawal, rebound insomnia is frequent, immediate, and severe. Side effects are frequent and include some morning sleepiness (before tolerance develops) and significant memory impairment and even episodes of amnesia. Triazolam may have a narrow margin of safety in that serious behavioral symptoms have been reported even with a 1-mg dose. Flurazepam is effective both for initiating and maintaining sleep with initial and short term drug administration. Further, its efficacy is maintained not only with intermediate term use but with long term drug use (4 weeks). Flurazepam is a long elimination half-life drug, and there is significant daytime sedation during short term use; with continued use this effect diminishes. Rebound insomnia has not been noted following withdrawal of flurazepam; there is a carry-over effectiveness into the first and second nights of withdrawal, and any withdrawal sleep disturbance would be expected to be infrequent, delayed in appearance, and mild in degree.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

      "abstract": "Different movements or behaviors can occur during sleep or around the time of sleep. They can be benign or physiologic, or may lead to sleep disruption of the person or their bed partner. Sleep-related movement disorders are simple, usually stereotyped movements that disturb sleep. Examples include bruxism, nocturnal leg cramps, and sleep starts. These movements need to be distinguished from more complex motor activities which are called parasomnias, such as REM sleep behavior disorder or sleepwalking. This distinction can typically be accomplished by taking a detailed history and physical, but may require the use of in-laboratory, attended polysomnography. Commonly included in the classification of sleep-related movement disorders is restless legs syndrome, which, though a complex activity, is frequently associated with periodic limb movements of sleep which more clearly fit the description of a sleep-related movement disorder. Restless legs syndrome is a common, yet frequently missed, cause of sleep disruption in the population. Effective and safe treatments, such as dopamine agonists, exist for this condition.",

      "abstract": "Background: Obsessive idea is related to act, the patient trying a resistance, so that, if in delirium the patient agrees and aspires to, in obsession, the disagreement is the main characteristic. Research Questions: In aggressive obsession, there is the fear of self of not being aggressive with others, while in paranoid delirium there is the fear of being persecuted by others. Aim: The concept of schizo-obsessive disorder, with onset in adolescence with OC phenomenology, with subsequently negative symptoms, productive perceptual and ideational area (auditory hallucinations and pseudo-hallucinations, next to Kandinsky Clerambault syndrome). OC phenomenology acquires connotations different from schizophrenia onset, the patient never acquiring again a disorder total insight. Results: When obsessions and compulsions were related to the content of delusional ideas and hallucinations, other typical rituals of obsessive-compulsive disorders appeared too, the patient considered sometimes irrational and excessive. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms were present a significant period of the prodrome, of active phases and residual period, being time-consuming, causing distress and interfering patient’s routine, in addition to the schizophrenia deterioration. Conclusions: Social degradation is dictated mainly by the negative dimension of schizophrenia, secondly by energy consumption in fulfilling the rituals and compulsions and finally by the mood change in depressive sense. The family emotional climate in excess potentiates the negative inversion towards family, which amplifies the sensitiveness to rejection, sensitive relationship delirium, referentiality and finally social isolation.",

It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

Excluded are secondary neurobehavioral signs and symptoms in coma that have been treated pharmacologically with sedatives. The definition of coma in terms of cerebral functioning refers to a state of acute brain failure not strictly related to any particular cerebral substratum or specific anatomical level of lesion. Coma normally occurs when broad areas in the upper and lower brain stems, or cerebral hemispheres, or simultaneously in the cerebral hemispheres and brain stem are damaged. The most frequent causes of coma are diffuse axonal pathology, hypoxia and secondary lesions which affect the brainstem (Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep paralysis is an inability to move at sleep onset or upon awakening. It is often a distressing experience that can be associated with significant clinical consequences. Few studies have focussed on pleasant sleep paralysis episodes. The present study aimed to determine the relative prevalence of pleasant episodes of sleep paralysis as well as variables that may make them more likely to occur. Participants ( N = 172) with recurrent episodes of sleep paralysis completed a battery of questionnaires investigating sleep paralysis episodes, trauma symptoms, life satisfaction, and Big Five personality traits. Pleasant sleep paralysis was found to be a fairly common experience (i.e. 23%). Episodes were emotionally complex, with pleasant episodes often involving some admixture of fear. In terms of hallucinations, pleasant episodes were more likely to involve vestibular‐motor sensations (i.e. illusory body movements) and some individuals reported an ability to induce these hallucinations. Contrary to expectation, neither lower trauma symptomatology nor higher levels of reported life satisfaction predicted pleasant sleep paralysis. However, the ability to lucid dream and higher levels of trait openness to new experiences appeared to make pleasant episodes more likely. Clinical implications are discussed.",

One month old infants are normally awake during one-third of the nocturnal sleeping time. Gradually, sleep moves into night and wakefulness into daytime. At 3 years, 25 to 38% of children wake up during the night, but after 5 years this proportion becomes negligible. Apart from acute or chronic diseases which may produce sleep disorders, most of these are due to environmental factors. Two syndrome are worthy of special mention: deficiency of slow wave and deep sleep in psychosocial dwarfism, and insomnia due to intolerance to cow's milk. Treatment of insomniac children rests on behavioural techniques: parents must be helped to understand and observe the sleep-wake rhythm of their children and teach them to acquire regular sleeping habits.",

Four individuals were interviewed, their dreams collected, and a total of 11 nights of sleep recorded. Although not apparent from initial interviews, all four individuals had more than one specific typical dream. All typical dreams were painful in feeling tone and intrusive. A typical dream may occur in varied motivational contexts, at times simply in association with a somatic sensation. Three individuals had abnormal wave forms in their all-night electroencephalograms.

It is possible that some stupors are essentially states of extreme preoccupation with the frightening experiences (cf.Hoch's (1921) Benign Stupors and the preoccupation with death).4. Other stupors are presumably hysterical (avoidance) methods of dealing with the same kind of experience.5. The long persistence of conditioned responses after traurna, up to two years ln some R.A.F.cases, and probably indefinitely longer, has its parallel (Anderson and Parmenter, 1941) in sheep with experimental neuroses.6.

      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "title": "863 When sleep takes you to unwanted places?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Somnambulism is a parasomnia occurring in non-rapid eye movement sleep, and is characterized by ambulation as a disorder of arousal regulation. Sleep deprivation, alcohol abuse, fragmented sleep and certain medications can increase the risk of sleep walking. Report of case(s) Here we present a 35-year-old man with multiple triggers for sleep walking, resulting in recurrent parasomnia events over fifteen years. He had a history of bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic insomnia, moderate untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), anxiety with violent daytime behaviors, and prior alcohol abuse status post six years of sobriety. He was sent to our clinic due to increased frequency and severity of events, with nightly events for the last five years. Episodes were characterized by walking around the home, leaving the home, and driving on occasion. He reported at least one minor car accident as a result of sleep driving. He also reported an injury resulting from a fall in his home while sleep walking. Several security measures were implemented, including door gates, door alarms, and hiding car keys. His family slept in different bedrooms with locked doors for safety. The patient’s chronic insomnia improved with cognitive behavioral therapy, leading to an average sleep time of five hours per night with no reported hypersomnia or daytime fatigue. After his initial evaluation, he was referred for a mandibular advancement device for treatment of his OSA, due to prior poor compliance with positive airway pressure therapy related to his PTSD. Optimizing his OSA helped decrease arousals that might trigger sleep walking events. He also maintained close follow up with mental health for pharmacotherapy and psychological therapy. Treatment with clonazepam 0.25 mg at bedtime was initiated given the severity of his somnambulism. Conclusion The use of a benzodiazepine can reduce slow wave sleep duration by its effect on the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Our patient had multiple risk factors for parasomnias, with severe, frequent episodes of sleepwalking leading to self-injury. His treatment involved both pharmacotherapy as well as optimization of underlying triggers. Support (if any):",

      "title": "Dreaming during REM sleep: autobiographically meaningful or a simple reflection of a Hebb'ian-based memory consolidation process?",
      "abstract": "REM sleep is a state of desynchronized electrophysiological activity of the brain. It is usually accompanied by mental activity characterized by a succession of complex visual experiences commonly referred to as dreaming. Although REM sleep and dreaming are not implicitly conjoined, when they co-occur, they have a very distinct phenomenology, as, typically, the dream plot is bizarre and incohesive which is mirrored in heightened brain activation coupled with strongly attenuated coherence levels. At the same time, owing to increased limbic system activity, REM sleep dreams are highly emotional. Moreover, concrete emotions are often unrelated to dream events. Nevertheless, REM sleep dreams are often subjectively perceived as story-like and autobiographically meaningful. Indeed, elements of salient life events, attachment figures, and personally relevant emotions, especially trauma, seem to have a higher probability of re-appearing in dreams, albeit the dream plot itself remains highly distorted. This has prompted several theories on the interpretability of dreams, some authors leaning towards dreams reflecting waking mentation, others suggesting complete dissociation between waking and dreaming, both sides not fully accounting for empirical findings. In this review, we provide an overview of recent findings on the factors mediating REM sleep neurophysiology and dream content. As a first step towards integration of conflicting research results, we introduce a testable model (Trace-Spur-model) based on Hebb'ian theory of neural networks, proposing that dream bizarreness is a function of state-related modulations in synaptic strength allowing for hyper-associative mental activity, possibly enabling either a restructuring and integrative consolidation or extinction of learning experiences acquired in waking. In this model, dreams are viewed as phenomenological expressions of this neurophysiologic activity where dream recall allows a fragmentary witnessing of such processes, similar to peeking into an enduring and complex networking system. However, the content of the recollected dream is probably strongly deterred by autobiographical memory bias, favoring those images we can form some sort of association with.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "abstract": "Sleep structure is qualitatively and quantitatively changed by aging. The elderly usually go to bed in early evening and wake up in early morning, and they also take several naps in the day time. The polyphasic sleep is one of the typical sleep patterns found in the elderly. Comparing the sleep of the elderly with that of young adults by the method of polysomnography, the characteristics of the sleep of the elderly are in the prolongation of sleep latency, shortening of total sleep time, increase of Stage W and Stage 1, decrease of Stage 3 and 4, and also decrease of Stage REM and the advance of REM phase. Insomnia is a frequently observed symptom in the elderly. The so-called psychophysiological insomnia due to transient psychological or situational stress is common in the elderly. However, insomnia following the mental disturbance (depression), chronic use of drug or alcohol, dementia (vascular or Alzheimer type) are also important in the elderly. Sleep apnea syndrome is recently found as an important cause of insomnia. Concerning the treatment and prevention of insomnia, it is necessary to exclude the causes of insomnia, to improve the environmental conditions and to keep the regular rhythm of sleep-wake cycle. It is also important to carefully select and use the adequate hypnotics considering the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of the drugs in the elderly.",

For acute ataxia (after traumatic head or neck injury), MRI head without contrast or CT head without contrast is usually appropriate. MRA head and/or neck and CTA head and/or neck may be appropriate. For recurrent ataxia (episodes of ataxia followed by relatively symptom-free periods), MRI head without contrast is usually appropriate. MRI spectroscopy head or MRI head without and with contrast may be appropriate. For chronic progressive ataxia (symptoms typically appear and increase in severity over at least 2 months), MRI head without and with contrast or MRI head without contrast is usually appropriate.

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are an integral feature of depressive disorders. Like the disorders themselves, the sleep disturbances associated with depression are heterogeneous, ranging from hypersomnia to marked difficulties maintaining sleep. These difficulties are to some extent age dependent and reflect abnormalities of central nervous system arousal. Moreover, the sleep disturbances associated with depression have both reversible, or state-dependent, and more persistent trait-like characteristics. Polysomnographic recordings can be used to document sleep maintenance difficulties, and they often also reveal reduced slow wave sleep, an early onset of the first episode of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased phasic REM sleep. A deficit of serotonergic neurotransmission, a relative increase in pontine cholinergic activity, and, perhaps, an excess of noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing hormone activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the sleep disturbances of more severe depressive disorders. Antidepressant medications have class- and compound-specific effects on polysomnographic profiles. Unlike other antidepressants, bupropion may increase or intensify REM sleep. While no single effect of antidepressants on sleep neurophysiology is necessary or sufficient for treatment efficacy, differences in drug effects may provide important clues to selection of specific medications for particular patients.",

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

In an already damaged cochlea, middle ear inflation and other unwarranted procedures, including over enthusiastic audiometry, can lead to further injury. In general, prognosis for recovery from sudden hearing loss correlates best with the interval between symptom onset and the first audiogram, and very poorly with either the type of treatment or the interval between symptoms and the patient's first visit to a physician.",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "title": "Disorders of Excessive Sleepiness: Narcolepsy and Hypersomnia",
      "abstract": "Besides sleep apnea, the main disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness include narcolepsy and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy is characterized by periods of irresistible sleepiness and sleep attacks of brief duration and, most often, by one or more of the auxiliary symptoms: cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnogogic hallucinations. Generally, sleepiness and sleep attacks in hypersomnia are of longer duration and are more resistible than in narcolepsy; also, the auxiliary symptoms are absent. There are three types of hypersomnia: idiopathic, secondary, and periodic. Nocturnal sleep is typically disrupted in narcolepsy, whereas in idiopathic hypersomnia it is prolonged and in secondary hypersomnia it is variable. The exact causes of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are unknown; however, there is evidence for genetic predisposition for either disorder. In secondary hypersomnia causative factors include: neurologic, such as head injuries, cerebrovascular insufficiency, and brain tumors; general medical, such as metabolic disorders, various intoxications, and conditions leading to brain hypoxia; and psychiatric, most notably depression. Although the cause of periodic hypersomnia is unclear, most research supports the notion of underlying organic disease. Often, the evaluation of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness can be completed in the office setting, based on the sleep history and a thorough neurologic, general medical, and psychiatric assessment. Whenever indicated, ancillary laboratory studies, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans, should be performed. Sleep laboratory recordings generally are not necessary unless there is suspicion of sleep apnea or narcolepsy in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "While many people experience periods of worry in their lives, those with an anxious worrying temperament have a tendency to worry most of the time, seemingly over the most trivial incidents and situations. They are often described by others as being ‘highly strung’ or ‘nervy’. Domains of anxiety may include worrying that the worst will happen even after minor events, being especially sensitive about unexpected changes in their immediate environment, and getting upset over minor things that go wrong. People with this type of temperament are easily upset and stressed, and can seem tense and jumpy. When distressed, they tend to find comfort in talking to close friends about their worries and in seeking reassurance, or going quiet and keeping to themselves. Sometimes they may resort to temporary relief from their worries by engaging in pleasurable activities as a means of distraction.",

      "title": "Sedation with Antipsychotics: Manage, Don't Accept Adverse 'Calming' Effect",
      "abstract": "Sedation is a frequent side effect of antipsychotics, especially at relatively high doses. Antipsychotics' sedative effects can reduce agitation in acute psychosis and promote sleep in insomnia, but long-term sedation may: [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] * interfere with schizophrenia patients' efforts to go to work or school or engage in normal socialization * prevent improvement from psychosocial training, psychiatric rehabilitation, and other treatments. This article discusses how to manage acute psychosis without oversedation and ways to address persistent sedation and chronic insomnia with less-sedating antipsychotics or adjunctive medications. Neurobiology or psychopharmacology? Many patients experience only mild, transient somnolence at the beginning of antipsychotic treatment, and most develop some tolerance to the sedating effects with continued administration. Others may have persistent daytime sedation that interferes with normal functioning. Sedation is especially common in elderly patients receiving antipsychotics. Compared with younger patients, older patients receiving the same doses of the same medications become more heavily sedated for longer periods of time. The resulting sedation can impair arousal levels during the day and increase the risk of falls. Sedation can occur with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), but it is seen more commonly and tends to be more severe with low-potency FGAs than with SGAs. Clinical challenges come with: * distinguishing between sedation and negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition, amotivation, withdrawal, and anhedonia * determining whether an individual's cognitive impairment is related to the antipsychotic's sedative properties. Because the treatments are different, it is important to try to distinguish negative symptoms and/or cognitive impairment related to schizophrenia's neurobiology from sedation related to the antipsychotic. Ask patients if they nap during the day or just lie around, and if they want to do things but can't: * If they want to do things but feel too tired, this likely is sedation caused by the antipsychotic. Treatment might be a dose reduction. * If they are not interested in doing things, the likely cause is negative symptoms. Treatment might be a medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. * If they want to do things but cannot organize themselves to be able to do them, this likely is cognitive impairment. Treatment might be cognitive training or remediation. Efficacy and sedation Antipsychotics are thought to exert their effect by antagonism of postsynaptic dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptors and possibly other receptors in the brain. Four SGAs--risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone--act as dopamine D2 and 5HT2A antagonists. Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5HT1A partial agonist, and serotonin 5HT2A antagonist. (1) Efficacy data comparing SGAs with each other and with FGAs vary, but all 5 of these SGAs have been shown to be effective antipsychotics. (2-4) They also generally cause less sedation than FGAs. Patients with acute exacerbation of psychosis often have insomnia and frequently report paranoia that something will happen to them while they sleep. When treating agitated patients, many clinicians consider calming effects and true antipsychotic effects to be one in the same, which is not correct. All available antipsychotics are, on average, equally effective in treating acute psychotic symptoms but vary considerably in the amount of sedation they produce. Studies of short-acting injectable SGAs, such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole, have shown that agitation and acute symptoms can be controlled without significant sedation. (5,6) Antipsychotic effects are not immediate and historically were thought to occur over several weeks. …",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep-related complaint and the second most common overall complaint (after pain) reported in primary care settings. It affects 35% of the general population, according to the 1984 report of the National Institutes of Mental Health (1). Insomnia is not defined by total sleep time but by the inability to obtain sleep of sufficient length or quality to produce refreshment the following morning. For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep. Contrary to popular lore, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most frequent causes of insomnia. Insomnias can be divided into two major categories: the primary insomnias and the secondary insomnias. As discussed elsewhere in this volume, primary insomnias are conditions in which the insomnia is the main pathophysiological process, whereas secondary insomnias are conditions where the insomnia is a symptom of another disorder.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia defined by intermittent loss of electromyographic atonia during REM sleep with emergence of complex and vigorous behaviors. Punching, kicking, and leaping from bed during attempted dream enactment caused repeated injury in nine of our first ten adult patients. Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient. (<i>JAMA</i>1987;257:1786-1789)",

      "title": "Sleep and Biological Clocks",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

      "abstract": "During the wake-sleep transition and sleep, diverse motor phenomena such as hypnagogic foot tremor may occur in the lower extremities. We investigated the relevance of this phenomenon in 375 consecutive subjects examined polysomnographically in a sleep disorders center. Rhythmic feet movements while falling asleep (RFM) were found in 28 subjects (7.5%). RFM occurred mostly as single, short series with a duration of between 10 and 15 seconds. They had a high night-to-night variability and were detected as rhythmic, oscillating movements of the whole foot or toes. Surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings displayed series of repetitive phasic bursts with a periodicity mostly between 1 and 2 per second. Single EMG burst duration varied between 300 and 700 msec. RFM at highest intensity occurred during presleep wakefulness, and usually persisted in sleep stages 1 and 2. RFM did not have a major sleep-disturbing effect in any of the affected subjects. Due to its high prevalence and the lack of a major sleep-disturbing effect, short series of RFM could be considered a quasiphysiological phenomenon. However, in more severe forms of RFM with evidence of a sleep-disturbing effect, RFM should be considered abnormal.",

      "title": "Seizures And Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "title": "Emergence Delirium in children",
      "abstract": "Delirium after anesthesia, also known as emergence delirium (ED) is a clinical condition in which patients have alterations to their attention, awareness, and perceptions. In children, this often results in behavioral disturbances such as crying, sobbing, thrashing and disorientation. Emergence Agitation (EA) and Emergence Delirium (ED) are commonly used interchangeably; they describe two distinct conditions with emergence delirium being described in the anesthesia literature as a state of mental confusion, agitation, and dis-inhibition marked by some degree of hyper-excitability during recovery from general anesthesia. The commonly reported incidence of emergence delirium is about 10% to 30% of paediatric patients. Risk factors associated with emergence delirium are age, preexisting behaviours, types of surgery and the use of volatile anaesthesia. Transient agitation - delirium from sevoflurane anesthesia can lead to a variety of adverse events, such as airway spasm, shedding or displaced tracheal tube, dehiscence, or bleeding. Volatile anaesthetics may affect brain activity by interfering with the balance between neuronal synaptic inhibition and excitation in the central nervous system. Elevated postoperative pain has been suggested to underlie ED. But given that ED is seen in patients undergoing MRI, pain cannot be the sole cause. Treatment options include the use of premedication, analgesic adjuvants, single dose of propofol at the conclusion of the case. Midazolam premedication, intraoperative dexmedetomidine and fentanyl were associated with lower incidence of ED. The incidence of ED in patients receiving propofol is markedly lower than those receiving sevoflurane, despite the similar rapid emergence profile of both agents. Paediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale, developed specifically for children, is a valid and reliable scale. Watcha score is a simpler, reliable tool to measure emergence behaviour. There has been considerable progress in the neuroscience of anaesthesia and the application of new pharmacological agents, but the mystery behind the exact mechanism of ED is elusive. ED is a diagnosis of exclusion once other causes have been dismiss. There is no strong evidence of long-term effects and outcomes in children who developed emergence delirium after anesthesia. Prevention may be the best treatment but no one medication is entirely effective.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Noise‐induced hearing loss due to intense and long‐term noise exposure is no longer disputed since the etiology is well defined. However, the influence of noise on the vegetative functions is not so clear. In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise‐induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well‐being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary‐effects (e.g. awakenings) and after‐effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after‐effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration. Some results indicate a higher sensitivity of critical groups (e.g. old people, the sick, children, pregnant women).",

      "title": "Resolution of stuttering during ketamine treatment: a case report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Stuttering may include repetition of words in whole or part, difficulty saying words, and elongated pauses in speech. Approximately 5% of children stutter for a period lasting 6 months or more. Most of those children stop stuttering as they approach adulthood, but the condition persists in approximately 1% of adults. The cause of stuttering is unknown. Adults who stutter face substantial burdens in many aspects of their lives. Stutterers may choose not to pursue meaningful employment opportunities, may not be hired for positions they seek, or may be denied promotions or positive performance evaluations. Stuttering can cause physical tension from fear of speaking. Social challenges arise when a person who stutters is seen as less capable or of lower intelligence than fluent speakers. Stuttering causes emotional difficulties through the frustration and embarrassment that disfluent speakers feel. Stutterers may experience a general loss of self-esteem and personal satisfaction in life. Speech therapy is the primary intervention for stuttering. Medications have been investigated as treatments for stuttering, but no medication has been identified that has widespread effectiveness. Case presentation A 60-year-old white non-Hispanic woman who had been a near lifelong stutterer was prescribed ketamine for an unrelated condition and experienced an almost immediate resolution of her stuttering. Conclusions Many possible pharmacological treatments for stuttering have been studied. Some medications appear to be effective in some patients; some appear to be more generally effective but have negative side effects. No reporting in relevant literature has addressed a possible role for ketamine in stuttering treatment. On the basis of this case report, research on the effect of ketamine on stuttering would be useful. Any effective treatment for stuttering would have a significant positive effect on quality of life for persons who stutter.",

Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses together with sleep disorders and astheno-neurotic syndrome [3]. Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

      "title": "1226 Shift Workers Acting Out? A Case of Shift Work Sleep Disorder Causing REM Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) is the manifestation of dream enactment with the failure of muscle atonia during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Shift work sleep disorder presents as sleep disruption and/or excessive sleepiness due to an atypical work schedule. Here we show a unique case of RBD provoked by a longstanding history of shift work sleep disorder. Report of case(s) 67-year-old male with shift work sleep disorder, hypertension, and depression who presented for evaluation of RBD. Patient recently retired as a night shift worker and was taking melatonin and citalopram for more than 20 years. For the past several months, the patient has been having episodes of acting out his dreams, such as punching his wife if he was dreaming about punching someone in his sleep. Patient’s polysomnography showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA) in the chin and limb leads with 30% of the 30-s epochs having chin EMG activity with bilateral flexor digitorum superficialis (FDA) phasic EMG activity. Patient’s melatonin dose was increased and he was also started on benzodiazepine with control of his symptoms. Conclusion The common risk factors of RBD include Parkinson’s Disease, occupational toxin exposure, antidepressants, psychological stress (PTSD), or compromised health conditions (such as smoking or cardiovascular diseases). The patient has a chronic use of citalopram but antidepressant-induced RBD usually presents in the fourth/fifth decade of life. A review of literature indicates no cases of shift work disorder causing RBD. However, disruptions in the circadian rhythm put shift workers at an increased risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and psychological disorders, all exposures for RBD. Patient developed shift work sleep disorder causing sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia with a disturbance in the circadian rhythm, ultimately leading to an increased risk for developing RBD. Treatment for RBD includes melatonin as the first-line treatment with addition of low-dose clonazepam or cholinergic agents. With the increasing prevalence of shift work, it is imperative to understand the risks of shift work and identify sleep disorders that may arise, such as RBD, through more research.

      "abstract": "The concept of analgo-sedation in intensive care medicine has changed considerably since the last decades. Deep sedation, keeping patients artificially unconscious, is not necessary anymore, it postpones weaning from mechanical ventilation, it provokes complications, and prolongs the length of ICU stay. On the other hand, recent surveys have shown that patients recall their intensive care experience still as stressing and painful. This need more awareness of patient's pain and the readiness to give analgesics particularly before painful procedures. The frightening environment of the ICU, sleep deprivation, pain and discomfort related not only to the actual dysfunctions, but even more to the stressing procedures of care and treatment, make a certain level of sedation necessary. But patients' discomfort may also originate from many other reasons, such as hypoxaemia, hypotension, cardiac failure, drugs overdose or withdrawal, or simply from an uncomfortable body position. These sometimes non-obvious reasons have to be carefully looked for in order to treat the problem effectively. Delirium and other mental problems are common in critically ill patients. They have to be diagnosed with particular attention and treated specifically. Sedatives must be carefully adapted to the individual needs and the actual situation. Modern modes of mechanical ventilation allows lower levels of sedation. Regularly repeated assessment of the sedation level (e.g. by Ramsay score) is mandatory; a sedation protocol seems advantageous. To avoid inadvertent accumulation and overdose, it is recommended to keep the patient at a sedation level at which communication is still possible. A daily interruption of the sedation has shown to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay.",

      "abstract": "The correlations between sleep and prolonged epileptic activity are discussed on the basis of the status classification of Gastaut (1983). Little information is available on the interrelation of sleep and the status of tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal status). Most important is the therapeutical management of these cases. Tonic seizures have been reported to occur in large numbers during NREM sleep in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A status-like increase is possible. Tonic seizures occur almost exclusively during sleep. Myoclonic status epilepticus arising (a) in the course of primary generalized epilepsy and (b) in the course of encephalopathies, are usually markedly attenuated during sleep. In absence status (petit mal status) synchronized sleep generally fragments the continuous discharge which is replaced by isolated bursts of polyspikes, or polyspike and wave complexes. The absence status can recur upon awaking during the night or in the morning. The abnormal EEG activity of a petit mal status can, however, occasionally persist during the whole night. Improvement as well as activation during sleep have been observed in elementary (= simple) partial status epilepticus; improvement seems to be more frequent. Epilepsia partialis continua may persist or decrease during sleep. An increase as well as decrease of motor phenomena has been observed during the REM stages. 'Epileptic aphasia' of childhood is associated with subclinical bioelectric status epilepticus during sleep. The electrical status epilepticus must be delineated as a separate group. The term encephalopathy related to electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep (ESES) has been proposed on the basis of associated psychic syndromes. This form of status epilepticus disappears during the waking state and during REM sleep. Cases with hypsarrhythmia without clinical signs may also be classified under the group of electrical or bioelectrical status. In some cases, a continuous hypsarrhythmia is observed only during sleep. In this context, one must also mention those patients who demonstrate continuous activation of spikes, or spike and wave potentials (without clinical seizures) during eye closure.",

Excessive daytime sleepiness is common in individuals experiencing sleep disturbances. The general view of sleep regulation is that two main processes are integrated to control the amount and timing of sleep. Given the heterogenous state of the sleep/wake cycle, supplying an answer to the simple question as to why an organism sleeps is very complex, and several theories have been proposed.

He simply confuses the matter by gratuitously suggesting that an alarm system has to be either off or maximally on. Clearly many physiological alarm systems produce mounting discomfort and activation but do not lead to a full-fledged maximum reaction unless adaptive action has failed to be effective. Ley obscures the issue by a physiologically unwarranted dictum about how alarm systems work. Central sleep apnea is a pathological feature of the breathing control mechanism; patients with central sleep apnea breathe insufficiently except during full wakefulness. Such patients are quite similar to patients with the Ondine curse, so this does not contradict my views. In obstructive sleep apnea, obesity or upper airway narrowing may result in hypoxia and hypercapnia, which may induce central apnea. During sleep apnea, the usual response",

      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC.

      "title": "Sleep Disturbances in the Aftermath of Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sleep disturbances, including nightmares and insomnia, are prominent following trauma and with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and likely contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder. Findings from laboratory studies of PTSD have been inconsistent in terms of documenting objective impaired sleep maintenance but have been somewhat more consistent in indicating alterations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Studies of the early aftermath of trauma can reduce the complexity associated with chronicity and comorbidity, and may have implications for early diagnosis and prevention. Multiple studies indicate that dream content is affected by recent threatening experiences. The development of PTSD is associated with a more replicative type of nightmare content. Sleep is reported to be generally disrupted following trauma especially among those developing PTSD. The limited number of studies that provide objective recorded indices during the early aftermath of trauma also provide a mixed picture regarding overall sleep maintenance. Recent data suggest that a more specific disruption of REM sleep may be associated with the development of PTSD and that this disruption is associated with an increased signal of sympathetic nervous system activation during REM sleep. Disrupted REM sleep and increased sympathetic/noradrenergic activity may have implications for understanding recent promising interventions for PTSD sleep disturbance that can be applied to early intervention.",

      "abstract": "Definition of stroke In epidemiological studies, stroke is defined by clinical findings and symptoms [1]: rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent cause other than a vascular origin. This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

      "abstract": "Three major components have been repeatedly implicated for the origin(s) of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): system, minor sickness and surroundings. All these factors also frame infant temperament, and therefore it seems logical to suppose that the babies who either succumb to or are at risk of SIDS may present with certain behavioural features. The infants who have died of SIDS moved less when lying awake in the crib, during feeding and during nail cutting; less often turned their head away and looked for their mother when held by a new person; were more frequently reported to show an extreme response (either almost never protested or almost always objected) when approached by someone other than main caregiver; and exhibited extreme behavioural patterns when the infant’s vocalising on waking up was studied. The infants who died of SIDS had lower activity scores. An unfavourable microenvironment can increase the risk of SIDS, and the babies facing less developmental stimulation had a more negative mood and were less distractible; less organised infants presented with a more negative mood, less distractible behaviour, lower rhythmicity, lower persistence and lower adaptability. The infants born to smoking mothers who are at risk of SIDS had more intensive reactions. The low‐birth‐weight infants who are at high risk of SIDS were more withdrawing and less adaptable. Infant–parent(s) bed sharing may increase the risk of SIDS, and solitary sleeping infants had a more positive mood and were more persistent. Use of a pacifier may be protective against SIDS, and pacifier users presented with higher rhythmicity. Prone sleep is known to increase the risk of SIDS, and the lowest persistence was a feature of those babies who were usually put to sleep supine and found prone. Infants who snored and/or had noisy breathing in sleep were characterised by more negative mood. Infants with signs of repetitive regurgitation were less distractible.",

Physiological changes are minimal during moderate sleep loss, but mood changes are clearly noticeable. The most likely sleep problems for aircrew members are those associated with disruption of sleep- wakefulness cycles and partial sleep loss. Consistent performance decrement is difficult to find, but marked increase in fatigue is a common problem. Sleep loss, both total and partial, tends to potentiate the circadian influence on performance and interact with other stressors to enhance the stress-induced physiological responses. Deprivation of sleep stage REM or sleep stage 4 produces no behavioral changes supportive of earlier beliefs that these two stages, especially stage REM, were necessary for effective waking behavior.",

Syncope is a brief, temporary loss of consciousness due to a transient reduction of cerebral perfusion. Prodromes such as lightheadedness or ringing in the ears in situations involving, for example, long periods of standing upright in poorly ventilated rooms are immediately suggestive of syncope. Narcolepsy is a disorder rarely seen in infants; however, single cases have been reported in patients under four years of age. As with paroxysmal torticollis, a connection between benign paroxysmal dizziness and migraine is also suspected.

General notes on Tinnitus: 1- Any Tinnitus treatment must be used in connection with counseling and possible other treatment. 2- Tinnitus is a perception of involuntary sound. It must be audible to the person, it originates in the head (McFadden 1982). 3- It is most commonly referred to as ringing in the ears. 4- Produced centrally, with peripheral influences (e.g. Cochlear damage). Exact mechanism(s), or epidemiology is unknown. 5- Noise type can vary from pure tones over modulated noise to crackling sounds that varies significantly with time &amp; Large intensity variations. 6- Not a ‘phantom’ perception for the patient, it is real 7- Tinnitus can be described in many different forms, for example: Ringing, Chirping, Clicking, Pulsating, Continuous, Sudden A-Geriatric tinnitus Presby tinnitus, defined as tinnitus that accompanies the progressive hearing loss of presbycusis; is classified as: type 1 (normal aging affecting the cochlea), and type II (preexistent sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by multiple systemic complaints, especially of sensory ones). B-Pediatric tinnitus has an incidence of 13% in children who passed an audio metric screening test, and 23-60% in those with hearing loss, 44% in secretory otitis media, but only 3% complain spontaneously because that the child considers tinnitus to be a normal event. There is no significant difference between children with tinnitus and those without in terms of hearing level, age, gender, or etiology of the deafness. Despite the fact that often children do not mention it, tinnitus may incite behavioral problems.",

      "abstract": "Summary Non‐rapid eye movement parasomnia disorders, also called disorders of arousal, are characterized by abnormal nocturnal behaviours, such as confusional arousals or sleep walking. Their pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, and objective diagnostic criteria are lacking. It is known, however, that behavioural episodes occur mostly in the beginning of the night, after an increase in slow‐wave activity during slow‐wave sleep. A better understanding of the prospect of such episodes may lead to new insights in the underlying mechanisms and eventually facilitate objective diagnosis. We investigated temporal dynamics of transitions from slow‐wave sleep of 52 patients and 79 controls. Within the patient group, behavioural and non‐behavioural N3 awakenings were distinguished. Patients showed a higher probability to wake up after an N3 bout ended than controls, and this probability increased with N3 bout duration. Bouts longer than 15 min resulted in an awakening in 73% and 34% of the time in patients and controls, respectively. Behavioural episodes reduced over sleep cycles due to a reduction in N3 sleep and a reducing ratio between behavioural and non‐behavioural awakenings. In the first two cycles, N3 bouts prior to non‐behavioural awakenings were significantly shorter than N3 bouts advancing behavioural awakenings in patients, and N3 awakenings in controls. Our findings provide insights in the timing and prospect of both behavioural and non‐behavioural awakenings from N3, which may result in prediction and potentially prevention of behavioural episodes. This work, moreover, leads to a more complete characterization of a prototypical hypnogram of parasomnias, which could facilitate diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "For about 40% of Americans, Insomnia is a major health issue that often leads to fatigue, reduced immunity, and dangerous driving. A good night sleep is essential for functioning and performance. It also influences mood, cognition, concentration, fatigue, and healing. Insomnia may be related to medical and psychiatric disorders, shift work, stimulants, travel, anxiety, pain, and other problems (e.g., poor sleep environment). People with insomnia (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings and daytime drowsiness) tend to rely on alcohol, drugs, and other remedies. Insomnia may reflect sleep apnea or other medical or mental health disorders that require evaluation as well as poor sleep hygiene. Insomnia can be brief, episodic or chronic. Unfortunately, many people assume that insomnia is normal and do not report it to the nurse or seek treatment. Sleep deprivation impairs the person's physical, mental, and cardiac functioning. Often insomnia is treated with medications which may have side effectives or be habit forming. Individuals with insomnia need evaluation of the precipitants of insomnia, education about sleep hygiene, and information about non-pharmacological treatments. In clinic and hospital settings, nurses are in a pivotal position to identify sleep problems, educate patients, and refer them for follow up.",

Patients presented to the author after an episode of confusion, amnesia, or somnambulism. Legal defendants were being prosecuted for driving under the influence, and the author reviewed the cases as expert witness for the defense. Potential predisposing factors including comorbidities, social situation, physician instruction, concomitant medications, and patterns of medication management were considered.Patients and defendants exhibited abnormal behavior characterized by poor motor control and confusion. Although remaining apparently interactive with the environment, all reported amnesia for 3 to 5 hours. In some cases, the episodes began during daytime wakefulness because of accidental or purposeful ingestion of the zolpidem and are considered automatisms. Other cases began after ingestion of zolpidem at the time of going to bed and are considered parasomnias. Risk factors for both wake and sleep-related automatic complex behaviors include the concomitant ingestion of other sedating drugs, a higher dose of zolpidem, a history of parasomnia, ingestion at times other than bedtime or when sleep is unlikely, poor management of pill bottles, and living alone. In addition, similar size and shape of two medications contributed to accidental ingestion in at least one case.Sleep driving and other complex behaviors can occur after zolpidem ingestion. Physicians should assess patients for potential risk factors and inquire about parasomnias. Serious legal and medical complications can occur as a result of these forms of automatic complex behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Sleep reactivity is the trait-like degree to which stress exposure disrupts sleep, resulting in difficulty falling and staying asleep. Individuals with highly reactive sleep systems experience drastic deterioration of sleep when stressed, whereas those with low sleep reactivity proceed largely unperturbed during stress. Research shows that genetics, familial history of insomnia, female gender and environmental stress influence how the sleep system responds to stress. Further work has identified neurobiological underpinnings for sleep reactivity involving disrupted cortical networks and dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Sleep reactivity is most pathologically and clinically pertinent when in excess, such that high sleep reactivity predicts risk for future insomnia disorder, with early evidence suggesting high sleep reactivity corresponds to severe insomnia phenotypes (sleep onset insomnia and short sleep insomnia). High sleep reactivity is also linked to risk of shift-work disorder, depression and anxiety. Importantly, stress-related worry and rumination may exploit sensitive sleep systems, thereby augmenting the pathogenicity of sleep reactivity. With the development of cost-effective assessment of sleep reactivity, we can now identify individuals at risk of future insomnia, shift-work disorder and mental illness, thus identifying a target population for preventive intervention. Given that insomniacs with high sleep reactivity tend to present with severe insomnia phenotypes, patient sleep reactivity may inform triaging to different levels of treatment. Future research on sleep reactivity is needed to clarify its neurobiology, characterize its long-term prospective associations with insomnia and shift-work disorder phenotypes, and establish its prognostic value for mental illness and other non-sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Hearing loss gives rise to a number of disabilities. Problems in recognizing speech, especially in difficult environments, give rise to the largest number of complaints. Other kinds of disabilities may concern the reduced ability to detect, identify and localize sounds quickly and reliably. Such sounds may be warning or alarm signals, as well as music and birds singing. The communicative disability affects both hearing-impaired people and other people in their environment--family members, fellow workers, etc. Hearing-impaired people are not always aware of all the consequences of the impairment; they do not always know what they are missing. Several studies have shown that uncorrected hearing loss gives rise to poorer quality of life, related to isolation, reduced social activity, and a feeling of being excluded, leading to an increased prevalence of symptoms of depression. These findings indicate the importance of early identification of hearing loss and offers of rehabilitative support, where the fitting of hearing aids is usually an important component. Several studies also point to a significant correlation between hearing loss and loss of cognitive functions. Most of these studies show such a correlation without being able to show whether the hearing loss caused the reduction in cognitive performance or if both the hearing loss and the cognitive decline are parts of a common, general age-related degeneration. A couple of these studies, however, indicate that the uncorrected hearing loss may be the cause of cognitive decline. Whichever alternative is true, the correlation should be seen as a clear indication for early hearing aid fitting for those needing it. Monaural hearing aid fitting in subjects with bilateral hearing loss may give rise to a reduced ability to recognize speech presented to the unaided ear, the so-called late-onset auditory deprivation effect. This functional decline is reversible in some but not all subjects after fitting of a hearing aid also on the previously unaided ear.",

      "abstract": "Snoring is a common phenomenon and a primary symptom in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a sleep-related breathing disorder in which neuropsychological function is reported to be impaired. The first purpose of the present study was to compare cognitive and motor function in 25 heavy nonapneic snorers and 26 sleep apneics. As the basis for impairments in heavy nonapneic snorers is still unclear, the influence of nighttime breathing disturbances and morning alertness, respectively, on daytime performance was evaluated too. Nonapneic snorers exhibit more slow wave sleep and tend to have fewer changes in sleep stage than sleep apnea patients, but values for other sleep variables are similar. Snorers also show comparable alertness. Deficits in immediate visual memory and in visuospatial reasoning are not found. However, there are some indications that snorers show decreased manual dexterity and eye-hand coordination for the nonpreferred hand and that they have deficits in focused attention. In addition, snorers may show difficulties in finger-tapping speed. These performance measures tend to be associated with reduced morning alertness, except for the score on focused attention which has a tendency to be related to the nocturnal breathing disturbances.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

They are able to breathe spontaneously, and they retain their gag, cough, sucking, and swallowing reflexes. Sleep-wake cycles are preserved, and so are the hypothalamic and brain stem autonomic responses. They are incontinent of urine and faeces, but they may retain their cranial nerve, spinal, and primitive reflexes. Inconsistent non-purposive movements occur, notably facial grimacing and chewing; they make sounds; and they may show inconsistent auditory and oculomotor orienting reflexes to peripheral sounds or movement. The diagnosis of a vegetative state is not tenable if there is any degree of voluntary movement, sustained visual pursuit, consistent and reproducible visual fixation, or response to threatening gestures.2 3\n\nThe condition is distinct from coma, in which patients have their eyes closed and lack sleep-wake cycles, and from the “locked-in” syndrome, in which patients are aware of themselves and their environment but have lost motor function and speech, communication being achieved by eye movement or blinks.

      "abstract": "Abstract Acute unilateral facial paralysis is usually a benign neurological condition that resolves in a few weeks. However, it can also be the source of a transient or long‐lasting severe motor dysfunction, featuring disorders of automatic and voluntary movement. This review is organized according to the two most easily recognizable phases in the evolution of facial paralysis: (1) Just after presentation of facial palsy, patients may exhibit an increase in their spontaneous blinking rate as well as a sustained low‐level contraction of the muscles of the nonparalyzed side, occasionally leading to blepharospasm‐like muscle activity. This finding may be due to an increase in the excitability of facial motoneurons and brainstem interneurons mediating trigeminofacial reflexes. (2) If axonal damage has occurred, axonal regeneration beginning at approximately 3 months after the lesion leads inevitably to clinically evident or subclinical hyperactivity of the previously paralyzed hemifacial muscles. The full‐blown postparalytic facial syndrome consists of synkinesis, myokymia, and unwanted hemifacial mass contractions accompanying normal facial movements. The syndrome has probably multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, including abnormal axonal branching after aberrant axonal regeneration and enhanced facial motoneuronal excitability. Although the syndrome is relieved with local injections of botulinum toxin, fear of such uncomfortable contractions may lead the patients to avoid certain facial movements, with the implications that this behavior might have on their emotional expressions. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "? Acuity ? Red reflex ? Pupil reactions ? Field loss # Appearance of retina, macula, and optic nerve In assessing a patient who has experienced an acute disturbance of vision in an uninflamed eye an accurate history is crucial, because it may be that a longstanding visual defect has only just been noticed by the patient. It is important to make this differentiation as this alters the range of diagnoses and the urgency of treatment. Acute visual disturbance of unknown cause requires urgent referral. In many cases the diagnosis may be made from the history. Symptoms of floaters or flashing lights suggest a vitreous detachment, a vitreous haemorrhage, or a retinal detachment. Horizontal field loss usually indicates a retinal vascular problem, whereas a vertical defect suggests an abnormality posterior to the optic chiasm. If there is central field loss (I can't see things in the centre) there may be a disorder at the macula. Associated symptoms such as headache may indicate giant cell arteritis or migraine. The visual acuity gives a strong clue to the diagnosis. A total lack of perception of light indicates complete occlusion of either the central retinal artery or the arteries supplying the head of the optic nerve. The nature of the field defect gives clues as outlined above. Obstruction of the red reflex on ophthalmoscopy suggests a vitreous haemorrhage, although the patient may have a pre-existing cataract. The appearances of the macula, remaining retina, and head of the optic nerve will indicate the diagnosis if there has been a haemorrhage or arterial or venous occlusion in these areas.",

      "title": "The Consequences of a Week of Insomnia II: Patients with Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia patients present with a consistent set of complaints that they generally report as secondary to their poor sleep, including increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective overestimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole-body metabolic rate, and longer MSLT latencies. If there is a relationship between the poor sleep and the secondary symptoms, then particularly poor sleep should exacerbate those symptoms. Ten patients with insomnia were identified on the basis of a 2-night screening protocol, then slept in the laboratory for 10 additional nights. On 7 of the nights, the insomnia patients had their wake-after-sleep-onset increased so that their total sleep time was 80% of that on their second screening night, resulting in an average of 254 minutes (of 480 minutes in bed) of sleep. The spectrum of changes seen in these patients with insomnia who had very poor sleep for a week was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation, and not consistent with exacerbation of symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. Specifically, (1) these patients had a reduction as opposed to an increase in the MSLT values, but the MSLT values at the end of the week remained within normal limits; (2) these patients had decreased (as opposed to increased) whole metabolic rate following nights of particularly poor sleep; (3) these patients tended to underestimate (rather than overestimate) their subjective sleep latency while being given particularly poor sleep; and (4) these patients displayed no significant change in body temperature, subjective anxiety, or MMPI scores following particularly poor sleep. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of patients with insomnia, and perhaps the poor sleep itself, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.",

It occurs in children of Jewish parentage, the majority of cases being reported from the U.S.A., with one from South America (Tyndel, 1955), and some from Montreal (Riley, 1955). The constant symptoms comprise: defective lachrymation (“crying without tears”); symmetrical, blotchy erythema following emotional disturbances or eating; excessive sweating; sialorrhoea; emotional lability; poor motor coordination; relative indifference to pain; and hypo- or areflexia. Inconstant symptoms are: intermittent hypertension; periodic vomiting which may threaten life; liability to respiratory diseases; frequent unexplained bouts of pyrexia; attacks of apnoea during the first year of life; corneal ulceration; orthopaedic changes (scoliosis, pes cavus); and epileptiform convulsions (Riley, 1952).

The incidence of this disorder is increasing and it is no longer uncommon to encounter a child or adult with some form of autism spectrum disorder in their own environment.\r\n Despite this, autism is still a significant unknown to most people and a great challenge to anyone working with children or adults with this disorder. Their specifics in communication and interaction often make it difficult to interact with them, learn, work, and other activities.\r\n Autism spectrum disorder involves different forms of autism as well as differences in providing the level of support they need to function. Despite the large differences within the spectrum, there are some characteristics that connect them. Difficulties in communication (verbal and nonverbal), socialization (reduced desire to contact people, inappropriate relationships with others, lack of understanding of the way people cooperate with each other, communicate), and the existence of some repetitive actions or narrowed and specific interests or fixations are specific symptoms present. These symptoms are more or less present in all children and adults with autism spectrum disorder. These characteristics significantly affect the daily functioning of people and it is important to be aware of them in contact with each other, and the environment must know them and adapt to help them.\r\n In her daily work, the nurse often encounters children and adults with various difficulties or mental illnesses. In addition to education, acquired knowledge and skills related to certain conditions and diseases can facilitate the process of examination, hospitalization or rehabilitation of a child who is afraid, does not tolerate changes, is afraid of examination and the like. Knowledge, experience and acquired skills on how to approach a child to a nurse provide security and training, and can provide better support to parents and the child during their stay in the health facility.",

      "title": "Postoperative respiratory arrest in a post poliomyelitis patient (1)",
      "abstract": "I read with interest this report of a patient who had had poliomyelitis and developed postoperative respiratory failure (Magi et al. Anaesthesia 2003; 58: 98–9). This should always be considered a potential complication when poliomyelitis has affected the respiratory muscles [1]. It is important to ascertain in the pre-operative assessment whether or not these were involved in the acute illness, and in particular whether respiratory support, usually in the form of an iron lung, was required. The subject of this report had recurrent headaches, probably due to nocturnal hypoventilation. This arises particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which occurs mainly at the end of the night. The headaches are characteristically bifrontal, occur early in the morning and clear within 20–30 min of waking. The authors comment on other ‘vague’ symptoms such as somnolence but this is a characteristic feature of nocturnal hypoventilation. The repetitive respiratory related arousals fragment sleep significantly to lead to the sensation of waking feeling unrefreshed and of excessive daytime sleepiness. While measurement of respiratory muscle strength may be of value, a simpler and much more widely available screening test for chest wall muscle involvement is the vital capacity. This should be carried out in the supine as well as the sitting position in order to detect bilateral diaphragmatic weakness, which may only be apparent from the fall in vital capacity of up to 50% while lying flat [2]. If the clinical features and the vital capacity of less than 1.0–1.5 litres suggest significant respiratory involvement, arterial blood gases should be measured pre-operatively and non-invasive ventilation, usually in the form of nasal or oro-nasal mask ventilation, should be available postoperatively. The risk of hypoventilation can be reduced by avoiding muscle neuromuscular blocking agents during surgery and only discontinuing mechanical ventilatory support when the effect of the anaesthetic agents has completely worn off. This report does highlight the risks of those who have had poliomyelitis when they undergo surgery, but accurate assessment pre-operatively can usually prevent postoperative complications",

      "abstract": "The question as to whether the beneficial effect of sleep deprivation in depression is related to the increased wakefulness or to the sleep suppression by itself, is made moot by the search activity concept. According to this concept, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is functionally deficient in depression and increases feelings of helplessness and hopelessness instead of restoring mood and search activity. Thus, REM sleep deprivation, either selective or not, is beneficial by breaking a vicious circle: depression in wakefulness…giving up (helplessness) in dream scenario…increased depression in the subsequent wakefulness. In addition, sleep deprivation is an important challenge for the depressed patient. The ability to confront this challenge and maintain wakefulness has a positive outcome on depression, especially when wakefulness is accompanied by active behavior.",

Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

      "title": "Recurrent fearful isolated sleep paralysis – A distressing co-morbid condition of obstructive sleep apnea",
      "abstract": "We present a case of recurrent fearful isolated sleep paralysis in a 52-year-old male of Indo-Caribbean ethnicity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Recurrent sleep paralysis is a widely under-reported yet worrisome symptom of various sleep disorders. Although a benign condition in most cases, sleep paralysis in a minority of patients causes great distress. Some patients exhibit bedroom avoidance behavior, whereas others experience bedtime anxiety, making it difficult to fall asleep. This leads to poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, which can greatly impact a person's overall health. As in our case, this led to a vicious \"lack of sleep\" cycle where a patient who had bedtime anxiety and could not fall asleep, owing to his recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, also had poor quality sleep secondary to his OSA. This increases morbidity and has many potential consequences, which may include cardiovascular events, cognitive decline, and motor vehicular accidents. Sometimes, simply addressing the underlying medical condition cures the recurrent sleep paralysis as in this case where continuous positive airway pressure for OSA cured the recurrent sleep paralysis. One of our goals is to raise awareness of recurrent sleep paralysis so that patients can seek medical help and would not have to live with the anguish of the condition. Coming forward will also assist medical researchers in furthering their understanding of sleep paralysis.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

Some of these movements, such as bruxism, might occur during both wakefulness and sleep, but a clear worsening of the symptoms during sleep is necessary in order to include the condition among sleep-related movement disorders. Sleep-related movement disorders may occasionally be present in healthy individuals, but the manifestations must disturb sleep with daytime consequences in order to be classified within this group of disorders.

In the first part of this review, the relationship between sleep and anxiety is discussed in terms of adaptive response to stress. Recent studies suggested that the corticotropin-releasing hormone system and the locus ceruleus-autonomic nervous system may play major roles in the arousal response to stress. It has been suggested that these systems may be particularly vulnerable to prolonged or repeated stress, further leading to a dysfunctional arousal state and pathological anxiety states, Polysomnographic studies documented limited alteration of sleep in anxiety disorders. There is some indication for alteration in sleep maintenance in generalized anxiety disorder and for both sleep initiation and maintenance in panic disorder; no clear picture emerges for obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. Finally, an unequivocal sleep architecture profile that could specifically relate to a particular anxiety disorder could not be evidenced; in contrast, conflicting results are often found for the same disorder. Discrepancies between studies could have been related to illness severity, diagnostic comorbidity, and duration of illness. A brief treatment approach for each anxiety disorder is also suggested with a special focus on sleep.",

The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

      "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and patient acceptance of a vestibular nerve activation intervention in chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Defined as: “Complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep”, insomnia is one of the most common presenting symptoms in the primary care setting [1, 2]. The disturbance may consist of one or more of three features:• difficulty in initiating sleep• difficulty in maintaining sleep• waking up too early [3].Insomnia can have a serious impact on work performance and maintaining healthy social relationships [4]. Chronic insomnia is differentiated from acute insomnia by individuals experiencing at least one of the symptoms described above for a minimum of 30 days [3]. Predictably, there has been a wealth of research in the areas of assessment and treatment for this sleep disorder, given the impact insomnia has been shown to have on mental and physical health and wellbeing [3-5]. Incidence rates are routinely around 9% of the general population, escalating to 30% for those who report occasional suffering [6]. Many individuals continue to report symptoms of insomnia for many years after initial onset [7]. Areas of particular interest to clinicians, health-care professionals and insomnia sufferers include implementation, acceptance and adherence to therapies that provide effective long-term management. Conventional treatments include prescription medications (sedative-hypnotics), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other alternative therapies (e.g. alcohol, herbal remedies and off-label use of other medicines) [3]. While sedative-hypnotics and CBT have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia [3,8], expert opinion counsels against long-term use of sedative-hypnotics due to residual sedation, rebound insomnia, memory impairment, dependency and withdrawal difficulties [9, 10]. In addition, CBT is not easily accessed and patients frequently have difficulty adhering to the strict behavioral program that is typically prescribed [11]. A further area of concern is the limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alternative therapies, despite their widespread use [3].One promising approach to managing chronic insomnia is non-invasive mechanical vestibular nerve stimulation, which has been demonstrated to affect sleep [12-17]. The vestibular apparatus, in conjunction with visual and proprioceptive inputs, is responsible for maintaining balance under all conditions. Previous studies have used a mechanical rocking motion to induce vestibular activation, mimicking the sensation of infants being comforted by their parents. Improvements in sleep architecture and increased Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Rapid Eye Movement and decreased Sleep Onset Latency have been demonstrated when using this technique [12-17]. A unique therapy, designed to non-invasively stimulate the vestibular nerve to promote sleep onset, has recently been developed. As an alternative to the rocking motion delivered by mechanical action, a swaying sensation is artificially created through mild electrical stimulation. Clinical studies have been previously conducted to investigate both the safety and efficacy of this medical device for the treatment of insomnia via a transient insomnia model, with positive outcomes [18, 19]. Individuals with chronic insomnia report similar issues in sleep disturbance to those in transient insomnia, but persistent in nature. Given the limitations of current effective therapies, and the recent emphasis on patient-centered care [20], there is an increasing need for an alternative treatment for insomnia symptoms. It has been shown that patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment was over three times greater than prescription medications [21]. Thus many would prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach if an effective one were available [11]. Vestibular nerve activation may provide such a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

We observed 6 neurologically normal infants (aged 6-21 months) with attacks that resembled those of BMEI but that occurred as reflex responses to unexpected auditory and tactile stimuli. four infants also had rare spontaneous attacks. These reflex attacks consisted of isolated muscle jerks or clusters of up to eight symmetric limb jerks affecting mainly the arms. Five of the children had a family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions. Myoclonic attacks disappeared in 4-14 months. In 3 patients, the jerks stopped spontaneously; the others responded to valproate (VPA). Myoclonus could be elicited in wakefulness and in sleep. Ictal EEGs showed brief generalized spike- or polyspike-and-wave discharges. Interictal EEGs were normal during wakefulness; during sleep, brief generalized discharges were evident. We propose that reflex myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (RMEI) is a new age-dependent idiopathic generalized epileptic (IGE) syndrome, with an apparently good prognosis.",

These observations suggest that memory stores in senile dementia remain outside the destructive action of the senile atrophic process, in any case until the expressive speech is preserved. Storage of the information acquired before the appearance of the symptoms of dementia is unlikely to depend on the degree of its personality importance. Before it becomes strongly manifest, senile dementia does not prevent the stamping on the person's memory, at least of part of new information (possibly, of only emotionally significant). Such material may also be stored in the patients' memory even in case of pronounced dementia. Difficulties in active reproduction of the ideas available in memory stores can already be seen at the early stages, becoming more remarkable as the disease progresses.",

In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

Parasomnias often involve the abnormal release of instinctual drives, such as locomotion, aggression, feeding, and sex during sleep, and can manifest with dream-enacting behaviors. Parasomnias are relevant to psychiatrists in regards to their misdiagnosis as a psychiatric disorder; their nocturnal extension of a daytime psychiatric disorder; their stress-responsivity; their induction or aggravation by psychotropic drugs; their adverse psychologic con- sequences; their link to various neurologic and medical disorders; and their forensic implications. Parasomnias can be categorized as primary disorders of sleep, or as secondary organ system disorders emerging during the sleep period. The evaluation of parasomnias includes clinical interviews, review of medical records, screening psy- chologic tests, neurologic examination, and hospital-based polysomnographic moni- toring. This article discusses the six most prominent behavioral parasomnias: REM sleep behavior disorder, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals (including abnormal sleep related sexual behaviors and severe morning sleep inertia), sleep relat- ed eating disorder, and sleep related dissociative disorders. Parasomnias can appear at any time in the human life cycle, often demonstrate prominent gender discordances, and can usually be accurately diagnosed and effectively treated.",

      "abstract": "Desde hace aproximadamente un mes, los familiares mas proximos (hermanos y sobrinos) vienen notando un cambio en la conducta del paciente en forma de aislamiento social progresivo hasta dejar de ver a familia y amigos, con los que se reunia regularmente. Los familiares refieren tambien un abandono casi completo de las tareas domesticas que le permitian vivir solo y con una autonomia total hasta los dias previos. Este patron de inhibicion se alterna, por otro lado, con episodios de inquietud psicomotora con agresividad hacia los vecinos, apareciendo, ademas, conductas bizarras como salir de su domicilio durante la madrugada. En la consulta del medico de cabecera el paciente tiende a negar o minimizar tales alteraciones, centrando sus quejas en una dificultad motora que le llega a incapacitar para la ejecucion de sus tareas habituales. En la exploracion neurologica dirigida, el paciente esta consciente, orientado y alerta. Lenguaje parco, de comprension y nominacion preservadas. Destacan como anormales la presencia de algun reflejo de liberacion frontal, y un extrapiramidalismo manifestado como rigidez axial y de extremidades moderada.",

      "title": "A Frequent Factor in the Origins of Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Anxiety in the Third Year of Life",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Primary nocturnal enuresis is not always due to the same cause and often several factors contribute. As the child grows older, the factor mainly responsible for his enuresis usually changes. The various current explanations appear to apply only to minority groups. Primary nocturnal enuresis sometimes causes anxiety but it is not evidence of underlying psychological disorder. The second, third and fourth years are a period in which acquisition of nocturnal bladder control is frequent and they are succeeded by a period of several years in which acquisition is rare. These are the characters of what ethologists call a ‘sensitive learning period’. Evidence is set out that anxiety‐provoking episodes during the third year of life are more frequent in the history of children who later have primary nocturnal enuresis than of children who are dry. It is suggested that anxiety in the third year is frequently the major factor causing children's failure to have learnt nocturnal bladder control before they enter the period of difficult learning. The bedwetting persists as ‘primary’ enuresis; the anxiety is usually transient. As onset enuresis is accepted as due to anxiety, the hypothesis that anxiety during the sensitive learning period for the skill of nocturnal bladder control is a frequent factor in the origins of primary nocturnal enures's is a unifying and parsimonious hypothesis. The hypothesis has implications for toilet training and for management of nocturnal enuresis. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Primäre. nächtliche Enuresis beruht nicht immer auf derselben Ursache und häufig sind verschiedene Fakroten daran beteiligt. Mit zunehmendem Alter verändert sich der für die nächtliche Enuresis in der Hauptsache verantwortliche Faktor. Die gegenwärtigen, verschiedenen Erklärungen scheinen nur auf Minoritätsgruppen Bezug zu haben. Primäre, nächtliche Enuresis verursacht manchmal Beängstigungen, aber ist kein Beweis von zugrundeliegender, psychologischer Störung. Während des zweiten, dritten und vierten Lebensjahres wird häufig die nächtliche Kontrolle über die Blase erzielt. Darauf folgt eine Zeitspanne von verschiedenen Jahren, während der die nächtliche Blasenkontrolle selten erreicht wird. Ethologen reden von einer ‘sensitiven Periode des Lernens’, wovon dies die charakteristischen Hauptmerkmale sind. Es wird bewiesen, dass angsterzeugende Ereignisse während des dritten Lebensjahres häufiger vorkamen bei Kindern die später unter primärer, nächtlicher Enuresis leiden, als bei Kindern die trocken sind. Ausserdem wird Ansich geäussert, dass Beängstigungen während des dritten Lebensjahres häufig die Hauptursache für das Versagen der Kinder ist, die nächtliche Kontrolle der Blase vor dem Eintritt in den schwierigen Lernzeitraum zu erreichen. Das Bettnässen besteht als primäre Enuresis weiter; die Beängstigung ist meistens vorübergehend. Da man annimmt, das s der Beginn der Enuresis auf Beängstigungen zurückzuführen ist, die Hypothese, dass Ängstlichkeitenwegen Erzielung der nächtlichen Blasenkontrolle während des sensitiven Lernzeitraumes, em häufiger Faktor in der Urheblichkeit der nächtlichen Enuresis darstellt, eine vereinheitlichende Hypothese, die für die Erziehung zur Sauberkeit und die Behandlung der nächtlichen Enuresis von Bedeutung ist. RESUMEN La enuresis nocturna primaria no es debida siempre a la misma causa, y muchas veces son varios factores que juegan un papel. Por lo commún, la causa principal de la enuresis varía a medida que el niño crece. Las diferentes explicaciones pueden aplicarse solamente a grupos minoritarios. A veces, la enuresis nocturna primaria causa ansiedad, pero no es evidencia de un disturbio psicológico fundamental. El control nocturno de la vejiga se obtiene en el segundo, tercero y cuarto, años. En los años siguientes es mucho mas dificil conseguir este control. Estas son las caracteristicas que los etologistas llaman ‘periodo sensitive de aprendizaje’. Los episodios que provocan ansiedad durante el tercer año de vida, son caracteristicas frecuentes en el historial de los niños que tienen enuresis nocturna desde su nacimiento. Sugiero que estos episodios son los mas responsables en el fracaso de aprender el control nocturno de la vejiga, antes de entrar en el periodo de dificuldad de aprendienje. La enuresis persiste como ‘enuresis de naciomiento’. Pero la ansiedad es normalmente pasajera. Se admite que la enuresis adquirida es debida a la ansiedad. La hipotesis de que la ansiedad en el ‘periodo sensitivo de aprendiente’ es una factor frecuente en los origenes de la enuresis nocturna de nacimiento, es una hipotesis unificante, ya que da la misma causa a esta que a la enuresis adquirida. Esta hipotesis tiene relacion con el entrenamiento de ninos en el control de la vejiga y el tratamiento de la enuresis nocturna.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral insomnia of childhood is a common disorder that results in prolonged sleep onset, increased night wakings, and overall shorter total sleep time. One of the most common complaints of parents of infants and toddlers is that their child either has difficulty going to bed or wakes multiple times per night. These nightly struggles can leave parents tired, frustrated, and very stressed. Sleep-onset associations are certain conditions that are necessary for a child to fall asleep at bedtime and then return to sleep with each normal arousal during the night. Limit-setting sleep disorder presents as bedtime stalling or refusal to go to bed at an appropriate time. When limits are set, children typically fall asleep quickly and easily. Behavioral insomnia of childhood impacts not only the functioning and behavior of the child, but also the entire household. Sleep problems in children also negatively impact parents and caregivers.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "abstract": "Fear and anxiety are common and basic human experiences. Fear is pathological if it occurs disproportionately frequently and excessively, i.e. without adequate, real threat. When anxiety occurs too often, a patient loses control over it and tends to avoid situations and is thus restricted in his/her everyday life. The most important forms of anxiety disorders in psychosomatic primary care are panic disorder, agoraphobia and generalised anxiety disorder. Very often anxiety symptoms are hidden by physical symptoms. Basic psychosocial interventions include strengthening autonomy, explaining the vicious circle of fear and also relaxation techniques (breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation). The core features of obsessive compulsive disorder are obsessions (intrusive, unwanted thoughts) and compulsions (performance of highly ritualized behaviours intended to neutralise the negative thoughts and emotions resulting from the obsessions).",

Many patients are found in bed or in the bedroom at the time of their death. Autonomic nervous system responses leading to fatal arrhythmias during changes in the sleep-wake cycle have been described in nonepileptic patients. Increased sympathetic tone alone can cause microscopic ischemic cardiac lesions or neurogenic pulmonary edema that may lead to death. In epilepsy, both partial and generalized seizures are associated with changes in autonomic function. These seizures are frequently more common in sleep.

Sleepwalking and sleep terrors can be triggered by stress, sleep deprivation, alcohol ingestion, and almost all sedative medications. This group of parasomnias is composed of three disorders occurring essentially during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Sleep paralysis is one of the main symptoms associated with narcolepsy, but it can also occur individually. REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by a loss of generalized skeletal muscle REM-related atonia and the presence of physical dreamenactment. Polysomnographic recordings of individuals with RBD showed a reduction of the tonic phenomena of REM sleep and the activation of the phasic phenomena. Parasomnias are frequent in the general population; more than 30% of individuals experiences at least one type of parasomnia. At the genetic level, there is growing evidence that many parasomnias have a genetic component.",

Williams1*, Bhuvanesh Awasthi1, 2, Paul F. Sowman1, 2, Matthew S. Finkbeiner1, 2 and Anina N. Rich1, 2 1 Macquarie University, Cognitive Science, Australia 2 Macquarie University, Centre for Cognition and its Disorders, Australia Visual perseveration is an unusual pathology that results in visual persistence of images in the absence of the original stimulus. There is often a short delay between the visual stimulation and the corresponding mental image or internal representation. The mental image usually disappears within seconds, although it may persist for several minutes and in some cases for much longer. Here we present a case of a young male, M, presenting with severe long-term visual perseveration of unknown eitiology who performs normally on all previous clinical examinations. His images often persist for several minutes and cause major disruption to his life. The onset occurred in his late teens but there is no known trauma. Structural MRI scanning revealed no obvious neurological damage. We performed Magnetoencephalograhy (MEG) while presenting spatially filtered face and house stimuli to assess the integrity of magnocellular and parvocellular pathways within the visual system. The magnocellular pathway is dominated by low spatial frequency (LSF) information and is faster than the parvocellular pathway, which processes high spatial frequency (HSF) information. This revealed an unusual pattern: M’s M170 was greater for HSF than LSF faces, whereas the opposite was evident in normal controls. In addition, M showed no difference in his M170 to HSF and LSF places whereas controls showed a greater response to HSF places than LSF places. We speculate that this atypical neural response to differing spatial frequencies reflects a mismatch in the information processing in these two pathways, resulting in M’s visual perseveration.

      "abstract": "The differential diagnosis of an episode of transient loss of consciousness can be sometimes very tricking, in particular when symptoms peculiar of syncope are mixed with focal neurological symptoms. We report the case of a 54-year-old woman who suddenly claimed, during a polygraphic recording (electroencephalography/electrocardiogram), a feeling of fear and tachycardia followed by loss of consciousness and then a tonic posturing of the left limbs. Polygraphic recording showed a critical electroencephalographic pattern starting from left temporo-zygomatic channels followed after few seconds by a sudden slowing of cortical background activity associated with an episode of asystole, as witnessed simultaneously by electrocardiogram. Muscular activity covered electroencephalographic activity of following minutes. This case provides an opportunity to highlight the existence of rare conditions such as ictal arrhythmias which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of episodes of transient loss of consciousness in particular when dysautonomic and neurological symptoms are intermingled. Autonomic symptoms (vomiting, tachycardia, cyanosis, bradycardia and asystole) may be also more frequent in idiopathic (more rarely symptomatic) epilepsies of childhood (Panayiotopoulos syndrome).",

      "title": "[Fear paralysis--still a possible cause of crib death].",
      "abstract": "There is overwhelming evidence that prone sleeping entails more risk of sudden infant death than supine sleeping does. However, no generally accepted biological explanation of this phenomenon has been found. In a viewpoint article in Acta Paediatrica in 1994 the author has re-emphasized that the fear paralysis reflex (tonic immobility) could be a cause of sudden infant death. The response consists of immobility, apnea, profound bradycardia and vasoconstriction. The bradycardia may proceed to irreversible asystole and silent death within a few minutes. In infant monkeys, this innate, atavistic reflex, which is prompted by aversive environmental fear-producing events, has the same age distribution as sudden infant death syndrome between the 2nd and 5th month of life. Main triggering stimuli are: restraint of movement (preventing flight) and sudden exposure to unfamiliar environments and persons, events for which the organism appears to be unprepared. Movements of the extremities are more restrained in the prone than in the supine position with greater chance of eliciting fear paralysis responses and death in prone sleepers. This biological mechanism presumably also applies to the winter peak (restraint due to overwrapping), sleeping outdoors (overwrapping) and co-sleeping in the same bed as another (parent).",

      "title": "Retrograde Amnesia – A Question of Disturbed Calcium Levels?",
      "abstract": "Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events or information. The successful acquisition and memory of information is required before retrograde amnesia may occur. Often, the trigger for retrograde amnesia is a traumatic event. Loss of memories may be caused in two ways: either by loss/erasure of the memory itself or by the inability to access the memory, which is still present. In general, memories and learning are associated with a positive connotation although the extinction of unpleasant experiences and memories of traumatic events may be highly welcome. In contrast to the many experimental models addressing learning deficits caused by anterograde amnesia, the incapability to acquire new information, retrograde amnesia could so far only be investigated sporadically in human patients and in a limited number of model systems. Apart from models and diseases in which neurodegeneration or dementia like Alzheimer’s disease result in loss of memory, retrograde amnesia can be elicited by various drugs of which alcohol is the most prominent one and exemplifies the non-specific effects and the variable duration. External or internal impacts like traumatic brain injury, stroke, or electroconvulsive treatments may similarly result in variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. In this review, I will discuss a new genetic approach to induce retrograde amnesia in a mouse model and raise the hypothesis that retrograde amnesia is caused by altered intracellular calcium homeostasis. Recently, we observed that neuronal loss of neuroplastin resulted in retrograde amnesia specifically for associative memories. Neuroplastin is tightly linked to the expression of the main Ca 2+ extruding pumps, the plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). Therefore, neuronal loss of neuroplastin may block the retrieval and storage of associative memories by interference with Ca 2+ signaling cascades. The possibility to elicit retrograde amnesia in a controlled manner allows to investigate the underlying mechanisms and may provide a deeper understanding of the molecular and circuit processes of memory.",

      "title": "The Causes and Developmental Mechanism of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

      "title": "Keeping Older Adults with Vision Loss Safe: Chronic Conditions and Comorbidities that Influence Functional Mobility",
      "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading of cause of vision loss in Americans aged 60 and older. The loss of central vision from AMD can decrease visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, glare sensitivity, color discrimination, and the ability to adapt to changes in lighting conditions. Older adults with vision loss often have other chronic, comorbid conditions that cause some level of difficulty with mobility tasks. Many express a fear of falling or other anxieties about walking outdoors or in unfamiliar settings (Nelson, Aspinall, & O'Brien, 1999) and hear from family members and friends that it is not safe for them to walk alone outdoors. A stumble, trip, or fall may cause some older adults to stop participating in an activity, such as working in the yard, walking in the neighborhood, shopping, and attending church services or senior center events. Withdrawal from activities of daily living and social events may lead to isolation and depression as an older adult's routines are interrupted (Tolman, Hill, Kleinschmidt, & Gregg, 2005). As an older adult gives up favorite activities, his or her self-confidence declines and begins to affect all activities of daily living, including mobility. All professionals who are involved in the vision rehabilitation process should be aware of the impact of these chronic, comorbid conditions on the mobility of older adults. Orientation and mobility (O&M) instructors are familiar with the unique mobility needs of older adults and the impact of other conditions, but older adults may not seek their services. Other health care professionals may not be aware of the impact of comorbid conditions combined with visual impairment on the mobility of older adults, the value of O&M services for older adults, or even that O&M services exist (Casten, Maloney, & Rovner, 2005). This article explores, from the author's experience, key conditions that influence functional mobility and how these limitations affect the safety of older adults. The focus is not on the visual impairment, but on the chronic, comorbid conditions that affect the mobility of older adults. Since functional vision may change throughout the day and under different weather and environmental conditions, functional assessments should identify unsafe practices in all types of situations. Training should incorporate the recognition of factors that influence vision and the implementation of compensatory strategies to maximize safe travel. VISION LOSS AND COMORBID CONDITIONS Independent mobility is a physically demanding task requiring one's body parts to work together in response to visual, auditory, and tactile input from the environment. Crews, Jones, and Kim (2006) noted the following difficulties with mobility tasks that were reported by older adult participants with vision loss and another comorbid condition: * Vision loss and joint problems: 41% reported difficulty walking a quarter mile, and 38% had difficulty climbing 10 steps. * Vision loss and stroke: 65% reported difficulty walking a quarter mile, and 54% had difficulty climbing 10 steps. * Vision loss and heart problems: 51% had difficulty walking a quarter mile, and 42% had difficulty climbing 10 steps. Visual impairment and other health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, arthritis, strokes, breathing problems, and peripheral neuropathies, have a significant impact on the mobility of older adults, affecting their range of motion, strength, balance, and endurance. Decreases in range of motion and strength may limit older adults' ability to maintain their balance when recovering from a stumble or a bump into an obstacle. Balance deficits in older adults increase the risk of falls. Over time, gradual withdrawal from daily activities, social events, and outings may have an effect on endurance. Success in accomplishing mobility tasks requires addressing many visual, psychosocial, cognitive, and physical factors, especially in older adults who have a number of chronic conditions. …",

It is also used to a lesser extent by people with visual or motor disabilities. A very wide range of devices has been developed for people with hearing loss. These devices can be categorized not only by the modality of stimulation [i.e., auditory, visual, tactile, or direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve (auditory-neural)] but also in terms of the degree of speech processing that is used. At least four such categories can be distinguished: assistive devices (a) that are not designed specifically for speech, (b) that take the average characteristics of speech into account, (c) that process articulatory or phonetic characteristics of speech, and (d) that embody some degree of automatic speech recognition. Assistive devices for people with speech and/or language disabilities typically involve some form of speech synthesis or symbol generation for severe forms of language disability. Speech synthesis is also used in text-to-speech systems for sightless persons. Other applications of assistive technology involving voice communication include voice control of wheelchairs and other devices for people with mobility disabilities.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

It discusses the prevention of sleep loss through the use of sleep-promoting medications. However, much insomnia secondary to medical illness and primary sleep disorders appear to have physiological and behavioral effects similar to those of sleep deprivation. Sleepiness is an inevitable result of sleep deprivation, and when the magnitude of sleepiness is high, the risk of inattention, poor performance, negative mood, and accidents is great. Jet lag was discussed under transient insomnia as sleep disruptive. However, it is the circadian-mediated sleepiness during desired or required waking hours that is often the most problematic component of the jet lag syndrome. Evidence that treatment of transient insomnia reduces or eliminates the sequelae of acute sleep deprivation outside of a laboratory environment is lacking. The frequent predictability of transient insomnia provides opportunity for prevention.",

A patient affected by anterograde amnesia, is temporarily less able to remember what he or she has experienced over a period of three months after treatment. The brain of a patient with retrograde amnesia is unable to retrieve or remember information or procedures 'saved' before the treatment took place. More specifically the patient with retrograde amnesia has three main types of problems: semantic memory problems (relating to facts), episodic memory problems (no longer able to retrieve memories concerning non-personal events), and procedural memory problems (no longer able to operate various devices). It is difficult to predict which patients will experience cognitive problems as a result from ect and to what extent. However, the problems are not intensified by maintenance treatment. Factual and autobiographical memory problems following ect-induced retrograde amnesia seems to have a more permanent character. According to the Dutch guidelines for ECT, cognitive side-effects need to be monitored. If patients are monitored before and after ect, they can be given a more targeted psycho-education and eventually a more targeted training course.We conclude that in clinical practice increasing attention is being given to ECT-related cognitive side-effects. Clearly, however, more consideration needs to be given to inter-individual variability. Cognitive monitoring is advisable because the course of the side-effects of ect must be followed and evaluated.",

Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation.

      "abstract": "The notion that cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions of epileptic origin can be prolonged and with an insidious onset, has meant a radical conceptual change about epilepsy considered so far uniquely as a paroxysmal disorder. Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

Case report we report the case of a 41-year-old female who has no psychiatric history. The patient went to emergency department because when she was starting to sleep, in the first state of sleep, she felts a sensation of paralysis in all her body, with incapacity for breathing, chest oppression and tactile hallucinations like something or someone was touching her entire body. Due to that, the patient awoke frightened, with high levels of anxiety, with heart palpitations, shortness of breath, trembling, choking feeling, sweating, nausea and fear of dying. When the patient arrived to the emergency department, she was suffering a panic attack, thinking that she could have some kind of neurological disease or she was suffering a heart attack. after treating the panic attack with 1 mg of lorazepam, all the symptoms subsided gradually. Discussion in this case report, we present a patient with a new-onset parasomnia, with hypnagogic hallucinations and a panic attack at the awakening. It is known that stress factors are closely associated with parasomnias, as we can see in this case because the patient was moving and she was sleeping in a new place. Conclusions Parasomnias are very frequently present in general population and they can trigger intense anxiety status that can lead to panic attacks.

Much of the time, feeling a specific degree of stress and nervousness can really help support your exhibition in explicit settings. For instance, an individual may encounter a degree of uneasiness the days paving the way to a public discourse, marriage, or another large life occasion. By and large, a touch of pressure and stress can be normal and is viewed as an entirely typical response. At the point when confronted with an impending task at work, a significant occasion, or even an arranged meeting, a great many people will experience a temporary feeling of apprehension and additional strain. Notwithstanding, persevering and solid sensations of apprehension and nervousness might be a lot greater concern. Nervousness and panicky sentiments that wait long after a stressor has passed, or which happen with no unmistakable explanation, may demonstrate that you are battling with an uneasiness problem.",

Inadequate sleep, either in duration or quality, and altered sleep-wake cycles are common reports in palliative care. The causes for insomnia in palliative care may be related to psychological factors (anxiety or depression), pain, treatment-related toxicity, or other comorbid medical conditions. Untreated insomnia can lead to daytime sleepiness, irritability, depressive or anxious mood, and accidents. Assessment, prevention, and management are addressed. The chapter includes discussion regarding sleep hygiene, the role of exercise, and the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Education of patients and their family members is imperative to address this syndrome.",

NPD is characterized by sudden arousal followed by motor agitation with dystonic posturing, and semipurposeful activity recurring several times per night. When short-lasting, NPD may respond favorably to carbamazepine. ENWs are unusual episodes of ambulation, with unintelligible speech, screaming, and complex, often violent, behavior that responds to anticonvulsants. In both short-lasting NPD and ENWs, electroencephalography may show some evidence of epilepsy; NPD is clinically similar to the frontal lobe seizures that arise mesially or in depth. Paroxysmal arousals (PAs) are even shorter episodes of arousal or awakening during nonrapid eye movement sleep, associated with transient dystonic posturing and related to the short-lasting NPD. PAs, short-lasting NPD, and ENWs probably represent a spectrum of peculiar sleep-related epileptic seizures.",

Motor or phonic tics that persist for more than 1 year are defined as persistent (chronic) tic disorder. Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

Central apnea is characterized by absence of respiratory effort, whereas obstructive apnea is characterized by continuous respi-ratory effort without airflow. Mixed apneas have both central and obstructive features without intervention of normal respiration.Obstructive apnea is considered clinically significant regardless of presence of desaturation or arousals. Cen-tral apnea is clinically significant only if it is followed by hemoglobin desaturation by at least 3% or by an arousal. It is also evaluated as significant when it lasts more than 20 seconds, regardless of presence of arousal or desatura-tion.Hypopnea is defined as reduction in airflow wave-form width by at least 50% compared to width recorded at the longest period of normal sleep, for at least two re-spiratory cycles. Clinically significant hypopneas have duration greater than two respiratory cycles and are as-sociated with hemoglobin desaturation by at least 3% or with an arousal.Primary snoring describes presence of snoring with-out apnea or hypopnea, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, high arousal index, disruption of normal sleep architecture or daytime symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for various cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes, including attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and interpersonal interactions. Sleep disruptions undermine these functions, resulting in measurable impairments in daily activities, occupational performance, and public safety. Adequate sleep supports sustained vigilance and concentration, whereas sleep deprivation is associated with attentional lapses, diminished cognitive control, and impaired sensory processing. Memory consolidation, which depends on both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, is particularly susceptible to disruption by sleep loss. Executive functions, such as working memory, impulse control, and decision-making, are notably impaired due to the prefrontal cortex's heightened sensitivity to insufficient sleep. Sleep deprivation increases amygdala reactivity, weakens prefrontal-amygdala connectivity, and contributes to emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors. Chronic sleep deprivation exacerbates cognitive deficits, emotional instability, and motor performance decline, leading to higher error rates and reduced workplace productivity. Given its widespread consequences, chronic sleep deprivation constitutes a significant public health concern. This narrative review synthesizes contemporary research on the effects of sleep and sleep loss on waking behavior, with a focus on attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and daytime performance.",

All the patients had undergone acute partial sleep deprivation prior to their breakdown. The results show severe deficiency in REM sleep and absence of stage 4 sleep. EMG was usually high with numerous body movements and bursts of tachycardia throughout the night. Nightmares occurred in stage 2. Total effective sleep time was between 129' and 250'. Most of the sleep was in stage 2, and patients woke up with the feeling that \"they had not slept at all.\" It is hypothesized that acute partial sleep deprivation prior to breakdown was an important predisposing factor, and that chronic partial sleep deprivation was a constant aggravating factor of combat fatigue. Replacement therapy for the specific deficient sleep states is proposed.",

      "title": "Sleep: universal for all, problematic for some",
      "abstract": "Human sleep is a paradox that evades detailed understanding to a large extent. Despite the fact people sleep almost every night, and despite advances in the scientific understanding of sleep, most of us have no insight or even a basic understanding of what happens when we sleep. Poor sleep, or a perception of poor sleep, vexes many. Insomnia or sleep disturbance is a very common presentation in primary care, and the effect of insomnia may be trivialised, to some degree, in the primary care setting, contributing to a lack of support and a dearth of clear management guidelines.1 An understanding of sleep and sleep requirements across the human life cycle remains elusive. As the parents of a newborn child can often attest, babies usually need to sleep a lot, but it is relatively uncommon for the infant's sleep cycle to align with that of the parents. Conversely, older people often perceive that their sleep is poor, and up to 50% of older people complain about difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep.2 Although normal aging processes can account for some of that insomnia, medical or psychiatric diseases, including chronic pain, dementia, depression, sleep-disordered breathing and more, can also have a profound impact. In this edition of the Journal we see discussion of this important clinical issue in detail. The reality is that there are a good many drugs in the pharmacopoeia that have sedating properties, and generally these agents, when given at an adequate dose, will cause an older person to fall asleep. It is another question altogether as to whether that person will remain asleep for the desired duration of rest, whether the sleep achieved will be of good quality and will fulfil the physiological purposes required, or whether the medications will continue to work if administered on a longer-term basis. Moreover, by the time a healthcare professional of any discipline has completed their basic training and enters the workforce, it is virtually impossible not to have been comprehensively appraised of the potential adverse consequences of the use of hypnosedatives in the context of advanced age. Equally, it is well-nigh inconceivable not to have been thoroughly exposed to the worthy concept of dealing with sleep disturbance (particularly among older people) by addressing underlying causes. On this basis, it is really not plausible to argue that ignorance of some of the issues involved on the part of doctors, pharmacists and nurses is driving the persistent use of these medicines among older people. Epidemiologists, academics and even social commentators with no qualifications at all are building reputations and social media profiles from being the dispensers of wisdom about the inadvisability of resorting to drugs to address insomnia among the elderly, and who could blame them? Prima facie, it would appear almost impossible to advocate otherwise. Of course, were the matter to be as simple as is presented by some, there would be no older people with insomnia: all the underlying causes would be adroitly addressed, and our older generations would have sound and satisfying sleep of adequate duration every night; but this is very clearly not the case. The reality is that many of the underlying causes of sleep disturbance for older people are refractory to intervention, severe, progressive and, in some cases, irreversible. In one's seventh, eighth and ninth decades of life, sleep may not come as easily as it does to one in the flush of youth, but if the underlying causes cannot be remediated, should this be the basis to suggest that these older people should be consigned to endure sleep disturbance for the rest of their relatively brief time on the planet? The possible downside of pharmacotherapy for sleep disturbances affecting older people is a concept not lost upon any discerning clinician. There has recently been a huge raft of attention focusing upon the prescribing rates of sedating medications in settings like aged and extended care facilities. For example, the RedUSe study, well-designed and conducted with rigour, conclusively demonstrated that the proportion of residents in aged care facilities prescribed antipsychotics and benzodiazepines can be reduced by the implementation of a multifaceted intervention.3 The nuances can be debated ad infinitum, but the fact remains that although the intervention reduced the prescribing of a potentially hazardous group of drugs, the long-term outcomes (both clinical and economic) associated with doing so were not assessed. Proponents will point to the prevention of possible harm associated with a higher rate of usage were the intervention not implemented, but of course, in the absence of measurement of long-term clinical outcomes, we cannot be sure. In the meantime, other parameters that escaped measurement included those related to quality of life, injuries that may arise because of agitated behaviour and consumer preference. There can be no denying that hypnosedatives and other psychotropic drugs have the potential to cause harm for older people but, like the case for other clinical situations, both sides of the equation warrant consideration. There are dozens of examples of widely used drugs with serious adverse effects that are more common among the elderly, but it is of interest that hypnosedatives have been singled out for special attention. Like the starting position established for the construct of the RedUSe study, the respected Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults4 make it very clear that the learned consensus panel assembled to determine the ratings considers that benzodiazepines and antipsychotics should be avoided for older people if possible. By contrast, the guidance provided in relation to anticoagulants is less strongly worded than for benzodiazepines – an interesting observation, given that on the basis of per capita usage rates, it could be argued that the former drugs create more iatrogenic harm for the elderly than the latter. To be clear, this point is not made here to argue that hypnosedatives or anticoagulants should be either used or avoided for older people: that is a matter for much wiser people than this commentator. However, it is reasonable to point out that there appears to be a kind of societal overlay applied in the consideration of medicines used for sleep. It is interesting to consider that the people who publish guidance and provide commentary about what is and is not appropriate in terms of the medicines prescribed to assist older people with sleep are almost always younger people, yet to experience the decline in sleep quality and duration that often accompanies older age, but as Joni Mitchell once sang, ‘you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone’. As is the case for all medicines, it is important that the use of hypnosedatives for older people is guided with a conservative hand intent on averting avoidable harm; but, at the same time, it is also important not to dismiss the importance of a good night's rest. An Irish proverb suggests that ‘a good laugh and a long sleep are the best cures in the doctor's book’. Perhaps that prescription may be written more often? The author declares that he has no conflicts of interest.",

      "title": "Transient epileptic amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient epileptic amnesia is an adult onset form of temporal epilepsy which is characterised by recurrent acute seizure-induced amnesia often accompanied by ongoing memory disturbances of autobiographical, topographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

      "title": "Alterations of Circadian Rhythmicity and Sleep in Aging: Endocrine Consequences",
      "abstract": "All 24-hour endocrine rhythms partially reflect the interaction of circadian rhythmicity with sleep-wake homeostasis but their relative contributions vary from one system to another. In older adults, many 24-hour rhythms are dampened and/or advanced, including those of cortisol and GH. Amplitude reduction and phase advance of 24-hour rhythms may represent age-related changes in the central nervous systems underlying circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis. Age-related alterations in circadian function could also reflect decreased exposure and/or responsivity to the synchronizing effects of both photic (e.g. light exposure) and nonphotic (e.g. social cues) inputs. There are pronounced age-related alterations in sleep quality in aging which consist primarily of a marked reduction of slow-wave sleep, a reduction in REM stages and a marked increase in the number and duration of awakenings interrupting sleep. Alterations in slow-wave sleep occur abruptly in young adulthood (30–40 years of age) whereas disturbances in amounts of REM and wake appear more gradually. This article reviews evidence indicating that deficits in characteristics of sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian function may mediate age-related alterations in somatotropic and corticotropic function. Because sleep loss in young subjects results in endocrine disturbances which mimic those observed in aging, it is conceivable that the decrease in sleep quality which characterizes aging may contribute to age-related alterations in hormonal function and their metabolic consequences.",

Independently of the changes due to aging itself, several other factors contribute to the deterioration of sleep in elderly persons.A high percentage of adults of advanced age have alterations in their sleep at night leading to somnolence during the day. The commonest disorders are difficulty in getting to sleep and in staying asleep. With age, there is an increase in periodic leg movements and sleep apnea; the most relevant parasomnia is the behavior disorder associated with REM sleep. There are also a series of problems, which although not specific to the elderly, have a greater impact on them because of their effect on sleep: lack of adaptation to emotional upsets, poor sleep habits, psychiatric affective disorders, organic disorders, use of drugs (psychotropic or others), nocturnal agitation and falls. Finally, although the problem is recognized as important in medical practice, not all doctors have sufficient resources to satisfactorily treat sleep disorders in the elderly.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "title": "Low Iron Status: A Possible Risk Factor for First Febrile Seizure",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: SEIZURES IN CHILDHOOD: A seizure or convulsion is a paroxysmal, time-limited change in\r\nmotor activity and/or behavior that result from abnormal electrical\r\nactivity in the brain. Seizures are common in the pediatric age group and\r\noccur in approximately 10% of children. Most seizures in children are\r\nprovoked by somatic disorders originating outside the brain, such as high\r\nfever, infection, syncope, head-trauma, hypoxia, toxins, or cardiac\r\narrhythmias. Other events, such as breath-holding spells and gastro\r\nesophageal reflux, can cause events that simulate seizures. A few children\r\nalso exhibit psychogenic seizures of psychiatric origin. Less than one\r\nthird of seizures in children are caused by epilepsy, a condition in which\r\nseizures are triggered recurrently from within the brain.\r\nFor epidemiological classification purposes, epilepsy is considered\r\nto be present when two or more unprovoked seizures occur at an interval\r\ngreater than 24 hr apart. The cumulative lifetime incidence of epilepsy is\r\n3% and more than half of cases begin in childhood. However, the annual\r\nprevalence of epilepsy is lower (0.5—0.8%) because many children\r\noutgrow epilepsy. Although the outlook for most children with symptomatic seizures\r\nor those associated with epilepsy is generally good, the seizures may\r\nsignal a potentially serious underlying systemic or central nervous system\r\n(CNS) disorder that requires thorough investigation and management. For\r\nchildren with epilepsy, the prognosis is generally good, but 10—20%\r\nhave persistent seizures refractory to drugs and those cases pose a\r\ndiagnostic and management challenge.\r\nSeizures have been recognized since ancient times and although\r\nimprovement has been made in management over this century compared\r\nto the previous 2000 years, there are still far too many children whose\r\nlives are crippled by poorly controlled seizures. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the association between Iron deficiency and the first\r\nfebrile seizure. DISCUSSION: 1. In our study to detect low iron status as a possible risk factor for\r\nfirst febrile seizures 50 cases and 50 age and sex matched controls are\r\nstudied and analyzed .\r\n2. In the present study we found that the peak incidence of febrile\r\nseizure occur during one to two years of age and the mean age is\r\n23.26 months. This is comparable to previous studies. The peak\r\nage of onset being 14-18 months of age as per Nelson textbook of\r\nPediatrics (22). Berg et al. in his study found that the peak\r\nincidence is between 18 and 24 months (12). Similarly Naveedur\r\nRehman et al. reported the peak incidence at 22 Months (18).\r\n3. The present study depicts that the incidence of febrile seizures is\r\nslightly higher in boys than in girls and the male: female ratio 2:1.\r\nThis is similar to the study by Berg et al (12), while Naveedur\r\nRehman et al. reported no gender difference in their study .\r\n4. In our study family history of febrile seizures is seen only in 14%\r\nof cases. But Forfar textbook of pediatrics mentions that 50% will\r\nhave a family history of convulsions and 80% of monozygotic\r\ntwins are concordant for febrile convulsions. 5. The mean serum ferritin level in our study is 27.39ng/ml . It is\r\nsimilar to Daoud AS et al. study from Jordan that the mean ferritin\r\nlevel was 29.5ng/ml (17) whereas Rajwanti K Vaswani et al. in his\r\nstudy group from India found that the mean ferritin level was 31.9\r\nng/ml(24) Similarly Momen Ali Akbar et al. reported a mean\r\nferritin level of 30.3 ng/ml (25).\r\n6. Daoud AS et al. in his study found that a significant proportion of\r\nchildren with febrile seizures had only low serum ferritin level\r\n(17). The proportion of children with febrile seizures having low\r\nhemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Volume and Mean Corpuscular\r\nHemoglobin were not statistically significant. Similarly Momen\r\nAli Akbar et al . also in his study found lower ferritin in a\r\nsignificant proportion of children with febrile seizures without any\r\nsignificant difference in complete blood count indices (25).\r\nWhereas our study demonstrates a statistically significant\r\ndifference in the proportion of children with febrile seizures have\r\nnot only low serum ferritin but also low hemoglobin, low Mean\r\nCorpuscular Volume and low Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin. This\r\nis similar to the findings reported by Naveedur Rehman et al. in his\r\nstudy at Karachi. SUMMARY: 1. The peak incidence of febrile seizures is between one and two\r\nyears of age. The mean age being 23.26 months.\r\n2. A male preponderance is observed in all age groups with male:\r\nfemale ratio of 2:1\r\n3. Family history of febrile seizures is observed in 14% of cases.\r\n4. The mean Serum Ferritin, Hemoglobin and Mean Corpuscular\r\nVolume are significantly lower in children with febrile seizures as\r\ncompared to controls.\r\n5. Significantly, a greater proportion of children with febrile seizures\r\nhave low Serum Ferritin (<12ng/ml); low Hemoglobin (<11gm/dl)\r\nand low Mean Corpuscular Volume (<70fl) as compared to\r\ncontrols. CONCLUSION: Plasma ferritin level and blood indices are significantly lower in\r\nchildren with febrile seizures as compared to children without febrile seizures\r\nsuggesting that iron deficient children are more prone to febrile seizures. A\r\nfollow-up study of patients found to be iron deficient at the time of a first\r\nfebrile seizure to determine the incidence of subsequent febrile seizures after\r\ntreatment for iron deficiency would be of great interest.",

      "abstract": "Post-operative sleep disturbance, with suppression of rapid eye movement sleep and slow wave sleep followed by a subsequent rebound, seems to be related to the magnitude of trauma and thereby to the surgical stress response. In this context, cortisol, autonomic stimulation, and certain cytokines may lead to abnormal sleep. Furthermore, the environment, pain and the administration of analgesics seem to be important factors in the precipitation of sleep abnormalities. Post-operative sleep disturbance may contribute to the development of episodic hypoxaemia, haemodynamic instability and altered mental status, all of which have an influence on post-operative morbidity and mortality. Prevention or reduction of the post-operative sleep disturbance may be achieved by minimizing surgical trauma, changing the conventional nursing procedures, avoiding opioids and treating pain with non-opioid analgesics, although none of these methods has been thoroughly studied. Post-operative sleep disturbance represents an important research field, since it may have a significant adverse impact on post-operative outcome.",

      "title": "Panic Disorder With and Without Agoraphobia",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by two components: recurrent panic attacks and anticipatory anxiety. Panic attacks within panic disorder are not caused by physical illness or certain substances and they are unexpected, at least initially; later in the course of the disorder, many attacks may be precipitated by certain situations or are more likely to occur in them. Anticipatory anxiety is an intense fear of having another panic attack, which is present between panic attacks. Some patients with panic disorder go on to develop agoraphobia, usually defined as fear and/or avoidance of the situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help might not be available in case of a panic attack; in such cases, patients are diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia. Those who do not develop agoraphobia receive a diagnosis of panic disorder without agoraphobia. Components of panic disorder are presented in Figure 2—1. Patients with agoraphobia who have no history of panic disorder or whose agoraphobia is not related at least to panic attacks or symptoms of panic attacks are relatively rarely encountered in clinical practice. The diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder has been a matter of some controversy, especially in view of the differences between American and European psychiatrists (and the DSM and ICD diagnostic and classification systems) in the conceptualization of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia. The conceptualization adhered to here has for the most part been derived from the DSM system, as there is more empirical support for it. Although panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) is a relatively well-defined psychopathological entity whose treatment is generally rewarding, there are important, unresolved issues. They are listed below and discussed throughout this chapter. …1. Are there different types of panic attacks based on the absence or presence of the context in which they appear (i.e., unexpected vs. situational attacks)? Should the ‘‘subtyping’’ of panic attacks be based on other criteria (e.g., symptom profile)? 2. Because panic attacks are not specific for panic disorder, should they continue to be the main feature of panic disorder? Can panic attacks occurring as part of panic disorder be reliably distinguished from panic attacks occurring as part of other disorders or in the absence of any psychopathology? 3. What is the relationship between panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia?",

Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

      "abstract": "Patients with PD experience recurrent episodes of panic, characterised by an intense feeling of impending doom or apprehension. These effects may be accompanied by several physical manifestations of anxiety (see Tab. 5.1). A three-part phenomenological model for PD has been formulated (Klein, 1981). The acute panic attack is the keystone of this model, characterised by sudden and spontaneous, crescendo-like onset of autonomic symptoms and a subjective sense of dread. These attacks last between 10 and 30 min in most instances, and then the patient returns to baseline functioning. The second feature is anticipatory anxiety. The patient begins to worry that an attack will occur again. Rather than returning to baseline after each attack, the patient now exists in a more chronic state of anxiety, always anticipating the onset of an attack. Finally, a subset of patients with PD develops phobic avoidance. In many of these patients, incapacitating agoraphobia supervenes, as they fear leaving the security of home in case a panic attack occurs. The question of whether panic attacks play a fundamental role in the development of agoraphobia remains controversial (Klein et al., 1983; Basoglu et al., 1994). Nevertheless, most patients with agoraphobia had panic attacks before becoming phobic (DeNardo et al., 1983; Noyes et al., 1986; Uhde et al., 1985).",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal head banging or body rocking often occurs in childhood in relation to sleep, and is generally considered a developmental or behavioral disorder. A few cases of Jactatio nocturna have been considered manifestations of sleep disorder, and an analogy to somnambulism and pavor nocturnus has been suggested. We observed episodes of Jactatio nocturna in a patient with global encephalopathy and frontal lobe dysfunction after closed head injury, and successfully treated these with imipramine. Sleep disorders are increasingly recognized after head injury; Jactatio nocturna must be differentiated from post-traumatic seizures, and may represent partial or defective arousal during light non-REM sleep, analogous to the parasomnias of deeper sleep and possibly representing dysfunction of frontal arousal mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are undesirable behaviors that occur during sleep. Some of these events can be violent and result in injuries to self or others, and some may even result in disability or death. There are no predictors to determine if a parasomnia will result in violence; hence, it is importance to learn to identify parasomnias in general and intervene when necessary. A detailed patient history is required to identify parasomnias. Video polysomnography is the recommended test to use, and additional electromyogram leads can be added to identify movement and correlate events with sleep or wakefulness. The polysomnogram is also helpful to determine presence of obstructive sleep apnea, which is a known precipitating factor for parasomnias. Other precipitating and predisposing factors are fragmented sleep, deprivation of sleep, alcohol, medications, disorders of sleep (eg, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, narcolepsy), and environmental triggers such as sudden noise, flickering light, or bed partner's snoring. Violent parasomnias that result in harm can be adjudicated to criminal courts, where investigation attempts to determine the presence of consciousness in the patient during the episode, indicating intent.

      "title": "Frontal lobe seizures",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This video teaching course presents several patterns of frontal lobe seizures recorded in a number of Italian Epilepsy Centers. The general features of frontal lobe seizures are outlined in the introduction. Sixteen vldeo‐EEG sequences involving 10 different patients are shown. A short presentation of the clinical history precedes each case report. The electroclinical characteristics of seizures implicating the frontal lobe are extremely variable. According to the literature, general characteristics allowing differentiation between seizures of different topography include: appearance of seizures in clusters; seizures predominantly nocturnal or while the patient is falling asleep; short duration of each episode (approximately 30 s); abrupt onset and end; relatively short post‐ictal phase, when present; frequent secondary generalization and falls; frequent subjective sensations, usually difficult to describe; impairment of consciousness is not a constant feature; episodes of status are frequent; differentiation from pseudo‐seizures may prove to be difficult. When confirmation of the epileptic nature of paroxysmal phenomena is needed, video‐EEG recordings may be of some help. Possible subjective manifestations are: cephalic and neuro‐vegetative (even epigastric) manifestations, as well as “pensée forcée” , fear, olfactory hallucinations, non‐lateralized visual disturbances. Motor manifestations include tonic, dystonic, postural, oculocephalic deviations and falls. Verbal and more often gestural automatisms can be complex, very brief and often violent, but elementary automatisms, such as automatic hand and mouth movements, or bimanual and pedaling movements, are also frequent. In this video teaching course, we first present seizures featuring minimal motor signs, followed by seizures with a more complex semiology. The most significant clinical and EEG features are discussed. (Published with videosequences.)",

People with ADHD usually experience the following types of symptoms: (1) Attention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly. (2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

Insomnia, fatigue, and sleepiness are the most frequent sleep complaints after traumatic brain injury. Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and parasomnias may also occur after a head injury. In addition, depression, anxiety, and pain are common brain injury comorbidities with significant influence on sleep quality. Two types of traumatic brain injury that may negatively impact sleep are acceleration/deceleration injuries causing generalized brain damage and contact injuries causing focal brain damage. Polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and/or actigraphy may be utilized to diagnose sleep disorders after a head injury. Depending on the disorder, treatment may include the use of medications, positive airway pressure, and/or behavioral modifications. Unfortunately, the treatment of sleep disorders associated with traumatic brain injury may not improve neuropsychological function or sleepiness.

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "title": "Key Facts About Tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external sound present, often described as a ringing, buzzing, humming, clicking, or cicada-like sound. Less commonly, tinnitus can be heard as a musical tune or a pulsing sound in time with a person's heartbeat. It may be one or multiple sounds, and it may be constant or intermittent. It can be heard as coming from one or both ears or from within the head. Research shows that most people hear tinnitus when they are asked to listen in a very quiet environment (i.e., when sitting in a sound-proof booth). Tinnitus is common and reported in all age groups. CAUSE AND HABITUATION The exact cause of tinnitus is hard to pinpoint, but it is generally understood that it results from some type of change, either mental or physical, but not necessarily related to the ear. Tinnitus can be associated with noise exposure, hearing loss, middle ear pathology or dysfunction, impacted wax, head or neck injuries, some medications, or a period of high stress. In many instances, the cause or the trigger is unknown. Tinnitus may dissipate over time or a person may habituate to it such that even though it may be audible, it is of little consequence. In some people, the tinnitus can be intrusively bothersome and significantly affect their general well-being. Seek assistance if the tinnitus: is associated with hearing difficulties. presents or changes suddenly. becomes intrusive and bothersome. interferes with sleep and/or your ability to concentrate. impacts general well-being. is in one ear only. Individuals with tinnitus are often told that “there is nothing that can be done” or that “you will have to learn to live with it,” but this is not the case. While there is no cure, treatment options are available, and patients can successfully manage the tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a concern. Consult a general practitioner to address any underlying medical factor that may be contributing to the tinnitus. Some people require a more involved intervention, and those with distressing tinnitus often benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to a general practitioner, an ENT specialist, and an audiologist/a tinnitus specialist, others who may be involved in the rehabilitation process include physiotherapists, counsellors, sleep specialists, and/or temporomandibular joint dental specialists. Factors influencing your ability to get used to the tinnitus include current stress levels and coping abilities, emotional and physical support systems, and insight into the mechanisms of the tinnitus. Plus, understanding how all of the above interact. FINDING SUPPORT Your experience of tinnitus and its impact on your life are unique, so it's important to seek the assistance of a tinnitus specialist who can offer a holistic, evidence-based tinnitus program designed specifically for your personal situation. A tinnitus management program should provide you with a deeper understanding of tinnitus and strategies you can use to manage and reduce the symptoms. These strategies may include a combination of: sound enrichment hearing devices neuromonics treatment behavioral techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance commitment therapy stress reduction and relaxation strategies sleep solutions TINNITUS AND HEARING If the tinnitus is accompanied by any hearing loss, the use of hearing aids can be helpful on a number of levels. Well-fitted hearing aids assist with communication, help reduce the stress and fatigue associated with intensive listening, and amplify low-level background sound. This can result in a reduction in tinnitus awareness. There are also devices that combine a hearing aid and a noise generator in a single unit, and these can provide the benefits of both. The timing and sequence of different types of intervention can play an important role in how individuals respond to treatment. A person with chronic tinnitus may be grieving for the perceived loss of silence and how this is affecting his or her life. This person may not be ready for certain types of intervention (e.g., hearing aids, maskers), and may even reject any early intervention. Before the rehabilitation process begins, it is helpful for the individual to be in a place of acceptance and to start coping emotionally.

      "abstract": "Neonatal brain injuries represent a group of common yet heterogeneous disorders, which result in long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

      "title": "Chronic insomnia: a practical review.",
      "abstract": "Insomnia has numerous, often concurrent etiologies, including medical conditions, medications, psychiatric disorders and poor sleep hygiene. In the elderly, insomnia is complex and often difficult to relieve because the physiologic parameters of sleep normally change with age. In most cases, however, a practical management approach is to first consider depression, medications, or both, as potential causes. Sleep apnea also should be considered in the differential assessment. Regardless of the cause of insomnia, most patients benefit from behavioral approaches that focus on good sleep habits. Exposure to bright light at appropriate times can help realign the circadian rhythm in patients whose sleep-wake cycle has shifted to undesirable times. Periodic limb movements during sleep are very common in the elderly and may merit treatment if the movements cause frequent arousals from sleep. When medication is deemed necessary for relief of insomnia, a low-dose sedating antidepressant or a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic may offer advantages over traditional sedative-hypnotics. Longterm use of long-acting benzodiazepines should, in particular, be avoided. Melatonin may be helpful when insomnia is related to shift work and jet lag; however, its use remains controversial.",

      "abstract": "Despite an initial sedative effect, alcohol disrupts sleep persistently and should not be used as a sleeping aid. Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

There is no close correlation between the degree of peripheral muscle weakness and the weakness of the respiratory muscles. Early in the disease the maximum in- and expiratory pressures can be abnormal even though the results of spirometry are normal. Progressive weakness of the respiratory muscles results in a decrease in vital capacity and eventually in alveolar hypoventilation, especially during sleep. General muscle weakness and fatigue may be the reasons why sleep hypoventilation is often overlooked in its early stages. Dyspnea may be a early symptom but it is not unusual that alveolar hypoventilation remains undetected until complications ensue (Cor pulmonale, polycythemia, altered alertness).",

Sensoric auras like visual phenomena may occur in all of these focal epilepsies. Ictal signs may mimic non- epileptic seizures. Case presentations Case 1: Patient suffering from a pharmacoresistent focal epilepsy. Focal seizures with sudden visual disturbance, later during the seizure epigastric aura, vertigo-nausea, involvement to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. MEG detected interictal spikes, source localization indicated focal epileptic activity parietal right. Case 2: Patient with focal pharmacoresistent epilepsy, semiology with focal unaware seizures, feeling that something like a coat is imposed from behind on him, then feeling cold over the whole body, goose bumbs from both arms to head, then block of motoric activity, later focal unaware seizures with stare gaze, blinking of eyes, clouding of consciousness, elevation of arms and legs, sometimes tonic-clonic convulsions. EEG/MEG source localization and MRI detected an epileptogenic lesion parietal left. Case 3: Patient with pharmacoresistent focal epilepsy, focal aware seizures, a dark spot occurring in the left visual field, sometimes anxiety during seizures (leading to the suspicion of non-epileptic psychogenic pseudo seizures). MRI demonstrated an atrophy occipito-temporal right after sinus vein thrombosis. Ictal video-EEG showed a focal seizure onset occipital right.

      "abstract": "Abstract Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep that allows motor responses to dream content. Patients display patterns of unusual, complex, and even violent motor activities. There is a high risk for harm to the patients or their bedpartners. REM sleep behavior disorder is more likely to occur in synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy and may precede clinical manifestations by decades. In secondary RBD, brainstem centers involved in muscle atonia during REM are disrupted. These conditions include multiple sclerosis, cerebral vascular accidents, and brainstem tumors. The acute onset of RBD may associate with the use of antidepressants and acute withdrawal from alcohol. The diagnosis of RBD should be confirmed by polysomnography utilizing multiple-limb electromyography and synchronized digital video monitoring and demonstrate elevation of muscle tone during REM sleep along with dream enactment behavior. The differential diagnosis includes sleepwalking, nocturnal seizures, sleep apnea, and periodic limb movement disorder. Management focuses on maximizing safety, use of clonazepam/melatonin, and discussion of prognosis with patients.",

Insufficient sleep can have important effects on daytime function by increasing the need to nap, reducing cognitive ability including attention and memory, slowing response time, adversely affecting relationships with friends and family, and contributing to a general sense of being unwell. However, rather than aging per se, circadian rhythm shifts, primary sleep disorders, comorbid medical/psychiatric illnesses, and medication use cause sleep difficulties in older people, which psychosocial factors may also affect. Clinicians should ask elderly patients about satisfaction with sleep. Any sleep complaints warrant careful evaluation of contributing factors and appropriate treatment.",

Pain stimuli disturb sleep and nonpainful stimuli [e.g., noise] that disrupt sleep [e.g., slow wave sleep] cause unrefreshing sleep, myalgia, and fatigue. Forced awakenings from sleep reduce pain inhibition and yields pain and nonpainful symptoms. Neurotransmitter dysfunctions, for example, central nervous system serotonin and substance P affect both sleep and pain. In clinical studies of FMS and CFS, unrefreshing sleep is associated with frequent periodic electroencephalogram arousals from sleep, i.e., the cyclical alternating pattern, sleep apneas, and periodic limb movements.Conclusions: These experimental and clinical findings have clinical and therapeutic implications in the assessment and management of FMS. Diurnal sleep/wake-related physiological studies provide objective evidence that further the understanding of FMS and chronic fatigue syndrome. Preliminary studies of novel treatments that aim to facilitate restorative sleep suggest a rationale for better management of FMS and related illnesses.",

Hallucinations are mental disorders in which the client experiences changes in sensory perception, feeling false sensations in the form of sound, sight, taste, touch or smell. The patient says that he often hears whispers like the voice of the devil mocking him, the client says he often feels anxious, daydreaming. During the assessment process, the nurse uses therapeutic communication and builds a trusting nurse-client relationship. In Mr.C's case, it was found that the client experienced hallucinatory symptoms such as hearing voices, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, looking tense, pacing, unable to maintain eye contact, sad, embarrassed, hopeless, withdrawn, irritable and etc. Nursing diagnoses that appeared in the Tn.C case: Auditory hallucinations, social isolation, ineffective individual coping, spiritual deficits, low self-esteem. But in practice, the authors focus on the problem of auditory hallucination sensory perception disorder. The purpose of writing is to provide nursing care to Tn.C. The writing method used is observation writing making observations by seeing, hearing and noting certain activities related to the client. The subject to be used is the case of one patient with sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations. The results of the analysis show that nursing interventions with implementation strategies (SP) can reduce signs and symptoms of auditory hallucination sensory perception disorders in patients after being given nursing actions.",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines.

É mais comum na infância e com episódios únicos diários, no primeiro terço da noite, sendo que a tentativa de fuga do paciente pode acarretar danos físicos a si ou a terceiros. Objetivos: fornecer uma síntese das informações mais relevantes sobre o terror noturno. Materiais e Métodos: revisão não sistemática da literatura nacional e internacional sobre aspectos classificatórios, epidemiológicos, diagnósticos, fisiológicos e terapêuticos do terror noturno. Resultados: O paciente não costuma recordar do ocorrido e imagens mentais não são comuns, porém, quando presentes, costumam ser simples e sem significado. O diagnóstico é principalmente baseado em anamnese detalhada e deve-se diferenciá-lo de outros distúrbios do sono como pesadelos, sonambulismo e epilepsia de lobo frontal. Seu tratamento envolve medidas gerais de segurança a fim de ser evitar acidentes no momento da crise e, nos casos mais graves, terapêutica farmacológica pautada em antidepressivos tricíclicos, benzodiazepínicos ou inibidores da recaptação de serotonina pode ser necessária. Conclusão: embora mais frequente em crianças, o terror noturno pode ocorrer na fase adulta e trazer implicações sociais maiores, além do risco de injúrias pela tentativa de fuga. Dessa forma, recomenda-se o conhecimento da patologia por parte dos médicos para manejo correto do distúrbio, evitando assim consequências sociais, físicas e laborais que um transtorno do sono pode acarretar.Descritores: Terrores Noturnos; Parassonias; Transtornos do Sono-Vigília.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) atau gangguan pemusatan perhatian dan hiperaktifitas. Gangguan mental ini menyebabkan anak menjadi sulit untuk memusatkan perhatian, berperilaku impulsif dan hiperaktif. Adapun ciri-ciri yang tampak pada anak yang mengalami gangguan ADHD ditandai dengan tidak mampu fokus dalam waktu yang lama sehingga bisa menggangu konsentrasi, berperilaku menentang dan cenderung destruktif, memiliki energi yang terlampau banyak sehingga membuat anak cenderung lebih banyak keinginan untuk bergerak secara berlebihan (seperti tidak ada kelelahan), bergerak terlihat seperti tanpa tujuan, cenderung menunjukkan sikap tidak sabaran, dan anak dengan gangguan ADHD cenderung memiliki intelektual rendah dibandingkan anak seusianya. Salah satu subjek berusia lima tahun dengan jenis kelamin laki-laki yang memiliki simtom tersebut, dimana perilaku subjek menunjukkan perilaku hiperaktif, bergerak seperti tanpa tujuan, mengerjakan suatu pekerja tidak selesai, sering terlihat tidak memperdulikan orang lain saat dipanggil namanya, terlihat sering kesulitan untuk mempertahankan perhatian, sering berlari-lari, melompat dan memanjat. subjek kurang bisa tenang. Subjek lebih menyukai melakukan sesuatu pekerjaan tanpa menghiraukan orang lain yang ada disekitarnya. Jika nama subjek dipanggil seakan tidak mendengar. Selain itu subjek cenderung aktif sekali, kelihatan seakan tidak menunjukkan kelelahan. Metode yang digunakan pada anak dengan gangguan ADHD yaitu dengan token ekonomi, yang bertujuan untuk mengurangi simtom dari gangguan ADHD subjek. Hasil dari penerapan token ekonomi pada gangguan ADHD bahwa dapat mengurangi beberapa gejala pada gangguan, seperti mengurangi perilaku berlebihan dan mampu meningkatkan atensi pada anak dibandingkan sebelumnya.

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are important features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), however, data characterizing PTSD sleep phenomena are limited. Detailed clinical description of sleep function and its study with the use of modern instrumental methods is important for timely and differential diagnosis of mental disorders in PTSD patients. 21 war veterans fighting in \"hot spots were observed during treatment in the specialized department of psychological rehabilitation, Samara Regional Clinical Hospital for War Veterans. After clinical interview the overnight polysomnography \"Sagura-2000\" (PSG) was performed. Sleep disorders in PTSD patients are characterized by the complex of subjective, clinical and neurophysiological symptoms: Superficial sleep (restless, lack of deep sleep); Increased motor activity during sleep (number of activations of the paradoxical phase of sleep to those of deep sleep); Nightmares; Specific (defensive) movements during sleep; Frequent nocturnal awakening (increased number and duration of awakenings); The excess of REM sleep. PSG identified the most frequently related nightmares neurodynamic phenomena: Deficiency of the deep sleep (stages 3 and 4 NREM); Up to 70% of the time NREM takes stage 2 sleep; The increase in motor and EEG activations; The number of activations of the REM than those of NREM; The increase in total REM sleep time; Increasing episodes of REM sleep. Further studies are required to clarify polysomnographic sleep changes, in particular, role of REM sleep dysregulation and treatment of sleep disorders in PTSD.

      "title": "Oropharyngeal Airway Three-dimensional Changes after Treatment with Myobrace in Class II Retrognathic Children.",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor-in-ChiefSeveral scholars pointed out the relationship between the function of muscle and teeth (1). The effects of breathing on facial growth and occlusion of the bite have been identified in various papers (2, 3). A breathing disorder occurs after upper airway blockage during sleep, it has not only nighttime symptoms such as snoring or apnea but also daytime symptoms such as behavioral disorder, excessive daytime sleepiness, concentration issue, memory, and cognitive function. Sleep is a physiological phenomenon essential for performing basic human functions and is important for normal growth and development, and for maintaining emotional health and immunity. Among various sleep disorders, Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common medical problem for children (4). Among the sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea has been reported in Korean children and adolescents based on polysomnography, relative to other sleep disorders. Sleep-disordered breathing can be prevented myofunctional therapy, the neuromuscular toning and re-education of oral, facial, and pharyngeal muscles (lips, tongue, cheeks, face, and throat) through a series of activities which helps normalize the developing or developed, head and neck structures and function, with orthodontic treatment (5,6). A recent research literature review shows myofunctional therapy for those whose tongues block their airway during sleep can reduce these choking events by approximately 50% in adults and 62% in children and those lowest blood oxygen saturations, snoring, and sleepiness outcomes improve in adults (7).We now have the evidence-based studies to validate the success of treating patients collaboratively with a variety of disorders (e.g., orthodontic disorders, sleep apnea, orofacial pain) but, until recently, there were not enough studies using oral appliance and myofunctional therapy of Korean children and adolescents. Since cephalometric radiography was introduced by Broadbent to evaluate the craniofacial morphology, as recently reported (8), to evaluate the size of the airways and tongue in patients with sleep apnea, it is widely used, but, not be evaluated in three dimensions.Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a useful nondestructive method for 3D reconstruction that can be used to visualize and measure the morphological structures of hard and soft tissue on face. 3D models reconstructed from CBCT and tomographic images can display the precise anatomical structure of Oropharyngeal space. In addition, CBCT is useful for establishing realtime clinical diagnoses of patients and treatment plans (9). Programs that accurately measure complex structures of 3D models mathematically are available, but no studies have attempted to measure the Oropharyngeal space area using CBCT technology. So, our study was conducted to evaluate three dimensional changes after Myobrace (Myofunctional Research Co, Australia) appliance treatment for the children with OSAS symptoms (Fig. 1, 2). Our study confirmed the increase of oropharyneal airway dimension using Myobrace (Fig. 3). We excluded the sleep symptoms of the participating patients.Although the majority of childhood obstructive sleep apnea is due to hypertrophy of adnexaadenoid, there is no correlation between the magnitude of hypertrophy and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. …",

      "title": "Touching the unconscious in the unconscious – hypnotic communication with unconscious patients",
      "abstract": "If hypnosis means contact to the unconscious to modulate psychological and physiological functions by means of suggestions, and if this is facilitated by attenuation of the critical mind, then the question arises as to whether suggestions also have an effect when waking consciousness is otherwise eliminated, namely by coma or anesthesia. A prerequisite would be perception, which actually is evidenced by reports of patients after traumatic brain injury, artificial coma, resuscitation or general anesthesia. Moreover, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently observed after these medical situations is hardly explainable without some sort of awareness under such conditions. Even advanced neurophysiological diagnostic cannot yet rule out consciousness or sensory processing. Especially reference to perception during unconsciousness is given by the results of a recent multicenter study on the effects of hypnotic communication with patients under controlled adequate deep general anesthesia. The observed reductions in incidence and severity of postoperative pain, opioid use, nausea and vomiting cannot be explained by the reaction of a few but only by a considerable proportion of patients. This leads to a strong plea for a more careful treatment of unconscious patients in the emergency room, operating theater or intensive care unit, for the abandonment of the restriction of therapeutic communication to awake patients, and for new aspects of communication and hypnosis research. Obviously, loss of consciousness does not protect against psychological injury, and continuation of communication is needed. But how and what to talk to unconscious patients? Generally addressing the unconscious mind with suggestions that generally exert their effects unconsciously, hypnotic communication appears to be the adequate language. Especially addressing meaningful topics, as derived from the basic psychological needs and known stressors, appears essential. With respect to negative effects by negative or missing communication or to the proposed protective and supporting effects of therapeutic communication with patients clinically rated as unconscious, the role of consciousness is secondary. For the effects of perceived signals and suggestions it does not matter whether consciousness is absent, or partial, or unrecognized present.",

During this time the patient found himself unable to maintain a 24-h sleep-wake schedule. The lengths of his sleep-wake periods (subjective days) and his sleep periods were highly variable. Nonetheless, there were certain unexpected regularities in his sleep-wake data, corresponding to fixed clock hours. Across the 4-year period, there were certain clock hours during which sleep onset and waking were likely to occur and certain clock hours that may be considered forbidden zones for sleep, during which the patient rarely either began or ended a sleep period. It is possible that the unexpected regularities resulted from partial entrainment to external cues or from some residual influence of an endogenous ultradian-regulating mechanism.",

TBI-related cognitive impairment is common in veterans who have served in recent conflicts in the Middle East and is often related to blasts from improvised explosive devices. Although neurobehavioral disorders such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder commonly occur after combat, the presentation of such disorders in those with head injury may pass undetected with use of current diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological instruments. With a multidimensional approach (such as the biopsychosocial model) applied to each symptom cluster, psychological, occupational, and social dysfunction can be delineated and managed.",

      "title": "Degeneration of rapid eye movement sleep circuitry underlies rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder",
      "abstract": "During healthy rapid eye movement sleep, skeletal muscles are actively forced into a state of motor paralysis. However, in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder-a relatively common neurological disorder-this natural process is lost. A lack of motor paralysis (atonia) in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder allows individuals to actively move, which at times can be excessive and violent. At first glance this may sound harmless, but it is not because rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients frequently injure themselves or the person they sleep with. It is hypothesized that the degeneration or dysfunction of the brain stem circuits that control rapid eye movement sleep paralysis is an underlying cause of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. The link between brain stem degeneration and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder stems from the fact that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder precedes, in the majority (∼80%) of cases, the development of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, which are known to initially cause degeneration in the caudal brain stem structures where rapid eye movement sleep circuits are located. Furthermore, basic science and clinical evidence demonstrate that lesions within the rapid eye movement sleep circuits can induce rapid eye movement sleep-specific motor deficits that are virtually identical to those observed in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. This review examines the evidence that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is caused by synucleinopathic neurodegeneration of the core brain stem circuits that control healthy rapid eye movement sleep and concludes that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is not a separate clinical entity from synucleinopathies but, rather, it is the earliest symptom of these disorders. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

      "title": "854 Sexsomnia in a Divorce Proceeding and its Custody Implications",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexsomnia is a NREM parasomnia under the subtype of Confusional Arousals, defined as abnormal sexual behaviors emerging from partial arousals during slow-wave sleep. Case reports suggest that is more common in men. Precipitating factors include Obstructive Sleep Apnea, insufficient sleep, alcohol and fatigue/stress and history of NREM parasomnias. Report of case(s) A 37-year-old male with bruxism (using mouth guard) and anxiety for 7 years, who presented to the sleep clinic for a second opinion to discuss concerns around the safety of his children due to his sleep related sexual behavior. Sexsomnia was first noted with the stressors related to becoming a parent (fostering children and having biological children). Sexual behavior reported by the couple was mostly provoked with spouse’s touch during sleep. Behaviors ranging from fondling to aggressive sexual intercourse were reported to occur 1 to 3 times/week. There were no injuries during episodes which only occurred in the bedroom with the spouse and the patient was amnestic of his behavior. Due to marital discord provoked by other stressors, he began to sleep alone in the basement. A video-polysomnogram revealed no parasomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep arousal disorders. Normal REM with atonia was observed. The patient was treated with Duloxetine 20mg for anxiety after the initial sleep visit. His condition contributed to marital separation. In the divorce proceedings, the spouse argued for denial of visitation rights related to his sleep-sexual behaviors noting that the children may be at risk. After separation, his anxiety and stress levels lowered in conjunction with therapy and medication. Follow up after 2 months found the patient asymptomatic. He placed an alarm on his bedroom door, to alert him and others during sleep. There are no published reports to provide a prediction as to whether his condition would-be supporting restrictions in overnight visitation by the foster and biological children. Conclusion In this case, there was a precedent condition (bruxism) and precipitating stress and anxiety, known to provoke NREM parasomnia. The absence of polysomnographic evidence is not unusual. Forensic repercussions, in particular prospective calculations of risk, are poorly described in the literature. Support (if any):",

Furthermore, severe rhabdomyolysis can be induced in myopathic muscle by the application of succinylcholine alone or in combination with inhalational anesthetics resulting in hyperkalemia, myoglobinuria and CK-elevation, sometimes followed by cardiac arrest. Cardiomyopathy is a common feature in many neuromuscular diseases. All cardiodepressant agents must be avoided. Specific problems with muscle relaxants arise in myasthenia gravis and in the myotonias. In the later stages of severe neuromuscular diseases the main problem concerning anesthesia is respiratory failure. The individual risk of every patient has to be evaluated before anesthesia. Recommendations for the anesthetic management are given.",

      "title": "Depression and anxiety: Distinguishing unipolar and bipolar disorders",
      "abstract": "The use of steroids and supplements can complicate the clinical picture in a young man with mood swings, anxiety, and depression referred for psychiatric evaluation by his primary care clinician and a psychologist. Identifying information: A 20-year-old single man was referred by his primary care physician and a psychologist for medical management of mood swings, anxiety, and confusion. Chief complaint: The patient reported unremitting sadness that had lasted more than a year, and said that he generally felt dead inside or like a zombie. He was often ruminative and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. History of present illness: The young man's sadness and disagreeable sensations were relieved only for periods of 3 to 4 days when he felt more worried than sad. It was during these intervals of worry that he grew more ruminative, tired, and irritable, and said he could not sort out his thoughts. The patient could not recall when he last felt well enough to have fun with friends. He ruminated about the past, often trying to change it in his mind and thereby causing himself to become confused about what was real and what he might have imagined to be real. In particular, he was preoccupied with the recent loss of a relationship with a girl, which began in high school. He blamed the loss on his moodiness. However, he also acknowledged that he briefly dated her younger sister, a short time after which the girlfriend abruptly stopped returning his calls, telling him it was payback for dating her sister. The patient spent a great deal of time online looking at his ex-girlfriend's MySpace social-interaction page, which only caused him to feel worse. He blamed himself for everything that was wrong in his life and struggled with thoughts that people were talking and thinking about him negatively. Because he believed he was physically too small, he exercised regularly to stay in good shape. Medications and allergies: The referring primary care physician and psychologist had prescribed sertraline 100 mg/d for 3 weeks. They then switched him to venlafaxine 225 mg/d, which he took for 4 to 5 weeks. However, the patient stopped taking both drugs on his own initiative because they made him feel numb, and he also thought they made him feel more depressed. In the week before the initial psychiatric evaluation, his father had given him some sleeping medications because he was often tense, keyed up, and unable to relax in the evenings and around bedtime. They did not help. Otherwise, this young man had not been taking any medications during the previous 6 months. Psychiatric history: The patient had never been hospitalized and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. As mentioned, he sometimes thought he could undo the past by some ritualistic rnental action. The young man was an only child and spent a lot of time talking about this. He denied any history of childhood trauma. However, he held an unusual suspicion that his parents were hiding a birth defect from him, and that this defect was in some manner related to his current issues and difficulties. He did not give any more details about this suspicion, saying, Every time I ask them about it, they tell me I'm crazy and just make a joke about it. His mother reported that it took about 10 years to conceive, but there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. The patient received no intervention during the first 6 months of the current episode, when his family doctor was contacted. The doctor referred the patient to a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist quickly referred him back to the doctor, believing that the young man needed a prescription for antidepressant medication. His mother said he was drinking alcohol more regularly while on his medications, and that he was probably not fully compliant with the antidepressant regimens. He was never prescribed benzodiazepines for his anxiety and tension, apparently due to concern about abuse potential. …",

      "abstract": "Premature survivors are at increased risk for impaired neurodevelopmental outcome compared to full terms. These sequelae include cognitive abnormalities, mild fine or gross motor delay, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing losses, impairment increases with decreasing gestational age. Persistence of multiple abnormal neurologic signs in the first 12 to 18 months is ominous. Emergence of other findings (vision impairments, seizures, feeding issues delay of head growth) is associated with poor outcome. MRI is useful in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome at the equivalent of term gestation. Other neonatal complications as; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, poor growth, presence of congenital anomalies are associated with an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Premature survivors are more likely to have specific psychological and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, general anxiety, and depression. Individuals with birth weights below 1500 g are at greater risk for poor academic performance than those born with normal birthweight because of their impaired cognition, neurosensory defects, and behavioral and psychological problems. Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood due to the cognitive recovery over time and lack of accurate predictive assessment tools in early childhood. Survivors of prematures need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental impairment and, if impairment is present, be referred to educational programs and subspecialty care in order to provide the best possible outcome. ELBW infants without evidence of significant neonatal brain injury can recover when exposed to a nurturing home environment and comprehensive early intervention services.",

The prominent occurrence of p. p in the latter half and r. p. p in the first half of the natural night sleep could be attributed to the difference in distribution pattern of activity level of each physiological function.

      "title": "Pathophysiology of Absence Seizures",
      "abstract": "Introduction and Definitions Absence epilepsy is a relatively common subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Affecting approximately 10% of all children with epileptic disorders, absence epilepsy is characterized by seizures lasting 3–10 s. Typical absence seizures consist of brief episodes of staring and unresponsiveness and are, at times, accompanied by subtle myoclonic jerks or eyelid fluttering. No obvious deficits are present after the conclusion of each seizure, though in severe forms of untreated disease, hundreds of seizures per day can occur (Blumenfeld 2005). Onset of absence seizures (also known as petit mal seizures) is typically between the ages of 5 and 7 years, and most children outgrow the seizures in adolescence. Treatment with medications such as ethosuximide, sodium valproate, or lamotrigine control seizures about 80% of the time (Shorvon 2005). Seizures may be triggered by hyperventilation, photic stimulation, sleep deprivation, or medication withdrawal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during absence seizures reveal large amplitude, bilateral, 3–4 Hz spike-and-wave discharges (SWD) with a frontal predominance (> Fig. 30-1).",

      "title": "Characteristics of REM and NREM Dreams",
      "abstract": "While REM sleep is the phase of sleep from which dream reports are most reliably elicited, dream reports can also be elicited from any other stage of sleep, including sleep onset and N3 SWS. Reports after awakenings from NREM stages of sleep tend to be shorter, less emotional, and less visually vivid than reports obtained from REM – but we do get reports of “dreams” from NREM sleep states. Indeed, you can get dream reports without REM when REM is chemically suppressed via antidepressant medications. Just as dreams can occur without REM, REM sleep can occur without dream reports. About 20 percent of awakenings after a REM episode results in no dream report. Activation of REM, therefore, does not necessarily eventuate in a dream or at least a dream report. In addition, children who have abundant REM do not consistently report dreams until visuo-spatial and cognitive skills have matured enough to support reporting of visual narratives (Foulkes, 1982). Similarly, patients with lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex, basal forebrain, and near the occipitotemporoparietal junction sometimes report complete cessation of dreaming (Solms, 1997). In addition, Solms emphasized that disconnection of the ascending meso-limbic-cortical dopaminergic tracts from their termination sites in ventromedial frontal lobes could also lead to the loss of dreaming. Given that this tract is associated with instinctual appetitive drive and motivational states, it seems reasonable to conclude that this dopaminergic system may participate in the generation of some dreams. The loss of dreaming in these patients is not due simply to an inability to recall dreams, as their basic memory and recall abilities are largely intact. REM physiology as measured by sleep EEG is normal in these individuals, thus REM is still operating.",

      "title": "Anxiety and Separation Disorders",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Anxiety is a physiologic response necessary for all human beings to survive. It helps protect individuals in dangerous situations and prepares them for challenges. Fears are the emotional response to a given stimuli or situation that is identified as threatening or scary. Fears are a normal part of development throughout childhood and adolescence, and they change throughout the life course (Table 1). Worries are the cognitive or thinking manifestations of fear and anxiety.Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when fears, worries, or anxiety occur outside the range of normal developmental responses or are extreme and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning (school, home, social settings). In anxiety disorders, the fear response is no longer adaptive and is either out of proportion to a stressor or occurs when there is no threat. Due to the physiologic mechanisms activated with the anxiety and stress response in the body, individuals who have chronic anxiety and stress have a greater risk of both physical and mental health problems. Individuals who have anxiety often present to their primary clinicians with frequent physical complaints, not necessarily reporting anxiety. Parents also may report significant changes in behavior, with increased opposition and tantrums in certain situations that are triggered by anxiety.Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents, affecting 8% to 10% of this population. (1) The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be as early as the preschool years, but the condition generally does not cause substantial impairment until school age. Anxiety disorders can occur throughout the lifespan, but most adult anxiety disorders begin by early adolescent years. (2) Girls have twice the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders as boys. (1) Anxiety disorders can cause family distress and dysfunction, school refusal and avoidance, and social isolation. Untreated anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing further anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. The long-term social impact of untreated anxiety disorder includes decreased academic and occupational achievement and poorer social and relationship outcomes. Anxiety disorders can be accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as medical illnesses, secondary anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, learning disorders, and mood disorders.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and this finding is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The reasons children develop an anxiety disorder are complex, but genetics, temperament, modeling, physiologic factors, and exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors all can contribute. Some young children have temperament styles that cause them to be more anxious and avoidant in new or unfamiliar situations, also known as behavioral inhibition. This temperament style increases the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in childhood, (3) but many children have no identifiable predisposing factors and still develop anxiety disorders. Some individuals have a heightened physiologic arousal to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, which also can increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Maternal depression and anxiety have a significant influence on attachment, affecting the early environment and brain development of children. Maternal depression and anxiety can influence appropriate emotion regulation and stress responses, the effects of which can manifest as psychiatric illnesses, such as disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. Environmental and psychosocial stressors, including school issues, social difficulties, family dysfunction, trauma, and loss, can contribute to anxiety disorders.Anxiety is a physiologic response that is essential to the survival of human beings, involving fright/flight neurobiology and the stress response system. (4) The fright/flight response in the brain is regulated through sensory input (thalamus), context and memory (hippocampus), and emotion regulation (amygdala) systems, often referred to as components of the limbic system. This system is activated under stress and danger and prepares the body physiologically by activating the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The prefrontal cortex helps to modulate this response in the brain and to modify fear responses.In anxiety disorders, the fright/flight mechanism is activated in situations that are not a threat or overresponds in reaction to the stressor without appropriate response modulation. The release of stress hormones and adrenaline in the body inappropriately or in excess (given the situation) without appropriate regulation causes the feelings of fear and physical symptoms of anxiety (eg, stomachaches, nausea, headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, paresthesias, chest pain). Avoidance, tantrums, aggression, crying, trembling, somatic complaints, and seeking of reassurance all are common manifestations of anxiety. The avoidance and reliance on others to help manage fears may help to decrease anxiety temporarily but can become extreme and interfere with functioning at home, school, and socially and cause anxiety to worsen over time.Anxiety for some children may occur only in very specific situations or environments and for others can be more generalized. It is important to distinguish between appropriate and adaptive anxiety and stress and an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is of long duration (usually lasting for many months), interferes substantially with functioning, and is out of synch with the magnitude of the stressor and developmental stage of the child. Adaptive anxiety and stress occur after a substantial change or transition (eg, starting school) and are expected responses to change or adversity. Anxiety disorders usually require intervention by a clinician; stress usually is of short duration (fewer than 2 weeks) and is likely to resolve spontaneously or be substantially ameliorated by social support or environmental modification alone.Diagnosis of the many types of anxiety disorders is based on criteria outlined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV TR). (5) Separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia are the most common childhood anxiety disorders, and social phobia (or social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in adolescence. Several anxiety disorder screening tools have been well validated for use in children and adolescents. The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a self-report screen for identifying anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) both have parent and self-report versions to screen for anxiety disorders in youth. These three scales are helpful for identifying youth at risk for anxiety disorders and for monitoring response to treatment. (6)Separation anxiety disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders in school-age children. Separation anxiety is a normal stage of early development in preschoolers and during the initial few months of first attending school. It is considered a disorder if it continues past these stages or causes substantial distress for the child and family and interferes with normal functional developmental tasks. Children who have separation anxiety disorder fear something bad will happen to them or someone they love (usually parent or caregiver) when they are apart. This fear causes children to avoid being out of sight from the parent or caregiver or to have substantial distress and anxiety when they are separated or in anticipation of separation. By definition, the duration of the anxiety must be at least 4 weeks. Anxiety symptoms can manifest as physical complaints on school mornings that usually do not occur on weekend mornings or as behavior outbursts. The symptoms generally improve if the feared situation (eg, school) is avoided.Children who have separation anxiety disorder often are unable to be left with a babysitter, are not able to fall asleep on their own (parent falls asleep with them or they sleep in parents' room), and avoid school. The affected child demands substantial attention and time, which can lead to less parental time for other children in the family. Mothers usually are the caregivers demanded, which can result in a parent-child dyad that can exclude other members of the family to manage the child's anxiety. The child becomes dependent on the mother for reassurance and management of the anxiety and fear, thereby losing confidence in his or her ability to manage situations independently.Parents of children who have separation anxiety describe loss of their adult relationships and occupational consequences because at least one parent is home with the child who has not gone to school. Children who have separation anxiety disorder miss out on social opportunities with friends because they do not want to be away from their home and parents. This disorder can cause substantial distress and dysfunction for the child and family and interfere with the development of age-appropriate independence and academic success. One of the important functional impairments commonly associated with this disorder is school phobia or school refusal. (7)School refusal is described as a persistent pattern of not wanting to go to school, avoidance of school, or high distress associated with going to school. Although it is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis, school refusal can be a symptom of underlying psychiatric illness, most commonly an anxiety disorder. School refusal often is a complex problem that requires genuine understanding of individual and family factors to develop a successful treatment approach. One of the key treatment goals in school refusal derived from separation anxiety disorder is getting the child back into the school environment as soon as possible.It is important to differentiate school refusal related to anxiety from conduct problems and subsequent truancy. Youth who exhibit truancy generally do not report other symptoms of anxiety or issues of separation from parents. They are not at school, but the reason is not that they need to be with a parent or caregiver due to fear and anxiety. Truancy is characterized by a pattern of skipping school, lack of concern or embarrassment about not attending school, refusal to do any school work, and frequently hiding school absences from parents.Specific phobia is the most common type of anxiety disorder, but it often is managed by avoidance of the specific feared situation and less often presents for treatment. Many people have fears, with common ones including heights, spiders, snakes, blood, and needles. A specific phobia is fear of an object or situation that is not developmentally expected and is out of proportion to the actual danger and manifests as an anxiety response that is extreme and unreasonable (eg, avoidance or intense anxiety and panic). The specific fear must be present for at least 6 months and cause the child substantial distress or impairment in functioning to be considered a true phobia. Although many specific phobias do not come to medical attention, fear of needles in a child requiring vaccination and fear of choking with restriction of oral intake are two examples of situations requiring treatment due to associated health risks. Specific phobias sometimes are preceded by a traumatic event (such as becoming afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog). Onset also can be associated with genetic predisposition, increased stress in the environment, and modeling behaviors in the environment (such as a parent's fear response to a situation).Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in teens, likely because of the increased importance of peers and social context in adolescent development. Youth who suffer from social anxiety disorder have severe anxiety in social situations that is extremely distressing and can lead to avoidance and substantial deterioration in overall function. Youth who have social anxiety disorder describe an overwhelming fear of drawing attention to themselves or saying something stupid or embarrassing around others, especially peers. This fear can lead to not being able to ask questions in class, not being able to talk in front of others, avoidance of the phone, not ordering in restaurants, and not using public bathrooms. Severe social anxiety disorder can result in isolation to the point of rarely leaving home, not having contact with friends, and not attending school.Generalized anxiety disorder can have its onset in childhood and adolescent years. The anxiety centers around everyday events and responsibilities in the child's life, such as school, friends, health, future, and finances, but the distress and worry are excessive, unrealistic, or unhelpful and persist for at least 6 months. Children may report feeling tense and irritable; have frequent muscle aches and pains; and experience poor sleep, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating due to the intensity and chronicity of the worried thoughts and feelings. Affected individuals may have academic performance anxiety that interferes with starting and completing assignments and taking tests due to fear of failure or that the result will not be good enough. A pattern of avoidance can develop to prevent a feared event or the youth may seek excessive reassurance from others that nothing bad will happen, leading to increased anxiety, decreased enjoyment, and avoidance of everyday activities.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder involving obsessions (distressing intrusive thoughts or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or rituals performed to relieve distress and anxiety associated with the obsessions) that are unwanted, cause substantial anxiety, and interfere with functioning (consuming more than 1 hour per day). The most common obsession themes are illness, contamination, and danger-related, and the most common compulsions are cleaning, washing rituals, and checking behaviors. OCD does not always involve observed compulsions, and the individual can suffer from repetitive images or thoughts (eg, of violent, religious, or sexual nature) that are extremely distressing. Children who have OCD generally have poor insight into their illness and may not recognize the obsessions and compulsions as irrational. They may have trouble going to school, find they are unable to concentrate in class, have difficulty getting out of the house or getting dressed, and have decreased food intake related to obsessions and compulsions. Parents commonly are involved in OCD routines and compulsions with children and teens, and the illness can have a substantial negative impact on family functioning.Panic disorder usually has its onset in adolescent years but can occur in children. Although not the most common anxiety disorder, this illness can become debilitating rapidly. Children who have panic attacks (Table 2) most commonly present initially to an emergency department or urgent care center because the physical symptoms are acute and escalate quickly, similar to having a heart attack, asthma attack, or even a stroke or seizure. Panic attacks can occur in any anxiety disorder or high-stress situation when the patient is presented with a feared stimulus. However, in panic disorder, the attacks occur \"out of the blue\" without clear precipitants or warning. Such unpredictability causes extreme fear and anxiety about having another attack, particularly in a place where others might see them or where escape or help might not be possible. Affected individuals avoid any situation they associate with having a panic attack as well as places where they fear that if they did have an attack they would not be able to manage it or get help. Teens who have panic disorder may stop all extracurricular activities, refuse to go anywhere without their parents, and stop going to school (or have extreme distress with school attendance).Anxiety disorder treatment in children and adolescents is one of the best-researched areas in child and adolescent mental health. Treatment of childhood anxiety includes both specific and nonspecific treatment approaches. Specific approaches are evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders and include structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Nonspecific treatments include activities that decrease stress, improve mood, and support well-being, including sleep hygiene, healthy eating, regular exercise, predictable routine, and social supports.Standard evidence-based anxiety disorder treatment guidelines recommend the use of CBT as first-line treatment for children who have anxiety disorders when this therapy is available. (8)(9) Many CBT programs and books are available, and the skills often are taught to both parents and child to support the implementation of the strategies and decrease indirect reinforcement of anxious behaviors and thinking. CBT includes psychoeducation and cognitive and behavior skills training to help individuals understand and better manage anxiety. Anxious children think catastrophically or overexaggerate the negative outcomes of situations and generate avoidant solutions, leading to significant distress and avoidance behaviors.The cognitive strategies include identifying anxiety symptoms and somatic symptoms related to anxiety, developing realistic thinking, and problem-solving. Behavioral strategies consist of relaxation and stress management techniques as well as gradual exposure to the feared situation to modify the anxiety response through systematic desensitization and habituation (Table 3). Many children experience improvement in their anxiety with CBT alone and do not require medication. In some cases, children and teens are unable to learn and use CBT strategies to manage their anxiety without pharmacologic treatment.Medications help decrease overall anxiety symptoms and panic response and should be considered if the anxiety is moderate to severe. The best evidence, supported by both meta-analyses (10) and a Cochrane review, (11) for pharmacologic treatment of childhood anxiety disorders favors the SSRIs. (9) Although some SSRIs have been approved for treating children who have depression (fluoxetine, escitalopram) and OCD (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), SSRIs do not have United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, considerable evidence supports their efficacy. CBT in combination with an SSRI is recommended for moderate-to-severe anxiety disorders. (9)(12) Randomized, controlled trials of SSRI medications (sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) show effectiveness in treating children and adolescents who have anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11)Evidence is insufficient to recommend non-SSRI antidepressants such as venlafaxine for treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Strong evidence supports the efficacy of clomipramine in treatment of OCD, but the adverse effect profile does not support its use as first-line treatment. (9)(11) Benzodiazepines have been used for acute management of anxiety, but there is no evidence of their effectiveness for treatment of anxiety disorders in children. (9)(11)The risk/benefit ratio of initiating a medication trial should be considered in each situation, and the adverse effects should be disclosed fully, including the FDA black box warning for all antidepressants (the rare but increased risk for youth of experiencing suicidal ideation and behaviors while taking antidepressant medications). Initial doses should be minimal, with very gradual increases, as tolerated, according to symptom response and adverse effects, remembering that the medications take several weeks to start working and improvement continues for several months at a given dose. Although suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are not as common in childhood anxiety disorders as in depressive disorders, they may occur, and children should be monitored. (10) Medication should be viewed as helping the child decrease overall anxiety symptoms to allow success in learning and using anxiety management strategies. Given the adverse effects and risks of SSRI medication in children and the limited long-term safety data of these medications in the developing brain, medication intervention should be combined with CBT and healthy living strategies, with the goal of trying to taper the child off the medication within 1 year if he or she is doing well.Anxiety has the best chance of improving when both youth and family are educated about anxiety disorders and when there is support of the treatment plan. Numerous randomized, controlled trials support CBT and SSRIs as effective treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders. (8)(9)(10)(11)(12) The goal of treatment is to ameliorate symptoms and reduce anxiety, with improvement in overall function.",

      "title": "Developing an International Core Outcome Set for SSD Interventions",
      "abstract": "Unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) is defined as normal or near-normal hearing in one ear and a severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing impairment in the other ear.1 Common causes of SSD in adulthood include vestibular schwannoma and associated surgery, Ménière's disease, and bacterial or viral infections. SSD affects an estimated 12 to 27 individuals in every 100,000 of the general population.2Shutterstock/Inspiring, hearing loss, deafness, technology.Figure 1: Steps to develop a core outcome set for SSD interventions for adults. Hearing loss, deafness, technology.Difficulties in daily life as a result of SSD vary considerably from person to person. Functional difficulties in everyday life are commonly reported, such as difficulties in speech perception in noisy environments and poor spatial awareness. SSD can also negatively affect one's psychological well-being, resulting in worries about losing one's hearing in the other ear and/or reduced confidence and belief in one's abilities to participate in social situations. Various social impacts of SSD can result from activity limitations and participation restrictions, including withdrawal from and within situations.3 The multidimensional burden of SSD on an individual's overall health is indicated by reductions in health-related quality of life.4 Interventions like a contralateral routing of signals (CROS) aid or a bone conduction device aim to alleviate the impact of SSD by rerouting signals from the impaired ear to the better-hearing ear.5 In the past decade, we have seen the introduction of cochlear implantation,6 which restores hearing by delivering information directly to the impaired side, thus creating a sensation of true binaural hearing. TREATMENT CHALLENGES The challenge faced by people diagnosed with SSD, health care professionals, and clinical researchers is understanding which intervention (if any) is ideal.7 How can we measure the benefits or harms associated with an intervention for SSD? Existing literature has highlighted inconsistencies in the benefits and risks (side effects), or outcome domains, assessed when evaluating these interventions. For example, clinical studies that evaluate these interventions have measured performances such as speech perception in quiet or noisy environments and sound localization. Studies have also assessed tinnitus symptom severity and quality of life. The tests (measurement instruments) that researchers have chosen to measure these effects also vary widely from study to study. For example, sound localization can be measured using a setup of four loudspeakers arranged at the front, back, and sides (90 degrees apart) or a more complex setup of six loudspeakers arranged in a semi-circle in front of the participant (30 degrees apart). This diversity of chosen measures poses a challenge to both health care users and professionals when comparing and contrasting various study outcomes. In some cases, researchers choose available measures because they are standardized or easily accessible, and not because of their importance to health care users or professionals themselves. ADDRESSING THE INCONSISTENCY Identifying appropriate outcome domains is crucial to designing clinical trials to evaluate the effects of various interventions for SSD.8 Selected outcomes need to be vital and tailored to key stakeholders such as health care users, professionals, or budget holders to minimize bias when making decisions about health care.9 Furthermore, the choice of outcome measures should be based on what is important and of interest to people making decisions about health care, not on what outcome instruments are available or most commonly used. The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative just celebrated its 10th anniversary. The network brings together researchers interested in the development of agreed and standardized sets of outcomes, known as core outcome sets. Part of the COMET work focuses on developing recommendations on minimum standards for the design of core outcome set (COS) studies.10 A COS is a recommendation of what should be measured and reported in all trials in a specific area as a minimum. If developed from the perspectives of all relevant stakeholders, a COS can overcome the problems imposed by the utilization of diverse measures. In the field of audiology and ENT, a group led by Professor Deborah A. Hall at the University of Nottingham has developed a COS for tinnitus.11 Professor Iain A. Bruce and his team at the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre are working on the PONCHO study: Prioritizing Outcomes iN Childhood Hearing lOss. THE CROSSSD STUDY The Core Rehabilitation Outcome Set for Single-Sided Deafness (CROSSSD) project is an international initiative that aims to develop a COS for SSD interventions. It aims to find an agreement on what outcomes are critical and should always be measured when evaluating interventions for SSD, using the methodology proposed by the COMET initiative. We have an advisory group of clinical professionals from the United Kingdom, United States, and Europe. The CROSSSD project also works closely with people who have lived experience of SSD. They have been integral to the design and delivery of the CROSSSD study. For example, a promotional video (http://bit.ly/2QbLJk) was developed alongside collaborators with lived experience of SSD to increase awareness of the project and help with global participant recruitment. Our methodology is as follows (Fig. 1): Systematic review of the published literature reporting interventions for SSD to identify the outcome domains and measurement instruments that have already been used.12 Workshops using a range of qualitative methods to explore patient perspectives on outcomes. Interactive online consensus exercise, known as a Delphi survey, with key stakeholders to identify which outcome domains are important when evaluating SSD interventions. Interactive consensus meeting with a subgroup of the key stakeholders to discuss the Delphi survey findings and recommend a minimum set of outcome domains that are relevant to all. So far, we have completed the systematic review of the literature. From 72 papers, we identified a total of 244 outcome domains. Many of these were duplicates or not directly relevant to SSD, and so we were able to produce a shortened list of 44 unique candidate outcome domains. The Delphi survey engaged 277 participants from 30 countries. They suggested five additional candidate outcome domains. The e-Delphi concluded in February 2020 and the CROSSSD team are currently preparing for the interactive consensus meeting to finalize the core outcome domain set. FUTURE STEPS Once a COS is developed, we would know what is important to measure in all studies; however researchers also need to consider how the included outcomes should be measured. The COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) international initiative has collaborated with the COMET initiative to develop guidelines for selecting outcome measurement instruments for outcomes included in a COS.13 For instance, if quality of life is an outcome in a COS, indicated to be critical and important to always measure for SSD interventions, COSMIN standards can help us establish what commonly agreed instrument or questionnaire everyone should utilize to measure it. Appropriate dis emination strategies14 will ensure that anyone designing a trial in this area will have a list of outcomes to measure as a minimum, alongside a list of recommended instruments to utilize. The COS will not prevent researchers from measuring additional outcomes or utilizing supplementary instruments. Future studies in the field should adopt the recommended COS to reduce the heterogeneity of measures utilized. Moreover, only outcomes meaningful to all stakeholders will be employed and, as a result, transparency will be established since both benefits and harms will be reported. Clinical researchers will be supported in thinking critically about what they are trying to measure, and they will not select their outcomes simply based on the popularity or accessibility of available instruments. Uptake of the COS will be encouraged internationally to improve research quality, enhance clinical decision-making, and facilitate meta-analysis in systematic reviews.

      "abstract": "Poststroke seizure is a potential complication of stroke, which is the most frequent acute symptomatic seizure in adults. Patients with stroke may present with an abnormal or aggressive behavior accompanied by altered mental status and symptoms, such as hemiparesis, dysarthria, and sensory deficits. Although stroke manifestations that mimic seizures are rare, diagnosing poststroke seizures can be challenging when accompanied with negative postictal symptoms. Differential diagnoses of poststroke seizures include movement disorders, syncope, and functional (nonepileptic) seizures, which may present with symptoms similar to seizures. Furthermore, it is important to determine whether poststroke seizures occur early or late. Seizures occurring within and after 7 d of stroke onset were classified as early and late seizures, respectively. Early seizures have the same clinical course as acute symptomatic seizures; they rarely recur or require long-term antiseizure medication. Conversely, late seizures are associated with a risk of recurrence similar to that of unprovoked seizures in a patient with a focal lesion, thereby requiring long-term administration of antiseizure medication. After diagnosis, concerns regarding treatment strategies, treatment duration, and administration of primary and secondary prophylaxis often arise. Antiseizure medication decisions for the initiation of short-term primary and long-term secondary seizure prophylaxis should be considered for patients with stroke. Antiseizure drugs such as lamotrigine, carbamazepine, lacosamide, levetiracetam, phenytoin, and valproate may be administered. Poststroke seizures should be diagnosed systematically through history with differential diagnosis; in addition, classifying them as early or late seizures can help to determine treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Background: Overactive bladder syndrome is a urinary disorder that occurs more frequently in women andolder people and is characterized by feeling an urge to urinate (sudden urge to urinate, with the feeling thatyou cannot get to the bathroom in time), doing it many times throughout the day (more than six) or havingepisodes of urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine) and nocturia (waking up several times duringthe night to urinate). In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day. The complications occurred in 5 patients (18.5%). Two patients (7.4%) developedpain after trauma to the back, lead migration, lack of efficacy of device, treated by reprogramming thedevice, one patient (3.7%) get infection at the site of device implantation, SN was removed , there was onefemale patient (3.7%) got pregnancy and devise was deactivated. One patient (3.7%) complaining from painand discomfort at the device site was treated conservatively.Conclusion: Sacral neuromodulation is FDA approved as option for treatment of refractory OAB.

      "abstract": "A psychiatric emergency is acute behavioral disturbance requiring urgent intervention, manifesting with mood, thought disorder or behavioral signs and symptoms. Psychiatric emergencies can have a variety of presentations and occur in a variety of settings:. A psychiatric emergency can be conceptualized under following broad categories: Acute onset of illness in a person with no past background of a psychiatric illness Acute exacerbation of a chronic psychiatric illness or an acute relapse in a psychiatric illness of recurring nature Psychiatric symptoms resulting from an underlying medical illness or use of a psychoactive substance or prescription drug. Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

      "abstract": "Shock as a result of simple anesthesia in the absence of trauma, hemorrhage or fright has not been carefully worked out. The term \"shock\" is unscientific. It is the clinical expression for a group of symptoms, the result of failure of important functions of the body, as those of circulation, respiration, excretion and secretion, and general metabolism. A lowered bodily temperature is a more or less constant phenomenon. Shock is intimately connected with the nervous mechanism. In studying shock from anesthesia it is not only essential to consider the specific toxin of the anesthetic used, but the resulting toxic bodies generated through the immediate or more remote influence of general anesthesia. Shock can not, therefore, be expressed in a single definition. The phenomena of shock are so complex that in experimental work on animals it is necessary to study each condition separately, and compile the associated facts obtained and compare",

Moderate levels of anxiety are often welcomed to improve performance, and quite severe levels of anxiety can be experienced as normal when they are consistent with the demands of the situation. Persons with anxiety disorders are usually not just complaining of being too anxious too often, for they seek help with specific and recurring fears that they recognize as irrational and somewhat intrusive. To paraphrase the description in Chapter 1: the fears are of physical collapse in panic disorder and agoraphobia, of negative evaluation in social phobia, of harm to self or loved ones in GAD, of self-caused harm to self or loved ones in OCD, of improbable harm to self in the specific phobias, and of the intrusive memory of past threats of harm in PTSD.",

The quality of life during the wakeful stage is heavily dependent on the quality of REM and non-REM sleep experienced, whether during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The most restorative sleep is delta sleep (slow wave sleep or deep sleep) that occurs in Stages 3 and 4 of non-REM sleep; it is during these stages that one is the most difficult to waken. Individuals waken during REM sleep, but the state of being awake is normally so brief that it is not recalled later when in the true wake state. Rapid eye movement and generalized muscle atonia are characteristic of REM sleep; diaphragmatic movements and erections are the only muscle movements not inhibited.",

      "title": "1255 An Unusual Clinical Presentation of a Parasomnia",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry to sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from sleep. The non REM (NREM) parasomnias include confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. In children, NREM parasomnias occur out of stage N3 (first part of the night) but in adults can occur out of stages N1 or N2 during any part of the night. We describe a case of NREM parasomnia with atypical clinical presentation. A 21-year-old female with history of depression and anxiety was evaluated for sleep terrors, sleep walking and sleep eating since age 5. Over the period of past 4 years, her sleepwalking subsided, and was substituted with hallucinations. Patient woke up with loud screams and hallucinations, “living the dream” and was able to explain it to her parents with her eyes open, who eventually “woke her up out of the episode”. Dreams were violent with “death” as the usual theme, approximately 2 hours after sleep onset with complete recollection after waking up. She also endorsed excessive daytime sleepiness with adequate sleep time on actigraphy. Patient denied history of head trauma, encephalitis, epilepsy or family history of sleep disorders. She was treated with Alprazolam and Sertraline in the past 3 years without improvement. She underwent a carefully conducted PSG and MSLT, which was negative for sleep disordered breathing or hypersomnia disorders. Extended Video EEG monitoring captured multiple stage 2 screaming and looking under the bed episodes with patient describing, “dead dogs around and under her bed”. No epileptiform activity was seen. Patient was started on Protriptyline HCL 10 MG twice daily, which resolved her symptoms. Sleep hallucinations are relatively common in teens and young adults, usually visual and reduce with aging. This case highlights an unusual presentation of hypnopompic hallucinations in stage 2, patient opening her eyes and being able to describe her hallucinations before she is “woken out of her sleep”. Differential diagnosis includes disorders of NREM sleep arousals vs. epileptiform activity. Latter was ruled out with an extended video EEG monitoring. It’s also interesting to note that her symptoms resolved with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which was used due to failure of SSRI and benzodiazepine therapy in the past. TCA use has been described to control sleep hallucinations in narcolepsy, our case delineates their possible use in NREM hallucinations.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is clinically associated with cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. It is treated by reassurance (that there is no physical disease) and by stimulants such as ephedrine and amphetamine on an intermittent basis. The special tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine is also used, and mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are useful in theory. Obstructive sleep apnoea is an important and often unrecognised cause of daytime somnolence. It is treated by weight reduction (pickwickian syndrome), hormones, or recently, with continuous positive pressure apparatus. Night terrors (pavor nocturnus) and sleepwalking typically occur during deep sleep (stage 3 and 4 throughout the episode) in children. In a night terror the child sits up with a scream, with eyes open, but inaccessible. He eventually falls asleep calmly. Sleepwalking, too, shows the features of inaccessibility and subsequent amnesia for the episode. Both conditions are normally treated with reassurance (to the parents) but may occasionally warrant benzodiazepines. Enuresis usually occurs in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, especially stages 3 and 4. The reason for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants is not precisely known. Delirium tremens (DT) is treated as a rebound excess of REM sleep, with benzodiazepines and other drugs. It is the withdrawal syndrome (with or without major seizures) to the barbiturate-alcohol group of drugs, which includes alcohol, chloral, paraldehyde, glutethimide, methylprylone, ethchlorvynol, meprobamate and meprobamate-diphenhydramine. Insomnia may be treated by the above drugs, by analgesics, antidepressants, major tranquillisers (neuroleptics) and miscellaneous other compounds. For the majority of patients, however, the most suitable group seems to be the benzodiazepines. The benzodiazepines are much safer than their predecessors, in both acute and chronic usage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias occur from deep NREM sleep and often involve complex behaviours that may appear purposeful but are not conscious or under deliberate control. There are a number of different types/presentations of NREM parasomnias. These may range from common manifestations such as sleeptalking, sleepwalking or night terrors, to the rarer sleep-related eating disorder or sexsomnia. Clinical features can facilitate the differential diagnosis, but polysomnography may be needed, particularly to assess potential concomitant sleep disorders that might represent precipitating factors. Medical treatment is often not indicated, but clonazepam or antidepressants may be used in more severe cases. Safety aspects, treating concomitant sleep disorders and avoiding trigger factors are key aspects of management.",

      "title": "REM Sleep in Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is mainly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, but the characteristic feature is abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena. REM sleep disturbances can manifest as cataplexy (in narcolepsy type 1), sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, abnormal dreams, polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep disruption with sleep-onset REM periods, and fragmented REM sleep. Characterization of REM sleep and related symptoms facilitates the differentiation of narcolepsy from other central hypersomnolence disorders and aids in distinguishing between narcolepsy types 1 and 2. A circuit comprising regions within the brainstem, forebrain, and hypothalamus is involved in generating and regulating REM sleep, which is influenced by changes in monoamines, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides. REM sleep is associated with brainstem functions, including autonomic control, and REM sleep disturbances may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Medications used to treat narcolepsy (and REM-related symptoms of narcolepsy) include stimulants/wake-promoting agents, pitolisant, oxybates, and antidepressants; hypocretin agonists are a potential new class of therapeutics. The role of REM sleep disturbances in narcolepsy remains an area of active research in pathophysiology, symptom management, and treatment. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of REM sleep and its dysfunction in narcolepsy.",

Nonrestorative sleep can hamper a child&amp;#039;s ability to concentrate and control emotions and behavior. Sleep disorders vary among age groups, but most can occur with varying frequency at any age. Several disorders are typically seen only during the first few years of life, including colic, excessive nighttime feedings, and sleep onset association disorder. A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age. Sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration are not found only in adults but are, in fact, quite common in the pediatric population. While these disorders can occur at any age, treatment options vary substantially by age.",

      "abstract": "In the vast majority of patients with parasomnias, the evaluation can be accomplished in the office setting, based on information from the patients themselves and family members or other observers of the nocturnal events. Parasomnias are episodic sleep disorders that include sleepwalking, night terrors, and nightmares. All three conditions are more prevalent in childhood, when developmental factors appear to be responsible for their occurrence; in the much less frequent cases of a delayed onset or persistence in adulthood, psychopathologic states are often primary in their cause. Based on a number of clinical, physiologic, and etiopathogenetic similarities between sleepwalking and night terrors, these two conditions appear to fall along the same pathophysiologic and therefore nosologic continuum. They are both disorders of impaired arousal, characterized by various degrees of confusion, and they occur early in the night when slow-wave sleep predominates, whereas nightmares may occur at any time of the night, because they are closely associated with REM sleep. Another important issue relating to the assessment of parasomnias is to differentiate between nightmares and night terrors: in addition to the different time of night for their occurrence, nightmares are accompanied by much less anxiety, vocalization, motility, and autonomic discharge. Also, nightmare patients usually have vivid and elaborate recall for the event, whereas patients with night terrors are typically amnesic for their episodes, as are patients who sleepwalk. A mainstay in the management of sleepwalking and night terrors is instructing the patients and their family members to provide for adequate safety measures to prevent accidents that may occur during these events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Complex motor behaviors can be a challenge for even a seasoned physician. Opinions may be divided when behaviors occur out of sleep as general tendency is to categorize them as a parasomnia. A 43 y/o female with suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was referred for a sleep study. She had severe OSA and a subsequent PAP titration study was performed. At 6 am, she had an arousal from N2 sleep with abduction of arms followed by writhing in bed. It was followed by flailing of arms in air with deviation of the eyes to the right. Later patient exhibited fast circling movements of the arms with chewing movements. Episode lasted for 25 seconds. Immediately after, patient was able to answer questions appropriately and walk without any difficulty suggesting no confusion. Limited EEG (done with PSG) was mostly obscured by muscle artifact and no clear epileptiform discharges could be discerned. No other abnormal EEG activity was noted during this sleep study prior to this event. She had similar behavior without any post event confusion on her sleep study 12 years ago. Patient demographic, clinical semiology and PSG/EEG features have been proposed to distinguish nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) seizures from parasomnias, validated guidelines are still missing. The short-lasting motor events cannot always be established as epileptic nature, on the basis of one event of clinical phenomena, but the recurrence of these similar observed movements in individuals can be used as an indirect marker of epileptic etiology. Distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from parasomnias is critical from pathophysiological relationship but has treatment implications. This case illustrates importance of reviewing clinical history and behavior semiology that was recorded as well as limitations of the ancillary testing such as polysomnography or EEG monitoring.",

      "title": "Eye Movements During Sleep",
      "abstract": "During the night of sleep there is a recurrent cycle of brain wave changes and physiologic events punctuated by the dream periods. When the electroencephalogram changes from a high voltage slow to a low voltage rapid pattern the eyes begin to move in bursts of rapid movement and the dream period begins. The dream periods (stage REM) may be considered as a distinct physiologic state from the rest of the night (non-REM sleep). In patients with paralysis of upward eye movement during waking, during non-REM sleep the eyes moved upward as if no paralysis were present. However, during REM sleep upward eye movement was severely restricted. The results suggest that the functional organization for eye movements during REM sleep is similar to that of waking whereas this organization is dissolved during the remainder of sleep.",

      "abstract": "Emotional processes and responses are underestimated in stroke patients because the massive clinical picture of large hemispheric strokes often hides these symptoms. We report on a patient with peculiar unpleasant emotional responses after temporal stroke. We describe a 62-years old man with significant unpleasant emotional responses that occurred after an acute episode of confusional state, disorientation, agitation, vertigo, postural instability, vomiting, and photophobia. Since then, he complained that vision of pictures containing curved/multicolored lines or tangles was associated with an uncomfortable feeling of fear and disgust, lasting few minutes, so that he avoided looking at them. Notably, he also showed an abnormal facial expression of disgust and fear, together with neurovegetative reaction and horripilation, at the presentation of pictures of objects or animals containing curved, multicolored, or tangled lines. A post-acute infarction of the right temporal-insular region, together with mild periventricular white matter changes, were evident at the brain magnetic resonance imaging. The anterior insula is crucial in transforming unpleasant sensory input into visceromotor reactions and the accompanying feeling of disgust. It is also known that temporal pole modulates visceral emotional functions in response to emotionally evocative perceptual stimuli. In the present case, the ischemic lesion of anterior part of the insula and temporal pole may have caused a decoupling of emotional and visceral response to complex visual stimuli. Further reports will provide a significant contribution to the taxonomy of these complex and relatively uncommon non-motor post-stroke symptoms that negatively affect quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The fundamental purpose of sleep remains one of the most compelling questions yet to be answered in the area of neuroscience, if not all of biology. A pervasive behavior among members of the animal kingdom, the functional necessity of engaging regularly in sleep is best demonstrated by showing that failing to do so leads to a broad repertoire of pathological outcomes including cognitive, immunological, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes, among others. Indeed, an absolute requirement for sleep has been shown in studies that have demonstrated that continuous total deprivation of sleep for as short a period as 15 days is generally lethal in some species. The most common clinical sleep disorder, insomnia, is both a principal disease (primary insomnia) as well as a co-morbidity of a large number of other ostensibly unrelated diseases including chronic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. From a treatment perspective, restoring normal healthy sleep delivers subsequent benefits in waking cognitive function and mood with the potential for beneficial therapeutic impact on daily functioning across multiple diseases for which restorative healthy sleep is compromised. Our remarkable escalation in understanding the anatomy and physiology of sleep/wake control mechanisms provides new opportunities to modify the neurobiology of sleep and wake-related behaviors in novel and exciting ways. In parallel, expansion of sleep research into novel interfaces between sleep-wake biology and disease states is revealing additional extensive implications of lost sleep. Current investigational and conventional pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep and wake disorders are discussed based on their mechanism of action within the CNS and their effect on sleep and wake. This review of recent sleep biology and sleep pharmacology peers into the future of sleep therapeutics to highlight both mechanistic safety and functional outcomes as key for differentiating and establishing success for the next generation of arousal modifying therapeutics.

      "abstract": "Abstract Rhythmic movements during sleep may occur in the context of physiological sleep-related motor activity or be part of sleep-related movement disorders such as bruxism, periodic limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder. They may also characterize some frontal or temporal nocturnal seizures of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, or be considered as part of NREM parasomnias, especially sleepwalking, sexsomnia or sleep-related eating disorder, or REM-related behaviors such as REM behavior disorder or complex movements associated with pediatric narcolepsy type I. In most cases rhythmic movements, especially when complex and long in duration, are related to different levels of arousal from sleep with recurrence of ancestral motor sequences promoted by central pattern generators in the brainstem, generally activated by the arousal process. A differential diagnosis between physiological events and pathological movement disorders, and between the latter and sleep-related epilepsy is critical to provide optimal treatment and an accurate prognosis. Specific treatment options for the aforementioned disorders are beyond the scope of this article.",

      "abstract": "Yawning is a normal reflex triggered by arousal, drowsiness, boredom, hunger and emotional conditions and it is associated to several neurological diseases and drug abuse. Its wide presence in the phylogenetic vertebrate scale and even in human fetuses as young as 12 weeks directed the search for the common anatomic and biochemical mechanisms involved. The demonstration that yawning is not connected with high CO2 or low O2 blood levels left aside a prevalent metabolic hypothesis. Its close relationship with the sleep-wake cycle, specially in moments previous to falling asleep and after awaking has been related to changes in personal situation and activity. A single component of this reflex which is to be found exclusively in humans, is the fact that yawning is contagious. Thus, it is considered a component of the adaptative mechanism that is part of the surveillance reflex, becoming a significant paralinguistic evolutive expression aimed at protection and social cohesion. The common anatomical structures and neurochemical systems taking part in yawning, the sleep-wake cycle and the temporal lobe epilepsy may imply that yawning results from a set of protective systems induced by endogenous opiods which intervene in the inhibition and prevention of the temporal lobe epileptic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Parasomnias Hrayr Attarian1* 1 Loyola University Health System, Department of Neurology, United States Learning objectives: Recognize the major categories of parasomnias Know the clinical presentations of the common parasomnias Understand the treatment options available Parasomnias are undesirable physical or experiential events that occur in and around sleep and although most of them are benign they can, occasionally, lead to significant morbidity primarily through injury to self or bed partners. They remain poorly recognized and understood. They fall under 3 categories; \"NREM parasomnias\", \"REM parasomnias\" and \"Other parasomnias\". Sleepwalking, sleep terrors and confusional arousals constitute the first category. The key differentiating characteristic of sleepwalking is the extensive wandering, of sleep terrors the autonomic hyperarousal and of confusional arousal the complex behaviors and sluggish response to the environment. There is a degree of overlap among all three. Among the REM parasomnias the most common is nightmares and the most injurious REM sleep behavior disorder or RBD. Nightmares are anxiety and fear provoking recurrent dreams and most do not require treatment but of those that do tend to respond to cognitive therapy low dose prazosin, an alpha 1 antagonist. RBD is a condition where the normal atonia of REM is absent and patients tend to act out their dreams hence risking injury to self or bed partner. This condition can be idiopathic but may also be related to neurodegenerative disorders, other sleep disorders or secondary to exposure to antidepressant medication. Treatment is generally successful with either clonazepam or high dose melatonin. The category of other parasomnias comprises of conditions that are not state dependant. Catathrenia or nocturnal groaning is such a condition that although benign can lead to significant sleep disruption and social embarrassment. It usually responds to CPAP even in the absence of sleep related breathing disorder. Sleep related eating disorder is another such parasomnia which can lead to injury, obesity and other adverse health outcomes. The treatment of choice is usually topiramate although pramipexole and SSRIs have been shown effective as well.

      "title": "Peripheral nerve entrapment and injury in the upper extremity.",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury of the upper extremity commonly occurs in patients who participate in recreational (e.g., sports) and occupational activities. Nerve injury should be considered when a patient experiences pain, weakness, or paresthesias in the absence of a known bone, soft tissue, or vascular injury. The onset of symptoms may be acute or insidious. Nerve injury may mimic other common musculoskeletal disorders. For example, aching lateral elbow pain may be a symptom of lateral epicondylitis or radial tunnel syndrome; patients who have shoulder pain and weakness with overhead elevation may have a rotator cuff tear or a suprascapular nerve injury; and pain in the forearm that worsens with repetitive pronation activities may be from carpal tunnel syndrome or pronator syndrome. Specific history features are important, such as the type of activity that aggravates symptoms and the temporal relation of symptoms to activity (e.g., is there pain in the shoulder and neck every time the patient is hammering a nail, or just when hammering nails overhead?). Plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging are usually not necessary for initial evaluation of a suspected nerve injury. When pain or weakness is refractory to conservative therapy, further evaluation (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, electrodiagnostic testing) or surgical referral should be considered. Recovery of nerve function is more likely with a mild injury and a shorter duration of compression. Recovery is faster if the repetitive activities that exacerbate the injury can be decreased or ceased. Initial treatment for many nerve injuries is nonsurgical.",

Report of Case A 64 y/o male, with history of ongoing complex movements occurring during his sleep, with no history of strokes or neurological deficits. Had extensive neurologic workup (all negative) including routine electroencephalogram (EEG), prolonged inpatient EEG (12 hours), and MRI of the brain. Home sleep study showing moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) AHI 24/hour successfully treated with CPAP therapy (residual AHI 1.7/hour) with improved nighttime symptoms initially. Wife recalls events as happening only at night while sleep, as patient often confused upon waking up in the morning, at times appear to sit up and smack his lips. No nighttime hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or acting out dreams were reported. Had two episodes associated with tongue biting and loss of bladder control. Another episode happened after a daytime nap, patient went outside and was mowing his lawn, went “completely blank “, appeared confused. No daytime or nighttime seizures were ever noticed. Patient do not recall any of the above events. Repeat EEG was normal. MRI/MRA of the head /neck showed small tiny focus in left frontoparietal lobe, suggesting remote cortical ischemic injury. Polysomnography (PSG) with seizure montage showed Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) foci recorded in the frontal/frontopolar leads without accompanying body movements. Interictal spike and wave activity seen during stage N2. Initially treated with carbamazepine (had skin reaction) switched to levetiracetam with complete resolution of his symptoms. Conclusion This case illustrates the importance of reviewing the clinical history, behavior semiology, and diagnostic ancillary testing such as polysomnography with EEG monitoring in distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from other nocturnal complex behavior disorders and parasomnias.",

      "title": "Excited delirium syndrome",
      "abstract": "Mental health calls make up a large proportion of ambulance workloads, with paramedics responding to a wide range of presentations such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and excited delirium syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

      "abstract": "Sudden death is natural death, heralded by loss of consciousness within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms. The time and mode of death are unexpected. This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

      "abstract": "The term of neurodevelopment risky child appeared in the medical literature of the sixties the 20th century in order to get out of the total number of live births isolate those infants who might have developmental disabilities. Nowadays, it is a wider spread opinion that 10% of the live born children belong to the group of those with neurodevelopment risks or that were under influence of other factors (medical history, clinical), which can lead to the early brain damage. Risk factors can be divided into perinatal, prenatal and postnatal ; and the worst effect of all have: premature birth - before the 32nd week of gestation ; low birth weight - less than 1500 grams ; machine breathing longer than 48 hours in the first 28 days of life ; cardio - respiratory collapse at birth including: Apgar score of 0– 3 in the fifth minute of life, inability to establish spontaneous respiration within the first 10 minutes and lasting muscle hypotonia during the first 2 hours of life ; prolonged perinatal hypoxemia ; acidemia ; neonatal hypoglycemia or recurrent apnea ; a history of epileptic seizures ; disturbances of consciousness of the newborn ; other potential neurological problems, such as previous CNS infection ; documented sepsis ; meningitis ; pathologic Hyperbilirubinemia, so called “Complicated” intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed by ultrasound (all except first degree) ; hypoxic - ischemic changes ; periventricular leucomalacia ; hydrocephalus and other congenital malformation ; and viral and other infection of the mother in the first weeks of pregnancy. With objective to prevent an easier neuromotor deviation and difficulties with basic life function to become dominant, stereotypical and habit of the child, physiotherapy intervention in the NICU is performed. It includes the proper positioning of the newborn, respiratory physiotherapy, early neurodevelopmental therapy, neonatal handling, preoral therapy and parent education. Although it is a small child it is important to have an holistic interdisciplinary team approach that focuses on the child as a whole and includes all professional disciplines and their existing knowledge in solving problems of the small patient. In the NICU, the basis of the team which take care of neurodevelopment risky infants are the physiotherapist, the neonatologist physician and the nurse.",

      "title": "Developmental Dyslexia: An Update",
      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

While certain types of seizures occur almost exclusively during sleep, sleep deprivation can precipitate seizures and can activate interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). While non-rapid eye movement sleep is an activator of IEDs and seizures, rapid eye movement sleep suppresses them. Nocturnal seizures need to be distinguished from parasomnias. Epileptic seizures and IEDs result in changes of sleep architecture, while antiepileptic drugs have variable effect on sleep and wakefulness. Nearly one-third of patients with epilepsy complain day time somnolence. In addition to nocturnal seizures and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), associated sleep disorders such as sleep apnoea and restless leg syndromes might be responsible for daytime sleepiness in persons with epilepsy.",

They may aggravate psychiatric disorders, perpetuate them or predict a disease onset, like in depressive or manic episodes. Also in organic sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders or nocturnal movement disorders, increased anxiety or depression scores may be observed. Patients suffering from sleep disorders do not only experience impaired well-being, but also show deteriorations in cognition and performance, have a higher risk of accidents, are generally more prone to health problems, have a higher sickness absence rate, seek medical help more often and thus are also an important socioeconomic factor.

The depressed patient was found to dream as frequently as the nondepressed, but the dreams were shorter and had a paucity of traumatic or depressive content, even after the depression had lifted. A dream that awakens the dreamer in a terrified state generally with accompanying frightening dream content—a nightmare—would be a psychopathologic dream.

However, diagnostic problems of shunt dysfunction are difficult and thus important. The typical symptoms of shunt failure such as headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, mental status changes, behavioural disturbances are unspecific and sometimes minimal. Headache as the commonest symptom of shunt dysfunction has various other aetiologies; a first episode of migraine is especially difficult to differentiate from shunt failure. Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain might also be related to gastroenteritis and consecutive dehydration might provoke symptoms of over drainage. Both, over drainage or infection can mimic the symptoms of drainage failure. Seizures as a warning sign are rare; but epilepsy as a comorbidity frequent. Neurological examination, although very important is not always very informative: papilledema and other signs of pressure develop only over time. Especially in children with spina bifida, new onset of brainstem and cranial nerve abnormalities are hints for shunt dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "During sleep, infants with obstructive sleep apneas are characterised by snoring, laborious breathing, and profuse sweating. During wakefulness, they may have breath-holding spells, and during feeding, difficult breathing and swallowing coordination. Abnormal weight, difficult growth, and recurring ear infections may also develop. During sleep apneas, cinefiuoroscopy shows approximation of tongue and hypopharyngeal tissues, with an obliteration of the air space. The obstructed breaths occur mainly in REM, and light NREM sleep, associated with total short sleep time, and frequent arousals. Preterm infants, and term neonates are more prone to obstructive apneas than older healthy infants. Apneas are more frequently seen in boys and in case of excess in body weight. Obstructive apneas are frequently associated with upper airway anatomic abnormalities: malformations, soft tissue infiltration, and neurologic lesions impairing muscle contractions. Alterations of the autonomic nervous control may induce airways obstructions. Contributing factors include mucopolysaccharide storage disease, hypothyroidism, or Down’s syndrome. Superimposed factors may occur, such as nasal obstruction, secretions in the airways, or tissue edema. Pressure- and chemo-sensitive reflexes may also favor obstruction. Environmental factors also contribute to the development of sleep apneas: body position, neck flexion, sleep deprivation, or the effects of sedative drugs.",

      "abstract": "Sleep medicine is relevant in both neurology and general medicine. A disordered sleep–wake cycle can have major effects on many common neurological complaints such as headache and epilepsy, and it may also directly affect important general health issues, such as blood pressure. Furthermore, sleep related disorders such as parasomnias, particularly with agitation, can be hazardous to patients and bed partners while also being diagnostic clues in some neurodegenerative diseases. The traditional view that sleep is simply the absence of wakefulness has been increasingly refined over the past 50 years or so. Rather, it is a precisely orchestrated and complex state with distinct and mutually exclusive phases: non-rapid eye movement (stages 1–4) and rapid eye movement sleep (non-REM and REM sleep, respectively), defined largely by the surface EEG. In a typical night, there are 4–5 cycles of non-REM and REM sleep (figure 1). In REM sleep, the cortical EEG is highly activated in common with wakefulness, usually corresponding to the vivid dreaming that accompanies REM sleep. REM sleep periods predominate towards the end of the nocturnal sleep period whereas the deepest stages of non-REM sleep (stages 3 and 4) tend to occur within an hour of sleep onset. Figure 1 (A) EEG waveforms that define wake and non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep stages. (B) An idealised hypnogram summarising the distribution of the sleep stages through a typical night. Black bars refer to REM sleep during which the EEG pattern returns to that seen in wakefulness. Given the normal variation in sleep patterns and habits between people, distinguishing whether or not a sleep related symptom suggests a formal disorder can be difficult. It is a salutary fact that normal ageing is associated with deteriorating and poorly consolidated nocturnal sleep.",

Changes in the cranial nerve examination primarily relate to an age-related decline in sensory functions, especially of vision and hearing, and to a restriction in the range of eye movements, especially vertically. A progressive decline in the bulk and strength of muscles and in the speed and coordination of movements has long been recognised as an accompaniment of aging. Posture and gait show conspicuous changes with advancing age, partially correlating with diminished sensation in the legs and/or with a nonspecific bradykinetic senile gait. The distal depression of deep tendon reflexes and sensory function is primarily due to distal degeneration of sensory axons. Among the release signs, only the reappearance of the grasp reflex is a reliable sign for indicating pathology of the nervous system. Senile tremor, a decline in the maintenance of thermal homoeostasis, an increasing frequency of orthostatic hypotension, and disorders of sleep are also commonly associated with aging.",

Seizure is often a manifestation or symptom of many medical conditions. Epilepsy is the occurrence of two or more unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder. In other words, a seizure is a sign, and epilepsy is a disorder. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of individuals reaching age 70 will have a seizure, but only 1–2% will be subject to recurrence and become epileptic. After a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, with normal exam, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG), 15–30% have recurrence. Seizure should be differentiated from syncope, migraine, transient ischemic attack, multiple sclerosis, hypoglycemic attack, sleep disorder (narcolepsy/ cataplexy/night terror, rapid eye movement behavior disorder), anxiety attacks, and pseudoseizure (psychogenic nonepileptic seizure). Routine workup for onset of unprovoked seizure in adults includes blood count, chemistry profile, EEG, and neuroimaging (computed tomography scan, MRI). Further workup depends on individual case (lumbar puncture). Late onset of seizures is usually because of vascular, degenerative, and neoplastic processes. However, more than half of the patients remain idiopathic, which is possibly genetically determined. Family history of seizure, previous history of head trauma, and prior history of seizure including febrile convulsion in childhood are important to establish.",

Features of panic disorder that are more common in adolescents than in adults include less worry about additional panic attacks and decreased willingness to openly discuss their symptoms. All patients with suspected panic disorder should undergo a medical history, physical examination, and laboratory workup to exclude medical causes of panic attacks.

      "abstract": "Immediately after unilateral loss of vestibular function there are very dramatic symptoms – rapid eye movements (nystagmus), vertigo, nausea, ataxia, a tendency to fall to the affected side – the patient is incapacitated. These symptoms usually rapidly disappear so that most patients return to their normal lifestyle within some weeks or months. The term used to describe this overall recovery of function is ‘vestibular compensation’ and it appears to be a simple general improvement. Closer examination shows a different picture. This chapter is not a review but an overview, an integration, and it aims to provide some principles and insights in this very complex area to position the reader so they can understand and place into context the multitude of papers which have been written on this important area. The vestibular system is a fundamental sensory system -the vestibular nuclei receive a host of sensory inputs, vestibular, visual, proprioceptive - and the neural output from the vestibular nuclei directly or indirectly impinges on many other systems – the vestibular nuclei are the hubs of multimodal integration. During compensation there are profound changes in the activity of neurons at the vestibular nuclei which receive not only vestibular input but input from a variety of other sources. One process which takes place rapidly is the rebalancing the neural activity between the two vestibular nuclei which is disrupted by the unilateral vestibular loss. Some of the changes in improved performance after the loss are due to new behaviours which, whilst very effective, can be so subtle that they are very hard to identify.",

      "title": "From Precipitation to Inhibition of Seizures: Rationale of a Therapeutic Paradigm",
      "abstract": "Epileptic seizures can be triggered by both nonspecific facilitating factors such as sleep withdrawal, fever, or excessive alcohol intake, and specific reflex epileptic mechanisms. These consist of sensory or cognitive inputs activating circumscribed cortical areas or functional anatomic systems that, due to some functional instability, respond with an epileptic discharge. Interruption of seizure activity at the stage of the aura (i.e., locally restricted discharge) also can be achieved by nonspecific (e.g., relaxation or concentration techniques or vagal nerve stimulation) or by specific focus-targeted sensory or cognitive inputs. The latter, again, activate circumscribed cortical areas. Intriguingly, in some patients, the same stimulus can either precipitate or abort a seizure. The response depends on the state of cortical activation: seizure precipitation occurs in the resting condition, and seizure interruption occurs when the epileptic discharge has begun close to the activated area. These relations can be understood on the background of experimental data showing that an intermediate state of neuronal activation is a precondition for the generation of paroxysmal depolarization shifts, whereas a hyperpolarized neuron will remain subthreshold, and a depolarized neuron that already produces action potentials is not recruitable for other activity. Sensory input meeting an intermediately activated pool of potentially epileptic neurons is adequate to produce a seizure. In another condition, the same stimulus can depolarize a neuron pool in the same area sufficiently to block the further propagation of nearby epileptic activity. Understanding these interactions facilitates the development of successful nonpharmaceutical therapeutic interventions for epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Increased daytime napping, early morning awakening, frequent nocturnal sleep interruptions, and lowered amplitude and phase advance of the circadian sleep-wake rhythm are characteristic features of sleep-waking and chronobiological changes associated with aging. Especially in elderly patients with dementia, severely fragmented sleep-waking patterns are observed frequently and are associated with disorganized circadian rhythm of various physiological functions. Functional and/or organic deterioration of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), decreased exposure to time cues such as insufficient social interaction and reduced environmental light, lowered sensitivity of sensory organs to time cues, and reduced ability of peripheral effector organs to express circadian rhythms may cause these chronobiological changes. In many cases of dementia, the usual treatments for insomnia do not work well, and the development of an effective therapy is an important concern for health care practitioner and researchers. Recent therapeutical trials of supplementary administration of artificial bright light and the pineal hormone melatonin, a potent synchronizer for mammalian circadian rhythm, have indicated that these treatments are useful tools for demented elderly insomniacs. Both bright light and melatonin simultaneously ameliorate disorganized thermoregulatory and neuroendocrine systems associated with disrupted sleep-waking times, suggesting a new, potent therapeutic means for insomnia in the demented elderly. Future studies should address the most effective therapeutic design and the most suitable types of symptoms for treatment and investigate the use of these tools in preventive applications in persons in early stages of dementia.

Several REM parasomnias are consistent with sleep dissociations, where certain elements of the REM sleep pattern emerge in an inadequate time (sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations and cataplexy) or are absent/partial in their normal REM sleep time (REM sleep without atonia, underlying REM sleep behavior disorder). The rest of REM parasomnias (sleep related painful erection, catathrenia) may have other still unclear mechanisms. REM parasomnias deserve attention, because in addition to disturbing sleep and causing injuries, they may shed light on REM sleep functions as well as the heterogeneous etiologies of parasomnias. One of them, REM sleep behavior disorder has special importance as a warning sign of evolving neurodegenerative conditions mainly synucleinopathies (some cases synucleinopathies themselves) and it is a model parasomnia revealing that parasomnias may have by autoimmune, iatrogenic and even psychosomatic etiologies.",

      "title": "The Psychology of Panic",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is often confused with elevations of anxiety and what is often described as \"anxiety attacks.\" However, panic is qualitatively different from these phenomena. Panic disorders or panic attacks are intense and usually brief episodes that have often come upon the sufferer as an extreme dread and fear of annihilation. Panic attacks are startling and often produce a sense of impending doom and fear of imminent disaster. They are associated with heart palpitations, dizziness, tingling of extremities, disorientation, and the urge to flee the present environment. During a panic attack, it is not unusual for the sufferer to act in ways that seem completely irrational and beyond the realm of sanity. Imagine sitting quietly in a darkened room and being intensely engrossed in a book that you cannot put down. Suddenly you feel someone's hands grasp your neck and begin choking you. That level of startled and life-threatening fear is like what many report during a panic attack. It is difficult to know what causes this disorder. In many cases, sufferers report having endured traumatic experiences, especially in childhood. However, in an equal percentage of cases, there is no prior trauma history, and the origins of the panic disorder are unknown, although they do tend to run in families. This book elucidates the nature of panic, the factors that contribute to the disorder, and describes psychological, physiological, and medical interventions that have been useful in ameliorating the suffering brought on by panic attacks.",

      "abstract": "An intensive care unit (ICU) stay is often a stressful and painful experience. Recent surveys indicate that 50–80% of patients experience pain during their ICU stay [1]. Critically ill patients experience pain more readily than healthy subjects; a phenomenon known as hypernociception. The most painful experiences for ICU patients are endotracheal suctioning and being turned in bed. In addition, many patients have pain at rest without a noxious stimulus [1]. This decreased threshold of pain in the ICU has been attributed to immobility and systemic inflammation. In addition to pain, ICU patients often suffer from stress, which has been frequently attributed to painful procedures. Other factors that may play a role in ICU stress include inability to communicate due to endotracheal intubation, interruption of sleep, hallucinations, and nightmares. This stressful experience is not without complications, as one retrospective study found that 25% of ICU patients with self-reported stressful experiences during their ICU stay, such as nightmares, anxiety, respiratory distress, or pain, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder four years later [2], thus, the importance of adequate analgesia and sedation to achieve patient comfort.",

Full blown REM sleep behaviour disorder can be diagnosed clinically, but REM sleep motor dysfunction, a pathophysiological basis of REM sleep behaviour disorder, is difficult to detect without all night polysomnography. Twenty one consecutive patients with multiple system atrophy with no complaints of nocturnal abnormal behaviours were clinically evaluated to determine the presence of sleep related symptoms. All night polysomnography with video monitoring was performed to investigate REM sleep characteristics and patients' behaviours. In 85.7% (18 of 21) of the patients' sleep talk started or increased around or after the clinical onset of the primary diseases. REM sleep without atonia occupied more than 15%(16.2%-100%) of the REM sleep time in all but one patient. In 90.5% (19 of 21) of patients, motor events such as sleep talk and various combinations of craniofacial, orofacial, or limb movements occurred at various frequencies mostly during REM sleep without atonia. In patients with multiple system atrophy, REM sleep motor dysfunction is a common polysomnographic finding which is otherwise overlooked, and sleep talk may be its early clinical manifestation.",

      "title": "The Effects of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders on Waking Performance",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "Insomnia impairs daytime functioning or causes clinically significant daytime distress. The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

Epilepsy is defined as at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart or one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years [5]. The most important diagnostic tool is the history. The examination is very often normal unless the patient has a structural brain lesion. The history should include the following information:• The presence or absence of an aura, which is a recurrent stereotypic abnormal sensation or experience. The aura is a simple partial seizure or focal seizure without impairment of consciousness or awareness according to the newly proposed classification of seizures and epilepsies [6].",

In some instances, such hypertension develops from a benign form, while in others it is malignant in type, almost from its inception; the latter type has constituted approximately 10 per cent. of the total number of cases in our hospital experience. The cause of the disease is unknown; the course is stormy and rapid; the prognosis is extremely grave, and the medical treatment is entirely unsatisfactory. The clinical symptoms are: (1) marked and continuous elevation of systolic blood pressure and disproportionately high diastolic pressure; (2) cerebral manifestations—that is, excruciating dull headaches, intermittent or continuous in character, affecting as a rule the entire cranium, but centering especially in the occiput—insomnia, irritability and mental deterioration, changes in personality and at times apoplectic or epileptiform seizures; (3)",

Many classifications can be used, such as classifications related to the location of the lesion or classifications related to the clinical presentations. The latter have the advantage of enticing the practitioner to systematically evaluate specific sleep disorders. Such classifications include neurodegenerative disorders, neuromuscular disorders, movement disorders, autoimmune disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, seizures, and headaches. The manifestations in terms of their impact on sleep often depend, of course, on the location of the lesion. Some neurologic diseases involve the sleep-wake system. For example, dementing disorders may affect diffuse neural pathways that impact the strength of the circadian rhythm, but also instability of sleep and sleep states. In contrast, other disorders secondarily impact sleep and its quality. As an example, neuromuscular disorders can impact control of swallowing and the airway, which can increase susceptibility to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",

      "abstract": "Sleep—a state marked by lessened consciousness, lessened movement of the skeletal muscles, and slowed-down metabolism—has an essential restorative function and an important role in memory consolidation. It is an orchestrated neurochemical process involving sleep promoting and arousal centres in the brain. Sleep propensity depends on two main factors: the amount of accumulated sleep deprivation and the circadian clock phase enhancing sleep at night.​night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEds Martin P Szuba, Jacqueline D Kloss, David F Dinges\r\n\r\nCambridge University Press, £34.95, pp 306 ISBN 0 521 01076 4\r\n\r\nRating: ★★★★\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsomnia is a symptom, resulting from insufficient sleep or sleep of poor quality, with negative effects on subsequent daytime functioning. The prevalence of insomnia increases steeply during the fifth decade of life. People with insomnia often complain of impairments in attention, memory, or concentration, impairments in their mood, feeling depressed or irritable or anxious, and impairments in their ability to function at work, at home, or even at school. They generally have more medical complaints, seek medical care more often, and are more prone to road injuries than people without insomnia.\r\n\r\nAn enormous gap exists between the prevalence of insomnia and the actual management of people with the condition. While roughly 20% to 30% of adults worldwide get insomnia, less than 50% of them will be diagnosed as having the condition. Patients are hesitant to discuss insomnia with their doctors because they are afraid that their problem will be seen as trivial or indicate a serious illness. Doctors tend to trivialise insomnia because little of their medical training is devoted to it and because they are often unaware that the onset of insomnia may signal a serious condition or an established risk factor for psychiatric illness.\r\n\r\nInsomnia: Principles and Management announces the arrival of this complex sleep disorder at the frontiers of internal and sleep medicine. With contributions from highly prominent sleep specialists, this multi-authored volume captures the breadth of the field and introduces a diverse array of up-to-date scientific and clinical data ranging from the diagnosis, prevalence, aetiology, and management of insomnia to the neurobiology of sleep and arousal. It also provides several perspectives on related disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep disorders in sighted and blind subjects, jet lag, and mood disorders.\r\n\r\nThe book reviews the various approaches for the management of insomnia, including behavioural approaches, the use of hypnotic drugs aimed at treating sleep quantity deficits, and the use of chronobiotic drugs (biological clock effectors, such as melatonin and its analogues) to improve the circadian control of the sleep-wake cycle. If indeed melatonin plays a role in sleep regulation, either through its chronobiotic, soporific activities or both, we would expect that exogenous melatonin administration will be able to induce sleep during daytime or when the homeostatic drive to sleep is insufficient, and to improve sleep in cases where there is a deficiency in endogenous melatonin. This is indeed demonstrated in blind subjects, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and elderly patients with insomnia in whom melatonin production is diminished.\r\n\r\nAnother important contribution of this book is the effort to identify where research should be heading. In recent years, the focus of clinically oriented sleep medicine has shifted from sleep quantity to sleep quality, as quality rather than quantity is associated with impaired daytime functioning, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and poor quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis succinct and informative volume will be useful to both sleep experts and general practitioners alike.",

In some cases the disorder of a somatic system plays an important etiological rôle; in some cases there are definite emotional idiosyncrasies; in some patients special experiences have sensitized the patient in certain directions; in some there has been, even with fair equipment and with no obvious disorder of the simple emotional reactions, a balance impossible to maintain for an indefinite period. In some there are personal traits of very special nature which cannot be reduced to simpler elements. In the formulation of each case one must take into account the possibility of a disorder at each of many levels. In working at this large group of patients we still require very much more information as to the rôle played by the simple organic functions, while not neglecting the complicated development of elaborate psychological reactions. The detailed analysis of the special determination of the specific psychological reactions has been carried further than the other lines of investigation, owing to the enthusiasm of the psychoanalytic school. There remains much work to be done in regard to the rôle of the various systems (cardio-vascular, gastro-intestinal, etc.) in the setting of the emotional reactions; and the study of the personality along lines analogous to those suggested by Hoch and Amsden is an important field for further research.",

      "title": "Unusual Presentations of Epilepsies",
      "abstract": "Seizures are either focal (partial) or generalized in onset (Table I).1 The manifestation of the seizure is related to the area of the brain involved in the initial electrical seizure discharge. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the motor strip then one might see a Jacksonian type of seizure with first clonic movements of the thumb and fingers, then a march up the hand, arm, face and leg on the contralateral side of the body. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the temporal lobe then one might see impairment of consciousness and automatic movements (automatisms). The \"aura\" is actually the start of the electrical seizure discharge which is confined to one area of brain. The type of \"aura\" that a patient has is related to the area of brain involved in the seizure discharge. For example, the olfactory aura of an unusual smell may be related to a mesial temporal lobe or mesial frontal lobe discharge. The aura of an unusual taste is related to a discharge in the insular cortex. If the electrical seizure discharge spreads out to involve other areas of brain or the whole brain then the patient has a secondarily generalized major motor seizure. The important point is to recognize that the seizure was a partial onset seizure becoming secondarily generalized and therefore due to a focal etiology rather than a primary generalized seizure disorder, which affects a particular area of brain which is may be precipitated in response to some stimuli which effects a particular area of brain which is extraordinarily sensitive because of an epileptic lesion in that area.

      "abstract": "Any systemic or neurological condition can cause sleep disruption. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "title": "Mirtazapine in Primary Insomnia: Case report and Literature review",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or achieving restorative sleep, despite adequate opportunities. This condition often results in significant daytime impairments, including fatigue, concentration difficulties, and irritability. Insomnia can be primary or comorbid with other disorders such as anxiety or depression. Case Presentation: A 27-year-old woman presented with severe and chronic insomnia, persisting for 14 years with recent exacerbation. Her symptoms included significant difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in an average of only 3-4 hours of sleep per night and complete sleep deprivation for periods exceeding half an hour over the past 5 days. This sleep deficit led to pronounced emotional instability, physical discomfort, and reduced appetite, although suicidal ideation was absent. She had a past history of drug use for different psychiatric illnesses. She was started on mirtazipine 30mg and showed abrupt improvement in her symptoms. She was discharged afterwards. Discussion: The patient's chronic insomnia and its secondary effects necessitate a comprehensive treatment approach. Mirtazapine, an antidepressant with potent histamine receptor antagonism, has shown efficacy in improving sleep quality across diverse patient profiles. However, side effects like weight gain and sedation require careful monitoring. Combining mirtazapine with prolonged-release melatonin has demonstrated enhanced outcomes, particularly in perimenopausal women. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) remains the first-line treatment due to its efficacy and long-term benefits. Conclusion: Mirtazapine can be a valuable option in the therapeutic arsenal for primary insomnia, but ongoing research is needed to refine treatment strategies. Personalized treatment plans considering patient history and response are crucial for effectively managing primary insomnia and improving patient outcomes.",

It is a fairly common problem in paediatric age: approximately 1 child out of 5 is affected at 5 years of age, with a potential significant impact on their quality of life and family. Pathogenesis is multifactorial, resulting in a combination of genetic factors, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, night-time anti-diuretic hormone deficiency and, in case, coexisting conditions such as sleep and behavioural disorders. Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases. Treatment mainly involves behavioural approach alongside, in those in which this approach fails, nocturnal alarm and/or pharmacological therapy. Assessment of associated comorbidities is crucial (ex. constipation, sleep and behavioural disorders).",

The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "title": "Evaluation of Syncope in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Syncope is defined as a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness associated with loss of postural tone and should be differentiated from other states of altered consciousness such as cardiac arrest, coma, narcolepsy, seizures, dizziness, and vertigo. Although multiple studies have focused on the diagnostic workup and on the prognosis of patients with syncope,1-5 data on the evaluation and outcome of elderly patients are only recently being reported.6, 7 Establishing a cause of syncope is frequently difficult. There are at least three possible reasons for the inability to define a cause of syncope. One, abnormalities causing syncope are frequently episodic or isolated events and may not be found at initial evaluation. Two, the diagnostic criteria for causes of syncope may be too stringent, leading to underdiagnosis. Three, many patients evaluated after the syncopal event may not recall the details surrounding their episode. If witnesses are not present, valuable observations are lost and the cause of syncope may not be apparent. Additionally, the evaluation of syncope in the elderly is especially more difficult because the elderly often have multiple coexisting diseases, maybe taking multiple medications, and have age-related physiologic changes that can predispose to syncope. Elderly noninstitutionalized patients have on the average 3.5 chronic diseases8 including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disorders, all of which can predispose to syncope. Older patients are reported to take three times as many drugs as the general population,9 and many of these medications may make persons susceptible to syncope. Additionally, age-related physiologic changes may alter the normal homeostatic mechanisms maintaining blood pressure and cerebral blood flow. Baroreceptor sensitivity decreases with age and the heart rate increase in response to upright posture, exercise, cough, and hypoxia may be blunted.10, 11 Furthermore, aging results in a diminished ability of the kidneys to conserve sodium when intake is restricted and plasma renin and aldosterone responses may be diminished in the elderly, leading to difficulties in maintaining extracellular fluid balance.12 As previously emphasized,13 multiple pathologic processes together may result in syncope in the elderly and occasionally it may be difficult to specifically assign a single entity as its cause. We have recently analyzed the data from our prospective syncope study in order to compare the diagnosis and prognosis of 210 elderly patients (mean age, 71 years; range, 60 to 90 years) to 190 younger patients (mean age, 39 years; range, 14 to 59 years).6 Patients in this study were accrued from the inpatient and outpatient services of the Presbyterian-University Hospital, Pittsburgh, from April 1981 through September 1983 and all underwent a standardized diagnostic evaluation.2, 6 In our elderly patients, as noted in Table 1, initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (EKG) were useful in assigning a diagnosis in the majority of the patients in whom a cause could be found. Furthermore, in the elderly, diagnosis assigned by electroencephalogram, carotid massage, cardiac catheterization, cerebral angiogram, and stress test were suggested by findings on the initial history and physical examination. These results in the elderly are similar to previous studies which have shown that a careful initial history and physical examination is the most important step in the evaluation of patients with syncope.1-3 Previous studies, however, have also shown that in a substantial number of patients a cause of syncope cannot be established after the initial history, physical examination, and EKG. Prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring has assumed a central role in the evaluation of this group of patients. Although in our study6 arrhythmias were more frequently diagnosed, and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring more often led to a diagnosis in the elderly, there are many issues regarding the use of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring that are not resolved. First, there is poor correlation between symptoms found during monitoring and concurrent electrocardiographic findings.14-16 Symptoms of dizziness or syncope during monitoring occur in 29 to 42% of patients.14-16 We have reported that a rhythm disturbance could not be identified during 75% of symptomatic periods.15 Arrhythmias may be excluded as a cause if the patient has syncope during monitoring, but no concurrent rhythm disturbance. However, most patients do not have syncope during monitoring. Therefore, presumptions regarding the cause of syncope based on asymptomatic findings are frequently necessary because of the prognostic importance and sporadic nature of the arrhythmias. However, high prevalenece of cardiac arrhythmias has been reported in asymptomatic elderly patients. Therefore, in elderly patients with syncope, it has been difficult to be certain which arrhythmias should be considered significant indicators for a potential cause of loss of consciousness. Validation of the criteria used by different investigators will be needed with long-term follow-up using recurrence of symptoms and mortality as endpoints. Second, the optimal duration of electrocardiographic monitoring has not been determined. One study suggested that patients should be continuously monitored until the symptoms recur.17 This approach is impractical and not cost-effective. We are currently evaluating the optimal duration of monitoring in patients with syncope. Third, the yield of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring is variable, showing transient arrhythmias as a potential cause of syncope in 10 to 64% of patients.18-23 Clinical predictors are needed to help identify patients more likely to have diagnostic findings. Because of the limitations of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, electrophysiologic studies have been advocated for use in the diagnosis and management of patients with syncope.24 These studies, however, consist of invasive and expensive diagnostic tests which are useful in the evaluation of very selected subgroups of patients with syncope, such as patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause “who have underlying organic heart disease. These tests may not be practical in many elderly patients who are frail, have multiple chronic medical illnesses, and who may not be able to undergo invasive diagnostic testing. A large number of abnormalities are reported on electrophysiologic studies but the diagnostic importance of many of these in terms of a cause of syncope is not well established. Although sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia, markedly prolonged H-V interval (greater than 80 m), and markedly prolonged sinus node recovery time are important findings in patients with unexplained syncope, the clinical significance of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, mildly prolonged H-V interval or sinus node recovery time, and induction of supraventricular tachycardia is not clear. Morbidity and mortality from syncope in the elderly may be different than the young. Injury after a fall in the elderly may have important ramifications in terms of the medical and psychological well-being of the elderly. Although there are no prior studies regarding injury due to syncope, studies on falls in the elderly reveal a higher incidence of bone fractures with advancing age.25 Approximately one-third of our patients had an injury due to a fall, but falls resulted in major trauma more frequently in the elderly. Bone fractures may be more likely to occur in the elderly because of their higher prevalence of osteoporosis. In addition, if premonitory symptoms are present, younger patients may be able to react more quickly and assume a supine or sitting position to avoid a severe injury. The mortality in our study was higher in the elderly as a reflection of deaths due to many underlying illnesses such as malignancies and pneumonia.6 In addition, more deaths in the elderly resulted from cardiovascular diseases such as chronic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disease. Elderly patients in our study also had a higher incidence of sudden death. A multivariate analysis of our data6 revealed that patients with a cardiovascular cause of syncope are at exceedingly high risk of mortality and sudden death regardless of age. In patients with a noncardiovascular cause of syncope or syncope of unknown origin, older age, a history of congestive heart failure, and male sex were important risk factors for mortality and sudden death. Recent studies on syncope in conjunction with our study in the elderly6 provide a framework for the evaluation of elderly patients with syncope. These studies show that a careful history and physical examination will help establish many of the causes of syncope and may suggest many of the cardiac or non-cardiac causes that require further testing for definitive diagnosis. An EKG and electrocradiographic monitoring should be done in patients in whom a cause is not found on initial history and physical examination. In selected patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause who have organic heart disease, electrophysiologic studies may provide evidence for possible cause of syncope, but further studies are needed to define the risk and benefit of this test in elderly patients. Other diagnostic tests should be used selectively. Our studies have shown that nongoal-directed use of head computed tomography scan, electroencephalogram, and glucose tolerance test establish few if any causes of syncope.1, 2, 6 Elderly patients have higher morbidity and mortality than the young. A systematic and meticulous evaluation for cause of syncope in the elderly is needed in the hope of decreasing recurrences, morbidity, and the incidence of sudden death.",

      "title": "Low Iron Status: A Possible Risk Factor for First Febrile Seizure",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: SEIZURES IN CHILDHOOD: A seizure or convulsion is a paroxysmal, time-limited change in motor activity and/or\r\nbehavior that result from abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures are common in the\r\npediatric age group and occur in approximately 10% of children. Most seizures in children are\r\nprovoked by somatic disorders originating outside the brain, such as high fever, infection,\r\nsyncope, head-trauma, hypoxia, toxins, or cardiac arrhythmias. Other events, such as breathholding\r\nspells and gastro esophageal reflux, can cause events that simulate seizures. A few\r\nchildren also exhibit psychogenic seizures of psychiatric origin. Less than one third of seizures\r\nin children are caused by epilepsy, a condition in which seizures are triggered recurrently from\r\nwithin the brain.\r\nFor epidemiological classification purposes, epilepsy is considered to be present when\r\ntwo or more unprovoked seizures occur at an interval greater than 24 hr apart. The cumulative\r\nlifetime incidence of epilepsy is 3% and more than half of cases begin in childhood. However,\r\nthe annual prevalence of epilepsy is lower (10.5—0.8%) because many children outgrow\r\nepilepsy.\r\nAlthough the outlook for most children with symptomatic seizures or those associated\r\nwith epilepsy is generally good, the seizures may signal a potentially serious underlying\r\nsystemic or central nervous system (CNS) disorder that requires thorough investigation and\r\nmanagement. For children with epilepsy, the prognosis is generally good, but 10—20% have persistent seizures refractory to drugs, and those cases pose a diagnostic and management\r\nchallenge.\r\nSeizures have been recognized since ancient times and although improvement has been\r\nmade in management over this century compared to the previous 2000 years, there are still far\r\ntoo many children whose lives are crippled by poorly controlled seizures. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the association between iron deficiency and the first febrile seizure. DISCUSSION: In our study to detect low iron status as a possible risk factor for first febrile seizures 63\r\ncases and 63 age and sex matched controls are studied and analyzed .\r\nIn the present study we found that the peak incidence of febrile seizure occur during one to\r\ntwo years of age and the mean age is 18 months. This is comparable to previous studies. The\r\npeak age of onset being 14-18 months of age as per Nelson textbook of pediatrics (22). Berg et\r\nal. in his study found that the peak incidence is between 18 and 24 months (12). Similarly\r\nNaveedur Rehman et al. reported the peak incidence at 22 Months (18).\r\nThe present study depicts that the incidence of febrile seizures is slightly higher in boys\r\nthan in girls and the male: female ratio 1.4: 1. This is similar to the study by Berg et al (12).\r\nwhile Naveedur Rehman et al. reported no gender difference in their study (18).\r\nIn our study family history of febrile seizures is seen only in 28.5% of cases. But Forfar\r\ntextbook of pediatrics mentions that 50% will have a family history of convulsions and\r\n80% of monozygotic twins are concordant for febrile convulsions (23).\r\nThe mean serum ferritin level in our study is 14.5ng/ml. whereas Daoud As et al. in his\r\nstudy group from Jordan found that the mean ferritin level was 29.5ng/ml (17). It is\r\nprobably due to the fact that iron deficiency anemia is more prevalent in our country; the\r\nmean serum ferritin level of Indian children is also low when compared to the Western\r\nstandards. CONCLUSION: Plasma ferritin level and blood indices are significantly lower in children with febrile\r\nseizures as compared to children without febrile seizures suggesting that iron deficient children\r\nare more prone to febrile seizures. A follow-up study of patients found to be iron deficient at\r\nthe time of a first febrile seizure to determine the incidence of subsequent febrile seizures after\r\ntreatment for iron deficiency would be of great interest.\r\n· Daoud As et al. in his study found that a significant proportion of children with febrile\r\nseizures had only low serum ferritin level (17). The proportion of children with febrile\r\nseizures having low hemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Volume and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin were not statistically significant. Whereas our study demonstrates a\r\nstatistically significant difference in the proportion of children with febrile seizures have not\r\nonly low serum ferritin but also low hemoglobin and low Mean Corpuscular Volume. This\r\nis similar to the findings reported by Naveedur Rehman et al. in his study at Karachi (18).\r\nThis is probably due to the fact that iron deficiency occurs in three stages.\r\n(a) First stage characterized by decreased storage of iron without any other detectable\r\nabnormalities.\r\n(b) An intermediate stage of `latent iron deficiency` i.e. iron stores are exhausted, but\r\nanemia has not occurred yet.\r\n(c) The third stage is that of overt iron deficiency when there is a decrease in the\r\nconcentration of circulating hemoglobin due to impaired hemoglobin synthesis.\r\nThe children in Western countries if they are iron deficient are mostly in the early stage.\r\nSo the study done by Daoud AS et al. in Jordan has a significant proportion of children with\r\nlow ferritin level, without significant difference in HB, MCV and MCH. Whereas Indian\r\nchildren/children of our neighboring country Pakistan are in the stages of latent or overt iron\r\ndeficiency. So our study and the study done in Karachi by Naveedur Rehman et al. had a\r\nsignificantly greater proportion of children with not only low serum ferritin but also low HB\r\nand MCV.",

It becomes chronic, is not remitting and consists in episodes of compulsive eating during the night, which are then partially or completely forgotten by the patient. This condition must be differentiated from night-eating syndrome, which is far more common and is linked to endocrinological and psychiatric disorders, as well as to other disorders involving eating behaviour during sleeping hours.A 28-year-old male who had suffered from the clinical picture every day for 10 years; this condition consisted in nocturnal episodes of binge eating in a state of semi-sleepiness, with no remembrance of what had happened the next morning. The patient had no history of psychiatric pathologies or any other eating disorder, but he did not rest adequately at night, was overweight and had a family and personal history of other sleep disorders. Since he did not respond to other treatments, we decided to try therapy with topiramate; as a result, the episodes disappeared, tolerance was excellent and effectiveness was maintained throughout the two years' follow-up.In this paper we review eating disorders that occur during sleep, nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder and its therapeutic possibilities, while highlighting the usefulness of topiramate to treat this condition.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Most sleep‐related seizures occur during non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly during stage changes. Sleep‐related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a rare epileptic syndrome characterized by paroxysmal motor seizures, mainly arising from NREM sleep. Here, we report a patient with SHE who had seven seizures captured on video‐EEG‐polysomnography during REM sleep. Ictal semiology of this patient ranged from brief paroxysmal arousals to hypermotor seizures. On EEG‐polysomnography, the spontaneous arousals were more frequent during REM than NREM sleep, with a considerably higher arousal index in REM sleep (20/hour). While the reason for seizures during REM sleep in this patient is unclear, we speculate that the threshold and mechanisms of arousal during different sleep stages may be related to the occurrence of seizures.

      "abstract": "Pruritus, better known as itch, is ‘an unpleasant cutaneous sensation provoking the desire to scratch’.1 It is typically caused by pruritogens that activate nerve endings in cutaneous and transitional tissues (eg, conjunctivae, anal mucosa) and serves a protective function against noxious stimuli.\n\nItch can also occur with diseased or malfunctioning pruritogenic neurones in the absence of a pruritogen—a symptom termed neuropathic pruritus or neuropathic itch.2 Neuropathic pruritus is a well described but under-recognised symptom of neurological disorders. The site of involvement may be (i) peripheral nerve and root, (ii) spinal cord or (iii) brain. It may accompany a variety of peripheral and central neurological disorders, including postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, traumatic nerve injury, complex regional pain syndrome, multiple sclerosis and stroke.3\n\nNeuromyelitis optica is a relapsing inflammatory astrocytopathic disorder affecting predominantly the optic nerves and spinal cord. It is associated with antiaquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) in up to 70% of patients. Spinal cord involvement typically presents as a longitudinally-extensive transverse myelitis with associated sensorimotor and sphincter dysfunction. Sensory symptoms such as numbness, dysaesthesia, pain and tonic spasms are common.4 This report highlights neuropathic pruritus as an under-recognised feature of neuromyelitis optica.\n\nA 45-year-old woman with no previous medical history presented with a 4-day history of unexplained nausea, vomiting, hiccup and vertigo. On the fourth day, she developed bilateral forearm itching. Over the following 3 days, she developed rapidly progressive weakness from the chest down, ultimately resulting in complete paraplegia, sensory loss and loss of both bladder and bowel function. She also developed weakness in both arms, worse on the left side.\n\nShe was admitted 3 days after the onset of her nausea and vomiting, which subsided a day later. However, the itching …",

      "abstract": "Background: Rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder (RBD) is a rapid eye movement parasomnia, which in its symptomatic type could be induced by the introduction or the discontinuation of several drugs and substances. No references for antiepileptic drugs and especially for lamotrigine are known regarding pharmacologically induced RBD. Case Report: We report a case of a 68-year-old man already suffering from RBD, who developed very brief episodes of epigastric discomfort followed by impaired consciousness and was given a diagnosis of epilepsy. Lamotrigine was started at 25 mg/d, reached a maximum of 100 mg/d after 2 months and was retained at this dose for 1 more month. During this period there was a slight decrease in the episodes of impaired consciousness and no appreciable changes in the frequency and intensity of RBD symptomatology. Immediately following the abrupt discontinuation of lamotrigine, RBD symptomatology was severely aggravated, with dreams becoming more vivid and frightening and occurring almost every night. RBD symptomatology gradually subsided over 2 months, reaching levels comparable to those before lamotrigine. The impaired consciousness episodes remained unaffected and were considered to be nonepileptic. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine may worsen symptoms of comorbid idiopathic RBD.",

Both phenomena can occur in the course of a large number of cerebrovascular pathological processes, and they may develop in either isolated or combined modalities. Isolated auditory, olfactory, and tactile hallucinations are a rare event and have been associated with a number of stroke subtypes. Charles-Bonnet syndrome is characterized by the occurrence of visual hallucinations that are formed, complex, persistent or repetitive, and stereotyped; fully or partially retained insight; and absent delusions. Peduncular hallucinosis may develop following rostral brainstem lesion and characterized by seeing animals of bizarre appearance, transformation of the animals into human figures, mobile and multiple-colored images, and visuotactile associations. Isolated or combination of visual and auditory hallucinations following multi-infarct dementia with lesions involving occipitotemporal regions may occasionally occur. In most of the patients, auditory hallucinations were observed mostly after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke involving posterior parts of the cerebral hemisphere and more frequently in the right than in the left. Patients with syncope and transient cerebral hypoxia may experience visual and auditory hallucinations such as gray haze, colored patches, or bright lights consisting of rushing or roaring noises, screaming, or voices.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Sleep disturbances in schizophrenia may arise during the acute phase of illness and persists in many cases in chronic phase.The authors intend to review the main sleep disturbances observed in schizophrenia, the possible pathophysiological mechanisms, their clinical impact, and the effects of antipsychotic medication on sleep architecture.This study was carried out a systematic search of published literature from January 1965 to May 2010, through PubMed, using the following key words: sleep, REM sleep, NREM sleep, schizophrenia, polysomnography, actigraphy and antipsychotics.Most changes found in objective studies using the polysomnography, in patients with schizophrenia are: reduction of total sleep time, decrease in slow wave sleep, REM latency and sleep efficiency. Studies using actigraphy also reveal that these patients experience changes in circadian rhythm sleep disorders, specifically the irregular type and phase advance. Although some sleep disorders improve with antipsychotic treatment, in many cases, even during the remission of the disease, sleep continues fragmented , suggesting that there are physiopathologic mechanisms involved in sleep disturbance in these patients.Privation of adequate and restful sleep has a negative impact on rehabilitation strategies, quality of life of patients with schizophrenia, and may contribute to worsening of cognitive deficits.",

In unplanned complex suicides self-inflicted injuries by sharp force, especially cuts of the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases the suicide switches from cuts to stabs (mostly to the heart region). Other methods often used after the first phase of suicide are hanging and jump from a height.

S disturbances have been shown to increase risk and/or exacerbate psychiatric and physical health problems in many different populations. However, few studies have examined the relationships among sleep, psychiatric, and cognitive functioning in Veterans with TBI.\r\nMethods: Retrospective chart reviews of 137 Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans with a history of mild to moderate TBI referred for cognitive rehabilitation at the Veteran Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.\r\nResults: 100% of Veterans reported clinically significant sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory [PSQI] global scores >5). Veterans also reported clinically relevant impairments in sleep latency (50 minutes), total sleep time (5.5 hours), and sleep efficiency (77%). More severe sleep problems were related to greater endorsement of depressive, post-concussive, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. Conversely, sleep disturbance showed limited associations with objective neuropsychological assessment. Overall measures of affective functioning were significantly associated with global measures of sleep quality, though such relationships were not observed for quantitative measures of sleep.\r\nConclusions: Veterans with mild to moderate TBI exhibit very high rates of sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance is associated with higher levels of comorbid psychiatric symptomatology, particularly affective complaints. The high prevalence of sleep problems in Veterans with a history of TBI underscores a need to develop both a better understanding of etiologic mechanisms relating brain injury and sleep and a better clinical appreciation of the ramifications of sleep disturbance on daily functioning and recovery in individuals who experience TBI.",

When the right hemisphere is damaged a variety of cognitive abnormalities may result, including hemiinattention and neglect, prosopagnosia, constructional apraxia, visualperceptual disturbances, and agnosia for environmental, musical, and emotional sounds. Similarly, a myriad of affective abnormalities may occur, including indifference, depression, hysteria, gross social-emotional disinhibition, florid manic excitement, childishness, euphoria, impulsivity, and abnormal sexual behavior. Patients may become delusional, engage in the production of bizzare confabulations and experience a host of somatic disturbances such as pain and body-perceptual distortions. Based on studies of normal and \"split-brain\" functioning, it also appears that the right hemisphere maintains a highly developed social-emotional mental system and can independentyly perceive, recall and act on certain memories and experiences without the aid or active reflective participation of the left. This leads to situations in which the right and left halves of the brain sometime act in an uncoopertive fashion, which gives rise to inter-manual and intrapsychic conflicts.",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by two or more years of recurrent and intermittent mood episodes in which the individual oscillates or “cycles” between periods of depression and hypomania, with or without normal periods interspersed between the depressive and hypomanic states. Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

It causes a relative lack of breathing and sleeping that bodes disaster for the patient. Alternately breathing and not breathing, the afflicted sleeper struggles to inspire through an obstructed upper airway or, more correctly, an occluded oropharynx. He repeatedly experiences episodic hypoxemia, which, in turn, disrupts his sleep. (This use of the male pronoun is convenient and correct, statistically; OSA is rare in women.) Obstructive sleep apnea is a multisystem disorder involving metabolic, respiratory, and neural abnormalities. The cause of the airway obstruction is multifaceted and includes the following: structural encroachment on the oropharyngeal lumen, subatmospheric intrapharyngeal pressure, and hypotonicity of oropharyngeal muscles. Similarly, secondary disease manifestations appear in multiple systems; respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and hypersomnolence are characteristic of severe OSA, and this complex is usually referred to",

Concerting lateral movements, complete paralysis of abduction, adduction (sparing convergence) or ipsilateral laterality is suggestive of damage to the radicular fibres of the abducencs nucleus (VI), to its internuclear neurons or to the nucleus itself respectively. Isolated paralysis of saccades is in favour of a lesion of the paramedian pontine reticular formation.

      "title": "Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief",
      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Beneficial effects on sleep architecture following nCPAP treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea patients Bozhidar Dimitrov1* 1 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Bulgaria The Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients suffer, among many other deteriorative clinical signs, of severely disrupted and disorganized night sleep. In early stages of the illness symptoms of concentration and memory loss, fatigue and mood changes are mild and susceptible to overcome. The prolonged negligence in seeking timely help leads in behavioral terms to the appearance of the Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) Syndrome, major cause of traffic accidents and occupational hazards, due to inability to sustain vigilance and alertness. We have treated patients with OSA by way of split-night titration, providing nasal Continuous Positive Air Pressure (nCPAP) during the second part of a testing night sleep. Full polysomnography was performed on an Alice3/Alice5, RespironicsTM equipment. Initially, patients with OSA have shown multiple episodes of arousals (up to 100 per hour) that varied from autonomous through cortical to behavioral arousal. They dwelt mostly in shallow early stages 1 or 2 of the sleep (Rechtschaffen & Kales scores) and have had many other concomitant features of the ailment: tachi/bradicardia, low blood oxygenation (down to below 70%), multiple apnea/hypopnea episodes (Respiratory Disturbance Index, RDI, up to 80 per hour). Severe cases were presented with just about an hour of total sleep time. Immediately following the application of a nasal mask and switching to the nCPAP apparatus, patients recovered their normal sleep architecture in the course of minutes. The proportion of slow wave sleep stages 3 and 4 reached 26% of the total sleep time, in many cases the REM-rebound phenomenon occurred: sudden appearance after lights-off of a REM sleep instead of reaching step-wise stage 1 through stage 5 and the duration of REM exceeded several-folds the usual amount. This gradually subsided in the course of nCPAP application for several nights. Arousal and respiratory disturbance indices were down to single-digit scores. All other measured parameters also recovered and the beneficial effect was observed immediately after awakening in the morning when headache, nausea, drowsiness and fatigue were miraculously abolished. Although the cognitive deficit - a characteristic feature of long-time OSA patients - was persistent to some degree for many more months, the quality of life was dramatically improved and these patients were further reintegrated into doing daily routines with flair and easiness. The frequently unappreciated cause of the excessive sleepiness, namely sleep structure disorganization, was relieved by the application of nCPAP apparatus. Since OSA patients in early stages do not really feel seriously treatened and obstinently refuse to turn in for consultation and help, we strongly suggest that a full night polysomnography be performed in any suspicious case of daytime sleepiness and personality aberrations like mood and temper tantrum changes, cognitive and memory deficits.

      "abstract": "Objective This article reports a case series of atypical sexual behavior during sleep, which is often harmful to patients or bed partners. Methods Eleven subjects underwent clinical evaluation of complaints of sleep-related atypical sexual behavior. Complaints included violent masturbation, sexual assaults, and continuous (and loud) sexual vocalizations during sleep. One case was a medical-legal case. Sleep logs, clinical evaluations, sleep questionnaires, structured psychiatric interviews, polysomnography, actigraphy, home electroencephalographic monitoring during sleep, and clinical electroencephalographic monitoring while awake and asleep were used to determine clinical diagnoses. Results Atypical sexual behaviors during sleep were associated with feelings of guilt, shame, and depression. Because of these feelings, patients and bed partners often tolerated the abnormal behavior for long periods of time without seeking medical attention. The following pathologic sleep disorders were demonstrated on polysomnography: partial complex seizures, sleep-disordered breathing, stage 3 to 4 non–rapid eye movement (REM) sleep parasomnias, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These findings were concurrent with morning amnesia. Conclusions The atypical behaviors were related to different syndromes despite the similarity of complaints from bed partners. In most cases the disturbing and often harmful symptoms were controlled when counseling was instituted and sleep disorders were treated. In some cases treatment of seizures or psychiatric disorders was also needed. Clonazepam with simultaneous psychotherapy was the most common successful treatment combination. The addition of antidepressant or antiepileptic medications was required in specific cases.",

Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them. These “minor” events can still progress to more significant harm.",

      "title": "Stuttering: an overview.",
      "abstract": "Speech dysfluency (stuttering) is common in children. Although stuttering often resolves before adulthood, it can cause significant anxiety for children and their families. Stuttering speech patterns are often easily identifiable; when a child is learning to talk, repetition of sounds or words, prolonged pauses, or excessively long sounds in words usually occur. Secondary behaviors (e.g., eye blinking, jaw jerking, involuntary head or other movements) that accompany stuttering can further embarrass the child, leading to a fear of speaking. The etiology of stuttering is controversial, but contributing factors may include cognitive abilities, genetics, sex of the child, and environmental influences. Research has shown that more than 80 percent of stuttering cases are classified as developmental problems, although stuttering can also be classified as a neurologic or, less commonly, psychogenic problem. The initial assessment of patients who stutter addresses the severity of dysfluency; secondary behaviors; and the impact of stuttering, such as patient distress. Further testing is useful in assessing the need for therapy. Pharmacologic therapy has not been shown to improve stuttering. Encouraging patients to talk slowly and the use of fluency-shaping mechanisms such as delayed auditory feedback devices to slow the speech rate can help minimize or eliminate stuttering. For patients with persistent stuttering, controlled fluency or stuttering modification therapy may be effective.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

      "title": "Simple Partial Seizure",
      "abstract": "A seizure is a symptom that refers to episodic, excessive, and disorderly neuronal activity in the brain. Traditionally seizures have been classified into and generalized. Partial seizure refers to abnormal neural activity localized to one area of the cerebral hemisphere and having a discernible or localized onset. When there is no associated impairment in consciousness, it is called a simple seizure, and when it is associated with impairment in consciousness, it is called a complex seizure. When a seizure becomes generalized, it is referred to as a partial seizure with secondary generalization. New terminology for a simple seizure is focal onset aware seizure.Partial seizures are the most common type of seizures in patients with epilepsy. Complex seizures occur more often than simple seizures, although most complex seizures start as simple seizures.Patients with simple seizures remain awake and aware throughout the seizure, and some patients can even talk during the episode. It may be difficult to distinguish them from complex seizures in infants and patients with cognitive and speech difficulties, as impairment in consciousness can be difficult to assess in these patients.The term aura refers to signs and symptoms that occur with a seizure before consciousness is lost and for which memory is intact afterward. Auras that are not followed by seizure should be considered aware seizures or simple seizures.Depending on clinical signs, symptoms, and EEG localization, seizures can be further subdivided into four types: Focal motor seizures Focal sensory seizures Autonomic seizures Psychological seizures Focal Motor Seizures The or motor seizure occurs due to an epileptogenic lesion on the contralateral frontal lobe. Motor symptoms constitute the primary clinical manifestation. Typically, consciousness is not impaired in seizures of discrete motor areas. They usually originate from the supplementary motor area and cause turning movements of the head and neck to the opposite side and sometimes tonic contractions of the limbs and trunk on the same side. This may or may not be followed by generalized clonic movements. Subdivisions of ictal motor symptoms include elementary (tonic, clonic, dystonic, versive) and automatism (coordinated, repetitive motor activity like lip-smacking, tapping, and swallowing). Another classification based on clinical symptomatology uses the terms like clonic, tonic, or versive seizures.Focal motor seizures are more common on the face, hands, and toes because these areas have disproportionately large cortical representations. The excitatory focus is usually around the rolandic (motor) cortex. If there are accompanying sensory symptoms, the focus may be on post-rolandic convolution. Temporal lobe origin seizures sometimes have head-turning movements on the same side followed by the forceful contraversive turning of the head and body. Clonic seizures refer to repeated, short contractions of various muscle groups characterized by twitching movements or rhythmic jerking that recur at regular intervals of less than 1 to 2 seconds. These seizures are brief, lasting less than one to two minutes. In clonic seizures, there is epileptic activation of a restricted area of the precentral gyrus. Tonic seizures refer to sustained contractions that last for more than 5 to 10 seconds and result in the posturing of the limbs and whole body. Focal tonic seizures refer to tonic contractions restricted to a part of the body on one side. Focal tonic seizures are attributed to activation of Brodmann area 6, particularly the mesial frontal region. There may be some involvement of the premotor areas in some cases. Versive seizures consist of sustained, forceful, involuntary turning of head and eyes to one side due to tonic contraction of head and eye muscles. Usually, they are accompanied by loss of consciousness, but occasionally patients may be aware of the forced involuntary eye and head-turning. The version can result from seizures originating from various locations and spreading to the premotor cortex. Following convulsions with predominant motor symptoms, patients may have transient, functional, and localized paralysis of the affected limbs. This is known as Todd paralysis and can last minutes to hours, usually in proportion to the duration of the convulsion. This postepileptic paralysis occurs due to persistent dysfunction of the affected epileptogenic area and is the signature of a seizure. It has significant clinical value in lateralizing the hemisphere of seizure onset. Jacksonian March Seizure Jacksonian march seizure starts with tonic contractions in one hand or on one side of the face or the muscles of one foot. This is followed by clonic movements in these parts and sometimes a series of clonic movements with increasing frequency that builds up to a tonic contraction. These movements may spread (march) from the muscles affected to the other muscles on the same side of the body. In classic Jacksonian march, the seizure spreads from hand to arm to face and then down the leg ipsilaterally, or if it started in the foot, then seizure marches up the leg, down the arm, and then to the face. This typically happens over a short time (20 to 30 seconds). There can be other associated symptoms like automatism (lip smacking or tapping movements), hallucinations, muscle cramping, head-turning, etc. Symptoms are usually mild. These seizures rarely become generalized, and typically consciousness remains intact. Jacksonian march seizure can be mistaken for a transient ischemic attack, migraine, or other condition. Focal Somatosensory Seizures Sensory seizures present as numbness, tingling, crawling sensation, pins and needles feeling, and rarely, as pain or thermal sensations. They can be or can march to other ipsilateral body parts and usually have a focus in or around post-rolandic convolution of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. Visual seizures are rare but have localizing significance. Visual hallucinations and visual loss are typical of occipital lobe epilepsy but sometimes can occur with seizure foci in anteromedial temporal and occipitotemporal regions. Auditory hallucinations are a rare initial manifestation of seizure and have sometimes been noted with lesions in the posterior temporal lobe on one side. Olfactory hallucinations often occur with a lesion in the inferior and medial parts of the temporal lobe. Gustatory hallucinations can occur in temporal lobe disease with lesions in the insula and parietal operculum. Autonomic Seizures Autonomic seizures manifest with predominantly altered autonomic function. Some common autonomic signs and symptoms include diaphoresis, shivering, piloerection, a rising sensation in epigastrium, nausea, changes in blood pressure and heart rate (commonly tachycardia), and pupillary changes. Autonomic features are common in several nonepileptic conditions, making autonomic seizures harder to diagnose.Some specific epilepsy syndromes with prominent autonomic features include neonatal seizures, epilepsy of infancy with migrating seizures, Dravet syndrome, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and early-onset benign occipital epilepsy. Psychological Seizures Psychological seizures manifest with affective and cognitive symptoms like memory flashbacks, dream-like events, Deja Vu feeling, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, and uncontrolled laughter or crying. They arise commonly from the temporal area rather than the extratemporal.",

      "title": "Sleep deprivation and hallucinations. A qualitative study of military personnel",
      "abstract": "Much anecdotal evidence suggests that sleep deprivation not only impairs performance, but also brings about other extraordinary effects like hallucinations. However, knowledge about how sleep deprivation may trigger hallucinations is limited. To qualitatively describe hallucinatory experiences during sleep deprivation 12 male military officers from the Norwegian Armed Forces who all had experienced at least one sleep loss-induced hallucinatory experience were recruited. Data were collected and analyzed by semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. This resulted in the identification of three distinct main themes: (1) Modalities, (2) circumstances/triggers and (3) reactions to hallucinations. Hallucinations were experienced in several modalities (visual, auditory and multi-modality), although visual hallucinations seemed to dominate. Typical reported circumstances/triggers were sleep loss, physical exhaustion, time-of-day, low calorie intake, mental exhaustion and lack of external stimuli (low sensory and social input, boring situations, and monotonous activity). Negative emotions were dominant during the hallucinatory episodes. Often some reasoning and checking on behalf of the officers were necessary to differentiate between real percepts and hallucinations. In some cases the hallucinations caused erroneous actions. Retrospectively, most officers viewed their hallucinatory experiences in light of positive emotions and several emphasized having learned something from them. The results are discussed in relation to the existing literature and suggestions for future studies are outlined.",

      "title": "Sleep less and bite more: Sleep disorders associated with occlusal loads during sleep",
      "abstract": "Occlusal overload during sleep is a significant clinical issue that has negative impacts on the maintenance of teeth and the longevity of dental prostheses. Sleep is usually viewed as an 'out-of-functional' mode for masticatory muscles. However, orodental structures and prostheses are not free from occlusal loads during sleep since masticatory muscles can be activated at a low level within normal sleep continuity. Thus, an increase in masticatory muscle contractions, by whatever the cause, can be associated with a risk of increased occlusal loads during sleep. Among such conditions, sleep bruxism (SB) is a type of sleep-related movement disorders with potential load challenge to the tooth and orofacial structures. Patients with SB usually report frequent tooth grinding noises during sleep and there is a consecutive increase in number and strength of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA). Other types of masticatory muscle contractions can be non-specifically activated during sleep, such as brief contractions with tooth tapping, sleep talking, non-rhythmic contractions related to non-specific body movements, etc.; these occur more frequently in sleep disorders. Studies have shown that clinical signs and symptoms of SB can be found in patients with sleep disorders. In addition, sleep becomes compromised with aging process, and a prevalence of most sleep disorders is high in the elderly populations, in which prosthodontic rehabilitations are more required. Therefore, the recognition and understanding of the role of sleep disorders can provide a comprehensive vision for prosthodontic rehabilitations when prosthodontists manage complex orodental cases needing interdisciplinary collaborations between dentistry and sleep medicine.",

However, research has shown that sleep is also required for other vital processes such as memory consolidation and normal physiological functioning. Extensive research has shown that the areas that control our sleeping behaviour are the hypothalamus, brain stem, midbrain, and amygdala. These areas coordinate events during the non-REM and REM phases of sleep-wake cycles. GABA and adenosine, two chemical neurotransmitters, are also involved and play an important role in our sleep cycle. Insomnia has caused a slew of psychological and physiological issues such as fatigue, decreased mental concentration, irritable nature and a higher risk of heart attacks and stroke. It has reduced the patient's quality of life of the patient and have a social impact on them. Primary insomnia is defined as the inability/absence of proper sleep and impaired daily life functioning. Secondary insomnia, on the other hand, is believed to result from pre-existing medical conditions, substance abuse, or as a side effect of certain drug therapy. Insomnia is diagnosed through physical examination and the use of electrical devices to monitor sleep behavior.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is frequently acquainting as an abnormal accumulation of body fat to the degree that may cause serious health consequences. ( Yanovski et al. , 2014). One of the most common complication of obesity is obstructive sleep apnea(OSA). Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a widespread complaint that is closely associated with global obesity epidemics, and it is described as frequent complete or partial flop of the upper airway during sleep leading to gaseous exchange impairment and disturbance of sleep. It is the commonest category of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in the world as reported in different epidemiological studies. (McNicholas et al ., 2007). Central sleep apnea : is described  as decreased respiratory effort leading to decrease or absence of ventilation .While in mixed apnea it is categorized by starting centrally and ending with obstructive events.In obstructive sleep apnea: the effort of  respiration is preserved but ventilation decrement  or absence due to partial or total obstruction in the upper airway; apnea is well-defined as the total airflow cessation lasting 10 sec. or more , There are three types of apneas :obstructive, central and mixed . A hypopnea: is defined as a reduction in airflow (30-50%) that is followed by an arousal from sleep or a decrease in oxyhaemoglobin saturation (3-4%)( The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999 and Kushida et al .,2005). The severity of sleep apnea is evaluated with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which is the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. According to the American Academy of sleep Medicine recommendations , OSA is defined with AHI>5., and it is classified as mild OSA with AHI of 5 to 15;moderate OSA with AHI of 16 to 30;and severe OSA with AHI > 30.(The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999). The Apnea–Hypopnea Index or Apnoea–Hypopnoea Index (AHI) is an index used to determine sleep apnea severity. It is characterized by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The apneas (pauses in breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation. Combining AHI and oxygen desaturation measurement gives a complete sleep apnea severity score that assesses the number of sleep disruptions and degree of oxygen desaturation.               (Ruehland et al .,2009 ). The AHI is calculated by dividing the number of apnea events by the number of hours of sleep. AHI values are categorized as Normal: 0-4;Mild Sleep Apnea: 5-14;Moderate Sleep Apnea: 15-29; Severe Sleep Apnea: 30 or more.(Ruehland et al ., 2009 ).",

      "abstract": "Neurologists are increasingly asked to see patients with acute neurological problems, many of whom have disorders of consciousness and awareness. The intensive care unit is a common source of referral of such patients where common questions include:\n\n\n\n The neurologist in training needs to have a clear understanding of the basis of normal consciousness, to be aware of the range of disorders of consciousness, and particularly to be aware of the pitfalls in diagnosis.\n\nConsciousness is a state characterised by awareness of self and environment and an ability to respond to environmental factors. Normal consciousness can be regarded as having two separate but closely interrelated components. The first of these is the arousal component of wakefulness. It is this that keeps the patient awake and which relates to the physical manifestations of awakening from sleep—for example, eyes being open, motor activity. The second component is the content of consciousness or the awareness of self and environment. This consists of the sum of psychological functions of sensations, emotions, and thoughts.\n\nA detailed description of the pathophysiology of consciousness is beyond the scope of this article. In simple terms, normal consciousness requires an interaction between the reticular activating system of the brain stem and the cerebral cortex. The reticular activating system is responsible for arousal or alertness and the cerebral cortex is responsible for the content of consciousness or the awareness of self and environment.\n\nIt should be recognised that an individual's awareness of self can only be recognised by an observer on the basis of the responses made to …",

      "title": "Invited Review: Developmental plasticity in respiratory control",
      "abstract": "Development of the mammalian respiratory control system begins early in gestation and does not achieve mature form until weeks or months after birth. A relatively long gestation and period of postnatal maturation allows for prolonged pre- and postnatal interactions with the environment, including experiences such as episodic or chronic hypoxia, hyperoxia, and drug or toxin exposures. Developmental plasticity occurs when such experiences, during critical periods of maturation, result in long-term alterations in the structure or function of the respiratory control neural network. A critical period is a time window during development devoted to structural and/or functional shaping of the neural systems subserving respiratory control. Experience during the critical period can disrupt and alter developmental trajectory, whereas the same experience before or after has little or no effect. One of the clearest examples to date is blunting of the adult ventilatory response to acute hypoxia challenge by early postnatal hyperoxia exposure in the newborn. Developmental plasticity in neural respiratory control development can occur at multiple sites during formation of brain stem neuronal networks and chemoafferent pathways, at multiple times during development, by multiple mechanisms. Past concepts of respiratory control system maturation as rigidly predetermined by a genetic blueprint have now yielded to a different view in which extremely complex interactions between genes, transcriptional factors, growth factors, and other gene products shape the respiratory control system, and experience plays a key role in guiding normal respiratory control development. Early-life experiences may also lead to maladaptive changes in respiratory control. Pathological conditions as well as normal phenotypic diversity in mature respiratory control may have their roots, at least in part, in developmental plasticity.",

      "title": "Tourette's Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Tourette's Disorder (TD), also known as Tourette syndrome, is characterized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) by the presence of multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics beginning prior to age 18 and continuing for at least one year or longer. Although the motor and vocal tics do not need to occur concurrently, the tics need to occur several times a day or more nearly every day or intermittently with no tic‐free interval of more than 3 months for the diagnosis to be given. Motor tics are defined as sudden, rapid, repetitive, stereotyped muscle movements, and vocal tics are similarly rapid and spontaneous vocalizations or repetitive sounds. Motor and vocal tics can be further categorized as simple or complex. Simple motor tics are brief, seemingly insignificant movements involving one muscle location, for example a hard eye blink, shoulder shrug, head tilt, nose twitch, and/or facial grimace. Simple vocal tics are monosyllabic, usually meaningless sounds, such as grunting, throat clearing, sniffing, and/or coughing. Complex tics are longer in duration, can be mistaken as voluntary and purposeful, and involve the coordination of multiple muscle groups, for example spinning, jumping, bending, kicking, touching self or objects, and facial or hand gestures. Complex vocal tics include interpretable noises, such as barking, shouting, or chirping, as well as vocalizations, such as words, phrases, repetition of self (palilalia) or others (echolalia). Coprolalia (e.g., profane language), often thought to be a defining symptom of TD, is quite rare, occurring in only about 10% of cases.",

Nevertheless, this is the picture that can be produced by an increased serum viscosity.<sup>1,2</sup>The bleeding characteristically occurs from the nose, mouth, or gums but may stem from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract.

The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen.

The interviewer should make sure that any “yes” response is not simply caused by exposure to a certain situation or object (Specific Phobia), being the focus of attention (Social Anxiety Disorder/Social Phobia), being separated from parents (Separation Anxiety), and so on. If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

(2) Non–rapid eye movement sleep increasing during the age of highest risk for sudden infant death syndrome facilitates some seizures (seizure gate).

(4) The sudden nature of both deaths warrants an exploration of similarities in the terminal pathway. Moreover, sudden infant death syndrome, febrile seizures, sudden unexplained death in childhood, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy share some of the following risk factors: prone sleeping, infections, hyperthermia, preterm birth, male gender, maternal smoking, and mutations in genes that regulate sodium channels.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder (PD)",
      "abstract": "Participants of expert group on CPG for Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder S.C Tiwari, Nilesh Shah, I.D. Gupta, B.N. Gangadhar, Devendra Vijay Vergiya, Pratap Sharan INTRODUCTION Short description of anxiety disorders Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Definition: One of the anxiety disorders, where the primary symptoms of anxiety are present at most days for at least several weeks at a time, and usually for several months. The symptoms should usually involve elements of: Apprehension (worries about future misfortunes, feeling \" on edge\", etc) Motor tension (restlessness, inability to relax, trembling) Autonomic over activity (light-headedness, sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea, dry mouth etc) The transient appearance of depressive symptoms, does not rule out the diagnosis of GAD as main diagnosis. The sufferer must not meet the full criteria for depressive episode, phobic disorder, panic disorder or OCD. Patients with generalised anxiety disorder have high anxiety and are worried about intrapsychic conflicts or external environmental events. They have multiple somatic symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, difficulty in concentration, irritability, fatigue, muscular tensions and difficulty in sleeping particularly early insomnia. They have vague apprehension about future events and fear of unknown. Common features observed in anxiety disorders include: Panic Disorder- Episodes of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by severe autonomic activity, palpitations, sweating, dyspnoea, chocking sensation or other somatic symptoms like chest pain, trembling, nausea, discomfort or fluttering sensation in abdomen and impending fear of death. Patient perceives it as a serious medical condition and invariably reaches to a medical emergency setup where after thorough physical evaluation he is declared normal. Phobias- Many patients with GAD suffer from irrational, unrealistic fears and acute autonomic reactions to certain specific situations or extreme fear to certan inanimate objects. They include agarophobia (fear of open spaces) fear of crowds, being out side home alone or traveling in a bus train or car. Some may have fear in closed spaces (claustrophobia) fear of heights (acrophobia) fear of opposite sex (hetero-phobia) fear of sight of blood (erythrophobia) or fear of facing certain social situations (social anxiety disorder) the common feature among all phobias being intense fear, increased autonomic activity and avoidance behavior (avoiding the fearful object or situation). Obsessive compulsive disorder- (OCD) has been seperately dealt with in details in these guidelines however the patients suffering from OCD have recurrent repetitive unwanted intrinsic thoughts (obsessions) or actions (compulsions) or both which lead to extreme distress, loss of time and impairment of functioning of the individual. The obsessious include douts, ideas of contamination, sexual thoughts or religious preoccupations or negative thoughts towards gods/goddess, the compulsions include activities like counting, checking, repeating, washing hoarding and touching objects, some have to and fro movements of body parts. Patient is aware of the irrationality of thoughts/actions but cannot control them, which produces intense anxiety and autonomic arousal with feelings of helplessness and guilt. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Usually it occurs after a terrifying event that involving physical or psychological traumatic event. It may also occure because of witnessing or experiencing a serious harm to other significant persons in life. Patients have terrifying recollections of the event, or nightmares. Some patients have an experience of living the event in an illusionary or imaginary situation with hallucinations, or flashback episodes. The patients suffer from intense psychological or physical distress. Many patients develop loss of interest, estrangement from others, sleep disturbances, irritability, difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response. This phenomenon may persist for one month or more before it is diagnosed. Natural history and course The age of onset is difficult to specify, as most of the patients have been anxious for long but report late. Nearly 1/3rd of the patients who have GAD seek psychiatric treatment. Many go to GPs, physicians, cardiologist, chest specialist for the somatic component of the disorder. Because of the high incidence of co-morbid mental disorders, the course and prognosis is difficult to predict. The occurrence of several negative life events greatly increases the likelihood that the disorder will develop. In all, a chronic condition may be life long. COMMON INGREDIENTS OF MANAGEMENT PLAN (FLOW CHART-1 AND 2)FLOW CHART 1. Management of Generalized Anxiety DisorderFLOW CHART 2. Management of Panic DisorderThe aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following ways. 1. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times required as long as 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. 2. Psychotherapy Cognitive behaviour therapy Behavioural techniques Supportive Psychotherapy Insight oriented Psychotherapy Goals Psycho-education Direct explanation of the symptoms and disorder to the patient and the family. Monitoring of anxiety Cognitive restructuring: Corrects the hypothesized cognitive distortions and helps to identify and counter fear of bodily sensations. Efficacy Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has proven efficy other psychotherapies do help in ameliorating symptoms of anxiety. It addresses cognitive distortions and somatic symptoms. More effective with chronically anxious patients, may need 8-10 sessions. It has been shown that yogic techniques produced greater motivation to practice than progressive relaxation Meditation was found to be as effective as pharmacotherapy in controlling symptoms of anxiety. The overall efficacy claims are backed by very few Indian studies, but are useful. It requires considerable time and discipline from the patients. Adverse effects These are relatively benign. Some patients may develop dependence on the therapist and that needs cautious vigil. 3. Combined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic intervention Long-term outcome is better when they are used in combination. ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION 1. Performing a diagnostic evaluation Psychiatric evaluation and physical examination is necessary. It includes history of present illness, current symptoms; past psychiatric history, general medical history and history of substance use, personal history (eg. psychological development, life events and response to those events), social, occupational and family history; review of the patient's medications; physical and mental status examination and adequate diagnostic tool and criteria. Diagnose GAD according to ICD-10 (W.H.0,1992). Anxiety should not be due to the other Axis I disorder (eg. mood disorder, psychotic disorder, social phobia, OCD, somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, PTSD) or a general medical condition (eg. hyperthyroidism) or substance use disorder (intoxication or withdrawal), (see appendix-1 for flow chart). 2. Evaluating particular symptoms Patients experience excessive anxiety but many of them experience panic attacks, which may worsen the clinical picture. The prolonged illness may cause depressive symptoms with emergence of suicidality and substance abuse. 3. Evaluating severity of functional impairment Many may continue to function in their social and occupational lives with some impairment, others may become severely incapacitated and give up their jobs and social duties. The impairment in different areas can be assessed self-administered visual analog scale. FORMULATING TREATMENTS AND CHOICE OF TREATMENT SETTINGS The aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following way. 1. Establishing and maintaining atherapeutic alliance The treatment of GAD may be long lasting hence the alliance is crucial. Understanding the life events, the extent and severity of symptoms requires confiding and lasting therapeutic relationship. Attention to the patient's worries and fears are essential for long term gains 2. Monitoringthe patient's psychiatric status The symptomatic improvement in psychological and autonomic symptoms leads to greater confidence in the treating doctor. The anxiety goes slowly with treatment and bursts of severe symptoms during the treatment need constant monitoring. 3. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times is seen as a 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. a). Goals Reduce psychological and autonomic symptoms and other co morbid conditions. Improve occupational and social functioning. b). Efficacy Little Indian data to address the issue; mainly western data available. c). Adverse effects Different for different class of drugs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and pregabalin are recommended as first line drugs due to their favorable risk-benefit ratio, with some differentiation regarding the various anxiety disorders. The common category of pharmacological agents used in management of generialised anxiety disorders include SSRIs, SNRIs, Pregabalin, TCAs, Benzodiazepines, Antihistamines, Atypical antipsychotics, and Antioxidants. Role of vitamin A, C and E has been evaluated and recommended in adequate doses for patients suffering from GAD. Dosing Majority of patients respond to the low dose of antidepressants (with the exception of OCD). In the elderly, treatment should be started with half the recommended dose or less in order to minimize initial adverse drug events. The antidepressant dose should be increased to the highest recommended therapeutic level if the initial treatment with a low or medium dose fails. For patients who do not improve with standard treatments, a number of alternative options should be tried including augmentation with small dose of antipsychotics or adding another anxiolytic agent or addition of non-pharmacological therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or Yoga, Meditation and increased physical activity as described below. 4. Non-pharmacological treatment Non pharmacological treatment found useful in treatment of anxiety disorders include supportive therapy, Exposure therapy (e.g. gradual exposure in vivo, \"flooding\") and response prevention. Psychoeducational advice, and suggesions to not to avoid feared situations are helpful in management. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Adequate strength of evidence is available for Individual CBT, Group CBT and Self-directed CBT. Choosing between medications and CBT is determined by a number of factors, particularly the patient's preference, treatment options at hand, adverse drug effects, onset of efficacy, comorbidity (e.g. with depression), financial considerations, time availability, accessibility of psychiatric and psychological treatment resources, and experience of the clinician. Steps of CBT shall include: Psychoeducation Self-monitoring Systemic exposure to panic inducing cues Countering anxious beliefs Exposure to fear cues Modify [mal-adaptive behaviors Relapse prevention Dealing with transference issues Resolving interpersonal and other emotional issues. Initial expectations and anticipation favoring CBT Accept that the worrying is out of control Perhaps, worrying offers some protective value. CBT will facilitate future adversities, despite the worrying. During the course of the treatment, revised understanding: The reasons for worrying and fears cannot be controlled Subjectively learn to control response to the fears and worries Learn to obviate the behaviour of worrying Worrying does not have a protective value Actually, worrying reinforces negative thinking Excesive worrying increases likely hood or more anxieties in the future CBT does not alter the method of managing source of the worries CBT helps to be better equipped to handle the future stress. Indian modules of psychotherapy Several therapists have talked about Search of Indian module of psychotherapy and it is a felt need to have such a module, which is socially and culturally relevant. Ancient Indian thought has provided very rich knowledge regarding mind and its functioning. From the Vedic period issues relating to mind, consciousness, understanding of human life, its existence and the concept of Atman have been widely studied and several explanations to improve the quality of human life are available in Vedic and Post Vedic literature. The Bhagvad Gita contains in condensed form all the philosophical and psycholoical wisdom of the Upanishads. Bhagwad Gita describes all aspects of yoga, psychology and is unique among the psychlogical and philosophical teachings for a student of psychotherapy, various aspects of psychotherapeutic techniques are described in it. In this excellent module of Psychotherapy through 18 chapters way of self knowledge, the Yoga of action (karma) knowledge of renunciation and action, the path of meditation, knowledge of the absolute and eternal, yogic vision, yoga of devotion, profound knowledge of three Gunas and the wisdom of renunciation and liberation have been described at length, which leads to personality transformation of Arjuna. In the modern psychotherapy, cognitive restructuring is the goal of psychotherapy, which has been accomplished a great deal through Bhagwad Gita. Prekshadhayan A Jain Meditational technique propounded by Acharya Mahapragya, which includes relaxation, meditation, yoga, asanas and pranayam, a comprehensive capsule of behavioural management has been tried in management of GAD. On mental level, it proves to be an applied method to train the mind to concentrate. It offers a way to treat serious anxiety disorders with or without drugs. Large trials of this technique are still awaited. At present, few scientific studies are available. 5. Providing Education To The Patient And Family This seemingly unimportant aspect is most relevant to Indian settings where awareness of psychiatric illness and its realization and need for treatment with compliance is little. Many feel dejected, angry, isolated and may have suicidal ideas. Family and the patient need to be told that this is like any other illness that needs treatment and success depends on compliance. 6. Addressing early signs of relapse The education that the illness is a chronic relapsing illness is essential and emergence of anxiety with or without treatment should be promptly treated. Sudden discontinuation may lead to emergence of withdrawal symptoms thus early recognition by the patient and the family helps in prompt treatment. MANAGEMENT AS PER THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE ILLNESS The treatment recommendations for the different anxiety disorders are summarized in Table I. Some antianxiety drugs are effective in all anxiety disorders, whereas some drugs have only been studied in specific anxiety disorders and thus should be reserved for use in these particular disorders. Panic disorder and agoraphobia. In acute panic attacks, mouth desolving short-acting benzodiazepines and reassurance to the patient may be sufficient. SSRIs SNRIs are first-line treatments for longterm management. Patients should be treated for atleast six to eight months or longer to prevent relapses. A combination of CBT and anxiolytic medication has been shown to have the best treatment outcomes. In GAD and Social anxiety disorder (SAD): Choice of Drugs for Management are SSRIs, SNRIs and pregabalin. Buspirone and hydroxyzine are second line treatment. Benzodiazepines should only be used for long-term treatment when other drugs or CBT have not shown results. Specific phobia: Specific phobia should be treated with behaviour therapy including systematic desensatisation. SSRIs or short acting benzodiazepines should be tried in cases not responding to behaviour therapy. OCD: Choice of treatments is the SSRIs and the TCA clomipramine. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention are other proven techniques of management. PTSD: Choice of treatments includes the SSRIs and venlafaxine. Therapeutic conversation, psychoeducation and regrief therapy are non-pharmacological treatment techniques advocated. TREATMENT UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS (FLOW CHART-3)FLOW CHART 3. Management of Anxiety Disorders in Special PopulationPregnancy. The use of SSRIs and TCAs in pregnancy does not have increased risk for malformations. It is recommended to avoid paroxetine alprazolam use among pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant. Breast-feeding. SSRIs and TCAs are excreted into breast milk, they do not cause any harm to the new born because the concentration in breast milk is very small however infants of mothers on benzodiazepines, should be observed for signs of sedation, lethargy, poor suckling, and weight loss, and if high doses have to be used and long-term administration is required, breast feeding should probably be discontinued. Treating children and adolescents. Choice of treatment should be SSRIs concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior have ben reported therefore careful monitoring is advisable, presence of comorbid depression should be looked fore. Treating the elderly. Elderly have increased sensitivity for anticholinergic properties, an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension, and ECG changes during treatment with TCAs, and possible paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines, which include depression, with or without suicidal tendencies, phobias, aggressiveness, or violent behavior. Thus, treatment with TCAs or benzodiazepines is less favorable, while SSRIs appear to be safe. Treatment of patients with severe Physical disease. Patients with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and endocrine disease, irritable bowel syndrome, malignency, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hyperthyroidism may have associated anxiety reactions with their somatic disease state. Such anxiety disorders may compound the management and the prognosis of these primary conditions. Advocated pharmacological agents in such conditions include SSRIs and Venlafaxine. WHEN TO STOP TREATMENT Decesion to stop treatment will depend on clinical response of the patients. Usualy the treatment is stopped in a tapering manner after atleast 6 months stability of clinical improvement and asymptomatic status of the patient. Before stopping the treatment, the nature of illness possibilities of recurrence, response to triggers and his/her ability to cope with the situation should be discussed at length. Patient's personal view should be included in decesion making of stopping the treatment. Patient should be encouraged to adapt alternative methods of anxiety reduction like yoga, pranayam, relaxation techniques including progressive muscular relaxation (PMR)/Shavasan etc. which can be mastered by him before weaning off the smallest dose of antianxiety medication. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (MBCBT) for reducing cognitive and somatic anxiety and modifying dysfunctional cognitions in patients with anxiety disorders has been tried where in different versions of mindfulness meditation, cognitive restructuring, and strategies to handle worry, such as, worry postponement, worry exposure, and problem solving have been employed. However, these studies are on small number of patients and need carefull review for further application. MANAGEMENT OF SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATION Diffrent side effects will emerge with different category of antianxiety medication. They should be carefully observed and addressed to. Side effects of medication can be drug related or dose related. If it is drug, related, alternative class of drug should be tried for adequate length of time. If it is dose related then the dose of the drug has to be reduced. Things to remember for GAD: Anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects to be kept in mind when using tricyclic and Tetra cyclic for side effects. Precaution in suicidal patients. Long-term treatment may be required. Psychopharmacological therapy combined with psychotherapy works better.",

There is increasingly firm evidence that obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with hypertension, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and metabolic problems such as insulin resistance, even at mild levels which may not cause much daytime somnolence. In addition, the central and obstructive apnoeas found in cardiac failure affect heart muscle function. Treatment of the apnoea improves blood pressure and cardiac function and is likely to have a beneficial effect on mortality. Since obstructive sleep apnoea is common it should be sought by appropriate questioning in these patient groups. The treatments for obstructive sleep apnoea are effective but cumbersome and this remains a challenge if patients do not achieve obvious early benefits such as reduction in sleepiness or breathlessness.",

      "abstract": "Hearing loss can result from disorders or damage to the ear (peripheral auditory system) or the brain (central auditory system). Here, the basic structure and function of the central auditory system will be highlighted as relevant to cases of permanent hearing loss where assistive devices (hearing aids) are called for. The parts of the brain used for hearing are altered in two basic ways in instances of hearing loss: (1) Damage to the ear can reduce the number and nature of input channels that the brainstem receives from the ear, causing plasticity of the central auditory system. This plasticity may partially compensate for the peripheral loss, or add new abnormalities such as distorted speech processing or tinnitus. (2) In some situations, damage to the brain can occur independently of the ear, as may occur in cases of head trauma, tumors or aging. Implications of deficits to the central auditory system for speech perception in noise, hearing aid use and future innovative circuit designs will be provided to set the stage for subsequent presentations in this special educational session.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sleep‐related complaints affect 50–80% of patients on dialysis. Sleep disorders impair quality of life significantly. Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disruption has a profound impact both on an individual and on a societal level. The etiology of sleep disorders is often multifactorial: biologicsocialand psychological factors play a role. This is especially true for insomniawhich is the most common sleep disorder in different populationsincluding patients on dialysis. Biochemical and metabolic changeslifestyle factorsdepressionanxietyand other underlying sleep disorders can all have an effect on the development and persistence of sleep disruptionleading to chronic insomnia. Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleepor having nonrestorative sleep. It is also associated with daytime consequencessuch as sleepiness and fatigueand impaired daytime functioning. In most casesthe diagnosis of insomnia is based on the patient's historybut in some patients objective assessment of sleep pattern may be necessary. Optimally the treatment of insomnia involves the combination of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. In some cases acute insomnia resolves spontaneouslybut if left untreatedit may lead to chronic sleep problems. The treatment of chronic insomnia is often challenging. There are only a few studies specifically addressing the management of this sleep disorder in patients with chronic renal disease. Considering the polypharmacy and altered metabolism in this patient populationtreatment trials are clearly needed. This article reviews the diagnosis of sleep disorders with a focus on insomnia in patients on dialysis.",

      "title": "Self-induction of seizures: the ultimate non-compliance.",
      "abstract": "The most extreme form of non-cooperation in the treatment of epilepsy is seen in those patients who deliberately induce their own seizures. The overwhelming majority of these patients are photosensitive and make use of visual stimuli to induce either overt seizures or 'sub-clinical' epileptiform EEG discharges. Best documented is the use of flicker produced by waving one hand in front of the eyes, but much more frequent, if less easily recognised, is the use of a manoeuvre involving slow closure and forced upward deviation of the eyes. This is exhibited by a quarter of patients with photosensitive epilepsy, many of whom report that the manoeuvre gives a pleasant sensation or relieves feelings of stress. Other forms of reflex epilepsy are used less often for self-induction and for a variety of motives. Often there is clear social advantage such as avoidance of school or gaining attention. Some patients find that the risk of a spontaneous attack is lessened following a self-induced seizure and can therefore contrive their fits to occur only in situations which are safe and convenient. Self-induced seizures are notoriously resistant to antiepileptic therapy even if the patient is compliant. Preliminary trials suggest, however, that in some patients dopamine antagonists may reduce this behaviour, apparently by making self-induced discharges or seizures non-rewarding.",

      "title": "La actividad Alfa frontal en insomnes primarios con dificultad para iniciar el sueño",
      "abstract": "Difficulty in sleep initiation, with or without objective signs, is one of the most frequent complaints in primary insomniacs. The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity characteristic of waking (beta and alpha oscillations) is gradually replaced by the EEG signs of sleep (sleep spindles and theta/delta waves) during the sleep onset period (SOP) in normal subjects. The decrease in fast oscillations occurs at the first signs of stage 1, whereas theta and delta increase occurs later, indicating that waking promoting mechanisms are turned off before sleep-promoting mechanisms are fully started. It could be therefore hypothesized that difficulty in sleep initiation in insomniacs might be due to either a hyperactivation of waking promoting systems, a weakness of sleep promoting mechanisms or an imbalance between them. Quantitative EEG analysis has revealed higher beta during wakefulness, as well as during sleep and lower slow (delta) activity in insomniacs. The presence of alpha activity during cognitive information processing, especially of slow alpha activity in relation to attention, as well as in some pathologies associated to sleep disturbances, has suggested that alpha activity during sleep is a sign of activation; however, alpha activity during sleep has been less studied in insomniacs. Only broad bands have been considered in all of the aforementioned studies, and in almost all of them the analyses were restricted to central regions. It is therefore important to study the entire frequency spectrum of EEG activity in insomniacs. Sleep initiation does not occur simultaneously over the entire cortex but starts as a local process which gradually invades the rest of the cortex, in which the frontal lobes play a crucial role. Frontal and parietal regions are part of an important network involved in attention and conduction of thought. Thus, quantitative analysis of narrow EEG bands and their distribution in the cerebral cortex may contribute to a better understanding of neural mechanisms compromised in etiology of sleep initiation in primary insomnia. The main objective of the present investigation was, therefore, to analyze the spectral power of narrow EEG bands in the 19 derivations of the 10-20 International System during SOP in primary insomniacs with difficulty in sleep initiation. Given that one of the main complaints of insomniacs is the difficulty to initiate sleep and that hyperarousal is one of the factors proposed to be involved in the etiology of insomnia, EEG activity during SOP of the first night in the laboratory was analyzed to control activating effects of surrounding circumstances and isolate permanent EEG characteristics. Subjects were 19-34 years old, right-handed with primary sleep insomnia, which were thoroughly screened via structured psychiatric, medical and sleep interviews and scales. Subjects were younger and the age range was narrower than in other EEG frequency spectral content studies of primary insomniacs to avoid confounding effects of changes in sleep architecture or in EEG generated by development. All patients met the criteria for primary insomnia with sleep onset difficulty and impaired daytime function on three or more nights per week for at least six months and with no medical, psychiatric or neurological conditions; they were not medicated and had no other sleep disorders.

Aural symptoms become permanent during the course of the disease. (2) Attacks of vestibular migraine may last anywhere from minutes to days. Most patients have a previous history of migraine headaches, and many experience migraine symptoms during the attack. (3) Vertebrobasilar TIAs affect older adults with vascular risk factors. Most attacks last less than 1 hour and are accompanied by other symptoms from the posterior circulation territory. (4) Vestibular paroxysmia is caused by vascular compression of the eighth cranial nerve. It manifests itself with brief attacks of vertigo that recur many times per day, sometimes with concomitant cochlear symptoms. (5) Orthostatic hypotension causes brief episodes of dizziness lasting seconds to a few minutes after standing up and is relieved by sitting or lying down. In older adults, it may be accompanied by supine hypertension. (6) Panic attacks usually last minutes, occur in specific situations, and are accompanied by choking, palpitations, tremor, heat, and anxiety. Less common causes of spontaneous recurrent vertigo and dizziness include perilymph fistula, superior canal dehiscence, autoimmune inner ear disease, otosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmia, and medication side effects.Neurologists need to venture into otolaryngology, internal medicine, and psychiatry to master the differential diagnosis of recurrent dizziness.",

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child9s period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

      "abstract": "Syncope, defined as a transient loss of consciousness due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion, characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery, is a frequent symptom and can be attributed to different causes.1\n\nThe most common aetiology of syncope is a neurally mediated reflex that consists of a transient failure of the cardiovascular mechanisms that normally control haemodynamic stability. This reflex is usually triggered by different stimuli (afferent pathways), leading to sudden withdrawal of sympathetic activity and to an increase in parasympathetic nerve tone (efferent pathways), causing vasodilatation, with consequent hypotension, and bradycardia.\n\nThe clinical presentation of neurally mediated syncope is not usually uniform; however, it may manifest with different patterns. In some patients, it is initiated by clear adrenergic stimuli such as fear, pain, emotional distress, or medical instrumentation, whereas in others it develops after prolonged orthostatism, hypovolaemia, or carotid sinus stimuli. There are also many patients in whom reflex syncope develops without any apparent recognizable trigger. On the other hand, some patients complain of typical vegetative prodrome, whereas others develop sudden syncope without any warning symptom. In addition, although both mechanisms, hypotension and bradycardia, are, by definition, always present, the predominance of one or the other leads to the characteristic patterns of vasodepressor, mixed, or cardioinhibitory reflex syncope.2 Although all these situations share a common underlying mechanism, i.e. hypotension and bradycardia triggered by some afferent stimuli, these differences have a great impact on the diagnostic process and in therapeutic decisions. Whereas a syncopal episode in a young patient, with clear triggers and prodrome, is easy to diagnose and manage, sudden episodes, without recognizable triggers, particularly … \n\n*Corresponding author.

      "abstract": "Abstract Tremors in post‐traumatic stress disorders have not been previously well characterized. A 67‐year‐old man has a 46‐year history of a noiseinduced exaggerated startle reflex followed by a large amplitude rest, postural and kinetic tremor that may persist for up to 3 days. This tremor is superimposed on a continuous mild organic postural/kinetic tremor whose electrophysiological characteristics are different from those of the overlying tremor. We attribute the exaggerated startle reflex and the noise‐induced tremor to Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and postulate a psychogenic origin for the noise‐induced tremor. The patient alos believes the noise‐induced tremor to be psychologically based and to be produced by the fear and anxiety he experiences when he hears loud, unexpected noises. The sudden onset of the noise‐induced tremor, its intermittent character, its temporary disappearance on distraction despite the patient's inability to suppress it, inconsistencies in handwriting and figure drawing, and the fact that the noise‐induced tremor is stimulus specific and persists long after the offending stimulus (noise) is no longer present all suggest a tremor of psychogenic origin.",

      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but it has never become part of the standard nomenclature. Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

Nocturnal pulse oximetry, nocturnal noise audio/videotape recording and nap polysomnography are useful tools for screening suspected cases of OSAS in children, and the gold-standard for diagnosis is overnight polysomnography in the sleep laboratory. On the contrary of SAOS adults, children usually present: less arousals associated to apnea events, more numerous apneas/hypopneas during REM sleep, and more significant oxihemoglobin dessaturation even in short apneas. The treatment of OSAS may be surgical (adenotonsillectomy, craniofacial abnormalities correction, tracheostomy) or clinical (sleep hygiene, continuous positive airway pressure – CPAP).",

      "abstract": "Electric current can damage an individual by thermal heating of the tissues; by disregulating autonomously functioning organ systems, such as the circulatory and respiratory systems; or by once-only or continuing stimulation of the nerves and striated muscles. In the first case, the result is coagulation necrosis, and in the second case life-threatening events can occur, such as arrhythmia or apnea. In the third case, vigorous nerve stimulation can lead to paralysis and vasospasm. Massive muscle contractions due to nerve stimulation or the direct triggering of striated muscles can cause ruptures, ligamentous tears, fractures, and joint dislocations, while prolonged current passing through the thoracic wall may stimulate tetany of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm resulting in asphyxia. This article is confined to a description of thermal or Joule heating of tissues when they form part of an electric circuit and to the effects of direct nerve and muscle stimulation. Other articles discuss nonthermal effects. The injuries a person sustains as the result of an electrical accident depend on a large number of interrelated factors, such as the properties of the electrical power supply, the magnitude and duration of current flow, the current pathway, and skin conditions. It makes a vast difference whether a person is hit by a lightning bolt (extremely high voltage, short current flow) or receives a shock from an electrical power supply (low to high voltage, relatively long current flow). Wide variation in the physical properties of lightning discharges and the discharges from electrical power supplies at home and in industry means that all kinds of injuries can be encountered.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Early‐onset benign childhood occipital seizures (EBOS) described by Panayiotopoulos constitute the commoner after the rolandic phenotype of a childhood seizure susceptibility syndrome. EBOS are the clinical representative of occipital spikes. Their cardinal features are infrequent (often single) partial seizures manifested with deviation of the eyes and vomiting, frequently evolving to hemi‐ or generalized convulsions. Ictal behavioral changes, irritability, pallor, and rarely cyanosis, and eyes wide open are frequent. Retching, coughing, aphemia, oropharyngolaryngeal movements, and incontinence may occur. Consciousness is usually impaired or lost, either from the onset or the course of the fits, but in a few children, it may be preserved. Duration varies from a few minutes to hours (partial status epilepticus). Seizures are usually nocturnal, but semiology is similar in nocturnal or diurnal fits. Onset is between 1 and 12 years with a peak at 5 years. One third of children have a single seizure, the median total number of fits is two to three, and the prognosis is invariably excellent, with remission usually occurring within I year from onset. A few children may later develop rolandic or other benign partial seizures. The likelihood to have seizures after age 12 years is exceptional and rarer than that of febrile convulsions. EEG shows occipital paroxysms demonstrating fixation‐off sensitivity, but random occipital spikes, occipital spikes in sleep EEG alone, or normal EEG may occur. Centrotemporal and other spike foci may appear in the same or more frequently in subsequent EEGs. The EEG does not reflect clinical course and severity.",

Classic symptoms include headache, vision loss, transient visual obscurations (TVOs), diplopia (often from sixth nerve palsy), divergence insufficiency, and pulsatile tinnitus. However, atypical presentations can occur, including asymmetric or unilateral papilledema, oculomotor disturbances such as third and fourth nerve palsies, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and olfactory dysfunction, among others. Fulminant IIH is a subtype of IIH defined as acute onset of rapid worsening of vision over days (less than 4 weeks between symptom onset and severe vision loss).

      "abstract": "Fear of the dark is a common complaint of pre-teenage children. 1 2 It should not be confused with night terrors or panics, in which a child becomes acutely agitated and terror-struck at night, appearing to be awake while in fact asleep and unable to be woken. 3 4 In contrast, fear of the dark can be experienced by the conscious child in dimly lit or dark conditions.When such fear is excessive it is often attributed to attention seeking behaviour or assumed to be an irrational fear that will abate with time.Most people can see a little in very dim lighting conditions after a short period of adaptation.However, a child with no visual problem obvious to the parents and who can see normally in well lit conditions can present as being unable to see at all in the dark even after a period for adaptation.In a child who cannot yet talk this may simply appear as fear of the dark.We describe two patients with congenital stationary night blindness, a diagnosis which may be missed without appropriate history taking from the parents, particularly if there is no family history of visual problems.",

The feeling of anxiety often recedes into the background and such patients present to nonpsychiatric physicians with mainly somatic symptoms. The consequences of frequent panic attacks, named panic disorder, are agoraphobia with impairment of psychic and social functioning, increased prevalence of alcohol abuse, depression and, in particular, suicidal attempts. It is of the utmost importance that physicians recognize the somatic symptoms of panic anxiety and plan integrated treatment. The main therapeutic resources at present include antidepressants, selected benzodiazepines and behavioral treatments and are very successful in improving panic attacks and their consequences, which may long go undiagnosed.",

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

Disordered circadian processes at central and/or cellular levels, sleep disorders, and unhealthy wakefulness/sleep rhythms can impair the physiological circadian organization and result in subjective, professional, or behavioral changes ranging from functional inadequacy to higher risks at work or on the road to medical relevance. Circadian rhythms and the sleep organization change ontogenetically; major changes result from normal aging and from the multiple diseases that are often associated. There are circular functional interactions involving sleep/sleep disorders, the autonomic and immune systems, and the functional changes in the circadian system due to aging that deserve attention but have been overlooked thus far.",

An extreme shift of mood, motivation, and energy suffered by patients with bipolar can lead to disability and even suicide. Therefore, it is important to know the symptoms, how to diagnose, and the treatment. A man, 39 years old, came with his family with the complaint of rampage and beating people for no reason. Over the past month, the family admitted patients cannot sleep. On physical examination found cuts on the right cheek. General status, neurological, and laboratory tests are in normal range, from psychiatric examination obtained clear consciousness, elevation of mood occasionally disforic, blunted affect, Inappropriate, with auditory, tactile, and visual hallucinations accompanied with delusions of greatness and erotomaniac.

      "title": "Sleep-related Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract As in many areas of sleep medicine, it is often a challenge deciding whether or not movements during sleep reflect truly abnormal nocturnal phenomenona or are simply physiological variants. Indeed, when asleep, subconscious shifts of body position occurring every 15 minutes or so are considered entirely normal, as are minor jerks of the extremities and face, particularly during periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, if nocturnal movements are observed to be excessive, violent, or arousing, either to the subject or bed partner, they will usually indicate a defined disorder, especially if the events are stereotypic through the night. Although the second edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) was revised in 2005 to include a new section dedicated to movement disorders occurring specifically during the state of sleep, diagnostic precision of such phenomena is often lacking and evidenced-based treatment protocols, when indicated, are poorly developed. Furthermore, if a sleep-related movement disorder is recognized, it can be very difficult to determine its true clinical significance for sleep quality and subsequent daytime wakefulness, especially in the elderly patient. This chapter addresses those movement disorders that are intimately or exclusively related to the state of sleep or the sleep–wake transition. By convention, parasomnias causing abnormal arousals from deep non-REM sleep, such as sleepwalking or night terrors, will not be covered, although restless legs syndrome is discussed, partly because of its close association with periodic limb movements during sleep.",

      "title": "Relationship between the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states and reports of anomalous experiences.",
      "abstract": "A whole range of anomalous experiences (1) has been reported during the hypnagogic or hypnopompic states that surround periods of sleep. It is not uncommon for people to experience brief, vivid, and often strange imagery or to find themselves temporarily unable to move or speak during these periods between wakefulness and sleep. These brief sensations and the temporary paralysis are known as hypnagogic or hypnopompic imagery and sleep paralysis, (2) respectively (American Sleep Disorders Association [ASDA], 1990). Recent surveys found that people who report more childhood experiences of hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery or sleep paralysis also report a greater number of anomalous experiences during childhood or adulthood (Sherwood, 1999, 2000). More specifically, hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery has been associated with reports of extrasensory perception (ESP), apparitions and communication with the dead, out-of-the-body experiences (OBEs), visions of past lives, and experiences involving extraterrestrials (e.g., Glicksohn, 1989; Gurney, Myers, & Podmore, 1886; Leaning, 1925; Mavromatis, 1983, 1987; McCreery, 1993; McKellar, 1957; Spanos, Cross, Dickson, & DuBreuil, 1993). In addition to the above anomalous experiences, sleep paralysis has also been associated with reports of psychokinesis (PK) and near-death experiences (NDEs) (Baker, 1992; Green & McCreery, 1994; Rose & Blackmore, 1996; Rose, Hogan, & Blackmore, 1997; Spanos et al., 1993; Spanos, McNulty, DuBreuil, Pires, & Burgess, 1995). The question is: are the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states conducive to anomalous processes and events or are normal hypnagogic/hypnopompic features being misinterpreted? Perhaps both statements are true? The aim of this article is to consider evidence for each of these possibilities. First, it is necessary to outline the characteristics of the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states and the features of some of the experiences that can occur within them. CHARACTERISTICS OF HYPNAGOGIC/HYPNOPOMPIC STATES Most research, both experimental and survey-based, seems to have focused on the hypnagogic state (the period between wakefulness and sleep, i.e., just as a person is falling asleep). Comparatively little research has been carried out on the hypnopompic state (the period between sleep and wakefulness, i.e., just as a person is waking from sleep). Thus, this article focuses mainly on the hypnagogic state. The hypnagogic state, like the sleep state, is fairly complex and contains a number of steps and stages (Mavromatis, 1983; Rechtschaffen, 1994). Hori, Hayashi, and Morikawa (1994) concluded that the sleep onset period is unique and cannot be accurately categorised as either waking or sleeping. It is very difficult to determine the precise point of falling asleep, except by using arbitrary criteria, because the transition is gradual, because the changes are not always synchronised, and because there are large individual differences in when the changes occur (Lavie, 1996; Rechtschaffen, 1994). During alert wakefulness, eye movements are fairly rapid, and the normal EEC trace consists of irregular waves of high frequency (Bray, Cragg, Macknight, Mills, & Taylor, 1992). As a person relaxes or becomes drowsy, there is an increase in alpha activity (8-12 Hz), and eye movements become slower and less frequent (Parker, 1975; Rechtschaffen, 1994). In fact, the presence of slow eye movements is considered to be an extremely accurate indicator of hypnagogic mentation (Schacter, 1976). Stickgold and Hobson (1994) found that as the period of eyelid movement quiescence lengthens, that is, as the eyelids move less, mentation becomes more dreamlike. This contrasts with the positive association between eyelid movements and dreamlike mentation during REM sleep. As a person passes through the hypnagogic period into the early stages of non-REM sleep, there is a decline in alpha activity and a concomitant increase in slower theta activity (4-7 Hz; Baddia, Wright, & Wauquier, 1994; Bray et al. …",

      "title": "Specific Phobia vs Panic Disorder in Children: A Unique Case Report and Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Specific phobia is defined as marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear and anxiety, is actively avoided, or endured with intense fear or anxiety that is out proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object/situation and to the sociocultural context. These symptoms are persistent and last for at least six months. The prevalence of specific and social phobia in children and adolescents is 2.9 and 0.3%. Panic disorder is defined as recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and is accompanied by at least 4/13 symptoms. One of these panic attacks must be followed by at least one month of constant worry about additional panic attacks and their consequences. There is a significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks. Such disturbances are not attributable to physiological effects of other substances, medical conditions, or other mental disorders. The prevalence of panic disorders is 5 – 15 percent in adolescents and 5 percent in children.\r\n\r\nCase Presentation: We present a case of a 3-year old male with panic attacks for over one year which started after an incident of smoke detector alarm followed by three more episodes of panic attacks at the daycare center. The recent episode was 4 weeks ago. After the last incident, the patient stopped eating and refused food which worsened over the past 2 weeks. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed with panic disorder, specific phobia, eating disorder, and referred to outpatient Psychologist.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n• Learn about anxiety disorders in children.\r\n\r\n• Management options for anxiety in children.\r\n\r\n• Etiopathogenesis of anxiety in children.\r\n\r\nConclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of panic disorder below the age of 4. We conducted a literature review and found no cases published. This is an interesting case for psychiatrists, therapists and pediatricians to learn as there is a lack of evidence in treating children under the age of 4. No medication recommendations were available for this age group; however, off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication was discussed with the patient’s mother who refused. We agreed with the primary care team’s recommendations and the case was referred to an out-patient psychotherapist.",

      "abstract": "Refreshing sleep requires both sufficient total sleep time as well as sleep that is in synchrony with the individual's circadian rhythm. Problems with sleep organization in elderly patients typically include difficulty falling asleep, less time spent in the deeper stages of sleep, early-morning awakening and less total sleep time. Poor sleep habits such as irregular sleep-wake times and daytime napping may contribute to insomnia. Caffeine, alcohol and some medications can also interfere with sleep. Primary sleep disorders are more common in the elderly than in younger persons. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep and may respond to low doses of antiparkinsonian agents as well as other drugs. Sleep apnea can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness. Evaluation of sleep problems in the elderly includes careful screening for poor sleep habits and other factors that may be contributing to the sleep problem. Formal sleep studies may be needed when a primary sleep disorder is suspected or marked daytime dysfunction is noted. Therapy with a benzodiazepine receptor agonist may be indicated after careful evaluation.",

In this paper, the author describes the clinical steps in the differential diagnosis of insomnia symptoms for readers who are not specialized in sleep medicine. When patients complain of insomnia symptoms, physicians first need to check their sleep habits and optimize them if they are inappropriate and interfere with good sleep. Medical history and medication use should also be reviewed in the first step because some medical conditions (e.g., articular diseases, skin diseases, cardiopulmonary disorders) and medications (e.g., steroids, interferon, methyldopa, levodopa) can cause insomnia symptoms. Insomnia symptoms can be caused by a variety of sleep disorders other than insomnia disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given only if the insomnia symptoms cannot be fully explained by another sleep disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The term Charcot–Wilbrand syndrome (CWS) denotes dream loss following focal brain damage. We report the first case of CWS, in whom neuropsychological functions, extension of the underlying lesion, and sleep architecture changes were assessed. A 73‐year‐old woman reported a total dream loss after acute, bilateral occipital artery infarction (including the right inferior lingual gyrus), which lasted for over 3 months. In the absence of sleep–wake complaints and (other) neuropsychological deficits, polysomnography demonstrated an essentially normal sleep architecture with preservation of REM sleep. Dreaming was denied also after repeated awakenings from REM sleep. This observation suggests that CWS (1) can represent a distinct and isolated neuropsychological manifestation of deep occipital lobe damage, and (2) may occur in the absence of detectable REM sleep abnormalities.

The occurrence of partial or complete UA obstruction during sleep characterizes the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome. Breathing (respiration), which is mainly under a behavioral or voluntary control system during awakening, is essentially under a metabolic or automated control system during sleep. The contribution of the thoracic cage to the overall respiration remains the same during wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Considering the importance of the metabolic regulation in the control of respiration during sleep, one can easily speculate that any change in the ventilatory response to hypoxic or hypercapnic stimuli will increase the magnitude of nocturnal hypoventilation episodes. UA are usually patent throughout the respiratory cycle and they behave in a manner similar to that of a Starling resistance model where a collapsible segment (pharynx) is located between two noncollapsible segments.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acute symptomatic epi attacks are attacks that are provoked by temporary action of systemic, metabolic, toxic and other factors with epileptogenic effect (high febrility, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, alcohol, lack of sleep, etc.) or they occur due to acutely induced brain lesions (stroke, meningitis, trauma, etc.). AIM: to present prehospital at-the-scene measures in treatment of a patient with acute symptomatic epi attack. to point out the significance of correctly taken anamnesis and the dispatcher's role in the operation of Emergency Medical Service Teams. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive overview of data, a dispatcher's protocol , a physician's protocol, and 2005 guidelines of good clinical practice for consciousness crises, the patient's discharge note. CASE STUDY: At 3 minutes past 12, the emergency team received a radio call that a female person 58 years of age lost consciousness. The dispatcher gave the information that the patient lost consciousness, that she was shaking, had turned blue and was breathing very heavily. The patient was found awake, confused, cyanotic, with traces of blood on her lips. The primary examination showed that the patient wasdyspnoic, with diminished breath sound over lungs, with extended expirium, presence of polyphonic wheezes over both lungs. SaO92%, rhythmic heart action, tachycardic, about 110/min. TA 160/100 mmHg. Abite was noticeable on the right side of the tongue. According to the consciousness crisis protocol, the temperature was taken, T 36.8 C, and glycemia 3.2mmol/l. A general neurological finding indicated slightly larger pupils, with a normal reaction to light, meningeal signs were negative, there were no signs of pyramidal lateralization. It became clear that the patient had an acute symptomatic epi attack. A question was raised whether the cause of attack was hypoxia, aminophylline overdose, or mild hypoglycemia. The patient remained confused all the time; she did not cooperate during examination. The dispatcher confirmed through the radio system that the patient did not have any epilepsy treatment and that she was an insulin dependent diabetic. Intravenous route was provided, and solution of 10% Glucose 250ml, corticosteroid therapy and oxygenotherapy were administered. The state of consciousness of the patient improved completely during transportation to the Admissions Department of Valjevo Hospital. CONCLUSION: In order for the treatment of these patients to be successful, it is necessary to recognize in the shortest possible time interval the symptoms of acute symptomatic attacks, taking into consideration that they do not have medical and social consequences of epileptic attacks and are not treated by administering antiepileptic medications. The therapeutic approach is based on the treatment of primary disease, i.e. elimination of immediate provoking factor.",

      "abstract": "After aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, acute subdural hematoma (SDH) is a rare consequence. SDH has never been linked to an unruptured intracavernous aneurysm. The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

      "abstract": "Several types of dreams reported by psychosomatic patients with alexithymic characteristics are presented. Two special features of the dreams are noted: (1) the dreams contain events which are very traumatic and (2) the protagonists of the dreams failed to fully perceive their own feelings. It is postulated that the failure of the protagonists to fully perceive their own feelings played an important role in fostering the development of the traumatic events. Feelings such as anxiety and sadness are key signals which incite the ego of the dreamer to set protective operations into motion. The diminution of awareness of these feelings may, therefore, delay the implementation of protective operations to a point which allows the traumatic events to progress dangerously far. It is interesting to note that the few psychosomatic patients without alexithymic characteristics who were included in my series reported a type of dream which was identical to one of the types of dreams reported by patients with alexithymic characteristics. This concurrence suggests the possibility that the dreams form a link between the psychologies of these two sub-groups of psychosomatic patients.",

It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

In settings associated with litigation/disability evaluation, the rate of malingering may be as high as 30%, but its frequency in clinical practice is not known. We describe the main characteristics of deliberate deception (factitious disorders and malingering) and ways that neurologists might detect symptom exaggeration. The key to establishing that the extent or severity of reported symptoms does not truly represent their severity is to elicit inconsistencies in different domains, but it is not possible to determine whether the reports are intentionally inaccurate. Neurological disorders where difficulty in determining the degree of willed exaggeration is most likely include functional weakness and movement disorders, post-concussional syndrome (or mild traumatic brain injury), psychogenic non-epileptic attacks and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (especially when there is an associated functional movement disorder). Symptom amplification or even fabrication are more likely if the patient might gain benefit of some sort, not necessarily financial. Techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include covert surveillance and review of social media accounts. We also briefly describe specialised psychological tests designed to elicit effort from the patient.",

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state.

      "abstract": "There are many reasons to take into consideration the sleep disorders in the elderly. The sleep quality degrades with age and is strongly affected by medical conditions, intrinsic sleep disorders, or by a combination of these factors. Other age-related conditions such as severe dementia, dependence or living in institution worsen sleep disturbances in older people. When living alone elderly people, being cognitively impaired and medically disabled, may not be able to complain about sleep problems. Sleep disorders are thus underdiagnosed, unmarked, and insufficiently investigated in the elderly. In this heterogeneous population, sleep assessment should include a global geriatric approach and be individually adapted for each subject. The sleep interview must specially include medical comorbidities, medication uses, and aged-related changes of lifestyle such as retirement, loss of spouse, hospitalization or institutionalization. In the elderly with loss of autonomy, standard sleep assessment is not always adequate and must be replaced by shorter, simpler or observation-based tests such as the Sleep disorders inventory, Observation-based nocturnal sleep inventory, Observation and interview based diurnal sleepiness inventory. When sleep log is impossible, actimetry is an excellent alternative for studying sleep-wake rhythm. Ventilatory polygraphy is a simpler test for detecting sleep apnea than polysomnography. Utilization of sophisticated investigations should be discussed when the feasibility and usefulness is limited.",

      "title": "PHOX2B mutations in three Chinese patients with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome",
      "abstract": "Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS, OMIM #209880) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) characterized by an abnormal autonomic ventilatory response to progressive hypercarbia and sustained hypoxemia. Patients typically present in the newborn period with hypoventilation or apnea asleep, awake, or both, without any associated cardiac, pulmonary, neuromuscular or brainstem lesions. Rarely, some patients may present at a later age and are diagnosed to have late onset central hypoventilation syndrome (LOCHS).1 Other features of ANS dysfunction such as feeding difficulty due to oesophageal dysmotility, severe constipation in the absence of Hirschsprung disease, poor regulation of basal body temperature, episodes of profuse sweating, pupillary and ocular abnormalities, decreased beat-to-beat variability of heart rate, attenuated response of heart rate to exercise, abnormal fluctuation of blood pressure, decreased perception to pain, and decreased perception to anxiety may be variably present but not essential for diagnosis.1 Furthermore, this central hypoventilation can occur as an isolated feature or in association with a number of neurocristopathies, notably Hirschsprung disease (Haddad syndrome, OMIM #209880) and tumours of the sympathetic nervous system particularly neuroblastoma, ganglioneuro- blastoma, and ganglioneuroma, which were found in 20% and 5%—10% of CCHS patients, respectively.2 Studies of genes pertinent to the early embryologic development of the neural crest cells, specifically the endothelin and the RET-GDNF signaling pathways, have recently led to the identification of PHOX2B as the major disease causing gene for CCHS.2-6PHOX2B was mapped to chromosome 4p12 and consists of 3 exons. It encodes a highly conserved paired-like homeobox transcription factor of 314 amino acids linked to the RET-GDNF signaling pathway. The DNA binding homeodomain is encoded by exon 2, whereas exon 3 encodes two short and stable polyalanine tracts of 9 and 20 residues, respectively. Expression studies performed in mice and human have shown that this is a master regulatory gene crucial for the proper development of the peripheral and central ANS.3,7,8 In this work, we detected PHOX2B mutations in three local Chinese patients diagnosed with CCHS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CCHS in Chinese. METHODS Patients Three male patients with CCHS were ascertained because of persistent hypoventilation in the absence of primary pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, brainstem and metabolic causes. Their clinical features were summarized in Table.Table: Clinical features of the three patients with CCHSMutational screening of thePHOX2Bgene Peripheral blood samples were taken after the families had consented for PHOX2B testing. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). The three exons and their intron-exon boundaries of the PHOX2B gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Ava II enzyme digestion and direct sequencing as described by Matera et al.6 The reference sequence is the human PHOX2B mRNA sequence (GeneBank accession number NM_003924). RESULTS Patient 1 A heterozygous c.586_c.590insG mutation was detected in exon 3 (Fig. 1). This is a frameshift mutation predicted to result in termination of translation at codon 359 (359X). Such mutation was not detected in his parents.Fig. 1.: Sequence chromatogram from exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. A heterozygous c.586_c.590insG was detected in Patient 1.Patient 2 A heterozygous in-frame duplication of 18 nucleotides was detected in exon 3, leading to an insertion of 6 alanines to the 20-alanines tract (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Parents’ PHOX2B genes were analyzed and found to be normal.Fig. 2.: Ava II enzymatic digestion of the PCR products of the exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. Extra band with size larger than 270 bp was observed in Patients 2 and 3, indicating expansion of the polyalanine tract. Lanes M1 and M2 are DNA size markers; Lanes N1 and N2 are normal controls; B is blank.Fig. 3.: Sequence chromatogram from exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. A heterozygous c.758_c.759ins18 was detected in Patient 2 and a heterozygous c.776_c.777ins21 was detected in Patient 3. The former insertion was occurred within the 13th alanine codon of the polyalanine tract, while the latter was occurred within the 19th alanine codon. A heterozygous c.762A>C nucleotide change was also detected in patient 3, which is a silent mutation.Patient 3 A heterozygous in-frame duplication of 21 nucleotides was detected in exon 3, leading to an insertion of 7 alanines to the 20-alanines tract (Figs. 2, 3). A heterozygous c.762A>C nucleotide change was also detected in patient 3, which is a silent mutation. Analyses of the parents’ PHOX2B genes were normal except that the father also had the heterozygous c.762A>C nucleotide change. As the c.762A>C nucleotide change was not a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we analyzed the DNA samples from 40 normal controls. We found that 5/40 (allele frequency 6.25%) controls also had a heterozygous c.762A>C change, indicating that it is a common SNP. DISCUSSION Several studies have shown that heterozygous mutation in PHOX2B is sufficient to cause CCHS and confirmed its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern,2-6,9-11 with incomplete penetrance.6 Taken together, there are 314 CCHS patients studied worldwide, with 14 cases being LOCHS. PHOX2B mutations were identified in 293 patients (93%). A mutational hotspot exists in the 20-alanines tract encoded by exon 3 as 91% of the mutations identified consisted of polyalanine expansion within this tract with size ranging from +5 to +13 (266/293). Small alanine repeats contraction has been identified in a few normal individuals, with size varied from -1 to -7.2-6 Rare frameshift and missense mutations account for the rest (27/293). Interestingly, most of these mutations did not disrupt the homeodomain. The molecular pathogenesis was thought to be protein misfolding that in turn led to decreased DNA binding, cytoplasmic or nuclear aggregation and nuclear exclusion, and or a partial dominant negative effect.12,13 Haploinsufficiency alone appeared insufficient to cause the full spectrum of CCHS, because a patient reported by Benailly with deletion of the PHOX2B gene had neither hypoventilation nor ANS dysfunction, but only Hirschsprung disease.8 Attempts of genotype-phenotype correlation have shown that the size of the polyalanine repeat expansion correlates with the severity of the respiratory phenotype and ANS symptoms.5,6 Such observation has been supported by two independent functional studies of the PHOX2B mutations, both of which found a progressive decrease in the transactivation of PHOX2B mediated target genes with lengthening of the expanded alanine tract.12,13 While frameshift and missense mutations appeared to result in CCHS phenotype at the severe end of the spectrum.6,11 with a predisposition to tumors of the sympathetic nervous system. 2 Bachetti et al12 proposed that the observed oncogenic role for frameshift mutations in the PHOX2B gene, among others, could be related to its ability to enhance the activity of the PHOX2A promoter, a transcription factor that acts with PHOX2B in the RET-GDNF signaling pathway. Here we report three Chinese patients with CCHS, our results generally support the overseas’ findings. All three cases presented in the newborn period with apnea and respiratory insufficiency that required ventilatory support. Patient 1, with a frameshift mutation (c.586_c.590insG), had the most severe phenotype. He was born preterm at 34 weeks with polyhydramnios, IUGR and poor respiratory effort requiring ventilatory support starting from birth. The apnea phenotype could overlap with apnea of prematurity and required a high index of suspicion. He developed constipation and abdominal distension on day 2 of life. Biopsy confirmed Hirschsprung disease with total colonic aganglionosis extending to distal small bowel. Patient 2, with an expansion of 6 alanines in the 20-alanines tract, had isolated central hypoventilation without the Hirschsprung association. Patient 3, with an expansion of 7 alanines, had both central hypoventilation and Hirschsprung disease, presenting with abdominal distension on day 2 and failure to pass meconium since birth. The extent of aganglionosis was uncertain, however, as his clinical course was complicated by necrotizing enterocolitis with transmural necrosis from part of ileum to whole colon, bowel resection and short gut syndrome. All three of them needed ventilatory support both awake and asleep. It is noteworthy that, with growth and maturation, they all subsequently became ventilator dependent only during asleep. Ocular abnormalities are common in CCHS patients as exemplified by patients 2 and 3, both of whom have strabismus. The smallest polyalanine expansion size known to date that led to the CCHS/HSCR is 6. However, not all CCHS patients harboring +6 to +13 polyalanine expansion developed Hirschsprung disease as shown by patient 2, suggesting that other modifying genes likely exist to modulate the penetrance for Hirschsprung disease. None of the three patients described here has shown any evidence of tumors of neural crest derivatives yet. However, predicted from his genotype, patient 1 will be at higher risk of developing tumors of the sympathetic nervous system. The great majority of the mutations were de novo, and the common polyalanine tract expansion was postulated to be the result of unequal crossover between the homologues during meiosis.3-6 Nevertheless, somatic mosaicism has been proposed in 4.5%2 and 10%5 of parents. Possibility of germline mosaicism cannot be excluded either. Finally, of the 14 cases with LOCHS studied, 9 (64%) were found to have mutations in the PHOX2B gene with an expansion of 5 alanines in the polyalanine tract,2,6,14,15 suggesting that idiopathic LOCHS and CCHS are indeed allelic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia defined by intermittent loss of electromyographic atonia during REM sleep with emergence of complex and vigorous behaviors. Punching, kicking, and leaping from bed during attempted dream enactment caused repeated injury in nine of our first ten adult patients. Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient.",

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental condition characterized by multiple psychological and physiological impairments in young children. According to the recent reports, 1 out of every 58 newly-born children is suffering from autism. The aetiology of the disorder is complex and poorly understood, hindering the adaptation of targeted and effective therapies. There are no well- established diagnostic biomarkers for autism. Hence the analysis of symptoms by the pediatricians plays a critical role in the early intervention.In the present report, we have emphasized 24 behavioral, psychological and clinical symptoms of autism.Impaired social interaction, restrictive and narrow interests, anxiety, depression; aggressive, repetitive, rigid and self-injurious behavior, lack of consistency, short attention span, fear, shyness and phobias, hypersensitivity and rapid mood alterations, high level of food and toy selectivity; inability to establish friendships or follow the instructions; fascination by round spinning objects and eating non-food materials are common psychological characteristics of autism. Speech or hearing impairments, poor cognitive function, gastrointestinal problems, weak immunity, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms, weak motor neuromuscular interaction, lower level of serotonin and neurotransmitters, headache and body pain are common physiological symptoms.A variable qualitative and quantitative impact of this wide range of symptoms is perceived in each autistic individual, making him/her distinct, incomparable and exceptional. Selection and application of highly personalized medical and psychological therapies are therefore recommended for the management and treatment of autism.",

Rules for improving the quality of sleep have evolved which can be quite useful to those with transient and milder forms of insomnia. Complaints about inadequate sleep are much more significant when the patient also complains of tiredness when awake. Caffeinated beverages and cigarette smoking may impair the initiation of sleep. Alcohol will interrupt sleep, inducing difficulty maintaining sleep. Sleep-related seizure disorders may prove quite difficult to identify but produce symptoms of nocturnal awakening, reducing sleep efficiency. Nonrestorative sleep suggests a difference in the distribution of sleep staging, implying an altered arousal threshold. Total sleep time appears to be within normal limits, but the patient complains of lack of satisfaction with his night's sleep.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "Central causes of vertigo, dizziness, and imbalance",
      "abstract": "Abstract Whereas dizziness, vertigo, or imbalance are common in many central disorders, it is often unspecific, and the differential diagnosis is broad. Recurrent dizzy spells unexplained by other central or peripheral vestibular abnormalities and with a history of migraine headaches point towards migraine-associated vertigo or dizziness. Vertebrobasilar stroke is the most frequent cause of acute vestibular syndrome (AVS), defined as acute-onset vertigo or dizziness lasting > 24 hours, accompanied by nausea/vomiting, head-motion intolerance, nystagmus, and gait imbalance, whereas brief attacks of vertigo or dizziness accompanied by other brainstem or cerebellar signs suggest transient ischaemic attacks (TIA). An immediate work-up (including bedside ocular motor tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) in order to identify the underlying cause is mandatory in order to avoid further events. Ataxic movements and gait may be related to cerebellar or afferent deficits. Onset of ataxia may be acute (Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE), alcohol or drug intoxication, cerebellar stroke), subacute (paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, multiple sclerosis (MS)) or slowly progressive (secondary to chronic alcohol consumption, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and sporadic or hereditary ataxia).",

Symptoms start shortly after the triggering acoustic incident and can be short-lived or can last for a considerable time. If persistent, the condition can lead to significant disability. Proposed mechanisms include involvement of the tensor tympani muscle, hyperexcitability of central auditory pathways, and a precursive state of raised anxiety or arousal.

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "HIT-AND-RUN DRIVERS IN A SEMI-CONSCIOUS CONDITION. PSYCHIATRIC AND FORENSIC ASPECTS OF THE POST-TRAUMA SEMI-CONSCIOUS CONDITION",
      "abstract": "The cases of 9 patients are described, who hit and then whilst in a post-traumatic semi-conscious condition. Two drove away from the place of the accident, whilst the remainder ran away on foot. Three of the latter stopped cars while still in a semi-conscious condition and continued their flight in this manner. As a rule, a sharply defined amnesia occurs at a later stage; only two patients suffered from a lacunary amnesia similar to that which occurs after a concussion of the brain. There were no instances of retrograde amnesia. The shortest duration of a post-traumatic semi-conscious condition is 20 - 30 minutes; and it often lasts for many hours. An initial deep loss of consciousness does not occur as a rule and there was only one instance of it amongst these particular cases. This distinguishes the post-traumatic semi-conscious condition clearly from a commotio cerebri and it could well be a separate manifestation of a disturbed consciousness. Actions made during this semi-conscious condition appear to be motivated, and occasionally the patients carried out what they had intended to do before the accident. Thus, for example, two of the patients appeared at their places of work. The report refers to the similarity of this post-traumatic semi-conscious state with epileptic psychomotor attacks on the consciousness. The very difficult problem of a diagnostic definition to differentiate from hysteroid panic behaviour is investigated. /TRRL/",

      "title": "[Transient amnesia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "The two main aetiologies of transient amnesia in the elderly are idiopathic transient global amnesia (TGA) and iatrogenic or toxic amnesia. Vascular and epileptic amnesia are less common. According to the literature, transient psychogenic amnesia, which is a frequent cause of amnesia at age 30 to 50, is very rare in the elderly. TGA is the prototypical picture of transient amnesia. It occurs more often after age 50, with no identified cause, even if some authors accept emotional stress or minor head trauma as occasional precipitants. The mechanism of TGA remains a matter of discussion. It may be the consequence of a spreading depression similar to that described in migraine with aura, but other arguments support an ischemic mechanism. Iatrogenic amnesias are mainly caused by benzodiazepines (BZs) or anticholinergics. The former may occur in a non-anxious subject, who is not a usual consumer of BZ and takes a single dose. The latter are more often due to a hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, in particular in patients presenting with a covert, incipient Alzheimer's disease. A vascular origin must be considered when amnesia is accompanied by other neurological symptoms, and when the regression of the amnesic disorder is slow, lasting several days. It results from lesions involving various mechanisms and locations, mainly subcortical. Partial seizures, most often mesio-temporal, more rarely frontal, may be the cause of transient amnesia in the elderly, in the absence of a past history of epilepsy. The red flag supportive of an epileptic origin is the repetition of stereotyped amnesic episodes. EEG demonstration of seizures may be difficult and the response to antiepileptic drugs effective on partial seizures is usually good.",

      "title": "Manifest Dream Content as a Predictor of Suicidality",
      "abstract": "A number of behavioral, social, biological, and cultural factors are associated with suicide. However, the ability to predict an imminent suicide attempt remains problematic. Prior studies indicate that the manifest dream content of depressed, non-suicidal patients differs from that of depressed, suicidal patients. The dream imagery of depressed, suicidal patients contains themes of death, dying, violence, and departure. The dream imagery of depressed, non-suicidal patients contains themes of rejection, helplessness, hopelessness, humiliation, failure, and loss. In the present study, the dream reports of 52 depressed patients were collected and rated for various themes. Patients were divided into three groups: Depressed and non-suicidal; Depressed, with suicidal ideation; Depressed, with suicidal ideation and/or attempt(s). Themes of death and/or dying, and to a lesser extent, themes of violence, injury, and/or murder occurred with greater frequency in the dream reports of depressed patients with suicidal ideation and/or attempts, than in the dream reports of depressed patients without suicidal ideation or behavior. These observations correspond with the prevailing psychodynamic explanation of suicide; namely, that it is a murderous attack on the self that is identified with hated internalized objects.",

(2) Limit the number of items seen at a glance, due to simultanagnostic visual dysfunction. (3) Cause inability to move the eyes to a specified target (apraxia of gaze), despite intact pursuit and fast (saccadic) eye movements. (Perhaps because the target cannot be located.) When severe, these features comprise Balint syndrome, but when less marked, the term dorsal stream dysfunction has been used. Associated lower visual field impairment due to the superior optic radiations passing through the parietal lobes being affected as well, can cause the feet not to be seen during locomotion. While accompanying inability to see fast moving targets, or dyskinetopsia is not uncommon. In our experience, a wider inflight gap between the fingers and thumb of a hand reaching in the lower visual field than when reaching in the upper visual field, and disability locating where sounds are coming from, may also be evident. Central and peripheral visual functions can be diminished if the occipital lobes are affected as well, while recognition can be impaired by this and / or associated temporal lobe dysfunction. Those with accompanying intellectual impairment and four-limb cerebral palsy may ‘wake up’ and start to look around, even reaching out for a single object, when surrounded by a monochromatic tent that excludes extraneous visual and auditory distraction. In the authors’ experience, dorsal stream dysfunction is the commonest pattern of cerebral visual impairment seen in children and in many affected (often previously undiagnosed) adults. A series of case history data is presented to illustrate the origin, nature and heterogeneity of this condition, as well as its potential management.",

      "title": "The Delirium/dementia Treatment Paradox",
      "abstract": "Delirium is the most common psychiatric disorder on medical/surgical units of general hospitals and is a major cause of consultations for consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatrists in medical centers. It primarily afflicts older patients and is characterized by a rapid onset of confusion with hallucinations, delusions, agitation (but sometimes hypoactivity), and fluctuating severity and outcomes. It can be triggered by multiple factors, including dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, upper respiratory infection, urinary tract infections, post-surgical state, and, very commonly, iatrogenic factors. Many medications, especially those with anticholinergic activity, can cause delirium in older patients. Delirium can lead to pronged hospital stays, functional decline, cognitive impairment, and accelerated mortality. (1) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] So what is the evidence-based treatment for this common and serious neuropsychiatric brain disorder? None exists! Delirium is managed by identifying and addressing underlying factors, as well as supportive medical care (hydration, nutrition, sleep, monitoring vital signs, preventing aspiration, quiet rooms, orientation, and ambulation). Physical restraints are undesirable but may be hard to avoid for severely disinhibited and agitated patients who try to rip out their IV or endotracheal tube or assault staff or family members who try to calm them during their psychotic confusional state. Doesn't this sound similar to dementia patients in nursing homes who develop psychosis and agitation and pose management problems for their family and staff? These 2 neuropsychiatric conditions are clinically similar, and the use of antipsychotic agents is not FDA-approved for either of them. Antipsychotics have not been found efficacious for delirium (2) or dementia with psychosis (3) but their use continues. The paradox is that C-L psychiatrists use small doses of antipsychotics routinely for delirium and generally believe that such pharmacologic intervention works in many patients, although some older agents (eg, haloperidol) have been reported to be neurotoxic (4) and associated with higher mortality in dementia patients with [psychosis. (5), (6) The relationship of antipsychotic treatment with delirium and dementia is complex, paradoxical, and unsettled. Consider the following: * Antipsychotics are not approved for the psychosis of dementia despite 17 large, placebo-controlled trials with 4 different second-generation agents. * The FDA issued a black-box warning on all first- and second-generation antipsychotics because of a 1.6-times higher mortality rate among older patients with dementia. * No placebo-controlled, FDA trials of delirium have been conducted with any antipsychotic agents. * Clinicians frequently use first-and second-generation antipsychotics for delirium despite the lack of evidence. …",

Inadequate sleep may impact children's development, mood and behaviour and in consequence the wellbeing of their parents and caregivers. In a prospective, randomised, multicenter, open, comparative clinical trial the effectiveness of homeopathic ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (Cypripedium pubescens D4, Magnesium carbonicum D10, Zincum valerianicum D12) in children with sleep disorders and restlessness was evaluated. <h3>Methods</h3> Children aged≤6 years, suffering from sleep disorders for≥1 month, were randomised to receive either ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (intervention) or the aminoacetic acid glycine (control) for 28 days. Effectiveness endpoints included the change of 7 sleep related complaints (SRC; time to sleep onset, difficulties maintaining sleep, sleep duration, troubled sleep (somniloquism), physical inactivity after awakening, restlessness for unknown reason, sleep disorders frequency; total score = maximum 11 points) and parent's treatment satisfaction. Safety parameters were the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the tolerability of the treatments. <h3>Results</h3> The SRC total score decreased from baseline median 7.0 points in both groups to 2.0 points in the intervention group (n=89 children) and 4.0 points in the control group (n=90 children) after 28 days of treatment. Children of the intervention group had overall significant higher odds of getting lower SRC total score (odds ratio: 4.45 (95%-CI: 2.77–7.14), p&lt;0.0001; ITT). First clinical differences between both groups were seen already after 14 days. At day 28 significantly more children in the intervention group showed absence of individual complaints (Chi<sup>2</sup>-test: all P values≤0.0475; ITT). More parents were either 'very satisfied' (n=33) or 'satisfied' (n=49) with ZinCyp-3–02 treatment compared to the number of parents with 'very satisfied' (n=10) and 'satisfied' (n=28) ratings in the control group. Only few ADRs occurred (ZinCyp-3–02: n=2 (nervousness, excitability); control: n=1 (excitement)) and almost all parents and physician (&gt;93% out of 179) rated the tolerability of both treatments as 'very good' or 'good'. <h3>Conclusions</h3> ZinCyp-3–02 showed to be a safe and effective treatment option for paediatric sleep disorders and restlessness.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

There are usually more than one, sometimes half a dozen such causes for one accident. And back of these there are still other considerations that enter in: the design and the condition of the roadway and of the street system in general; the methods of controlling traffic; the laws and the enforcement of them; and a host of personal characteristics-eyesight, hearing, reaction time, and all the permanent or temporary conditions of mind or body which lead to inattention and carelessness.5 The cause of an accident is thus quite a complicated affair, which explains why the preventing of it is often so difficult. The problem, however, is perhaps not quite so complex when we look at it in this light: nearly every accident (other than the rare cases of mechanical failure) occurs because some one or more persons, usually the driver, did not try hard enough to drive safely under the existing conditions.

      "abstract": "In contrast to newborns, who spend 16–20 h in sleep each day, adults need only about sleep daily. However, many elderly may struggle to obtain those 8 h in one block. In addition to changes in sleep duration, sleep patterns change as age progresses. Like the physical changes that occur during old age, an alteration in sleep pattern is also a part of the normal ageing process. As people age, they tend to have a harder time falling asleep and more trouble staying asleep. Older people spend more time in the lighter stages of sleep than in deep sleep. As the circadian mechanism in older people becomes less efficient, their sleep schedule is shifted forward. Even when they manage to obtain 7 or 8 h sleep, they wake up early, as they have gone to sleep quite early. The prevalence of sleep disorders is higher among older adults. Loud snoring, which is more common in the elderly, can be a symptom of obstructive sleep apnoea, which puts a person at risk for cardiovascular diseases, headaches, memory loss, and depression. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder that disrupt sleep are more prevalent in older persons. Other common medical problems of old age such as hypertension diabetes mellitus, renal failure, respiratory diseases such as asthma, immune disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, physical disability, dementia, pain, depression, and anxiety are all associated with sleep disturbances.",

      "title": "Apnea",
      "abstract": "Apnea, from the Greek \"absence of breath,\" refers clinically to the partial or complete cessation of respiratory flow. Three types of apnea differ in their underlying pathophysiology as well as in their clinical presentations. Central apnea is the absence of respiratory effort from failure of brainstem neurons to generate an excitatory impulse and subsequently stimulate respiratory muscles. Obstructive apnea results from partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway despite normal brainstem excitation. Mixed apnea is characterized by both central and obstructive components. Understanding the differences among central, obstructive, and mixed apnea is essential for selecting appropriate and effective treatment.Central apnea can affect term neonates and infants as a consequence of their relatively immature brainstem respiratory centers. Clinically, central apneic episodes are characterized by a lack of chest wall motion and the absence of air flow. Brief episodes of apnea, which are fairly common, simply reflect the immaturity of the neural regulatory system, but an episode lasting more than 20 seconds usually is considered pathologic and may be accompanied by cyanosis, hypotonia, bradycardia, or pallor.Preterm neonates can present with idiopathic apnea of prematurity or with apnea from a variety of serious underlying conditions. The apneic episodes may be central, obstructive, or mixed. Idiopathic apnea, which typically has an onset from the second to the seventh day after birth, results from an immature brainstem in association with an underdeveloped upper airway, giving it a mixed clinical picture. It is the most common type of apnea seen in preterm neonates, with the risk varying inversely to gestational age. Resolution usually occurs by 37 to 40 weeks postconceptional age, but rarely may persist up to 48 weeks.When not idiopathic, apnea in a preterm neonate can be the consequence of a multitude of disease processes, including sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, seizure, pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and hypoglycemia. It is critical to differentiate between a stable preterm neonate who has self-limited idiopathic apnea and one whose apneic episodes signal a serious, potentially fatal illness. Markers that suggest high risk for underlying pathology include apnea on the first day after birth, apnea in infants older than 36 weeks of gestation, episodes associated with cyanosis, and severe episodes requiring intense resuscitation. Any of these factors is a signal for further evaluation and appropriate treatment of the underlying condition.Obstructive apnea typically occurs in older children, although it can affect infants. The upper airway may be obstructed in the nose (polyps, hypertrophied adenoids), in the oropharynx (enlarged tonsils, macroglossia), or in the larynx (subglottic stenosis, laryngomalacia). Clinically, children may present with a broad spectrum of findings, including snoring, respiratory distress while sleeping, behavioral problems, failure to thrive, and developmental delay. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is not a benign condition and, if severe, can lead to cor pulmonale and death.Because it can be so diverse in its presentation, OSA is not always easy to diagnose. Frequently, a child does not have obvious symptoms while awake or behaviors resulting from sleep disturbance may be attributed erroneously to another condition, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Failing to take a sleep history is one mistake; not giving serious credence to parental reports of snoring and restless sleep is another. Even when parents are questioned properly about their child's sleep, they may not be aware of habitual snoring. Children may not snore as loudly as adults or the parents may be deeply asleep when their child's snoring is most likely to occur (in the last third of the night, when the body's tone is most relaxed during REM sleep).Overall, 2% to 3% of children have sleep disorders, but a thorough sleep history is particularly important in children at special risk: those who have trisomy 21, craniofacial anomalies (Crouzon or Apert syndromes), or neuromuscular disorders (myotonic dystrophy). The following mnemonic tool created at Brown University's Child Development Center can guide an appropriate sleep history: Between 75% and 100% of children who have OSA snore. A comprehensive sleep history also should include questions about enuresis, which has a strong predictive value for OSA, as well as diaphoresis and hyperextension of the head during sleep.The physical examination findings may be entirely normal in children who have OSA. Careful measurement of weight and height is important; affected children may lose weight and fail to grow because of interrelated difficulties with eating and chronic hypoxemia. The association of obesity with OSA is more prevalent in the adult population; almost 30% of children who have OSA are underweight.The presence of dysmorphic facies, mouth breathing, hyponasal speech, or cleft palate should raise the physician's suspicion for OSA. A careful examination of the nose may reveal obstruction from polyps, septal deviation, hypertrophied adenoids, or even a foreign body. In the oropharynx, the size of the tonsils should be noted on a scale of 0 to 4; macroglossia (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hypothyroidism), micrognathia (Pierre Robin or Goldenhar sequence), or retrognathia may predispose a child to OSA. A complete neurologic examination is indicated because OSA can be associated with cerebral palsy or hypotonia.Most children who have OSA have no laboratory evidence of their disorder. Polycythemia, respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography are present only in the most severe cases. Radiographs may be useful in determining the cause of OSA. Among children who do not have tonsillar hypertrophy, a lateral neck radiograph can assess the size of the adenoids. In the absence of adenoidal and tonsillar hypertrophy, nasopharyngoscopy may assist in determining the cause of OSA.Several different strategies are available for confirming the diagnosis of OSA. Overnight pulse oximetry with in-hospital observation has a high positive predictive value in confirming OSA. At home, parents can record a sleep audiotape, although one limitation of this technique is the inability to identify a component of central apnea. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) can provide additional information when results of a sleep history and audiotape are inconclusive. It evaluates daytime sleepiness by measuring how long it takes a patient to fall asleep at different times. Having a short mean sleep latency (<10 min) during the day is abnormal, but the MSLT is of limited use in pediatrics because excessive daytime sleepiness is more common with obesity, which is not the usual finding among children who have OSA.The gold standard for diagnosing OSA remains polysomnography (PSG). The four essential components of a polysomnogram are a chest wall motion detector, nasal air flow meter, heart rate monitor, and a pulse oximeter. More complex instruments may have a pH probe and provide electroencephalographic monitoring. In 1996, criteria were set to standardize PSG interpretation in children. An abnormal study is defined by an apnea index (AI) greater than 1, an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 5, blood carbon dioxide levels of 45 mEq/L (45 mmol/L) for more than 60% of sleep time or 50 mEq/L (50 mmol/L) for more than 10% of sleep time, and a minimum oxygen saturation lower than 92%.Not all children suspected of having OSA require PSG, particularly when the indication for a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is already clear. PSG can provide critical information when there is uncertainty about the severity of OSA, in the presence of severe neurologic disease, with a very young child, and with a medical condition that might complicate surgical intervention. The major disadvantages of PSG are its expense and the time required for the study.As Drs. Matiz and Roman point out, the association between OSA and obesity is not as strong in children as it is in adults. About one third of children who have OSA actually are underweight, which makes sense, considering how failure to thrive might well be the consequence of poor sleep and chronic hypoxemia in a growing organism. The association of massive obesity with hypoventilation, daytime somnolence, and OSA has been called the Pickwickian syndrome. In fact, the syndrome is misnamed. In Dickens' Pickwick Papers, the hero, although portly, is neither obese nor somnolent, and he is not remarkable for his snoring. Mr. Wardle's young servant, known as \"the fat boy, Joe,\" has all the appropriate characteristics, but \"Joe's syndrome\" doesn't have much of a ring.",

Less commonly, autonomic hyperactivity also involves the parasympathetic system and manifests primarily with bradyarrhythmia or even syncope. Common causes of autonomic hyperactivity are head trauma, hypoxic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury, Guillain-Barré syndrome,and iatrogenic disorders such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome.Autonomic hyperactivity in the setting of cognitive, psychiatric or sleep disturbances suggests alcohol (or other depressant drug) withdrawal, fatal insomnia, or limbic encephalitis. Patients with autonomic hyperactivity should be managed in an intensive care unit as they require continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, respiration, and fluid balance.",

A migraine diathesis may be a marker for an underlying defect such as hypertension, hypercoagulability, lupus erythematosis or mitral valve prolapse and therefore might occasionally co-occur with[2] vascular occlusion or retinal vasospasm. Experts disagree whether retinal migraine is a rare or common cause of monocular visual loss and whether the mechanism is spreading depression or vasospasm. Complicated migraine refers to a permanent neurologic deficit whether it is visual, motor or sensory in origin. In some instances the stroke does not respect the usual middle or posterior cerebral artery territories suggesting that a strict vascular mechanism is insufficient to[3] explain all migraine-related stroke phenomena. Cocaine abuse cause hypertensive surges, stroke, arterial and venous thrombosis. Neuroimaging studies in cocaine abusers demonstrated abnormal perfusion involving the infraparietal,[4] temporal and anterofrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Dopamine-rich brain regions appear to be relatively specific targets for cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia. Dopamine is one of the[5] numerous neurotransmitters present in outer and inner layers of the retina. Cocaine abuse,[3] exercise and lupus cause non-migrainous retinal vasospasm and transient monocular visual loss. Authors have documented hypertension, cerebrovascular accident and basal ganglia infarction in a 37-year-old patient. In our practice we routinely inform the possibility of underlying systemic disease and importance of physician consultation in all patients with migraine. Perimetry may be useful to identify coexisting cerebral ischemia in patients with retinal vascular occlusion and normal neuroimaging study. We appreciate the authors' effort and research work.

Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

      "title": "Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is characterized by a slowly progressive peripheral sensorimotor and/or autonomic neuropathy as well as non-neuropathic changes of cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, vitreous opacities, and CNS amyloidosis. The disease usually begins in the third to fifth decade in persons from endemic foci in Portugal and Japan; onset is later in persons from other areas. Typically, sensory neuropathy starts in the lower extremities with paresthesias and hypesthesias of the feet, followed within a few years by motor neuropathy. In some persons, particularly those with early-onset disease, autonomic neuropathy is the first manifestation of the condition; findings can include: orthostatic hypotension, constipation alternating with diarrhea, attacks of nausea and vomiting, delayed gastric emptying, sexual impotence, anhidrosis, and urinary retention or incontinence. Cardiac amyloidosis is mainly characterized by progressive cardiomyopathy. Individuals with leptomeningeal amyloidosis may have the following CNS findings: dementia, psychosis, visual impairment, headache, seizures, motor paresis, ataxia, myelopathy, hydrocephalus, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features, amyloid deposits identified on biopsy that bind to anti-TTR antibodies, and identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TTR by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Therapeutic approach based on the characteristics of each therapy and the affected individual's severity of amyloidosis, general condition, and social environment. Pharmacotherapeutics (e.g., TTR tetramer stabilizers, gene-silencing therapies) are first-line therapy for all individuals with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. Limited indication for orthotopic liver transplantation, which is highly invasive and does not address non-neuropathic forms of ATTR amyloidosis. Surgery indicated for carpal tunnel syndrome, vitrectomy for vitreous involvement, and surgical treatment for glaucoma. In those with sick sinus syndrome or second-degree or third-degree AV block, a cardiac pacemaker may be indicated. Surveillance: Serial nerve conduction studies to monitor polyneuropathy; serial electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide levels to monitor cardiomyopathy and conduction block; follow modified body mass index to monitor nutritional status. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Local heating appliances, such as hot-water bottles, which can cause low-temperature burn injury in those with decreased temperature and pain perception. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing ensures early diagnosis and treatment. If the familial variant is not known, clinical evaluations ensure early diagnosis and treatment. Genetic counseling Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an affected individual (who is heterozygous for one TTR pathogenic variant) has a 50% chance of inheriting the TTR variant. For affected individuals homozygous for TTR pathogenic variants: Each sib is at a 50% risk of inheriting one TTR pathogenic variant and a 25% risk of inheriting two TTR pathogenic variants; All offspring will inherit a pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. Requests for prenatal testing for adult-onset conditions that (like hereditary ATTR amyloidosis) do not affect intellect and have some treatment available are not common.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Complaints about sleep are common in elderly adults. While changes in sleep architecture occur with normal aging, complaints about sleep are often related to pathological and treatable sleep disturbances. Primary sleep disturbances occurring in older adults include circadian rhythm disturbances, insomnia, sleep disordered breathing, rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and periodic limb movements in sleep. Particularly in older adults, sleep disturbances are likely to represent a multifactorial syndrome in which medical illness, psychiatric illness, and medications play a role. Sleep complaints necessitate the attention of the clinician as they are associated with poor outcomes. Because treatment strategies differ depending on the etiology of the sleep disturbance, a careful and systematic approach to diagnosis is crucial. This chapter reviews the normal changes in sleep that occur with age and sleep disorders frequently seen in older adults including in those with major neurocognitive disorders/dementia. Diagnosis and treatment strategies are discussed.",

      "title": "Recognize \"Sleepy\" Workers by Asking the Right Questions Early in the Rehabilitation Process",
      "abstract": "Recognize Sleepy Workers by Asking the Right Questions Early in the Rehabilitation Process The impact of sleepiness upon job performance has smoldered as a neglected issue for many years. In fact, only disastrous events, particularly involving nuclear power and the aviation industry, have succeeded in bringing the problem to the attention of both the general public and regulatory agencies. At present, obvious aggravating factors--external to, yet imposed upon the worker (such as shift work and jet lag) are under intense scrutiny. However, a major dilemma remains. Essentially, we have tripped over the razor-sharp tip of a massive iceberg. There are many employees inherently incapable of maintaining adequate alertness for job performance, irrespective of hours and work conditions. For example, the leading cause of severe sleepiness encountered by sleep medicine specialists is sleep apnea. This syndrome is characterized by repeated cessation of breathing during sleep. Individuals may struggle violently to overcome closure of the upper airway hundreds of times each night. Their consequent exhaustion may be compounded further by the serious drops in blood oxygen levels that many of them demonstrate. Potential complications, aside from incapacitating sleepiness, include heart failure, hypertension, and risk of sleep-related heart attacks, seizures, strokes and sudden death. It seems incredible that such a dramatic condition in fact is common--occurring in approximately one out of every fifty adult men. Narcolepsy, an often inherited disorder that appears due to neurochemical imbalances in the brain, was first described over 100 years ago and had been thought rare. We now recognize that it has a prevalence of roughly 1:1000 or greater, such that it is at least as prevalent as multiple sclerosis. A large number of additional men and women are diagnosed as having idiopathic central nervous system hypersomnolence: likely due to yet other perturbations in brain chemistry, that eventuate in severe sleepiness without classic narcolepsy. A variety of other physical causes of impaired wakefulness similarly abound. In short, we now realize that the magnitude of the population affected by these disorders is immense. No less striking is the severity of job impairment experienced by this group. Narcolepsy has been most thoroughly studied in this latter regard. Broughton and co-workers (1984) contrasted life effects of narcolepsy and epilepsy and found that although a higher percentage of people with narcolepsy currently were working (73.3 vs 55.0), people with narcolepsy more often reported reduced work performance due to the underlying condition: 61.4 vs 30.3. Narcolepsy also was reported as having led to a variety of specific problems: reduction in earnings in 31.8%, prevention of promotion in 22.7%, fear of job loss in 45.5%, and actual job loss in 23.3%. A more recent and somewhat larger survey (Alaia, 1988) cited reduced job performance in 84.6%, resulting job change in 57.1%, failure to receive promotion in 37.9%, and accidents on the job in 18.9%, with narcolepsy stated to have influenced initial job choice in 42.9%. At the same time, workers whose impairment derives from excessive sleepiness tend to be excellent rehabilitation candidates. For example, nearly all sleep apnea patients are restored to full alertness if their nocturnal breathing abnormality is corrected, now possible in the vast majority due to the advent of newer treatment approaches. Recognition: The Challenge Two obvious questions arise. First, if the prevalence of these disorders is so great, where have they been? Second, if effective treatment indeed is possible, why might individuals with sleep disorders still present for rehabilitation? Odds would favor many rehabilitation counselors already having seen workers unemployed as a direct consequence of excessive sleepiness--without ever knowing that such was the basic problem. …",

      "title": "1205 Haunted Slumbers: Decoding a Trauma-Induced Sleep Disorder in a Teen Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction This case examines a complex inpatient sleep presentation of a teenager with a history of foster care, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD, presenting with features of parasomnia. Key symptoms included excessive sleepiness, waking hallucinations, partial awareness, and significant uncontrolled movements reaching a level of severity requiring hospitalization. Report of case(s) A 14-year-old female presented with severe nocturnal episodes arising from sleep characterized by hallucinations of a dark figure, observed limb thrashing, screaming, and impaired arousal that gradually intensified over a 5 month period. Despite treatment for PTSD and an SSRI, her condition worsened - escalating to a severe and prolonged episode requiring EMS and hospitalization for her intense, potentially harmful movements. Concerns of parasomnia prompted inpatient sleep medicine consultation. Detailed history indicated these spells occurred primarily in early morning hours during sleep-wake transitions, with the patient having only partial recall of her movements. Each episode involved fear and visual hallucinations of threatening figures that she could recall later. Significant sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness were noted. Her psychiatric history revealed trauma from foster care. She also reported a fascination with horror media which seemed to influence these disturbances, reflecting in recurrent nightmares and similar traumatic experiences. Video EEG was negative for seizure disorder; PSG showed very mild OSA, REM with appropriate atonia, and sudden brief awakenings in both NREM and REM sleep. No spells were observed. Due her parents safety concerns, she stayed in a residential facility for intensive outpatient psychiatric therapy. Her episodes gradually improved with sleep scheduling, optimization of medications, and counseling. In outpatient therapy, she reported a swift cessation of the episodes, marked by her intentional disregard of the hallucinatory figure from her experiences. Conclusion This case highlights trauma-induced sleep disturbances in a young patient requiring hospitalization and inpatient sleep medicine consultation. The resolution of symptoms with changes in medication, improved sleep duration and hygiene in a residential setting underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to managing complex sleep spells in adolescents with mood disturbance.

Abstract This review synthesizes some of the most current investigative research to illuminate the physiological mechanisms contributing to the relationship between sleep dysfunction and depression. Major depression has consistently been linked to sleep abnormalities and insomnia is a robust risk factor in the initiating and development of depression. Recent neurobiological findings indicate the crucial role of sleep in the affective modulation of brain functioning. Studies have demonstrated that sleep in major depression is characterized by a reduction in slow wave sleep, interruptions in sleep continuity, longer periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep including a shortening of REM latency (i.e. the time between sleep onset and the occurrence of the first REM period), as well as an increase in REM density. The failure of sleep dependant emotional brain processing in REM sleep that seems to occur in depression, support the development and fostering of clinical depression. How depression likely interplays with these sleep processes points to the use of multi-therapeutic approaches for treatment with emphasis on positive behavioural imagery therapies.",

These parasomnia events occurred at REM sleep-wake transitions, manifesting with screaming or crying, similar to sleep terrors, without alertness or clear orientation.

Brainstem disorders of subacute onset (onset and progression with accumulation of disabling deficits in 6–12 weeks) are generally of autoimmune, infectious, inflammatory, or infiltrative neoplastic cause. An autoimmune or infectious brainstem disorder may be referred to as brainstem encephalitis or rhombencephalitis. We describe a patient with paraneoplastic autoimmune rhombencephalitis, in whom diagnostic clues included the following: diverse visual and sleep symptoms, trismus, and choking in the history; see-saw nystagmus, opsoclonus, dysarthria, jaw dystonia, and episodic laryngospasm on examination; subtle but longitudinal and nonenhancing T2 MRI abnormalities in the brainstem and upper cervical cord; and oligoclonal bands in the CSF. His movement disorder–specific neural IgG profile revealed ANNA-2 (anti-Ri) and KLHL-11-IgG. Both are biomarkers of paraneoplastic brainstem encephalitis. KLCHL-11-IgG has been reported to accompany germ cell tumors, which was found in a solitary metastasis to the left inguinal lymph node in our patient, along with an atrophic left testis. Multidisciplinary treatment (autoimmune neurology, sleep medicine, ophthalmology, and physiatry) led to significant clinical improvements. This case provides a framework for the evaluation of patients with subacute-onset brainstem syndromes and the investigation and management of those with paraneoplastic and other autoimmune diseases.",

      "abstract": "Delirium Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness (awareness of the person' s environment) characterized by altered or shifting mental status and inattention (reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention).There are also changes in cognition (basic mental functions) such as memory impairment, disorientation to time or place, and language disturbance.There also may be disturbances of perception (accurate appreciation of the environment) such as hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not actually there), abnormal speech, abnormal movements (including tremors or picking at clothing), disruptive or violent behavior, and sudden shifts in emotions.To qualify for a diagnosis of delirium, the signs and symptoms must have a short onset (over a period of hours or days) and change over the course of the day.It is important to make a clear distinction between delirium and dementia (such as Alzheimer disease).Dementia is a disturbance in intellectual (thinking) functions and memory that is usually gradually progressive over a long period.Having delirium along with another medical illness can significantly increase a person' s chance of dying of that illness.It is important for doctors to identify delirium so that it can be treated to improve the person' s overall prognosis.The August 18, 2010, issue of JAMA includes an article about diagnosing delirium.This Patient Page is based on one previously published in the December 24/31, 2008, issue of JAMA.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sleep disturbance was identified as one of the main characteristics and biological markers of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. Sleep initiation, sleep maintenance and terminal insomnia with unrefreshed sleep and disturbing dreams have been consistently reported in the studies of adults with MDD. Hypersomnia has been reported in a subset of adult depressives. Although sleep disturbances may be present throughout all phases of a depressive disorder, they are most severe during an acute episode. Patients with depression who report sleep disturbances are more likely to attempt suicide than those who do not report difficulties with their sleep. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep to such a degree that patients may have vegetative symptoms of depression. Thus, it is important when assessing a depressed patient with sleep difficulties to consider a thorough sleep assessment to rule out a physiological cause of vegetative symptoms of depression and insomnia. Those with depression who also exhibit sleep disturbance can benefit from behavioral and relaxation training (1).",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Ekbom's syndrome, is a fairly common complaint which is not widely recognised by medical professionals, although it seems to affect 1-10% of the population. Despite recent attempts to better characterize RLS, this neurologic disorder remains poorly understood. Idiopathic RLS frequently follows an autosomal dominant inheritance with a variable clinical expressivity of symptoms. Secondary RLS is usually associated with neuropathy of chronic disorders (uremia, cryoglobulinemia, diabetes mellitus, infections, etc). RLS gives the sufferer an unpleasant sensation in the legs at rest, causing an irresistible desire to move which alleviates the discomfort. Other features that characterize RLS include sleep disturbance, involuntary movements in sleep or wakefulness, a normal neurologic examination, a chronic clinical course (waxing and waning over the time), and, in some cases, a positive family history. Periodic limb movements during sleep, which also may occur as an isolated finding, may or may not cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Clinical diagnosis of idiopathic or symptomatic forms of RLS can be supported with polysomnography. Full understanding of the features of RLS will provide the clinician with the strongest tool for recognizing the disorder. Many different treatments have been tried for RLS. Since the cause is unclear, therapy of RLS and PLMS remains symptomatic except for some secondary forms. Treatment of first choice consists of dopaminergic drugs or dopamine agonist, opioids and benzodiazepines.",

Diagnostic procedure for insomnia should include evaluation of sleep–wake behaviour and sleep history, as well as questions about somatic and mental disorders, anamnesis of medication and other substances used, physical examination, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, and additional measures. Sleep diaries or actigraphy can be used to evaluate sleep–wake schedules or circadian rhythm disorders. Polysomnography is recommended when other sleep disorders (periodic limb movement disorder, sleep apnea or narcolepsy) are suspected, also for treatment-resistant insomnia. Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age. A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective or not available. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia. Long-term treatment of insomnia with benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists is not recommended. Sedating antidepressants are effective for short-term insomnia treatment. Antihistaminics and antipsychotics are not recommended for insomnia treatment because of insufficient evidence. Melatonin is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of low efficacy. Phytotherapeutics are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence. Light therapy and exercise regimes may be useful as adjunct therapies. Acupuncture, aromatherapy, foot reflexology, homeopathy, meditative movement, moxibustion, and yoga are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence.",

However other conditions have shown to have presence of sleep on REM episodes which include but not limited to obstructive sleep apnea, sleep wake schedule disturbance, alcoholism, neurodegenerative disorders, depression and anxiety Report of Case Here we present a case of 30 year old female with history of asthma, patent foraman ovale, migraine headache, and anxiety who presented with daytime sleepiness, falling asleep while at work, occasional scheduled naps, non-restorative sleep, sleep paralysis, and hypnopompic hallucination. Pertinent physical exam included; mallampati score of 4/4, retrognathia, high arched hard palate, crowded posterior oropharynx. She had a score of 16 on Epworth sleepiness scale. Patient previously had multiple sleep latency test at outside facility which revealed 4/5 SOREM, with mean sleep onset latency of 11.5 minutes. She however was diagnosed with narcolepsy and tried on modafinil which she failed to tolerate. She was tried on sertraline as well which was discontinued due to lack of benefit. She had repeat multiple sleep latency test work up which revealed 2/5 SOREM, with mean sleep onset latency was 13.1 minutes. Her overnight polysomnogram prior to repeat MSLT showed SOREM with sleep onset latency of 10 minutes. Actigraphy showed consistent sleep pattern overall with sufficient sleep time but was taking hydroxyzine and herbal medication. Patient did not meet criteria for hypersomnolence disorder and sleep disordered breathing. Conclusion There is possibility her medication may have played pivotal role with her daytime symptoms. We also emphasize SOREMs can be present in other disorders such as anxiety in this case and not solely in narcolepsy",

The various modes of mechanical ventilation may have different effects on sleep fragmentation and on the propensity to cause central apnoeas, thereby potentially prolonging the time on the ventilator.

      "title": "Carersʼ experiences of seeking help for relatives with first-episode psychosis: a systematic review of qualitative evidence.",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to synthesize the best available evidence on the lived experience of carers of a relative with a first-episode psychosis (FEP) and in particular their experience preceding and of seeking help. More specifically, the objectives are to explore: Perceived promoters and inhibitors to help-seeking during a FEP. Perceived barriers and facilitators to accessing services during a FEP. Background Psychotic disorders are low prevalence disorders, affecting between 1-2% of the adult population.1 Onset of first-episode psychosis (FEP), the first presentation of psychotic symptoms, is typically during late adolescent and early adult years.1, 2 Positive psychotic symptoms may include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech and behaviour.3, 4 Onset may be sudden or insidious, though most individuals experience a prodromal phase manifested by the gradual development of a variety of signs and symptoms that are commonly vague and nonspecific e.g. functional and social decline, sleep disturbance and mood symptoms.4-6 Individuals detected in this phase are considered to be ‘ultra high risk’ clinically, though development of psychosis is not inevitable.7 Though low in prevalence, psychotic disorders account for a high proportion of resources allocated to mental health services and are associated with significant challenges for those with the illness as well as their families.1, 2 During late adolescent and early adult years a young person is developing in many areas including formation of friendships, vocational goals, and general independence.2 The experience of mental illness during these formative years can divert a person from the trajectory of normal life development and significantly disrupt the person's life goals.8, 9 For those presenting at a later stage in life, other developmental issues will be of importance such as partners and children.10 A recent Australian national survey of people living with a psychotic illness, designed to capture the impact of psychosis, concluded that ‘psychosis is associated with substantial and persistent disability’.2(p.97) More specifically, participants named the following challenges: financial difficulties (42.7%), loneliness (37.2%), unemployment (35.1%), poor physical health (27.4%) uncontrolled symptoms of mental illness (25.7%), lack of stable/suitable housing (18.1%) and stigma (11.6%).2 Whilst some people will experience one psychotic episode and obtain full recovery, a significant number (61.5%) reported recurrent episodes with good or partial recovery during episodes and 30.5% experienced a continuous chronic illness.2 Early intervention for FEP has been a focus of care for several decades. It arose from the premise that the early years of illness are a ‘critical period’ for intervention when there can be significant decline but also most scope for influencing longer term prognosis.9, 11, 12 The main aims of such services are to shorten the course of the initial psychotic episode, reduce the severity of the illness, and subsequently minimize disruption to the person's life.9, 12 Key components of early intervention include medication to reduce symptoms and psychosocial interventions aimed at supporting the individual's recovery.13 Even after onset of psychosis there is typically a delay in accessing appropriate treatment.14 The period of time between onset of first psychotic symptom and first treatment, referred to as the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), has been a major focus of research and intervention. This is because DUP is considered to be an important and malleable prognostic factor. A systematic review to establish whether DUP is associated with prognosis included a meta-analysis of 26 studies from diverse cultural backgrounds including 4490 participants.15 The results showed there is evidence of a moderate association between DUP and symptomatic and functional outcome in the short term (6-12 month follow up), though it remains inconclusive as to whether reducing a person's DUP improves overall prognosis. Mean DUP was found to be two years.15 The Treatment and Intervention in Psychosis (TIPS) early detection and intervention programme in Norway successfully reduced median DUP from 16 to 5 weeks.16 At ten-year follow up, though reported symptoms were comparable across the early detection group and usual detection group, there were significant gains in recovery for the early detection group due to increased employment.17 Reducing DUP remains a common service goal.13 DUP is typically long, meaning individuals18 and their families19-21 are often required to cope with distressing symptoms for many months or longer. Many individuals and families report high levels of distress during the stage of untreated psychosis. First-episode psychosis is a high-risk period for suicidality22 which is important as previous suicide attempts are predictors of later attempts and completed suicide.23 Gersen et al24 found that families of relatives with a FEP predominantly use adaptive coping strategies. In contrast, families of individuals with a more chronic illness reportedly use increased maladaptive strategies, suggesting the impact of burden and stress of care over time on coping.24, 25 A recent systematic review measuring the effectiveness of early intervention on clinical outcome was inconclusive, with the exception of sustained positive impact in the areas of employment and family.26 Whilst this may have implications for future funding directives, it does not reduce the need for individuals with a FEP to receive early and appropriate intervention. Minimising the impact of psychosis for individuals and improving outcome remains a priority in Clinical Practice Guidelines in many countries.3, 27, 28 Quick and timely access to services can positively impact on the distress experienced by both the ill person and their families. Reaching those individuals experiencing a FEP during the early stages of illness requires ‘early detection of psychosis in the community and understanding factors associated with and contributing to delay in help-seeking’.14(p.76) The literature related to pathways to care explores barriers and facilitators to accessing services. This encompasses help-seeking behaviour, accessibility of services and service response.9, 29, 30 Help-seeking can be defined as ‘“the behaviour of actively seeking help from other people” (Rickwood, Deane, Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005, p. 4)31 and can be directed towards formal sources, such as mental health professionals, or informal sources, such as family and friends’ (Dr Coralie Wilson, personal communication, 2012 Mar 27). For young people informal sources are the preferred source of help.31, 32 In FEP it is frequently family members that initiate successful contacts for their relatives20, 33 and often without the affected individual participating in the contact.34 Before help-seeking can occur there needs to be a recognition that the person is in need of help.32 Recognition that a disorder is developing, knowledge of treatment options and knowledge of effective help-seeking strategies are all components of ‘mental health literacy’.32 Community surveys of mental health literacy show that many people are unable to recognize mental illness, though there is evidence that improvements can be made by education strategies at a community level.16, 32 This knowledge is now impacting upon policy development, with programmes designed to develop people's mental health literacy and help-seeking skills.16, 27, 32, 35 In a systematic review aiming to understand and measure pathways to care in FEP, Singh14 notes that there remains a delay for relatives to seek help even when a problem has become evident. Understanding individuals' personal narratives and journeys is one method of enhancing understanding of the processes that affect help-seeking.14 Delays in accessing appropriate treatment arise at all levels including illness recognition, help-seeking and service response. Help-seeking is just one factor that can impact on delay to treatment.36 Delays at service level can also be significant and for varied reasons, e.g. lack of affordable services, inflexibility of appointments37 and delayed diagnosis within mental health services.38 Common themes relating to delayed help-seeking include: stigma, misattribution of symptoms (e.g. drugs, stress or typical changes of adolescence), not knowing where to go, hope that the symptoms will go away without intervention, and a raised threshold for seeking help.5, 39, 40 Factors associated with successful help-seeking include: frank psychotic symptoms, depression and suicidal thinking and reaching a crisis.5, 18, 20 When studies include both individuals and families of FEP, considerable congruence is reported in themes and experiences when help-seeking.18, 21 Research to date provides information regarding potential barriers and facilitators to help-seeking in a FEP. Increased awareness of the impact of prolonged DUP and benefits of early intervention has driven the need to further explore and understand the pathways to care for people experiencing a FEP. A preliminary search of the literature reveals qualitative studies exploring individuals' and their carers' experiences of help-seeking during a FEP.5, 21, 41 Carers play a crucial role in accessing help for relatives14, 21, often being the primary and sole help-seeker.34 A search of the Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute Library of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, CINAHL and PROSPERO databases did not reveal any previous or planned systematic reviews of qualitative evidence on this topic. A synthesis of the relevant studies of carers' experiences will add to the understanding of illness recognition, help-seeking strategies utilized and service response and may provide important information regarding pathways to care for those experiencing a FEP. Definition of terms First-episode psychosis (FEP) For the purpose of this review all operational definitions of FEP will be considered. This means first-episode may be defined as first treatment contact, duration of antipsychotic medication use or duration of psychosis.42 Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include carers of a relative with a FEP. This means first presentation of psychotic symptoms with no limit to duration of untreated psychosis. Method of diagnosis may be according to any of the editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), research diagnostic criteria relevant to the country of study or confirmed by a psychiatrist or other health care professional. Psychotic symptoms may include hallucinations and delusions. Psychotic disorders may include: Schizophrenia Schizoaffective disorders Mania with psychotic symptoms Depression with psychotic symptoms Delusional disorders Acute and transient psychotic disorders Other and unspecified non-organic psychotic disorder. There will be no age restriction for the person experiencing the psychosis. Carers could be a parent, sibling, spouse or other relative of any age. Studies that predominantly include individuals in the prepsychotic or ultra high-risk stage of illness will be excluded due to the ‘low’ conversion rate to psychosis. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that investigate the experience of carers of a relative with a first-episode psychosis, and in particular their experience preceding and of seeking help from both informal (family and friends) and formal (services) sources. Types of outcomes The review will consider research conducted in any mental health care setting including inpatient, outpatient and community. Types of studies This review will consider studies that focus on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. In the absence of research studies, other text such as opinion papers and reports will be considered. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Studies published in English will be considered for inclusion in this review. Studies published between January 1990 and August 2012 will be considered for inclusion in this review. This is due to focus of care on first-episode psychosis and pathways to care developing in the early 1990's. The databases to be searched include: CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO and Embase. The search for unpublished studies will include: Mednar, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Trove, relevant professional bodies in the field of Early Intervention in Psychosis and carers in mental health. Initial keywords to be used will be: help-seeking; care-givers; first-episode psychosis; qualitative. Assessment of methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data collection Data will be extracted from qualitative research papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-QARI (Appendix I). The data extracted will include specific details about the phenomena of interest, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Qualitative research findings will, where possible, be pooled using JBI-QARI. This will involve the aggregation or synthesis of findings to generate a set of statements that represent that aggregation, through assembling the findings rated according to their quality, and categorising these findings on the basis of similarity in meaning. These categories are then subjected to a meta-synthesis in order to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesized findings that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice. Where textual pooling is not possible, the findings will be presented in narrative form. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.

      "title": "BELL'S MANIA",
      "abstract": "(1) There are cases of acute excitement that are classified under several headings with apparently no recognition as to the uniformity of symptomatology. These cases have been diagnosed as Bell's Mania, typhomania, acute delirious mania (manic-depressive psychosis), delirium grave, acute delirium, specific febrile delirium, and collapse delirium. (2) Luther Bell described these cases in 1849 and the description is slightly modified as follows: There is a sudden onset; exceedingly great overactivity; marked sleeplessness; great push of speech with statements that are disconnected at times by reason of the rapidity of flow; disconnected and poorly systematized delusions; transient hallucinations that border on illusions; appearance of confusion, but when one insists that the patient answer the questions, the patient can \"suspend the intellectual wanderings\" long enough to answer correctly as to orientation. The course of the illness is from three to six weeks, with a fatal termination in a large percentage of cases, apparently from cardio-vascular failure due to overactivity. The cases that recover have no after symptoms. No pathological evidence of note has been found by later workers. (3) Treatment is recommended in the form of sufficient sedative, regardless of the dosage, to enable the patient to get some rest. In our case ordinary sedatives failed and though over 125 grains of sodium amytal were given in three days the patient slept comparatively little. However, the overexcitement was quelled. (4) For the sake of clarity in the studying of this group, and until more definite findfngs are brought forth, it is suggested that these cases be called Bell's Mania, after the original observer.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

The phenomenon of paradoxical undressing may be observed. A paradoxical feeling of warmth in the advanced condition of hypothermia leads to the behaviour of undressing, partly or completely. Suicides with intentional hypothermia are rare. Fatal hypothermia often appears as a concomitant mechanism, e. g. in drug poisoning.

      "abstract": "1. Subcortical (e.g., internal capsule) versus cortical lesion: Motor weakness (paresis) usually affects the face, arm, and leg equally. Primary sensory deficits (paresthesia, numbness) are more prominent because of involvement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Cortical lesions affect higher cortical sensory, manifesting as agnosia, agraphesthesia, and impairment of double simultaneous stimulation. Visual field defects are more common because visual tracts travel through the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Occipital lobe lesions produce visual field defect, but usually are not associated with motor or sensory deficit. Speech dysarthria is more common. A dominant cortical lesion produces aphasia and apraxia. 2. Gerstmann’s syndrome. This syndrome is commonly caused by a stroke affecting the left angular and supramarginal gyrus and clinically characterized by finger agnosia, left-right disorientation, agraphia, and dyscalculia. 3. Watershed or border zone infarcts. Watershed areas are end-artery zones between superficial branches of a major cortical blood supply such as between the anterior cerebral artery-middle cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery-posterior cerebral artery. Bilateral watershed infarcts occur in severe hypotension or hypoxia, and unilateral watershed infarcts occur when the affected artery is stenotic, and collateral circulation cannot compensate in a hypotensive episode.",

The incidence is 1.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.7) but it ranges from 1-8 and 25 out of every 1000 born in developed and developing countries, respectively. The most frequent causes are detachment of the placenta, prolapse of the umbilical cord and uterine rupture. The diagnostic criteria include partial or total incapacity for the newborn to cry and breath at birth even when stimulated, requiring assisted ventilation in the delivery room, Apgar < 5 in 5 and 10 minutes, acidemia (pH ≤ 7 and / or bases deficit ≥ 12 mmol/l), alterations of the conscience and the reflexes of Moro, grasping and suction, muscular stretching and muscle tone. The clinical forms are mild, moderate and severe. In the mild forms, the recovery is total in three days without, or with minimal, neurodevelopmental alterations. The moderate and severe forms cause permanent neurological deficits and neurodevelopmental alterations (48%) or death (27%). The regular or amplitude integrated EEG and the magnetic and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging performed between 24 and 96 hours and 7 and 21 days after birth, respectively, have a high diagnostic and prognostic value. Induced hypothermia (33.5° C for 72 hours) is recommended before 6 hours old. The result is a decrease in mortality (from 35% to 27%) and morbidity (from 48% to 27%).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infusions of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) are often cycled at night coinciding with sleep episodes. Adult consumers of HPN are known to experience poor sleep attributed to frequent awakenings and long durations of wakefulness after falling asleep. Consequently, most consumers do not meet recommendations for sleep duration and quality or daytime napping. The primary underlying pathophysiology resulting in sleep problems is nocturia; however, other factors also exist, including disruptions caused by medical equipment (ie, pump alarms), comorbid conditions, dysglycemia, and medication use. Early guidance on sleep is imperative because of the central role of sleep in physical health and wellbeing, including mitigating complications, such as infection risk, gastrointestinal problems, pain sensitivity, and fatigue. Clinicians should routinely inquire about the sleep of their patients and address factors known to perturb sleep. Nonpharmacologic opportunities to mitigate sleep problems include education on healthy sleep practices (ie, sleep hygiene); changes in infusion schedules, volumes, rates, and equipment; and, possibly, behavioral interventions, which have yet to be examined in this population. Addressing comorbid conditions, such as mood disorders, and nutrition deficiencies may also help. Pharmacologic interventions and technological advancement in HPN delivery are also needed. Research on sleep in this population is considered a priority, yet it remains limited at this time.",

Unawareness of the meaning of these symptoms often mislead both the patient and his physician.To define and describe the types of visual illusions and hallucinations which can be commonly encountered in neuro-ophthalmological practice.Overview article.Hallucinations are a perception not based on sensory input, whereas illusions are a misinterpretation of a correct sensory input. Both phenomenon can be due to medication or drug, or to an altered mental status. Visual hallucinations can be formed (objects, people) or unformed (light, geometric figures). They can be generated either by a lesion on the antechiasmatic pathway, by a seizure phenomenon, by a migrainous phenomenon, or by a release phenomenon secondary to visual differentiation. Investigations will be directed towards a retinopathy, an optic neuropathy, a chiasmal or retrochiasmal lesion, or a bilateral antechiasmal lesion (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Visual illusions include meta-morphopsias, micro- macropsias, polyopia, palinopsia (visual perseveration), achromatopsia, Pulfrich phenomenon, or subjective vertical deviation. Illusions can be due to lesions of the retina, the optic nerve, the visual cortex (primary or associative), or the graviceptive pathways.As most patients do not spontaneously mention their symptoms, history taking is essential. The first step is to rule out medication or an altered mental status as the possible cause of these symptoms.

      "title": "Is ‘Poor Sleep’ Too Vague a Concept for Rational Treatment?",
      "abstract": "Poor sleep is a common complaint, accounting for 4-5% of all general practitioner consultations. Disorders of initiating sleep are overrated by patients compared with disorders of maintaining sleep, despite the greater effect of the latter on daytime performance. There is frequently a discrepancy between subjective observations and objective measurements of sleep. General practitioners should pay attention to sleep disorders lasting more than three weeks and should bear in mind that poor sleep is a symptom, the underlying cause of which needs to be determined. Good coordination of endogenous biorhythms and external life and working circumstances can positively influence sleeping patterns. Sleep onset latency determines the amount of deep sleep and, thus, the duration and stability of core sleep. General practitioners usually prescribe a single type of benzodiazepine drug with a half-life of 5-10 h for sleep disorders. Such drugs cause the patient to fall asleep quickly, to have a considerable period of uninterrupted sleep with little waking and to wake in the morning with a subjective feeling of having slept well. A number of less desirable changes can occur, however, that may produce, for example, anxiety dreams, increased snoring and sleep apnoea periods at night, and weakness of muscles during the day. The third generation of hypnotic agents produce less undesirable changes than the second generation. Zolpidem (an imidazoypridine), one such agent, seems to provide an effective treatment for insomnia without inducing undesirable side-effects.",

Clinically, cognitive dysfunction can be characterized as debilitation of cognitive dysfunctions, including memory, learning, focus, and speed of mental action. Influencing surgical patients in all age bunches over the short term, cognitive dysfunction shows days or weeks after surgery and shows quicker determination in more youthful populations, in spite of the fact that it might be perpetual. Generally, communicated by patients as another powerlessness to finish once effectively feasible tasks, signs include trouble staying concentrated on an errand, failure to multitask, trouble discovering words and reviewing information recently obtained.

The activation of extrastriate and limbic structures, combined with a deactivation of primary visual and prefrontal cortices, appears to indicate the existence of a closed processing loop during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Slow waves are prominent characteristics of the later stages of nonrapid eye movement sleep and consist of highamplitude delta waves at 1–4 Hz and a slower oscillatory rhythm of less than 1 Hz. Rapid eye movements are some of the most prominent hallmarks of REM sleep and are believed to be related to the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves identified through cellular recordings in animals. Sleep disturbances are a common facet of depression and include problems in sleep continuity, reductions of slow-wave sleep, decreased REM latency, and increased REM density.",

      "abstract": "Familial dysautonomia or the Riley-Day syndrome was first described in 1949 with a report of five cases (14). Dysautonomia refers to the characteristic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system upon which are superimposed both motor and sensory abnormalities; familial refers to the genetic nature of the abnormality, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait occurring almost exclusively in Jewish families of East European extraction (12). The clinical features may be grouped into major categories resulting from apparent dysfunction of the dominantly involved systems: (a) episodic hypertension and postural hypotension, transient (erythematous) blotching of the skin, cool extremities, excessive perspiration, hypolacrimation, episodic unexplained fever, episodic vomiting; (b) disordered swallowing, dysarthria, motor inco-ordination; (c) marked diminution in sensory modalities (notably pain and taste), decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, corneal hypesthesia (leading to corneal scarring). Additional, almost constant features are emotional lability, recurrent pulmonic infection, kyphoscoliosis, and other bony changes. The occasional occurrence of convulsions is noted, but mental retardation is not thought to be an important primary feature of this syndrome. Recent communications have emphasized the probably pathognomonic absence of the fungiform papillae of the tongue with the presumed absence of the associated taste buds; frequently there is concomitant absence of the circumvallate papillae (4, 15). Pharmacologic investigations have revealed hypersensitivity to both norepinephrine and methacholine, absence of normal responses to intradermal histamine, and restoration of many of the abnormal sensory and parasympathetic findings with infused methacholine (4, 16). Despite the wide array of symptomatology and despite the fact that the radiologist is frequently involved with the initial diagnosis of this disease because of the chronic and recurrent pneumonic episodes that often mimic cystic fibrosis, there is a dearth of radiographic literature available concerning this syndrome. Kirkpatrick and Riley in 1957 discussed the general radiographic findings (10). They found that chronic bronchopneumonia was the most common and important radiographic feature. They also reported the skeletal changes of abnormal and retarded growth, of kyphoscoliosis, and of traumatic sequelae in a large percentage of their cases. Of their 7 patients who underwent examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, none showed any major abnormality, although one patient had nonpersistent pylorospasm. Linde and Westover in 1962 discussed the esophageal and gastric changes seen in their 6 patients (11). Difficulty in swallowing was present in 2.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

Their general occurrence is reflected in phrases like “it makes me sick” and “to sweat with fear”. In some groups of people these autonomic disturbances are not confined to stressful situations but become more general and frequent and so more disabling. For instance, in patients with affective illnesses, symptoms of autonomic origin are common and are relieved by successful treatment of the underlying illness. Again, there is a group of patients who complain of these symptoms but who show little affective disorder. In these patients the autonomic symptoms are provoked by specific situations which are not particularly stressful to normal people, e.g. nausea occurs when eating in company or diarrhoea when travelling; outside these specific situations symptoms do not occur. Although these patients may complain of some anxiety, the physical symptom is the major complaint and the anxiety is often attributed to this.",

      "title": "A rare yet treatable case of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Dear Sir, Paroxysmal dyskinesias are movement disorders that manifest with recurrent abnormal involuntary movements that are episodic. The movements can be chorea, athetosis, ballism, dystonia, or a combination of all.[1] Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is the most common type of movement disorder, and it can be primary or secondary to some illnesses and is precipitated by sudden voluntary actions.[2] The secondary causes implicated are trauma; stroke; neurosyphilis; encephalitis; multiple sclerosis; and metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and kernicterus.[3] Here, we describe a case of secondary PKD. A 32-year-old man with normal birth and developmental milestones presented with multiple episodes of dystonic posturing in the left upper and lower limbs precipitated by walking or activity for 10 years. The frequency of the episodes was 4–5 per day. There was no preceding aura, sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, tongue bite, or urinary incontinence in any of the episodes. In addition, the patient denied any premonitory urge before the attacks, and they were not suppressible. Each episode lasted 25–40 seconds and used to occur soon after patient started walking and would subside spontaneously. There was no history of gait imbalance, cognitive impairment, or cranial nerve involvement. His family history was negative for similar complaints. He was treated with multiple antiseizure medications in the past with no relief in symptoms. On examination, the mini-mental state examination score was 30/30. His general physical examination was normal. His speech, cranial nerves, power, reflexes, and sensory and cerebellar examination were normal, and he was noted to have positive Trousseau sign. He underwent video electroencephalography recording with the possibility of seizures versus movement disorder. No epileptiform discharges were detected in both ictal and interictal electroencephalography. Routine investigations, including hemogram and renal and liver function tests, were within normal limits. The corrected serum calcium level was 5.1 mg/dL (8.6–10.2 mg/dL) and phosphorus level was 5.3 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL). Serum ionized calcium measured during the dystonic attack was 0.8 mmol/L (1.16–1.3 mmol/L). Serum ceruloplasmin, peripheral blood film for acanthocytes, and thyroid function were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram revealed prolonged QTc interval. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head revealed calcifications in the bilateral caudate, putamen, thalami [Figure 1], and cerebellum. Subsequently, the intact parathyroid hormone level was 1.56 pg/mL (normal, 15–65 pg/mL) and vitamin D level was 40 ng/mL (11–42 ng/mL). He was managed with acetazolamide and high-dose calcium supplementation, following which the attacks remarkably diminished in duration and frequency at his 1-month follow up.Figure 1:: Non-contrast computed tomography head showing calcification of the bilateral basal ganglia structures and thalamiThis case is noteworthy as it remained a diagnostic dilemma for approximately 10 years. Simple investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head clinched the diagnosis. A multitude of clinical features are reported in hypoparathyroidism such as seizures, tetany, depression, psychosis, and extrapyramidal manifestations.[4,5] However, case reports of hypoparathyroidism presenting as PKD are scarce.[6-9] The involuntary movements are due to low serum calcium levels; hypocalcemia renders the neuronal membrane hyperexcitable and leads to paroxysmal dyskinesia, but why the symptoms are paroxysmal is enigmatic. The symptoms usually respond to high-dose calcium supplementation. In addition, the dystonic movements can occur in the setting of normal serum calcium levels when there are extensive calcium deposits in the basal ganglia. Perfusion abnormalities have been noted in the basal ganglia of patients with PKD. The cause of hypoparathyroidism in this patient is highly likely to be idiopathic; we did not perform any genetic testing due to financial constraints. In conclusion, we report an uncommon but easily treatable secondary cause of PKD. Investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head helped in the diagnosis, and the patient responded well to treatment.

      "title": "Mass Hysteria, Mass Possession",
      "abstract": "Outbreaks of mass hysteria are not uncommon in primitive and modern cultures alike. A group of people will exhibit bizarre behavior, including seizures, tremors, running amok, comatose-like trance or possession states, or other sudden hysterical symptoms with no identifiable medical cause. Western psychiatrists call this Mass Psychogenic Illness. Mass hysteria usually starts with a single individual, and this quickly spreads to others, particularly in close settings such as schools, nunneries, or factories, particularly if individuals are subject to intense anxiety of stress. Sometimes these states are voluntarily elicited in religious or healing ceremonies, with incessant drumming, excitement and suggestibility as one person after another falls into a trance or possession state. Sometimes the outbreak will pertain to a collective fear that is entirely false, for example a collective delusion that there is a poisonous gas in the air-and many people will fall victim to symptoms of toxic poisoning despite the fact that there is nothing in the air. A mass dancing mania emerged following the Black Plague epidemic of the 14th century. People would hop, dance, clap hands and jump about in a frenzy, often naked. How hysteria spreads from the initial case to a group is deeply mysterious. Perhaps hysteria can be contagious much in the same way as a violent mood can spread in a mob and lead to a riot, or there is some sort of decoupling of an individual’s personality in the context of group dynamics.",

The perception that a problem constitutes an emergency is often subjective and sometimes reflects the anxieties of others rather than a real need for urgent treatment. Keeping calm and unhurried in front of an agitated patient might be as important as the use of a neuroleptic. The rather unusual psychopathological phenomena catalepsy and psychogenic twilight state (psychogenic trance) are mentioned in view of their importance for urgent assessment of mental status. The scope of the problem of suicide is outlined as far as the general physician is involved. Special attention is paid to panic disorder and attacks, a relatively new concept in medicine. Since the symptoms mimic those of cardiac, endocrine and convulsive disorders, patients with such symptoms often come to the attention of general physicians and frequently use the services of emergency departments. Early identification and treatment of panic disorder might help to avoid unnecessary repeated emergency department visits, and at the same time reduce the associated high risk of suicide and other psychiatric disorders such as depression as well as drug and alcohol abuse.",

      "title": "Depression in der Rheumatologie",
      "abstract": "Depression is due to a diseased state of a central resonance system controlling our mental and autonomous functions. This regulatory system is essentially involved in communicating with our surroundings. As far as its reactivity is concerned, it can be patterned and programmed with certain behavioural models originating in early childhood. The system is responsible for our feeling tone and can be influenced by both physical disorders and by emotional stress.Depression can result in a fatal spiral depending on the prepatterned tendency to react either more sensitively and vulnerably or more on the aggressive side. Vulnerability is enhanced, the sensitivity to e.g. noise or stress is increased. For example, mothers are apt to be the first persons to complain about the fact that children have become too boisterous, whereas husbands realize that this is symptomatic of a depressive mood.This is followed by a retreat as a kind of protection against enhanced vulnerability, a retreat the relatives fail to understand: ». . . You don't take any interest - you no longer react to what I say; you have ceased to impart stimuli.«After the disturbed approach to aggressivity, the patient shows irritated excitement and enhanced inner tension, inner unrest. This is again interlinked with musculature: the excitement, which has not been sufficiently discharged, leads to muscular tension and eventually to myogeloses and insertion tendopathy.Of course, the human psyche cannot be explained solely by means of chemistry of the brain or by means of amplification systems or any combination of such processes. Hence, depressive and affective disorders cannot be treated on a biochemical basis only. All we can do is to try to understand the subjective side of the patient's experience during his depressive phase, and to help him on the basis of our understanding of this depressive mood. Not only the extent of psychosocial stress and its contribution towards triggering the depression make it mandatory for us to understand the patient's problems; in equal measure, the suffering of the depressed patient who is aware of his condition requires a special approach to his mental disorder. Since depression is made up of physicobiological as well as mental disturbances, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy must always act jointly.With regard to the complex of depression in rheumatology, therefore, attention must be paid to the following interrelations:1. Depression can be produced in many different ways. A depression can be associated with syndromes of pain in the muscular and skeletal system via cerebral nuclearspecific imbalance through the disturbances in nuclear regions regulating muscular tone. Such syndromes appear chiefly as syndromes of the cervical vertebral column and lumbar vertical column and as general »non-specific pain syndromes«.2. Depressive moods may cause manifestation of rheumatic complaints previously latent due to lowering of the pain threshold.3. Conversely, chronic physical diseases or sudden motor impediments (e.g. in acute and chronic rheumatic diseases) may be assumed to produce depression via common afferent structures.4. Masked depression can assume the pattern of a rheumatic pain syndrome and can be treated as such for a long time purely somatically, i.e. non-specifically (Fig. 6).",

      "title": "Overview of Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "Abstract A seizure (also called attack, crisis, turn, fit, breakout, trembling, convulsion, and insult) is usually defined as a sudden alteration of behavior due to a temporary change in the electrical functioning of the brain, in particular the outer layer of the brain called the cortex. Epilepsy means recurrent seizures. Seizures can take many different forms, as the descriptions in this book indicate. However, any given person usually has a limited number of different types of seizures that they experience, and readers should understand that seizures affect different people in different ways. The material in this book points out these differences, but should not be taken to imply that every person with seizures will experience everything described in this book at some time. Sometimes, seizures can be triggered by alcohol, strong emotions, intense exercise, flashing lights or loud music, illness and fever, the menstrual period, lack of sleep, and stress. Often an individual learns to recognize what they may be susceptible to. Sometimes there is no identifiable or consistent trigger. Seizures have a beginning, a middle, and an end. When an individual is aware of the beginning, it may be thought of as a warning. Another word used for the warning is the aura. Auras are actually seizures that affect only a very small part of the brain; enough to cause symptoms, but not enough to disrupt consciousness. Doctors may refer to auras as “simple partial seizures”—“simple” means that consciousness is not impaired, and “partial” means that only part of the brain is involved with the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy and sleep are intimately linked; patients with epilepsy frequently present sleep disorders and alterations in sleep quality and architecture. This, in turn, leads to greater prevalence of psychiatric and cognitive comorbidities and poorer quality of life. Sleep is a physiological process regulated by the circadian rhythm. The sleep–wake cycle occurs as a result of the reciprocal activity of numerous regions and circuits in the brain, via neuromediators. The different stages of sleep also influence the propagation of interictal epileptiform discharges and epileptic seizures. Non-rapid eye movement sleep facilitates their propagation, whereas rapid eye movement sleep suppresses it. This connection is made even more evident by the existence of epileptic syndromes that occur only or mainly during specific stages of the sleep–wake cycle. Antiepileptic drugs also influence this cycle. Better sleep quality may have positive effects on seizure control, and vice versa. New therapeutic targets involve the sleep–wake cycle, with orexin receptor antagonists having been proposed as a potential antiepileptic treatment. However, more research and controlled clinical trials are needed to corroborate these findings. La epilepsia y el sueño están íntimamente relacionados y los pacientes con epilepsia (PCE) presentan con frecuencia trastornos de sueño, alteraciones en la calidad de sueño y de su arquitectura. Todo ello conlleva una mayor prevalencia de comorbilidades psiquiátricas, cognitivas y una peor calidad de vida. El sueño es un proceso fisiológico regulado por el ritmo circadiano. El ciclo sueño/vigilia tiene lugar mediante la actividad recíproca de diversas regiones y circuitos cerebrales a través de neuromediadores. Por otro lado, las distintas fases del sueño influyen en la propagación de descargas epileptiformes intercríticas (DEI) y de crisis epilépticas (CE). El sueño NREM facilita su propagación y el sueño REM la dificulta. Esta conexión se hace todavía más evidente debido a que hay síndromes epilépticos que ocurren sólo o principalmente durante determinadas fases del ciclo sueño/vigilia. Los diferentes tratamientos empleados en epilepsia también influyen en el sueño. Es posible que una mejora en la calidad de sueño tenga repercusiones positivas en el control de las crisis epilépticas y viceversa. se han explorado nuevas dianas terapéuticas implicadas en el ciclo sueño/vigilia proponiendo los antagonistas de la de orexina como potenciales agentes antiepilépticos.

      "title": "Review article on sleep apnea",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder that involves a reduces or complete halt in airflow despite an ongoing effort to breathe. It occurs when the muscles relax during sleep, causing soft tissue in the back of the throat to collapse and block the upper airway. This results in partial reductions (hypopneas) and complete block (apneas) in breathing that lasts a minimum of 10 seconds during sleep. Most pauses last between 10 and 30 seconds, but some may persist for one minute or longer. This can cause abrupt reductions in blood oxygen saturation. The brain responds to the lack of oxygen by alerting the body, causing a brief arousal from sleep that restores normal breathing. This pattern can occur many times in one night. The result is a fragmented quality of sleep that often produces an excessive level of daytime sleepiness. Most people with OSA snore loudly and regullarly, with periods of silence when airflow is reduced or blocked. They then make choking, snorting or gasping sounds when their airway reopens. A common measurement of sleep apnea is the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).",

      "title": "Complications of Allergic Rhinitis",
      "abstract": "With unfortunate high frequency, clinicians consider allergic rhinitis to be more of a nuisance than an illness. When in fact, allergic rhinitis is not only a very common disease process, affecting up to a cumulative frequency of 42% of the U.S. population by age 40, but can lead to significant short-term and long-term medical complications. Poorly controlled symptoms of allergic rhinitis may contribute to sleep loss, secondary daytime fatigue, learning impairment, decreased overall cognitive functioning, decreased long-term productivity and decreased quality of life. Additionally, poorly controlled allergic rhinitis may also contribute to the development of other related disease processes including acute and chronic sinusitis, recurrence of nasal polyps, otitis media/otitis media with effusion, hearing impairment, abnormal craniofacial development, sleep apnea and related complications, aggravation of underlying asthma, and increased propensity to develop asthma. Treatment of allergic rhinitis with sedating antihistamine therapy may result in negative neuropsychiatric effects that contribute to some of these complications. Sedating antihistamines may also be dangerous to use in certain other settings such as driving or operating potentially dangerous machinery. In contrast nonsedating antihistamines have been demonstrated to result in improved performance in allergic rhinitis.",

Compared with normal infants, siblings of the sudden infant death syndrome victims have longer intervals between active sleep epochs at particular times during the night in the newborn period and a decreased tendency to enter short waking periods at 2 and 3 months of age.

      "title": "Visual trails: When perceptual continuity breaks down",
      "abstract": "“Visual trailing” is a transient but dramatic disturbance of visual motion perception of unknown origin: the subject perceives a series of discrete stationary images trailing in the wake of otherwise normally moving objects. Although this phenomenon is most frequently encountered after ingestion of prescription and/or illicit drugs (i.e. Lysergic Acid Diethylamid or LSD), it has also occasionally been reported following brain damage or neurological disorders. Visual trails, because of their discrete and repetitive nature, may represent the perceptual manifestation of an underlying periodic neural process. This periodicity could arise outside of the visual system altogether (e.g. eye movements, motor tremor), or may be the result of faulty motion computation mechanisms (e.g. motion smear suppression), or finally, may point to a more general oscillatory process that affects, among other things, the motion perception system. However, only qualitative case reports exist in the literature, and a quantitative account of visual trails is currently lacking. We report our attempt to collect both qualitative and quantitative data on this phenomenon by means of an online survey. We simulated visual trails in a short movie and varied the interval between successive persisting images of moving objects (10 intervals between 25 and 250 ms); then we instructed past users of LSD (as assessed via a questionnaire) to report which sequence best corresponded to their experience of visual trails. Although the survey is still ongoing, we present results from more than 200 responses. Participants consistently selected a time interval between images of 60 ms on average, corresponding to an underlying periodicity in the 15–20 Hz (beta) range. This is but a preliminary step, and we suggest key experiments that should help identify the oscillatory underpinnings of this rare disturbance, and eventually lead to important insights into how our brains update conscious visual perception in time.",

The hallucinations themselves consist of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, tasting hallucinations, and olfactory hallucinations. Auditory hallucination is a stimulus or stimulus disorder in which the client hears voices that do not exist, especially human voices, usually the client hears the voices of people according to what the client thinks which then orders the client to do something that can sometimes harm oneself, others, and the environment. In the assessment stage, data were obtained showing the client experiencing sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations, which were obtained from the precipitation factor. The client often heard voices without any form when the client was alone. Mr. N has 4 nursing problems including sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations, risk of violent behavior, social isolation and low self-esteem, but the author focuses on one diagnosis, namely the problem of hallucinations. The action taken is to practice conversational therapy with other people to reduce the patient's level of hallucinations. The conclusion of the given action has been reached where the client is able to converse with other people when the client experiences hallucinations.",

      "title": "Nocturnal swallowing augments arousal intensity and arousal tachycardia",
      "abstract": "Cortical arousal from sleep is associated with autonomic activation and acute increases in heart rate. Arousals vary considerably in their frequency, intensity/duration, and physiological effects. Sleep and arousability impact health acutely (daytime cognitive function) and long-term (cardiovascular outcomes). Yet factors that modify the arousal intensity and autonomic activity remain enigmatic. In this study of healthy human adults, we examined whether reflex airway defense mechanisms, specifically swallowing or glottic adduction, influenced cardiac autonomic activity and cortical arousal from sleep. We found, in all subjects, that swallows trigger rapid, robust, and patterned tachycardia conserved across wake, sleep, and arousal states. Tachycardia onset was temporally matched to glottic adduction-the first phase of swallow motor program. Multiple swallows increase the magnitude of tachycardia via temporal summation, and blood pressure increases as a function of the degree of tachycardia. During sleep, swallows were overwhelmingly associated with arousal. Critically, swallows were causally linked to the intense, prolonged cortical arousals and marked tachycardia. Arousal duration and tachycardia increased in parallel as a function of swallow incidence. Our findings suggest that cortical feedback and tachycardia are integrated responses of the swallow motor program. Our work highlights the functional influence of episodic, involuntary airway defense reflexes on sleep and vigilance and cardiovascular function in healthy individuals.",

Two or more attacks could occur in a single night and were most common in the early morning hours. Family and personal histories did not show epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, or (with 1 exception) previous somnambulism. Electrographic investigation revealed that all patients had normal waking‐sleep cycles but that 4 of them had epileptiform abnormalities on their electroencephalograms. All patients were treated with either phenytoin or carbamazepine, with cessation of the abnormal nocturnal behavior during follow‐up periods ranging from 9 to 48 months. This syndrome appears to be distinct from more typical non–rapid eye movement dyssomnias and suggests an atypical form of epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "DEFINITION Ohtahara syndrome (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression bursts), is the earliest developing form of epileptic encephalopathy. ETHIOLOGY It considered to be a result of static structural developing brain damage. CLINICAL PICTURE Variable seizures develop mostly within the first 10 days of life, but may occur during the first hour after delivery. The most frequently observed seizure type are epileptic spasms, which may be either generalized and symmetrical or lateralized. The tonic spasms may occur in clusters or singly, while awake and during sleep alike. The duration of spasms is up to 10 seconds, and the interval between spasms within cluster ranges from 9 to 15 seconds. In one third of cases, other seizure types include partial motor seizures or hemiconvulsions The disorder takes a progressively deteriorating course with increasing frequency of seizures and severe retardation of psychomotor development. DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP In the initial stage of Ohtahara syndrome, interictal EEG shows a pattern of suppression-burst with high-voltage paroxysmal discharges separated by prolonged periods of nearly flat tracing that last for up to 18 seconds. PROGNOSIS AND THREATMENT Half of the reported children having Ohtahara syndrome die in infancy. Anticonvulsant helps little in controlling the seizures and halting the deterioration of psychomotor development. Severe psychomotor retardation is the rule. With time, the disorder may evolve into West syndrome or partial epilepsy. Psychomotor development may be slightly better if the infants do not develop West and later Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Death is usually anticipated. Physiological death resulting from senility and the gradual wearing out of organs and tissues is probably an exceptional occurrence. The end usually comes as a culmination of some disease of whose ravages the clinician and the patient are aware. Sometimes it comes with suddenness as the result of an accident, of the imbibition of a poison, or of a sudden turn for the worse in an already existing disease, and sometimes it comes for no apparent reason. It is the unexpected cases of death to which reference is made in this paper. When one hears of an unexpected death, one's mind usually turns to two, or at most three, of the systems of the body. One thinks first perhaps of the circulatory system, and secondarily of the nervous and respiratory systems, and as a matter of fact, the majority of cases of unexpected death may be referred to one of these. But in the course of autopsy experience one learns that there is a wide range, in lesions of these systems, and that the primary cause of the demise may occasionally originate in other systems and tissues, although the actual termination of life may be due to the effect upon one of the three systems previously mentioned. The cases reported have, with a few exceptions been selected from a series of about 1200 autopsies performed at the Hamilton General Hospital during the past ten years. Many of the more unusual observations have been revealed in autopsies done on cases, which have been the subjects of coroner's investigations, and where little or no previous clinical history was available. No doubt some of the so-called unexpected findings",

Attacks of generalized cataplexy produce complete atonic, areflexic partial or complete paralysis of striated muscles commonly involving the leg muscles resulting in collapse of the knees and falling while milder forms often termed partial cataplexy may manifest by sagging of the face, eyelid, or jaw, dysarthria, blurred vision, drooping of the head, weakness of an arm or leg, buckling at the knees, or simply a momentary sensation of weakness that is imperceptible to observers (Guilleminault, 1976; Aldrich, 1993). The duration of cataplexy is usually a few seconds, although severe episodes can last for several minutes and rarely several hours or days in the case of \"status cata-plecticus\" (Parkes et al., 1974; Guilleminault, 1976; Billiard & Cadilhac, 1985; Aldrich, 1992; 1993).This report concerns a 51 year old man with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis who exhibited daily episodes of partial cataplexy which resolved within 3 weeks after he received treatment with picotesla electromagnetic fields.",

      "abstract": "Sedation of critically ill patients with neurologic or neurosurgical pathology is often a controversial topic, as one of the primary tenants of care of these patients is the capacity to perform repeated neurologic examinations to assess for a change (1). Routine sedation of all intubated patients, for example, is not recommended, as somnolence may be the first indication of a worsening intracranial process. However, there are a number of situations when sedation and analgesia are necessary for either patient safety or comfort. These include patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), who are often agitated and at risk of injury to self or the medical staff caring for them. Many TBI patients are also withdrawing from chronic alcohol and drug use, and this must be factored in to the choice and duration of sedation. Patients who must remain intubated for either neurologic or systemic reasons, and are at risk of selfextubation or show significant anxiety or discomfort while mechanically ventilated, may also require gentle sedation and analgesia. Patients with severe intracranial hypertension may require deep sedation and analgesia or even general anesthesia to control intracranial pressure (ICP) (see also Chapter 5). Similarly, patients with generalized status epilepticus may require general anesthesia to the point of electrographic burst-suppression to control seizure activity (see also Chapter 25).",

      "abstract": "Executive summary:  Frailty is when the body gradually loses its in-built reserve and becomes vulnerable to sudden changes in health triggered by stress or minor illness such as a urinary tract infection.  Frailty increases the risk of unfavourable health outcomes including falls, disability, admission to hospital, need for long-term care, poorer recovery and reduced quality of life compared to those who are not frail.  Prefrailty is an intermediate stage between non-frail and frail, with loss of in-built reserves but the ability to recover after a stressor event.  The prefrail have more than twice the risk of becoming frail compared to those who are non-frail.  Evidence suggests the ‘prefrail’ state may be a window of opportunity for effective interventions.  Potential interventions include physical activity alone or in combination with nutrition and/or brain training.  Evidence for interventions targeting other aspects of frailty such as cognition, social outcomes and psychosocial wellbeing (depression and loneliness) is limited but have been advocated.  The use of Information Communication Technology (ICT)/eHealth in frailty interventions demonstrates potential for self-management, improved health and cost effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "The alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in the hours or days after the cessation of alcohol drinking in an alcohol dependent patient. The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Die REM-Schlafverhaltensstörung (RBD) ist häufig das erste für den Betroffenen lebensbeeinträchtigende Symptom einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass 81%–90% der Patienten mit einer RBD innerhalb von zehn Jahren eine Alpha-Synukleopathie (Morbus Parkinson, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz, Multisystematrophie) entwickeln. Durch das Fehlen der normalerweise auftretenden Suppression der motorischen Aktivität während des REM-Schlafes, kommt es zum Ausagieren von Träumen. Die Diagnosesicherung erfolgt mittels Polysomnografie. Meist tritt die RBD zwischen dem 50. und 60. Lebensjahr erstmals auf. Männer sind wahrscheinlich häufiger betroffen als Frauen. Bei Patienten mit RBD fallen oft schon früh subtile Veränderungen wie Hyposmie, Obstipation oder Veränderungen der Motorik oder Kognition auf, die weitere Zeichen einer beginnenden neurodegenerativen Erkrankung sein können. Das gleichzeitige Auftreten der RBD bei bekannter, neurodegenerativer Erkrankung, ist häufig mit einem schwereren Verlauf verbunden. Neben Bettsicherungsmaßnahmen kommen zur medikamentösen Behandlung am häufigsten Clonazepam oder hochdosiertes Melatonin zum Einsatz. Die RBD stellt als Prodomalstadium einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung einen zentralen Ansatzpunkt für die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuroprotektiven, krankheitsmodulierenden Therapie dar.",

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "abstract": "Sleep/wake disorders are common in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, sometimes the most prominent or sole initial symptom, then delaying diagnosis. Sleep/wake disorders in autoimmune encephalitis vary and include severe sleeplessness, hypersomnia, central and/or obstructive sleep apnea, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, indeterminate sleep/wake states, and loss of circadian sleep/wake rhythms. N-methyl- d aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDAR) is often associated with insomnia, then hypersomnia and sleep-related central hypoventilation. Profound sleeplessness and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are seen in patients with voltage-gated potassium channel-complex antibodies. Fragmented sleep and hypersomnia are common in paraneoplastic syndromes associated with anti-MA protein encephalitis; rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in those with antibodies against leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein (LGI1) or contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2) antibodies. Antibodies against a cell adhesion protein IGLON5 may result in obstructive sleep apnea, inspiratory stridor, disorganized nonrapid eye movement sleep, and excessive movements and parasomnias fragmenting nonrapid and rapid eye movement sleep. Recognizing a particular sleep/wake disorder is often a presenting or prominent feature in certain autoimmune encephalitis permit for earlier diagnosis. This is important because reduced morbidity and better short- and long-term outcomes are associated with earlier diagnosis and immunotherapies.",

      "title": "Anxiety Disorders",
      "abstract": "Anxiety is a common and normal phenomenon, involving multiple brain regions, including the amygdala, locus ceruleus, and frontal cortex. Moreover, multiple brain transmitters regulate the presence and severity of anxiety; these include classical transmitters such as gamma aminobutyric acid, serotonin, and dopamine, as well as neuropeptides, including corticotrophin-releasing hormone, substance P, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin, and vasopressin. Anxiety is highly adaptive, and involves both acute fear that is related to an immediate threat, and anticipatory anxiety that is associated with a possible future threat. Certain individuals seem predisposed to develop anxiety disorders. Predisposing variables include genetic factors (that may function to dispose toward anxious temperament), emotional traumas, and other psychologically mediated factors. Anxiety disorders represent a family of conditions with important distinguishing elements. Panic disorder and phobias involve reactions that are reminiscent of acute fear (albeit often worse). Specific and social phobias involve excessive fearful responses to identifiable things or circumstances in the environment. On the other hand, panic disorder is characterized by acute and intense fear responses that are not associated with a specific environmental cue, although people with this illness may experience aversive conditioning as a result of having spontaneous panic attacks in specific situations. Generalized anxiety disorder is a condition that, essentially, exclusively involves anticipatory fear (i.e., worry). Worries of everyday life are enhanced beyond any normal or adaptive functioning. Obsessive–compulsive disorder subsumes both obsessive ideation and compulsive behaviors. Obsessions are fears or worries that are fixated on unlikely events, and cannot be reduced by normal reassurance. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that typically are in response to an obsession. For example, a person may have a fear of contamination that might lead to a terrible disease in themselves or someone else. This, then, leads to compulsive hand washing that may occur dozens of times per day. Although the person usually recognizes that the fear is excessive, they have difficulty controlling the worry. Finally, acute and posttraumatic stress disorders occur after a catastrophic, usually life-threatening event. People with these conditions experience persistent reexperiencing of the event (including intrusive thoughts or nightmares), avoidance of reminders of the event, and signs of increased arousal, such as difficulty sleeping, hypervigilance, or exaggerated startle response. Although complex, anxiety disorders are treatable conditions that respond to certain medications and specialized forms of psychotherapy.",

Anticipation of these situations is also experienced with uneasiness, distress or fear.

      "abstract": "Back pain in the working age population can coincide with work-related activities and may lead to temporary or permanent work disability in the case of functional impairment that interacts with workplace demands. This can lead to economic if not existential problems for the affected individual. Although neurogenic or inflammatory back pain may be the cause, the big majority of all cases is caused by \"common\" low back pain with or without irradiating pain, the main problem being frequent recurrencies of acute pain episodes (periodic or relapsing course). After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie einerseits im Zusammenhang mit Arbeitstätigkeiten auftreten können, andererseits im Falle der Beeinträchtigung von Körperfunktionen mit den Arbeitsaufgaben interagieren können und so zur vorübergehenden oder andauernden Beeinträchtigung der Arbeitsfähigkeit führen können. Dies kann ökonomische, unter Umständen auch existentielle Probleme zur Folge haben. Obwohl auch neurogene und entzündliche Ursachen in Frage kommen, stellen die „banalen“ Rückenschmerzen mit und ohne Ausstrahlung die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Fälle dar. Ein Hauptproblem stellt sich aufgrund der hohen Rezidivneigung („periodischer Verlauf“). Nach frühzeitigem Ausschluss spezifischer Ursachen („rote Flaggen“: Anamnese und einfaches Labor meist ausreichend!) sind wiederholte Abklärung zu vermeiden. Strukturelle Veränderungen und physische Arbeitsbelastungen als Ursachen dürfen nicht überbewertet werden. Dagegen spielt in der Frühphase eine geeignete Information und Medikation, bei anhaltender Funktionsstörung eine aktive Behandlung (Verläufe über 3 Wochen oder Rezidive) im Vordergrund. Langzeitverläufe haben erhebliche individuelle und sozioökonomische Konsequenzen. Das Chronifizierungsrisiko kann mittels „gelber Flaggen“ und Verlaufscharakteristika erkannt werden. Eine möglichst rasche Rückkehr zu Alltagsaktivitäten ist vordringlich. Bei Risiko für chronische Verläufe und/oder Eingliederungsproblemen sind eine interdisziplinäre arbeitsbezogene Rehabilitation oder sozialberufliche Eingliederung zu forcieren.",

      "title": "Noise-induced sleep disturbances and long-term health risks",
      "abstract": "Undisturbed sleep of sufficient length is essential for daytime alertness and performance, health and wellbeing. According to recent figures published by the WHO, sleep disturbance is one of the most deleterious non-auditory effects of environmental noise. A connection between noise exposure in the residential setting and detrimental effects on sleep and health is suggested by observational, experimental and epidemiological evidence that has been accumulated over the last decades. Maximum sound pressure levels as low as 33 dB have been shown to induce physiological reactions such as autonomic, motor, and cortical arousals (e.g., tachycardia, body movements, awakenings). Whether or not noise will induce such acute effects depends on the number of noise events and their acoustical properties, but also on situational moderators (e.g. momentary sleep stage) and individual noise sensitivity. Although clinical sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) have been shown to be associated with increased risks for cardiovascular diseases, only little is known about long-term effects of noise-disturbed sleep on cardiovascular health. In the past years, several hints have surfaced that undermine the suspicion that nocturnal noise exposure may be more relevant for the genesis of long term effects than daytime noise exposure. The paper reviews the present state of research in the domain of noise-induced sleep disturbances from transportation and other noise sources, compares exposure-effect functions, critically appraises methods for the assessment of noise effects on sleep, and reviews potential mechanisms of the genesis of long term health effects due to noise-induced sleep disturbances.",

They can cause insomnia or hypersomnia (e.g. 'myoclonus nocturnus'), psychosocial stress (e.g. sleep-related enuresis and sleep walking) and injuries to oneself and others (e.g. REM-parasomnia). Finally, they can be symptomatic of neurological and medical disorders (e.g. sleep paralysis and 'myoclonus nocturnus').

      "title": "Sympathetic Overstimulation During Critical Illness: Adverse Effects of Adrenergic Stress",
      "abstract": "The term ‘‘adrenergic’’ originates from ‘‘adrenaline’’ and describes hormones or drugs whose effects are similar to those of epinephrine. Adrenergic stress is mediated by stimulation of adrenergic receptors and activation of post-receptor pathways. Critical illness is a potent stimulus of the sympathetic nervous system. It is undisputable that the adrenergic-driven ‘‘fight-flight response’’ is a physiologically meaningful reaction allowing humans to survive during evolution. However, in critical illness an overshooting stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system may well exceed in time and scope its beneficial effects. Comparable to the overwhelming immune response during sepsis, adrenergic stress in critical illness may get out of control and cause adverse effects. Several organ systems may be affected. The heart seems to be most susceptible to sympathetic overstimulation. Detrimental effects include impaired diastolic function, tachycardia and tachyarrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, stunning, apoptosis and necrosis. Adverse catecholamine effects have been observed in other organs such as the lungs (pulmonary edema, elevated pulmonary arterial pressures), the coagulation (hypercoagulability, thrombus formation), gastrointestinal (hypoperfusion, inhibition of peristalsis), endocrinologic (decreased prolactin, thyroid and growth hormone secretion) and immune systems (immunomodulation, stimulation of bacterial growth), and metabolism (increase in cell energy expenditure, hyperglycemia, catabolism, lipolysis, hyperlactatemia, electrolyte changes), bone marrow (anemia), and skeletal muscles (apoptosis). Potential therapeutic options to reduce excessive adrenergic stress comprise temperature and heart rate control, adequate use of sedative/analgesic drugs, and aiming for reasonable cardiovascular targets, adequate fluid therapy, use of levosimendan, hydrocortisone or supplementary arginine vasopressin.",

      "abstract": "In the early premature, the EEG is mostly discontinuous. Discontinuity becomes limited to quiet sleep periods by the 36th week of conceptional age (CA). Temporal theta bursts, or the \"sawtooth\" pattern, come and go between 27 and 32 weeks' CA. Delta brushes attain their maximum about 32 to 34 weeks' CA and disappear about 40 to 44 weeks' CA. Frontal sharp transients have their peak occurrence at 35 or 36 weeks' CA and are still present at 44 to 48 weeks' CA. The background activity is essentially symmetric but transient patterns are less symmetric and frequently asynchronous. Lack of variability in the record is abnormal after 34 weeks' CA. Responses to isolated light flashes are prominent from very early prematurity through full-term. On the other hand, photic driving is frequent in early prematures (29-32 weeks' CA), but it then declines and is difficult to detect in the full-term neonate. Nonspecific responses to stimulation occur from early prematurity. Sleep--waking cycles are clearly discernible about 37 weeks' CA. Active sleep (rapid eye movement) goes from 60% at 34 weeks' CA to the 25% of adulthood at about 8 months of age. The EEG of the full-term newborn has four patterns, corresponding to three states: the low voltage irregular for wakefulness, high voltage slow and tracé alternant for quiet sleep, and the mixed for either wakefulness or active sleep.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep breathing disorders (SBDs) are characterized by recurrent episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) or hypopnea (reduced breathing) during sleep, arising from overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms. Central sleep apnea is not a singular disorder but can occur independently or as part of other clinical syndromes. It is primarily caused by a transient loss of output from the pontomedullary pacemaker, affecting respiratory muscles such as the diaphragm, thorax, and abdomen. Various pathophysiological classifications exist, including high loop gain associated with conditions like heart failure, and rhythm generation failure due to brainstem disorders. Among the latter, Chiari malformation is well-documented, though data are limited. The exact mechanism remains unclear, but it is hypothesized that central apneas may result from dysfunction of the respiratory center due to medulla oblongata compression or vascular compression causing ischemia. Brainstem compression may also affect the reticular activating system, and compression or stretching of the glossopharyngeal nerve could impair afferent input from the carotid bodies, affecting the chemoreflex. Damaged chemoreceptors may reduce responsiveness to CO2, leading to central apneas. Methods Case presentation Results We present a case of a 40-year-old male with predominantly central sleep apnea, evaluated for Chiari malformation. MRI revealed a 3mm tonsillar herniation, which did not meet the criteria for Chiari malformation Type I but suggests a potential cause for the central sleep apnea. Conclusion This case highlights the need for further investigation into the pathophysiology of central sleep apnea, particularly regarding the severity of anatomical brainstem disorders that might trigger such apneas.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

The duration of loss of consciousness is usually 20–30 seconds, after which the person regains consciousness on his own. After fainting, there may be a feeling of general weakness, feelings of weakness, fatigue, and the occurrence of retrograde amnesia is characteristic for older people.

Defining disordered sleep behaviour is difficult because of important differences in sleep patterns at different developmental stages. The sudden onset of a sleep disorder or problem can be due to physical, mental and/or environmental factors. Objectives To present the case of a young boy admitted to the emergency department of the Pediatric Hospital of Coimbra due to a sudden inability to sleep. Results A 6-year-old boy with previous language delay and undergoing regular psychotherapy due to family distress issues presented with inability to sleep for more than 10–15 minutes. The disturbances started 2 weeks prior to presentation and occurred more than 10 times per night. Immediately after each event the patient was screaming, frightened, unable to communicate normally with his mother. Since the beginning of the episodes the patient's social performance had declined, he was easily irritated, aggressive and with dysphoric mood. The patient was admitted and evaluated by child psychiatry in the emergency department. An extensive psychiatric evaluation revealed familyrelated stressors, depression and anxiety symptoms. An electroencephalogram was performed which revealed frontal lobe epilepsy. After the diagnosis treatment sodium valproate was started (30mg/kg/day). The symptoms reversed. Conclusions This case highlights how psychiatric manifestations or comorbidity may interfere in the understanding of clinical manifestations of sleep disorders in children.

      "abstract": "Disease, intoxications and injuries cause subjective phenomena of hearing that shed much light on the mechanism of hearing, and on the causes of deafness. Paralysis of the tensor tympani muscle arising from injury to the fifth cranial nerve causes dysakusia for low frequencies—a condition in which high intensities produce discomfort or actual pain. Hyperacousis, or increased acuteness of hearing, in which the loudness of sound is accentuated, follows injuries to the facial nerve paralyzing the stapedius muscle. Affections of these middle ear muscles by myasthenia gravis, or other diseases which give rise to muscular fibrillations, cause roaring, “boiler factory” tinnitus. In the absence of the ear drum, high intensities of low frequencies cause vertigo and falling. These phenomena parallel in many respects animal experimental findings such as those reported by Drs. Wever and Bray; and indicate that the middle ear mechanism serves primarily as a sound impedance that protects the inner ear, rather than as a specialized sound conductor. Tinnitus of inner ear origin may be caused either by anemia, congestion, allergy or spasm of blood vessels. Intoxication by quinine, aspirin and other salicylates, and ergot are among the most frequent causes of these types of tinnitus and deafness. They act by causing spasm of the blood vessels. The incidence of progressive deafness could be considerably reduced by restriction of these drugs. Increased pressure of the perilymph on the inner ear gives rise to tinnitus which is readily cleared up by spinal tap and by medical therapy designed to keep the pressure down. Hallucinations of hearing often characterize disease of the brain involving the central nervous mechanism of hearing.",

Where rheumatic complaints are prominent such a constellation of disturbed sleep physiology and symptoms also characterizes the fibromyalgia disorder. In contrast to the chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia is associated with a variety of initiating or perpetuating factors such as psychologically distressing events, primary sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder) and inflammatory rheumatic disease, as well as an acute febrile illness. The chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia have similar disordered sleep physiology, namely an alpha rhythm disturbance (7.5–11 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that accompanies increased nocturnal vigilance and light, unrefreshing sleep. Aspects of cytokine and cellular immune functions are shown to be related to the sleep-wake system. The evidence suggests a reciprocal relationship of the immune and sleep-wake systems. Interference either with the immune system (e.g. by a viral agent or by cytokines such as α-interferon or interleukin 2) or with the sleeping-waking brain system (e.g. by sleep deprivation) has effects on the other system and will be accompanied by the symptoms of the chronic fatigue syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have soft signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

Ictal aspects include the specific part of the brain from which the seizure originates, the loss of integration of incoming sensorial stimuli with motor-emotional output, the loss of higher control associated with a reversion to primitive automatic behaviour and the emergence of repressed feelings and aggressive instincts.

A 17-year-old boy, educated up to 9th std, living with parents and younger sibling, was brought to the psychiatry outpatient department with complaints of irritability, aggressive behavior, easy distractibility, restlessness, impulsive behavior, inappropriate social behavior, and wandering tendency since 1.5 years. The patient was apparently alright 1.5 years back when he met with a road traffic accident (RTA), sustained closed head injury, and had right ear bleed, following which he had loss of consciousness for 18 days requiring ventilatory support. On regaining consciousness, the patient had memory loss for events a few days prior and multiple days after the RTA, irritability, anger outbursts, impulsivity, abusive behavior, overfamiliarity, jocularity, wandering behavior, disinhibition, and distractibility. He had unprovoked bouts of aggression and would start abusing those around him. He could not sit still for any task and would leave conversations midway, focusing his attention on some other activity. When he got unmanageable at home, he was shown to a psychiatrist a month after the accident and he was prescribed: tablet risperidone 3 mg + tablet trihexyphenidyl 2 mg, tablet olanzapine 5mg BD, and valproate 250 mg BD. The treatment was partially effective in treating his mood and behavioral changes, but symptoms still persisted. There is no significant past medical history, no family history of any psychiatric illness, and no history of substance use. His general physical and systemic examinations were within normal limits. On central nervous system examination, anosmia was present, grip was reduced in the left hand, dysdiadokokinesia showed frequent sequencing errors, and gait was suggestive of frontal ataxia. On the Frontal lobe assessment patient score was: 5/18 (normal score of 15); motor functions: grip strength was reduced on the left side; fine motor speed was reduced in the left hand with errors; premotor functions: sensorimotor integration was slower in the left hand; dorsolateral/ executive functions: complex and directed attention was normal; multiple response alternatives: open set F, A, S beginning words – very poor, behavioral inflexibility: Luria's bilateral hand movements – negative; Wisconsin card sorting test was abnormal; orbital/inhibitory functions: behavioral disinhibition – go no go test was abnormal, Stroop test was abnormal; anosmia was present; abnormal behavior during testing: poor/no insight into deficits, inappropriate social behavior, perseveration present, easily agitated, and hyperactive. From the above tests, we concluded that the patient had loss of executive functions along with disinhibition which is seen in frontal lobe syndrome (dysexecutive syndrome). Mental status examination revealed overfamiliarity, jocularity, and disinhibited behavior. Speech was spontaneous with increased rate, monotonous, nasal voice, unclear words and increased reaction time. His mood was irritable and labile. Delusions/ obsessions/ suicidal ideas were absent. X ray skull showed multiple frontal bone fractures. CT scan of brain showed bilateral frontal bone fractures, orbital and maxillary injuries along with extensive edema. With the diagnosis of frontal lobe syndrome, he was treated with tablet olanzapine 5 mg BD and tablet valproate 500 mg BD. Our case report demonstrates the drastic change in behavior and personality in a patient with traumatic brain injury causing damage to the frontal lobe. He was an above-average student prior to the RTA but could not function normally since then and was unmanageable at home with frequent bouts of unprovoked aggression. He also required supervision to carry out daily activities. Frontal lobe is responsible for higher mental functions including executive functions, voluntary movement, and language and is prone to injury due to its placement. It is also considered the behavior and emotion control center and home to our personality, injury to which can lead to serious consequences. Frontal lobe damage can have devastating consequences on the patient as well as the relatives. Psychotropic medications can be used to an extent to control the behavioral disturbance and rehabilitation could be useful for support, although prognosis is poor for such patients.

      "abstract": "Physical symptoms with no medical explanation are commonly experienced by healthy people and those attending clinics. Psychiatrists see such patients in liaison settings and clinics for those with psychotic and affective disorders. The pathophysiology remains obscure; physical investigations are usually performed to exclude pathology rather than elucidate dysfunction. However, modern neuroimaging has allowed the study of nervous system structure and function. Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival). Psychiatric syndromes that have an impact on bodily awareness signal dysfunction within systems representing that body and its performance in time and space.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: A transient occurrence of signs and symptoms brought on by excessive abnormal neuronal or synchronous activity in the brain is known as an epileptic seizure. By way of onset, seizures can be classified as focal, generalized, unknown, or unclassifiable. An underlying structural abnormality can cause focal seizures in the brain. Among these, the temporal lobe is the most prevalent, but there may be alterations in the frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes. The objective of this case report is to contribute to the knowledge of the multiple symptoms of patients with parietal lobe seizures. Case Report: The report is about parietal aura, diagnosed in the patient J.F.R., a 45-year-old male, and reported his first seizure in 2017. The patient said the increasing onset of the condition leads to significant body image disorders (the representation of the child during eye contact is similar to that of a monster). A limb or a body side may also appear heavier, more significant, absent, or separate from the rest of the body. The postictal period was slow, and full consciousness and correct body image emerged insidiously. Conclusion: In the evaluation, it is essential to value not only the main complaint but also the entire psychic context, cognitive function, and interpersonal and social relationships since these aspects can affect the quality of life of these patients and their integration into the social environment.",

      "abstract": "Depression is the most common and most serious mental health problem affecting all age groups, genders, communities throughout the world. It is increasing very rapidly day by day. It is characterised by persistent sadness, and a loss of interest in daily activities that a person normally enjoys, accompanied by an inability to carry out daily activities for at least two weeks. In addition, there may be a loss of energy, a change in appetite, changes in sleeping pattern, anxiety, reduced concentration, indecisiveness, restlessness, feeling of worthlessness, guilt, hopelessness, thoughts of self-harm and committing suicide. According to WHO report, prevalence of depression is about 5% in general population. Currently more than 300 million people are suffering worldwide from it. It is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents suffering from depression. In Unani perspective, depression is not a disease rather it is a symptom or a group of symptoms of Malenkholiya (Melancholia) in which the mental functions of the individual are disturbed leading to constant grief, fear and uncertain aggression. The patient finds himself/herself isolated and occupied, feels lonely and some patients experience delusion and hallucinations. There is also a change in feelings, mood and behaviour of patient. At times patient becomes overanxious and his thoughts and thinking process gets disturbed. Person suffering from Malenkholiya becomes easily irritable, prefers loneliness and is fearful of usual things. There are a number of factors responsible for depression but Unani scholars consider Ghair Tabayi Sauda (Abnormal black bile) as the main cause of psychological and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, etc. There are different regimens in Unani System of Medicine (USM) for correction of psychiatric disorders (depression) such as Ilaj-bil-Ghiza (dietotharapy), Ilaj bit tadabeer (regimenal therapy), Ilaj-bil-Dawa (pharmacotherapy or medicinal therapy).",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is suggested that psychotherapeutic treatment during pregnancy can help a disturbed woman achieve better integration of internal resources and self-representations, thereby preventing postnatal maternal distress. The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

      "title": "First seizure definitions and worldwide incidence and mortality",
      "abstract": "Summary While all patients with epilepsy experience seizures, not all individuals with seizures have epilepsy. Seizures may be acute symptomatic or unprovoked. Acute symptomatic seizures are seizures occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Unprovoked seizures are seizures occurring in the absence of precipitating factors and may be caused by a static injury (remote symptomatic seizures) or a progressing injury (progressive symptomatic seizures). Unprovoked seizures may be single or recurrent (epilepsy). The incidence of acute symptomatic seizures is 29–39 per 100,000 per year. These predominate in men, in the youngest age class, and in the elderly. Traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, drug withdrawal, infarction, and metabolic insults are the commonest causes. The incidence of single unprovoked seizures is 23–61 per 100,000 person‐years. As with epilepsy, single unprovoked seizures predominate in men and in patients less than 12 months and older than 65 years. Studies on the mortality of acute symptomatic seizures are lacking. A standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 2.3 has been reported in patients experiencing a single unprovoked seizure. The SMR in patients with a newly diagnosed unprovoked seizure ranges from 2.5 to 4.1 according to the study population and design. The SMR is highest in the youngest patients and in those with symptomatic seizures.",

This condition is caused by a coma (anesthesia), and sometimes the individual remains in this state for several years. Although the person looks awake, his/her eyes are open and has some involuntary movements, there is no signs of mental and cognitive function. Moreover, the individual is physically in a state of dementia. Coma is a state in which a person cannot be awakened and does not respond to any stimulation including pain. Generally it lasts few days to a few weeks, after which some patients gradually recover, but some permanently lose all brain function (brain death), while others evolve to a vegetative state (VS). Patients in VS are unconscious and unaware of their surroundings, but they continue to have a sleep-wake cycle and can have periods of consciousness. They are able to breathe spontaneously, retain their gag, cough, sucking, and swallowing reflexes. They often look fairly “normal” to families and friends who hope and pray for their full recovery. Laws and regulations in Islamic countries originate from popular jurisprudence. Therefore, by arguing that the well-known principles of Islam are necessarily legitimate, the phenomenon of vegetative state has been recognized. Jurisprudents have conflicting opinions on brain deaths and these perspectives cannot be considered as a widespread legal basis at the level of macro policy for administrative, medical and judicial affairs. In criminal law, maniac has no criminal responsibility because the punishment is not in line with the purpose of punishment. Consequently, restrictions will be imposed on the patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that a person with vegetative state is compatible with the insanity.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Hallucinations, sensory perceptions without environmental stimuli, occur as simple experiences of auditory, gustatory, olfactory, tactile, or visual phenomena as well as mixed or complex experiences of more than one simple phenomenon. The nature of the hallucination assists localization, differential diagnosis, and treatment planning. In particular, the presence of persistent visual hallucinations of persons with Parkinson's disease predicts dementia, rapid deterioration, permanent nursing home placement, and death. Hallucinations in persons with Alzheimer's disease are often associated with serious behavioral problems and predict a rapid cognitive decline. Theories of the etiology of hallucinations include (1) stimulation, e.g., neurochemical, electrical, seizure, and ephaptic, and (2) inhibition, e.g., destruction of normally inhibitory functions, resulting in disinhibition as in the Charles Bonnet and phantom limb syndromes. Functional neuroimaging procedures suggest anatomical associations for hallucinations. While hallucinations may be a symptom of medical, neurologic, and psychiatric disorders, they may also occur in a wide range of human experiences.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) dominate the clinical picture, the nonmotor complaints are often more disabling for the Parkinson patient. REVIEW SUMMARY Behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive changes occur commonly and are frequent causes for concern. Depression affects up to half of Parkinson patients and can worsen their motor function. Drug-induced psychoses can range from benign visual hallucinations to paranoid delusions. Dementia, classically described as subcortical, usually occurs in the elderly PD patient and is often clinically distinct from the cortical dementia of Alzheimer's disease although pathological descriptions overlap. A parkinsonian personality has been noted by psychoanalysts and movement disorder experts characterized as rigid and compulsive yet cautious and apprehensive with a subordinate behavior. Sleep disturbances associated with PD include insomnia, sleep fragmentation, daytime somnolence, vivid dreams, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Sensory symptoms, including pain, may occur, as do symptoms of autonomic dysfunction including postural syncope. Problems with bladder and bowel control and sexual dysfunction are common and often distressing to both the patients and their partners. Fatigue, akathisia, seborrheic dermatitis, and scoliosis are conditions intrinsic to or aggravated by PD. Most of these problems are amenable to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. CONCLUSION Helping patients with PD cope with these difficulties is just as important as manipulating therapy to provide control of their motor symptoms. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:18-27, 2000)",

      "abstract": "Focal epileptic activity (FEA) in amygdalohippocampal complexes (AHC) is mostly highly intensive (except in patient BUK where it is nearly missing). Unilateral FEA is hardly ever propagated to the superficial EEG electrodes, bilateral FEA only very rarely (patients BRY and DUS), in some patients solely in deep synchronous sleep (patient LOB). FEA intensity rises in relaxed vigilance and in superficial sleep while tending to decrease in deep synchronous sleep. FEA intensity tends to drop or even disappear in active vigilance during mental activity or paradoxical sleep. Epileptic activity generalized in all the superficial and deep-implanted leads is mostly accompanied by clinical manifestations (absences, twitching, motor automatisms), or to put it the other way round: if a clinical paroxysms is in progress, there is evidence of generalized epileptic activity in all the leads. The time parameter is of no consequence, the inconspicuous motion of the hand is due to a second-lasting discharge of polyspike and wave (patient BRY in sleep). If prolonged discharges remain localized there is subclinical paroxysm (patient IRL). Similar findings were reported by Lieb et al. (1976). All we can add is that the start of an attack depends not only on the amplitude and frequency of the spikes but also on the regularity of spike intervals. Superficial \"neocortical\" EEG and deep \"paleocortical\" SEEG exhibit equal sleep stages equally, i.e. either there is synchronization in all the leads (like in synchronous sleep), or there is desynchronization (such as in active vigilance or in paradoxical sleep); those two cortical structures are not antithetical such as in, e.g., rats or cats. The sleep stages show quantitative as well as qualitative changes. There is increasingly more wakefulness and superficial sleep at the expense of spindle and paradoxical sleep. EEG graphoelements often show little differentiation, e.g. the sleep spindles are short and irregular in shape, delta activity is low in amplitude and also irregular in shape, and paradoxical sleep shows insufficient desynchronization in EEG and preserved tonic muscular activity. Epileptic activity variability is often found helpful for the reliable identification of the sleep stage concerned.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "The effects of prolonged endurance exercise on the neurological system in horses",
      "abstract": "Horses compete routinely in endurance-type activities. Many of the various pathophysiological mechanisms which arise during endurance exercise have implications for the health and function of the neurological system. The development of centrally-mediated fatigue is a normal homeostatic physiological event with several possible mechanisms. Development of pathophysiological phenomena such as cerebral oedema may be near-terminal events during or after endurance exhaustion. Cellular damage resulting in cytotoxic cerebral oedema may result from decreases in circulating blood volume (dehydration), blood pressure, oxygen, and glucose, or increases in brain temperature. Vasogenic cerebral oedema arises from changes in cerebral vascular perfusion, tone, and permeability. Increased vascular permeability results from increased brain temperature, poor vascular integrity due to severe dehydration, disseminated intravascular coagulation due to hemoconcentration or endotoxemia, and iatrogenic overhydration during therapy. Clinical signs of intracranial disease after endurance exercise include staggering, shaking, ataxia, paresis, poor tongue tone, facial twitching, collapse, recumbency, seizures, and death. Treatment should include active and aggressive cooling, intravenous polyionic fluids, acid-base imbalance correction, intravenous glucose and calcium supplementation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents once the patient is better hydrated, intra-nasal oxygen therapy if practicable, and achievement of a non-dependent head posture to prevent jugular venous hypertension and further increases in intracranial pressure. The prognosis for central fatigue is good with appropriate supportive care, but the prognosis for successful treatment of cerebral oedema must be considered guarded at best. Prevention is critical and must be through incorporation of mandatory rest stops with sufficient length and veterinary monitoring to allow prevention and detection of exhaustion, excessive dehydration, and neurological signs. Management flexibility in shortening or postponing rides in hot and humid conditions, mandated use of aggressive cooling techniques, and more restrictive entry criteria for upper level Fédération Equestre Internationale races should all be considered as viable options for optimising the safety of endurance horses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Central sleep apnea (CSA) syndrome is defined when five or more central apneas and/or hypopneas are present per hour of sleep, more than 50% of all respiratory events. CSA usually occur during NREM stage and rarely during REM. CSA is important to recognize because of complications ranging from frequent nighttime awakenings,sleepiness to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We present a 40 year old female patient with rare CSA during REM sleep and dream enactment. Report of Case 40yo African American female with history of loud snoring, witnessed sleep apnea, and daytime fatigue. She reported nightmares, sleep talking, and acting out her dreams without injury. Epworth sleepiness score was 5 /24. Her past medical history is significant for depression and anxiety. She has no history of head trauma, no neurologic or cardiovascular disorders. Her medications include fluoxetine and,quetiapine. She denied substance use, narcotic use, or alcohol use. Her level 1 sleep study showed predominantly REM-associated central sleep apneas which is rare. She also was observed to have loss of REM sleep muscle atonia suggestive of REM Behavior disorder. Her sleep architecture was atypical with decreased N3 sleep stage. REM sleep duration was adequate. She was noted to have loss of REM muscle atonia based on AASM guidelins elevated chin EMG, excessive transient muscle activity, and witnessed movement during REM stage via video monitoring. During the study, she had an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 13.1 per hour of sleep, Central apneas were predominantly noted during REM stage, 10 per hour, comprised of 50% of her respiratory events. The minimum SpO2 value with CSA was 94%. She had normal sinus rhythm. Her sleep was fragmented. A total arousals were 28.4/hour,and 7.9/hour were respiratory arousals, and the rest were spontaneous arousals. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 to 60 %. Her room air arterial blood gas was normal with PaC02 of 37 mmHg. MRI of the brain/brainstem was ordered given her atypical REM sleep. She had no acute intracranial abnormalities. There is a non specific finding of a low lying cerebellar tonsils without evidence of Chiari I malformation. Conclusion Our patient has rare idiopathic central apnea in REM stage and is third case reported. She also has loss of muscle atonia during REM with dream enactment which is also rare in her age group. Injury precaution advised.",

      "abstract": "Sensory perception disorder is a condition that occurs in a person who experiences changes in the shape and number of stimuli that come from outside, resulting in a sensory perception disorder: hallucinations. One of the sensory perception disorders is auditory hallucinations, where the patient will experience changes in perception and often hear false or unreal whispers and have no form. The purpose of writing this scientific paper is to describe the management of sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations with severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms at Wisma Drupad RSJ Prof. Dr. Soerojo Magelang. This type of research uses a descriptive method with the approach used, namely the nursing care approach including nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions, nursing implementation and nursing evaluations. The data obtained from the perception assessment that the patient said he heard a whisper, usually appeared when the patient was alone or doing activities. The patient is confused, daydreaming, pacing, the patient is disturbed and uncomfortable with whispering sounds. Whispers are not clear but real audible. Whispers were frequent and countless. So that a nursing diagnosis of Daignosis disorder was established which was enforced by sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations. The interventions arranged were teaching SP 1 how to rebuke hallucinations, SP 2 with 5 correctly taking medication, SP 3 controlling hallucinations by talking and SP 4 controlling hallucinations by doing favorite activities or positive activities. Furthermore, the implementation of SP1, SP2 and SP3 and an evaluation is carried out at the end of management. Based on the results of nursing management, it can be concluded that the problem of sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations is partially resolved by reducing the frequency of hallucinations.&#x0D; &#x0D; ABSTRAK&#x0D; Gangguan persepsi sensori adalah suatu keadaan yang terjadi dalam diri seseorang yang mengalami perubahan bentuk dan jumlah rangsangan yang datang dari luar sehingga mengakibatkan terjadinya gangguan persepsi sensori: halusinasi.

Diperoleh data dari pengkajian persepsi bahwa pasien mengatakan mendengar suara bisikan, biasanya muncul saat pasien sedang sendiri atau beraktifitas. Pasien bingung, melamun, mondar-mandir, pasien terganggu dan tidak nyaman dengan suara bisikan. Suara bisikan tidak jelas tapi nyata terdengar. Suara bisikan sering muncul dan tidak terhitung. Sehingga ditegakkan diagnosis keperawatan gangguan Diagnosis yang ditegakkan gangguan persepsi sensori: halusinasi pendengaran. Intervensi yang disusun yaitu ajarkan SP 1 cara menghardik halusinasi, SP 2 dengan 5benar minum obat, SP 3 kontrol halusinasi dengan bercakap-cakap dan SP 4 kontrol halusinasi dengan melakukan kegiatan yang disukai atau kegiatan positif. Selanjutnya implementasi dari SP1, SP2 dan SP3 dan dilakukan evaluasi di akhir pengelolaan. Berdasarkan dari hasil pengelolaan keperawatan, maka dapat disimpulkan masalah gangguan persepsi sensori: halusinasi pendengaran teratasi sebagian dengan berkurangnya frekuensi munculnya halusinasi.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Summary The incidence of casualties in an institution for mentally retarded children is shown to be about three times as great as in the normal Danish child population. The circumstances concerned are analysed by means of a retrospective investigation to elucidate the mechanisms involved and the contributory factors. The investigation reveals that there is a definite relationship between the degree of mental handicap and the underlying disease (e.g. epilepsy and/or cerebral paresis, mon‐golism etc.) and the incidence of casualties. Other types of incapacity such as motor handicap, anaesthesia, defective sight or hearing and other physical disease (e.g. hydrocephalus) may predispose to accidents. Some children are undoubtedly more accident‐prone than others and the cause may be found in their disease (most frequently epilepsy) while, in others, purposeless motor activity and the inability to learn from experience combined with severe or profound mental retardation appear to be responsible. Phases of accident‐proneness may be associated with the acquiring of new skills. Some prophylactic measures are suggested which should be considered when new institutions are planned. A broad spectrum of somatic, developmental, handicap, environmental, emotional and mental factors interplay in the production of accidents in mentally retarded patients. Attempts should be made to analyse the mechanism of every accident so that appropriate prophylactic measures can be undertaken.",

      "title": "Psychosocial outcome after stroke and traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "The research in this dissertation focuses on the psychosocial consequences of stroke and traumatic brain injury. Psychosocial consequences are reduced thinking functions such as concentration and memory problems, emotional consequences such as anxiety and gloominess and reduced participation in society. Participation includes, for example, participation in activities such as work, housework, sports and social contacts.The results of the study show that a large proportion of people living at home recover well from brain injury, but some do not. For example, people are afraid of a new stroke or are unable to resume work because they have concentration problems. Because the psychosocial consequences for the outside world are not always visible, more structural attention is needed. Low-threshold aftercare by nurses provides this essential attention to psychosocial problems: people feel reassured. Moreover, this is a relatively inexpensive form of care for people living at home with brain damage.",

      "abstract": "Sleep neuroscience is a rapidly expanding discipline. The many functions of sleep are still being characterized, and it is clear that sleep is not a passive state but a dynamic condition during which memories are consolidated, restorative hormones are released, and neuronal excitability is modulated.1 Many clinical syndromes of sleep are intertwined with neurologic disorders. The REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with parkinsonian syndromes and other neurodegenerative disorders. Restless legs syndrome occurs with myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThe syndrome of sleep apnea interacts with neurologic disorders in several ways. 1) Many patients with neurologic disorders have coexisting sleep apnea simply because obstructive sleep apnea is so common. In one study, 2% to 4% of working adults had obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), defined as greater than five apneas or hypopneas per hour in association with daytime somnolence.2 2) Neurologic diseases …",

The specific sounds reported during episodes of exploding head syndrome are quite variable and can include perceptions of fireworks, lightening cracks, or nondescript screaming. Visual experiences (e.g., light flashes) may also be involved. A variety of etiological theories exist for exploding head syndrome, but the most popular of these implicates abnormal surges of neuronal activity within the brainstem during sleep-wake transitions—surges which then are perceived as the loud and startling sounds. Although episodes are more common than initially thought and can have important clinical impacts on sufferers, exploding head syndrome is still a relatively unknown disorder. Further, its characteristic symptoms have also been incorporated into several current conspiracy theories, of which many clinicians may be unaware.",

Une altération de la continuité du sommeil et des anomalies de son architecture ont été objectivées dans cette affection. Une diminution de l'efficacité du sommeil, une augmentation du nombre d'éveils, une diminution du sommeil lent profond et surtout une activité alpha anormale en sommeil lent profond (activité alphadelta) seraient caractéristiques bien que non spécifiques de cette affection. Ces données ont de plus éte confirmées par l'analyse spectrale de l'activité EEG au cours du sommeil en retrouvant une augmentation de la puissance des bandes à hautes fréquences ainsi qu'une diminution de celle à basses fréquences. La présence d'une activité alpha-delta, de micro-éveils et de complexes K-alpha, témoins d'une fragmentation du sommeil, correspondent à une possible intrusion de l'éveil dans le sommeil et peuvent ainsi contribuer à l'altération de la fonction restauratrice du sommeil et ainsi expliquer en partie la symptomatologie diurne de ces patients. Toutefois ces activités alpha anormales ne sont pas spécifiques et sont observées chez des sujets sains privés de sommeil lent profond. Cette fragmentation anormale du sommeil n'est pas à mettre en rapport avec un trouble primaire du sommeil comme le syndrome d'apnées du sommeil et le syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs, bien que ces dermières conditions sont souvent concomitantes. La pathogénie de la fibromyalgie demeure toujours incertaine. Toutefois l'altération du métabolisme de certaines substances dont la sérotonine, la mélatonine et l'hormone de croissance a pu être objectivée. Cette affection est fréquente et apparaît multifactorielle malgré l'existence d'un débat sur les causes de la fibromyalgie, l'implication de facteurs psychologiques (anxiété), environnementaux, génétiques, neurochimiques et de leurs impacts sur la qualité du sommeil. Enfin, il est probable que ceux-ci interviennent à diffèrents niveaux dans la genèse des symptômes de la fibromyalgie.",

      "title": "Typical Absence Seizure Similarity to “Shokhous” in Iranian Traditional Medicine",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nIn allopathic medicine, absence seizure is a kind of generalized seizure characterized by sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural control (1, 2). Typical absence only lasts for a few seconds and consciousness returns suddenly as it was lost, without postictal confusion (3).\r\n\r\n“Shokhous” or “Jomoud” in Iranian traditional medicine is a disease in which patients suddenly lose their sensations and movements and they look as if they are slept. The patients keep their posture and their eyes open or close the same as before attack, but usually are open and fixed.\r\n\r\nIf you talk to them, they do not understand or respond. Feeding or awakening them is impossible even by force. These attacks occur in a short time (4). According to the Avicenna, sensations completely vanish, but movements remain, because patients can breathe normally (5).\r\n\r\nIn Iranian traditional medicine, “Shokhous” is not classified as a kind of seizure but as a sleep disorder (4).\r\n\r\n“Shokhous” signs are similar to signs of typical absence seizure, therefore, they might be the same disease; however, in absence seizure diagnosis, EEG is an important criterion (2, 6), and there was not EEG in ancient age.\r\n\r\nIn most traditional medicine references, “Shokhous” is caused by a “soddeh” (meaning obstruction), in the posterior ventricle placed in the back part of brain. The substance known as “soda” (black bile) leads to this obstruction (4).\r\n\r\nAccording to Iranian traditional medicine, there are 4 basic qualities in body elements: warmth, coldness, moisture, and dryness (5).\r\n\r\nThe body is composed of 4 humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and its health is based on the right proportion and specific balance of humors according to their quality and quantity. Each of them is similar to one of the 4 elements (air, water, fire, and earth) in the temperament and its activity. The black bile is similar to earth element and has some characteristics like stability, rigidity, and hardness. Black bile is divided into two categories: normal black bile and abnormal black bile. Any decrease of normal black bile in the body leads to rise in abnormal black bile, which causes a disorder (7, 8).\r\n\r\nIn “Shokhous,” abnormal black bile rises in the brain and causes higher than normal dryness and coldness (4).\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis of “Shokhous” in Iranian traditional medicine comprises the following diseases:\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sar” (tonic-clonic seizure): The attack of “Sar” causes patients to squirm and produce convulsive movements; but “Shokhous” does not cause movement, on the contrary, it stops body movements for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sobat” (stupor): In “Sobat,” eyes are closed, it does not start and finish suddenly. The patient takes time to return to its normal state, and we can force the patient to understand or talk during “Sobat.” On the contrary, in “Shokhous” eyes are often open, it starts and finishes abruptly, it lasts a short time and if you talk to them, they do not understand or answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sadare khaderi” (orthostatic hypotension): Dizziness unlike “Shokhous” is the main symptom of this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sekte” (stroke): Unlike “Shokhous,” force-feeding is possible in “Sekte.” \r\n\r\n\r\n“Sarsame bared” (a kind of meningitis): Patients can move eyes, close eyelids, change the posture, even speak a little, and there is fever in this disease but none of these signs and symptoms are reported in the “Shokhous” attack (4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nIn the allopathic medicine, valproic acid, ethosuxsimide, and lamotrigine are the drugs of choice to control absence seizures (9, 10).\r\n\r\nIn Iranian traditional medicine, treatment is divided into two parts: prevention and therapy. Prevention consists of not eating some foods like eggplant, marinades, mushroom, and cabbage which produce more “soda” in the patient’s body.\r\n\r\nTherapy comprises enema with herbals such as “aftymoun” (Cuscuta epithymum), “basfayej” (Polypodium vulgare), “halile” (Terminalia chebula), and “ghariqoun” (Polyporus officinalis). According to the Iranian traditional medicine, these plants are used because of their special ability to extract “soda.” Also enema is more useful to cleanup brain but this treatment is helpful when body is strong enough. If energy is insufficient, enema with “Mae nokhale” (water bran), “varaghe salgh” (beet leaf), and dissolved oil, something like “booragh” (a kind of mineral), and “shahme hanzal” (Citrullus colocynthis) or other “ayarajate moshele” soda that are usable to extract soda, are helpful (4).\r\n\r\nAccording to this study, more research is suggested to assess the effect of this treatment in Iranian traditional medicine.",

Psychosis is a combination of biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological), psychological and social factors in various proportions. Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices.

      "abstract": "AbstractIt is still debated whether the deterioration of the sleep pattern, frequently reported by elderly subjects, is due only to aging per se. Other factors associated with aging or modifications of biological rhythms could also be involved. Elderly subjects frequently complain of daytime sleepiness, but it is not clear whether this actually represents a return to a polyphasic structure of sleep, or only a consequence of a disturbed night sleep. Ten healthy, independent and active elderly subjects (age > 72 years) were evaluated by means of 24-hour ambulatory polysomnography. Findings of nocturnal sleep were compared with sleep of the same group in the. 24-hour period and with sleep of young healthy controls. We observed a fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, but a fairly good representation of stages and a preservation of cyclicity. Except for three cases, with early or late times of sleep onset and wake-up, sleep disruption did not seem to be related to modification of circadian rhythms. Only three subjects presented undesired daytime naps, whereas the others either did not show daytime sleep at all, or were used to having their siesta after lunch since their young adulthood. In normal aging, daytime sleep does not constitute a social problem. Ambulatory polysomnography is a valid alternative to laboratory recordings in the identification of daytime sleep.Key Words: Sleepambulatory polysomnographynormal aging",

      "title": "Memory impairment in post-traumatic stress disorder: Behavioral and neuroimaging findings",
      "abstract": "When an event is perceived as life-threatening or as having the potential to cause serious bodily injury to oneself or others, an intense feeling of fear, horror or helplessness can arise and the memory process can be disrupted, leading to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This pathology is characterized by three kinds of symptoms: (i) re-experiencing, which is probably the main PTSD symptom and refers to intrusive memories occurring in flashbacks and/or nightmares so invasive that PTSD sufferers feels as if they are reliving the sensory and emotional aspects as occurring in the present; (ii) avoidance, where sufferers try to avoid everything that may remind them of the traumatic event (thoughts, places, people, and other reminders of the trauma) and (iii) hyper-arousal, which includes hyper-vigilance, exaggerated startled reactions, sleep disturbances, and irritability. The purpose of this article is to review the current state of knowledge on memory disturbances and cerebral abnormalities that are central to the pathology’s importance. PTSD in adults is well documented, and a concise description of the impairment of traumatic event memory has been established, involving both enhanced memory for emotional aspects and decreased memory for contextual information. As for traumatic events, memory for everyday events is also impaired in PTSD, with hypermnesia for negative information and lower memorizing of neutral information. Structural and functional abnormalities of brain areas involved in episodic memory (hippocampus), emotional memory (amygdala), and emotional regulation (medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices) seem involved in memory disturbances observed in PTSD. We will describe the two main theories synthesizing current understanding of adult PTSD. In children, while the symptoms are well described, the lack of investigations hinders the accurate identification of a particular profile of memory dysfunctions and their cerebral substrates. However, we will review the few findings in this field.",

      "abstract": "Typical migraine aura is a short-lived sensory experience coming before or during migraine and experienced by about 1/4 of all migraineurs. The experience can be visual, sensory, or result in problems with speaking or word finding. Typical visual changes are seeing spots, zigzags or crescents, flashes of light, or losing sight partially or fully, with any one of these lasting between 5 minutes and one hour. The symptoms, when they first occur, can be alarming. However, usually, typical migraine aura is a recurring and completely reversible phenomenon that heralds the onset of a migraine. Those affected sometimes use the aura symptoms as a signal for effective early treatment of the headache. There are treatments that can reduce the intensity or frequency of aura, and many times, the migraine itself can be improved by treating the aura. Visual changes are the most common form of aura, occurring in more than 90% of those migraineurs with aura. There can be spots, either colored or dark, circles increasing in size, zigzags, or crescent shapes, and light or dark alterations of vision. It is not uncommon to experience tunnel-like vision such that the sides of the visual field are darkened. When people see zigzags or crescents, this is termed a “positive” visual phenomenon. When people simply lose vision and see only black or dark, this is termed a “negative” phenomenon. The zigzags often assume the shape of forts from the Middle Ages and are referred to as “zigzag fortification spectra.” The shimmering that occurs in aura when vision is obscured is referred to as a “scintillating scotoma,” where a scotoma is a blind spot in vision. Sensory changes are the second most frequent form of typical migraine aura. These may consist of tingling or numbness on one side of the face, body, or tongue. Usually, the sensation change begins in the fingers and moves up the arm and then up to the chin and tongue in what is called a “cheiro-oral” aura. A third form of typical aura results in problems with speech or language, such as being temporarily unable to speak, slurred speech, being unable to find the right word, or using the wrong word to express an idea. All 3 common types of aura, and different symptoms within each type of aura, are considered typical if any one of them lasts less than an hour. Typical aura is not accompanied by actual weakness of the affected area, although sometimes migraineurs confuse extreme numbness as weakness. True weakness, such as being unable to lift an arm, is attributed to a more rare form of migraine aura, hemiplegic migraine. Aura is caused by a firing of nerves in the brain that serves a particular function. For example, a visual aura is caused by nerves firing in the visual cortex of the brain and is associated with a big increase in blood flow to serve the activated nerves. When the firing is complete, the nerves become quiet, and the blood flow drops because the nerves are no longer firing. This period of decreased blood flow is referred to as “cortical spreading depression,” but aura is really a spreading activation, with the depression only occurring after the activation. One common misconception is that other symptoms signaling an impending migraine represent aura. These symptoms, called premonitory symptoms or prodrome, are indications that a migraine is probably in the offing, but they do not represent true migraine aura. Premonitory symptoms might be feeling irritable, tired, yawning, or having an unexplained change in mood. Some people will become very energetic, and others have trouble concentrating. Nausea, blurred vision, and neck symptoms are other common signs of early or impending migraine. While these symptoms do not represent aura, they can be useful warning signals to prepare for a migraine and institute possibly helpful measures such as drinking fluids, reducing stress, noise, or reducing excessive environmental stimuli. True aura can be treated. Magnesium (400-500 mg) is one low side effect medication that can be used either at the onset of aura or used daily to prevent aura. Vitamin B2 or riboflavin (200-400 mg) per day can be used preventively, with no significant side effects. Many standard migraine preventive drugs also appear effective in reducing aura, such as topiramate and certain antidepressants. Some medications that probably effectively prevent aura may not work as well in prevention of migraine without aura, such as lamotrigine and verapamil. A different class of medications, not commonly used for migraine prevention alone, has shown promise in the prevention of aura. Memantine blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor in the brain and is believed to inhibit the spread of brain signaling that occurs with aura. Magnesium may also work by plugging the NMDA glutamate receptor. The risk of stroke in women with migraine without aura is likely not increased beyond that of non-migraineurs. The risk is estimated to increase up to twice normal if a woman does have aura, but this risk remains very low overall. Adding in estrogen-containing contraception raises the stroke risk 6-fold, and in migraineurs with aura who smoke and use estrogen containing contraceptives, the risk of stroke becomes considerable at 9 times the expected level. Use of progesterone-only contraceptives is not clearly linked to stroke. It is strongly recommended that those who have migraine with aura as well as tobacco dependence, at any age, cease smoking. In women with aura older than age 35, particular caution is advised in using estrogen-containing contraceptives or taking hormone replacement therapy because of this additional risk. When discussing contraceptive options, women should notify their gynecologist or primary care doctor if they have migraine with aura. Anyone whose aura worsens after using hormonal therapy will need to stop it. If aura is atypical, for instance if individual visual, sensory, or speech symptoms last longer than an hour, or there is accompanying weakness, hormonal contraception containing estrogen should not be used. Aura is a common accompaniment to migraine, occurring in about one-quarter of those with migraine. It usually follows an established pattern in any given migraineur. When recognized as typical, it can be treatable and even serve as an early warning to begin addressing the migraine before significant pain onset. With reasonable precautions, such as avoidance of smoking and judicious consideration of estrogen contraception, migraine with aura is a treatable problem seldom associated with complications.

Of special interest are pregnancy-induced changes in disease course or severity and likelihood for baseline recovery of function postpartum. Labor and delivery present special challenges in many conditions that affect skeletal but not smooth (uterine) muscle; so labor complications must be anticipated. Anesthesia for cesarean section surgery requires special precautions in many disorders. The types of conditions reviewed are broad and include examples of autoimmune, hereditary, and compressive/mechanical processes. Disorders include carpal tunnel syndrome and other focal neuropathies, Bell palsy, myasthenia gravis, and other neuromuscular junction disorders, acute and chronic inflammatory neuropathy, hereditary and acquired muscle diseases, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, channelopathies, autonomic neuropathy, and dysautonomia. Many commonly used therapies have fetal animal but no proven human toxicity concerns, complicating treatment and risk decisions. Weaning off effective therapeutic agents or preemptive aggressive treatment or surgery prior to planned pregnancy is an option in some conditions.",

Sleep deficiency can lead to physical and mental health problems, injuries, loss of productivity, and even a greater risk of death. Sleep deprivation is seen in several psychiatric disorders, and there may be a cause or effect relationship. Sleep-deprived individuals may have trouble making decisions, solving problems, controlling their emotions and behavior, and coping with stress or change. We report a case who started having sleep deprivation over 15 days following a stressor, which resulted in an acute psychosis-like condition with associated disorientation and perplexity. However, the patient responded to benzodiazepine medication given for the restoration of her sleep cycle and did not require any antipsychotics. There was also complete amelioration of her behavioral and thought disturbances.",

Inappropriate sleep habits in children have increased in developed countries and have become a major public health concern. Indeed, the impositions of daily life in technologically advanced societies on sleep and wake schedules have markedly shortened the total duration of sleep that children obtain these days. When sleep fragmentation is conducted in healthy adults using auditory stimuli to elicit arousals throughout the night, detriments in performance are clearly apparent the following day. Acute sleep restriction for one night in children has been shown to increase inattentive behavior the following day, although no changes were observed in hyperactive or impulsive behaviors.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatments of Pediatric Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION In a general sense, the operational definition of insomnia in children may be construed as similar to that in adults, i.e., significant difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep and/or non-restorative sleep (early morning awakening is an infrequent complaint in children). However, practically speaking, the most frequent clinical manifestations of childhood insomnia, particularly in younger children, are bedtime refusal or resistance, delayed sleep onset, and/or prolonged night wakings requiring parental intervention. It is estimated that overall 20% to 30% of children in cross-sectional studies are reported to have some significant bedtime problems and/or night wakings (1-7), and a recent study suggests that lifetime prevalence of insomnia in 13 to 16-year-old adolescents approaches 11% (8). These percentages are substantially higher in children with psychiatric comorbidities (9,10) and with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (11). Furthermore, there is clear evidence from both experimental laboratory-based studies and clinical observations that insufficient and poor quality sleep in children results in or exacerbates mood instability and behavioral dysregulation, impacts negatively on neurocognitive functions and academic performance (12-14), and affects caregivers, with significant repercussions on family functioning. Therefore, appropriate and effective management of insomnia in the pediatric population is an important therapeutic goal for mental healthcare providers.",

      "title": "Clinical management of antidepressant discontinuation.",
      "abstract": "To minimize the symptoms of antidepressant discontinuation, gradual tapering is necessary for all serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) except fluoxetine, which has an extended half-life. Agents with shorter half-lives such as venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine should be tapered gradually. Discontinuation symptoms, which frequently emerge after abrupt discontinuation or intermittent non-compliance and, less frequently, during dose reduction, are generally mild, short-lived, and self-limiting but can be distressing and may lead to missed work days and decreased productivity. The symptoms may be somatic (e.g., dizziness and light-headedness; nausea and vomiting; fatigue, lethargy, myalgia, chills, and other flu-like symptoms; sensory and sleep disturbances) or psychological (anxiety and/or agitation, crying spells, irritability). Mild symptoms can often be treated by simply reassuring the patient that they are usually transient, but for more severe symptoms, it may be necessary to reinstitute the dosage of the original antidepressant and slow the rate of taper. Symptoms of discontinuation may be mistaken for physical illness or relapse into depression; misdiagnosing the symptoms may lead to unnecessary, costly tests and treatment. Thus, health care professionals need to be educated about the potential adverse effects of SRI discontinuation.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

      "title": "Syncope and fainting: classification and pathophysiological basis",
      "abstract": "Extract Introduction Syncope, or fainting, refers to a transient loss of consciousness usually resulting from temporarily inadequate cerebral blood flow. A syncopal attack is frequently preceded by sweating, pallor, blurring of vision, dizziness, and nausea. It is uncommon in supine subjects and usually when subjects become supine as the result of syncope they rapidly recover consciousness. There is a wide variation in the susceptibility of individuals to syncope. The fainting of pregnant women or soldiers standing motionless on hot parade grounds is well known. On the other hand, patients in heart failure rarely, if ever, faint. Syncope does not necessarily point to organic disease, although it is clearly important to exclude diseases such as epilepsy, autonomic neuropathies, cerebrovascular disease, as well as cardiac and endocrine disorders. Most healthy individuals can precipitate at least presyncopal symptoms if, particularly in a warm environment (causing skin vasodilatation), they hyperventilate (to constrict cerebral blood vessels) and, after having been in a crouching position, suddenly stand (to allow abdominal blood vessels to fill with blood and to increase the height to which blood must be pumped to the brain).",

Cortical spreading depression (a depolarization wave across the brain cortex) is believed to be the underlying mechanism for a migraine aura, and observed vascular changes are considered epiphenomena. It is likely that there is an individual threshold for spreading depression, influenced by genetic factors.1\n\nIn migraine aura status, patients experience a large number of consecutive (mostly) visual auras, very often without headache.2 Between the auras, the patient is without symptoms. Episodes can last for weeks, and within this period several migraine auras can occur on one day. An aura status generally resolves spontaneously, but during the episodes most patients are greatly bothered by it and cannot perform their daily activities. The treatment of migraine aura status is unknown. One patient failed to improve on daily doses of aspirin, and subsequently appeared to improve on cyproheptadine.2 Other reports of treatments for aura status are lacking.\n\nIn the last few years, seven patients with aura status visited our outpatient clinic.

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "Today, prolonged wakefulness is a widespread phenomenon. Nevertheless, in the field of sleep and wakefulness, several unanswered questions remain. Prolonged wakefulness can be due to acute total sleep deprivation (SD) or to chronic partial sleep restriction. Although the latter is more common in everyday life, the effects of total SD have been examined more thoroughly. Both total and partial SD induce adverse changes in cognitive performance. First and foremost, total SD impairs attention and working memory, but it also affects other functions, such as long-term memory and decision-making. Partial SD is found to influence attention, especially vigilance. Studies on its effects on more demanding cognitive functions are lacking. Coping with SD depends on several factors, especially aging and gender. Also interindividual differences in responses are substantial. In addition to coping with SD, recovering from it also deserves attention. Cognitive recovery processes, although insufficiently studied, seem to be more demanding in partial sleep restriction than in total SD.",

Although contact proximity to these UFO-like luminosities is fatal, less terminal encounters have generated many religious and cosmic references. Unfortunately, the biobehavioral effects produced by these hazardous exposures have not been considered seriously. One hypothesis is that close-encounter experiences displayed near a luminosity are evoked by direct stimulation through current induction within the observer's brain. Because of the architectural and electrical characteristics of temporal lobe structures, their functions should dominate clinical profiles. Whereas the immediate experience would involve dream-like sequences, terror, perceptual changes, depersonalization, vestibular alterations, auditory sensations, and profound meaningfulness, post-episodic effects would include amnesia, time loss, confabulation, crisis suggestibility, and electroconvulsive shock symptoms. Progressive personality deterioration could be characterized by enhanced religiosity, “sense of the personal,” a compulsion to proselytize, affective disorders and modifications of memory from before the event.",

      "abstract": "Major depression is a common disorder; nearly 10% of the population suffers from a depressive illness in any given year. There is a strong association between sleep disturbances and depression. The most common sleep disturbance associated with major depressive disorder is insomnia. The relationship between insomnia and depression is bidirectional in that insomnia is one of the symptoms of depression and chronic insomnia can be a risk factor for depression. Depression causes changes in sleep patterns and sleep quality. Depressed patients showed prolonged sleep latency, increased wakefulness during sleep, early morning awakening, decreased sleep efficiency, decreased amounts of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep abnormalities. Depression is currently one of the leading causes of disability in the world. There is a direct association between the severity of depression and the level of disability. Depression has a big impact on quality of life of patients. Studies have showed that patients with major depressive disorder have poorer quality of life than persons from the general population. Effects of depression on quality of life are equal to or greater than those of patients with chronic medical conditions. Untreated depression usually does not go away by itself and often gets worse with time and increases a person's risk of suicide; it is a fact that up to 15% of those who are clinically depressed die through suicide. Clinical depression is treatable with counseling and medication. The majority of people with depressive disorders improve when they receive appropriate treatment. Improvement in depressive symptoms during the treatment is related to improvement in the quality of life. Antidepressants are shown to improve quality of life. There are some tools for evaluating quality of life in depressive patients, today. These tools help us to assess improvement in depressive patients beyond the extent to which depression rating scales do. In clinical settings, quality of life instruments can show us when patients begin to feel benefits of antidepressant therapy.",

Clinically, the distinguishing feature of sleep, in contrast to coma, is the ease with which the sleeping subject can be roused to awareness of the external world. Between alertness and coma are a variety of altered states of consciousness. Palliative sedation refers to the intentional clinical practice of suppressing consciousness to control refractory symptoms during the last days or hours of life, in a manner that is ethically acceptable to the patient, family and healthcare providers. The intractable symptoms, which have proven non-responsive to all other interventions, are contained by the induction and the continuance of deep sedation. Deep sedation may need to be maintained until death; the duration is usually in the range of 1–6 days. Trial releases of deep sedation can be orchestrated, if required, by withholding the dose or administering flumazenil. The dosage necessary to induce deep sedation is variable.",

Such disturbances of sleep could be characterized by a dissociation of the daily sleep volume into some epoches which lasted not more than 5-6 hours each. The EEG, submental EMG and heart rate as well as respiration were recorded continuously during the sleep periods. Eye movements, however, as they are not detectable by electric recording, were observed visually. In our 4 cases of blind children eye movements disappeared during sleep and sleep stages characterized by desynchronized EEG were found to be reduced.

Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

      "title": "Nociception and Acute Pain: Ascending Functional Structure and Descending Modulation",
      "abstract": "Pain is – a pain in the neck, isn´t it? Yes and no. Yes, it hurts. Yet, it helps. At least do acute and transient pain. Acute pain resulting from an acute event is a fundamental condition for survival, insofar as it warns against imminent or actual tissue damage, a potentially life-endangering threat. The importance of the physiological, protective role of nociceptive pain is underscored by cases, in which a failure to sense pain such as in the case of congenital insensitivity often leads to self-mutilation, bone fractures, joint deformities, amputations, and even early death. While the goal of acute pain based on nociception thus appears to be clear, its implementation is anything but that because to achieve this goal calls for a number of requirements to be fulfilled. The first is the identification of a noxious stimulus, including its intensity and location on the body surface or within the body. The second is the orchestration of counter-measures, including arousal, emotional and various motor reactions. The third is the mobilization of the required energy as well as cardio-vascular and respiratory responses. All this implies multi-dimensional activations of diverse neural and neuro-muscular systems. This review attempts to describe the structures and mechanisms underlying nociception and pain in quite some detail to emphasize their complexity. It starts with a structural description of the nociceptive and pain system in an ascending order, from peripheral nociceptors to supraspinal structures involved in nociceptive and pain processing. This is followed by a description of the systems organizing descending pain modulation. The focus will here be on acute pain. It turns out that even acute nociception and pain and the underlying neural systems are very complex. There are many reasons for this complexity. First, many neuronal nodes receive multifarious inputs and send multiple outputs to other nodes, which often have additional functions other than nociception and pain. This constitutes an extended, multi-functional, multiple input-multiple output network. Second, individual nodes often have an inhomogeneous structure chracterized by diverse neuron groups and inter-connections. Third, sub-cellular processes are complex, but will not be treated here. It comes as no surprise, then, that we face difficulties in dealing with pain and its clinical consequences, and find appropriate treatments. It will not suffice to manipulate a single screw or only a few.",

      "title": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and eventual deterioration of bulbar functions. Early in the disease, affected individuals may have gait disturbance, slurred speech, difficulty with balance, brisk deep tendon reflexes, hypermetric saccades, nystagmus, and mild dysphagia. Later signs include slowing of saccadic velocity, development of up-gaze palsy, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, and hypotonia. In advanced stages, muscle atrophy, decreased deep tendon reflexes, loss of proprioception, cognitive impairment (e.g., frontal executive dysfunction, impaired verbal memory), chorea, dystonia, and bulbar dysfunction are seen. Onset is typically in the third or fourth decade, although childhood onset and late-adult onset have been reported. Those with onset after age 60 years may manifest a pure cerebellar phenotype. Interval from onset to death varies from ten to 30 years; individuals with juvenile onset show more rapid progression and more severe disease. Anticipation is observed. An axonal sensory neuropathy detected by electrophysiologic testing is common; brain imaging typically shows cerebellar and brain stem atrophy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCA1 rests on the result of molecular genetic testing to detect an abnormal CAG trinucleotide expansion in ATXN1. Affected individuals have alleles with 39 or more CAG trinucleotide repeats. Such testing detects 100% of cases. Management Treatment of manifestations: Canes and walkers to help prevent falls; modification of the home with grab bars, raised toilet seats, and ramps for motorized chairs; speech therapy and communication devices for dysarthria; weighted eating utensils and dressing hooks to help maintain independence. Intensive rehabilitation (coordinative physiotherapy) may be beneficial. Weight control is important because obesity can exacerbate difficulties with ambulation and mobility. Video esophagram can help to identify the consistency of food least likely to trigger aspiration and feeding devices may be indicated when dysphagia becomes troublesome. Prevention of secondary complications: Medications may help symptomatic secondary problems such as spasticity, bladder urgency, depression, and pain; vitamin supplements are recommended if caloric intake is reduced. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation every three to six months. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Alcohol, medications known to cause nerve damage (e.g., isoniazid). Circumstances that could lead to physical harm, such as operating machinery or climbing to great heights, should be avoided. Genetic counseling SCA1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the expanded allele. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies is possible if the diagnosis has been confirmed by molecular genetic testing in an affected relative; however, requests for prenatal testing of typically adult-onset diseases are not common.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Hypothermia is not limited to the northern states: people also die of hypothermia in other areas with milder climates. Infants, young adolescent boys, and inadequately dressed teens who abuse alcohol or illicit drugs are at highest risk for death secondary to hypothermia. The mildly hypothermic patient may appear fatigued and display persistent shivering, ataxia, clumsiness, confusion, tachypnea, and tachycardia. The child with moderate hypothermia will not be shivering; declining mental status may cause the freezing patient to remove clothing. An irregular heartbeat is likely at this stage. Severe hypothermia is marked by apnea, stupor, and coma. In a frostbitten patient, rapid rewarming of the affected area in warm water for 15 to 30 minutes is the first step. Potent analgesia is often necessary. After thawing, the frostbitten part is kept dry, warm, and loosely covered. With an adequate dose of common sense, the vast majority of deaths from cold injury can be prevented.",

      "abstract": "Disasters, whether resulting from terrorism or natural events, have a dramatic impact on the health and well-being of children. Studies after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and countless reports on the impact of natural disasters on children show that a child's mental health can suffer from direct and indirect exposure to these events. Children may react to a disaster or act of terrorism in a variety of ways. These reactions are influenced by age, developmental level, intellectual capacity, individual and family support systems, personality, and other factors. Common manifestations of psychological trauma in young children include regression, clinging behavior, inattentiveness, aggressiveness, bed-wetting, somatic complaints, irritability, social withdrawal, nightmares, and crying. Longer-lasting effects may include depression, anxiety, adjustment disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and interpersonal or academic difficulties. Some children are particularly vulnerable to postdisaster trauma because of preexisting psychosocial stressors (homelessness, foster care, exposure to violence, etc), low socioeconomic status, or special needs (including cognitive delays and prior mental illness). These postdisaster reactions may not manifest until well after the event and could persist for years.\n\nThe National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP) at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health gathered key staff to discuss the appropriate response to the needs in the Gulf Coast region. Over the following few days, talks were held with federal, state, and local public officials to assess immediate needs and determine what resources could be offered to the affected areas. Necessary clearances to provide medical care were obtained from the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas departments of health. Permission was also necessary (and obtained) for access to gasoline and necessary supplies including pharmaceuticals and to travel after curfew.\n\nThe Children's Health Fund and the NCDP launched Operation Assist, a collaborative effort to organize programs … \n\nAddress correspondence to Paula A.

      "title": "Complex Suicides",
      "abstract": "The term \"complex suicide\" refers to suicides in which more than one suicide method is applied. In this context, a distinction can be made between planned and unplanned complex suicides. In planned complex suicides, two or more methods are employed simultaneously in order to make sure that death will occur even if one method fails. In unplanned complex suicides, several other methods of suicide are tried after the first method chosen failed to gain one's end or when it proved to be too painful. In planned complex suicides, typically two of the generally common methods of suicide (e.g., ingestion of hypnotics or other medicaments, hanging, use of firearms, drowning, jumping from a height) are combined. However, unusual combinations have been described also, such as the simultaneous firing of several guns, self-immolation, jumping from a height, or shooting oneself while driving a car. In unplanned complex suicides, injuries by sharp force, especially cutting the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases, the suicidal changes from the infliction of cut wounds to the infliction of stab wounds (most often located in the heart region). Other frequently used methods after failure of the first method are hanging and jumping from a height. A further characteristic feature of unplanned complex suicides is the application of more than two methods of suicide. The literature has reported the use of up to five suicide methods applied one after the other. From the criminological point of view, the presence of several injuries of different origin strongly suggests infliction by another person. Differentiation is possible only if autopsy including toxicological analysis is performed and the traces at the death scene are thoroughly investigated, so that the sequel of events can be reconstructed.",

      "title": "Perioperative Hearing Impairment",
      "abstract": "PERIOPERATIVE hearing loss is a rarely reported phenomenon. However, it occurs more frequently than most anesthesiologists suspect. Perioperative hearing impairment is often subclinical and may go unnoticed unless audiometry is performed. 1–3It can be conductive or sensorineural, unilateral or bilateral, and transient or permanent. 4–8Hearing loss has been reported following virtually every type of anesthetic technique. The hearing mechanism may be less susceptible to acoustic trauma during general anesthesia, 9but other mechanisms are capable of causing both conductive and sensorineural hearing losses (SNHL) in the perioperative period. The etiologies include mechanical, traumatic, noise-induced, changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, nitrous oxide, embolism, pharmacologic, and other miscellaneous causes.The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear. It is a snail-shaped structure of 2.75 turns with an uncoiled length of approximately 3 cm (fig. 1). The cochlea is divided into three channels. The two outer channels, the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, contain perilymphatic fluid and communicate at the apex through the helicotrema. The middle channel, the scala media (cochlear duct), contains endolymphatic fluid. In the conventional cross-sectional view of the cochlea (fig. 2), the scala media is triangular in shape. Its upper boundary, the vestibular or Reissner's membrane, attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and to the outer wall of the cochlea, separating it from the scala vestibuli. The lower boundary, the basilar membrane, also attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and the outer wall of the cochlea. The basilar membrane supports the hearing organ, the organ of Corti, and separates the scala media from the scala tympani. The lateral wall of the scala media is the highly vascular stria vascularis. At the base of the cochlea, the perilymph of the scala vestibuli contacts the oval window and the perilymph of the scala tympani contacts the round window (figs. 1 and 3).Arterial blood is supplied to the inner ear by the internal auditory artery, which arises from either the basilar or the inferior anterior cerebellar artery and passes through the internal auditory meatus with cranial nerve VIII. The arterial supply to the cochlea is via end vessels, with no collateral circulation. The afferent special somatic exteroceptive cochlear nerve provides innervation. The peripheral processes arise in the organ of Corti, their cell bodies forming the spiral ganglion of the cochlea in the osseous spiral lamina. The processes converge, traversing the modiolus to form the cochlear nerve, which passes through the internal acoustic meatus with the vestibular nerve. A smaller number of efferent nerve fibers arise from the olivary complexes and terminate axodendritically on the afferent dendrites that innervate the inner hair cells.The cochlear fluid system is made up of two fluids, perilymph and endolymph (fig. 2). Perilymph fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani and has an ionic composition, low in potassium and high in sodium, similar to interstitial fluid and nearly identical to CSF. 10There are two theories regarding its origin: (1) it is filtrate produced by capillaries in the spiral ligament; and (2) it is CSF communicated to cochlea through the cochlear aqueduct, a small channel in the temporal bone near the round window, which connects the scala tympani directly to the subarachnoid space. The endolymphatic fluid is unique to the inner ear. It has a high concentration of potassium and a low concentration of sodium, similar to intracellular fluid. The stria vascularis is believed to be the source of the unique endolymph ionic composition. Although there is slow longitudinal flow of endolymph, maintenance of the critical ionic environment for the organ of Corti is due to local radial flow between the stria vascularis and nearby cells. Endolymphatic absorption takes place in the endolymphatic sac, a specialized structure of the membranous labyrinth. The endolymphatic sac is located in the subdural space and communicates with the membranous labyrinth via the endolymphatic duct (fig. 1). It is thought to participate in balancing endolymphatic pressures with changes in CSF pressure. Two-way flow through a patent cochlear aqueduct provides relatively rapid perilymphatic pressure equilibration with the CSF. Endolymphatic pressure regulation is considerably slower, being primarily a function of production and absorption. Only minor and temporary pressure adjustments are made by the endolymphatic sac.The organ of Corti, the hearing transduction mechanism, is located in the cochlear duct (scala media). The sensory cells of the organ of Corti are mechanoreceptors with stereocilia projecting from the top of the cells into the endolymph. 11There are two types of hair cells, outer (OHC) and inner (IHC) hair cells (fig. 2). They differ in morphology, microanatomical location, and function. The IHCs and OHCs initiate the transduction process by transforming the acoustic signal into neural activity. Activation of the hair cells causes neurotransmitter release that depolarizes afferent dendrites causing an all-or-none spike discharge in individual auditory nerve fibers. Overlying the organ of Corti is a gelatinous flap, the tectorial membrane. The tectorial membrane is attached on its medial edge to the spiral limbus and laterally is in contact with the stereocilia of the OHCs. Since the tectorial membrane and basilar membrane have different medial attachment locations, upward or downward displacement of basilar membrane induces shearing displacements of the hairs in contact with the tectorial membrane. These various bending movements of the OHC stereocilia can cause excitation or inhibition. Excitation initiates the transduction of acoustic energy into neural signals. In contrast to OHCs, the stereocilia of the IHC are not embedded in the tectorial membrane but rest in a groove near the undersurface of the tectorial membrane. The IHC do not respond to displacement of the basilar membrane, but they do respond to the velocity of displacement of the basilar membrane. The neural signals initiated by the IHCs and OHCs are transmitted through the acoustic division of cranial nerve VIII ultimately to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe.A simplified diagram of the cochlea uncoiled is usually used to describe cochlear mechanics (fig. 3). On the left is the base of the cochlea with the stapes and oval window. Below these structures and adjoining the scala vestibuli is the round window of the scala tympani. In the diagram, the uncoiled cochlea is divided horizontally by a line representing the scala media, Reissner's membrane, the organ of Corti, and the basilar membrane. However, this line, for purposes of understanding cochlear mechanics, can be thought of as simply the basilar membrane. Above the dividing line is the scala vestibuli, and below is the scala tympani. Because of the inertia of the fluid mass and frictional resistance to fluid flow in the narrow channels of the scala, inward or outward motion of the stapes against the oval window causes a pressure wave to travel down the scala; there is no fluid flow. Since the fluids are incompressible within the bony cochlea, the pressure wave traveling down the scala vestibuli causes the basilar membrane to deflect downward toward the scala tympani for positive pressures and upward for negative pressures. The flexible round window compensates for pressure changes transmitted to the scala tympani. For the acute changes caused by pressure waves in the audible frequencies, the connection between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, the helicotrema, functions as though it were closed. The helicotrema is only involved in very slow equalization of pressures between the two scalae.The most important property of the basilar membrane is its ability to separate various frequencies. The compliance of the basilar membrane changes by a factor of greater than 100 from base to apex. At the base, near the oval window, the basilar membrane is narrower and thicker, making it less compliant (fig. 3). It is wider and thinner at the apex, resulting in greater compliance. Since a system's resonant frequency is directly proportional to stiffness and inversely proportional to mass, the stiff base responds maximally to high frequencies (> 4,000 Hz), and the compliant apex responds maximally to low frequencies (< 1,000 Hz). In short, the basilar membrane functions as a sharply tuned bandpass filter, performing a spectral analysis on the incoming sound (pressure) waves. The effect is to translate the frequency of incoming sound into distance along the basilar membrane, a frequency-to-place or tonotopical transformation. Therefore, both IHCs and OHCs at a specific point along the basilar membrane respond to a very specific, narrow frequency range. Excited hair cells depolarize specific acoustic neurons, and the information is finally interpreted in the auditory centers.Clinical or subclinical hearing loss following spinal anesthesia or lumbar puncture has been reported frequently(table 1). 4,6–8,12–24Despite many reports, few anesthesiologists appear to be aware of the possibility of this complication. Since there has been no large-scale audiometric study of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia, the precise incidence of clinical or subclinical hearing loss is unknown but may occur more frequently than appreciated. Further, the specific presentation and onset of the hearing deficit after spinal anesthesia can vary widely.The first case of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia 25was reported in 1914. In 1956, Vandam and Dripps 26reported that of 9,277 patients who had spinal anesthesia, 0.4% experienced auditory difficulties, such as impaired hearing, tinnitus, buzzing, or roaring. Few specific data were gathered, and no audiometry of these patients was performed. Michel et al. 27described nine cases of hearing loss following myelography, diagnostic lumbar puncture, and spinal anesthesia. The hearing deficits were almost uniformly in the lower frequencies (125–1,000 Hz). The deficits were bilateral in six of the nine patients. Six of the nine patients had full recoveries in less than 1 month without treatment.In addition to these case reports, there have been several studies of hearing loss related to spinal anesthesia. In one study, 6 of 14 patients had audiometrically detectable mild hearing deficits in the low-frequency range that resolved spontaneously in 1–7 months. 28Walsted et al. 29tested 34 patients with audiometry before and after spinal anesthesia. Most of the patients had a small but significant threshold shift at 500 Hz. However, one patient developed a considerable unilateral hearing loss in the low-frequency range, which persisted until an epidural blood patch was performed. Gultekin et al. 30used pure tone audiometry to test hearing before and after spinal anesthesia for hernia repair. Fourteen patients (32%), despite being unaware of it, had audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing losses. All spinal anesthetics were performed with 22-gauge Quincke needles (needle gauge and design are discussed in the next section), and the authors suggested that hearing loss was less frequent when the anesthetic agent was bupivacaine rather than prilocaine. In 35 patients undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia (24-gauge Sprotte needle), pure tone audiometry revealed that five patients had developed low-frequency hearing loss on the first postoperative day. 31The deficits were unilateral in three patients and bilateral in the other two. All patients had full recovery without treatment by the fifth postoperative day. In contrast, Finegold et al. 32found no audiometric hearing decrement postoperatively in 44 patients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Half of the patients' spinals were performed with 25-gauge Quincke needles; 24-gauge Sprotte needles were used for the other half. This is the only study of 13 found that failed to show a relationship between spinal anesthesia and hearing loss. Hearing acuity is affected by hormonal changes, 33,34but peripartum changes have not been documented. The explanation for this singular result may be in the study's methodology.In a study of 100 patients undergoing elective urologic procedures under spinal anesthesia, eight patients experienced noticeable hearing impairment. 18Audiometry was performed on three of the patients and revealed a 30-dB loss in the low-frequency range. Hearing deficits resolved within a short time without treatment. In another study of 100 patients undergoing elective general or urologic surgery under spinal anesthesia, 16 had audiometrically documented hearing losses. 3The hearing loss typically affected only the frequencies between 125 and 2,000 Hz. The deficits were usually detected on the second day after the spinal anesthetic and in all cases resolved within 3 days without treatment. The incidence of hearing loss after spinal anesthesia for men under 30 yr of age was compared to that in men over the age of 60. 35Fifty-two percent (13 of 25) of the younger and 16% of the older patients had significant hearing losses (≤ 10 dB) confined to the low-frequency range (125–500 Hz). There was no hearing impairment in the speech frequencies (500–2,000 Hz) and higher frequencies for either group. No patient was aware of a hearing deficit, and no patient developed a post–dural puncture headache (PDPH). In a recent study of hearing loss following spinal versus general anesthesia, there were audiometric losses in both groups, although the spinal group had significantly greater hearing losses, particularly in the low-frequency range. 36Interestingly, in the spinal group, increases in the low-frequency audible threshold were inversely related to the preoperative low-frequency audible threshold.Overall, it appears that 10–50% of patients receiving spinal anesthesia experience an audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing deficit. Less than one fourth of these patients have a clinical, or noticeable, hearing loss.The size of the needle used for dural puncture appears to play a role in postspinal anesthetic hearing impairment. The hearing loss may be a result of CSF leakage even when the CSF loss is insufficient to cause a PDPH. Fog et al. 2found that 13 of 14 patients whose spinal anesthetics were performed with a 22-gauge needle had a 10-dB or greater hearing loss across the audible frequency range with significantly greater losses in the low-frequency range. Only 4 of the 14 patients in whom a 26-gauge needle was used had similar hearing impairment, and none had significant (> 10 dB) losses. When spinal anesthesia was performed with a 26-gauge needle, 37only one of nine patients was found to have a low-frequency hearing loss, which was severe but transient. Interestingly, this patient also experienced a PDPH. In another study of 100 patients, 50 had spinal anesthesia using either a 20- or a 22-gauge needle. Of these, 10% had significant decreases in audiometric values in the 250- to 500-Hz frequency range on the first postoperative day that resolved spontaneously within 5 days. 38In the 50 patients in whom 24- and 25-gauge needles were used, no decrement in audiometric values occurred. Oncel et al. 1used pure tone audiometry at 125 Hz preoperatively and postoperatively to assess hearing loss. Three groups of 15 patients were studied. One group received epidural anesthesia. In the other two groups, spinal anesthesia was performed with either a 22- or 25-gauge needle. No hearing impairments were detected in the epidural group. There was significantly greater hearing loss in the 22-gauge group versus the 25-gauge spinal group. None of the study patients developed a PDPH. The authors suggested that pure tone audiometry may be a more sensitive indicator of CSF leakage than the presence of PDPH.Needle design may also play a role in hearing impairment following lumbar puncture. Using audiometry, Sundberg et al. 39compared the effect of 22-gauge cutting-tip (Quincke) to 22-gauge pencil-point (Whitacre) needles on postspinal hearing loss. A hearing loss of at least 10 dB at two or more frequencies below 1,000 Hz was observed in 6 of 25 (24%) patients in the Quincke group as compared to only 2 of 23 (9%) in the Whitacre group. In addition, of those patients with hearing deficits, the mean hearing level was significantly worse in the Quincke group. This study suggests an association between the design of the spinal needle tip and postoperative hearing dysfunction that is similar to the relationship between the needle types and the incidence of PDPH, implying a similar pathogenesis. Lamberg et al. , 40using audiometric testing, compared hearing losses after a single-shot spinal with a 25-gauge Quincke needle with those following a continuous spinal anesthetic (19-gauge Touhy-type needle and 22-gauge catheter). None of the patients developed a PDPH or were aware of a hearing loss. However, nine (43%) of the single-shot patients and seven (37%) of continuous spinal patients had hearing deficits in excess of 10 dB when tested postoperatively. This result also seems to parallel experience with the cause and incidence of PDPH.In summary, hearing impairment following neuraxial anesthesia seems to be related to the same factors (age, needle gauge, and needle type) that are implicated in CSF leakage and PDPH. 41Two of the studies cited above included a total of 27 patients who received epidural anesthesia. Audiometric testing did not reveal measurable postoperative auditory impairment in any of these patients. On the other hand, the consensus of the studies indicates a consistent rate (10–50%) of SNHL in the low frequencies after lumbar puncture. Also, postspinal hearing impairment resolved without treatment, usually within several days, again suggesting an etiology common with that of PDPH. Interestingly, in two reports, patients who received epidural blood patches for PDPH had simultaneous reversal of their postspinal, low-frequency hearing loss. 4,29Cerebrospinal fluid leakage can cause a decrease in the CSF pressure that may be transmitted to the inner ear. A relative balance in the endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressures maintains the normal structural conformation in the inner ear. Disruption of this pressure balance can cause hearing impairment as well as impairment of semicircular canal function. A change in CSF pressure is promptly transmitted through a patent cochlear aqueduct to the inner ear perilymph (fig. 2). 6,42–45A decrease in CSF pressure following a dural puncture and CSF leak would cause a rapid and similar decrease in perilymph pressure. The endolymphatic system, however, responds much more slowly. Endolymphatic pressure–volume adjustments are primarily the result of altered endolymph production at the stria vascularis or altered absorption at the endolymphatic sac. Therefore, an acute drop in CSF pressure could result in endolymphatic pressure sufficiently exceeding that of the perilymph to cause distortions of both Reissner's membrane and the basilar membrane. The consequent disruption in the position of the hair cells results in hearing impairment. 10This mechanism has been postulated in several reports. 3,6,8,46Walsted et al. 47proposed such a mechanism in 1991. Later, in controlled prospective studies of neurosurgical patients and in animal studies, she showed the relationship between CSF loss and low-frequency hearing impairment. 48–52The finding that the degree of hearing impairment is correlated with the size of the spinal needle further supports the theory that postspinal hearing loss and PDPH share a common etiology: leakage of CSF from the subarachnoid space. 1,2Distortion of the basilar membrane and hearing loss could also be caused by acute increases in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph. In a case report, Hardy 53postulated that injection into the epidural space caused an acute increase in CSF pressure that was immediately transmitted through the cochlear aqueduct to the perilymph, thus distorting the basilar membrane and causing an acute low-frequency hypoacusis.Finally, if the mechanism of postspinal hearing loss is the same as for PDPH, several questions arise: why do we not see as many patients with vestibular symptoms; why does not every patient with a severe PDPH experience hearing impairment; and why are some hearing losses unilateral? In response to the first question, not only are the changes in CSF pressure transmitted less rapidly to the vestibular apparatus, but the vestibular apparatus is somewhat less sensitive than the cochlea to perilymph–endolymph pressure imbalances. Further, the hearing deficit may be subclinical, not obvious without audiometric testing. In answer to the second question, as many as 7% of adults have an anatomically obstructed cochlear aqueduct, and as many as 30% have a functionally obstructed aqueduct. 44,45,54For these patients, CSF pressure changes are not transmitted to the perilymph, and, therefore, a severe PDPH could exist without a hearing deficit. This mechanism may also explain the cases of unilateral hearing deficit. In addition, restricted cochlear aqueduct flow and the mechanical compliance of the cochlear windows can limit the stress of CSF pressure changes.The reports cited above indicate that the great majority of hearing deficits that result from lumbar puncture or CSF loss occur in the low frequencies and, in most cases, bilaterally. We propose that this is the result of the physical characteristics of the basilar membrane. At the cochlear base, where higher frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is narrow, thick, and stiff, and therefore resistant to pressure changes that are not in its resonant frequency range (fig. 3). At the cochlear apex, where low frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is much more compliant. Changes in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph can cause significant static displacement of the basilar membrane, disrupting the normal OHC relationship to the tectorial membrane and resulting in low-frequency hearing loss. Hearing loss confined to the low frequencies is unlikely due to CSF pressure–mediated stretch or pressure injury to cranial nerve VIII.It is interesting to note that the low-frequency hearing loss observed in Ménière's syndrome involves a similar mechanism. In Ménière's syndrome, instead of a decrease in perilymphatic pressure relative to endolymphatic pressure, there is an increase in endolymphatic pressure (endolymphatic hydrops). This imbalance in pressures would cause a similar distortion of the basilar membrane with the greatest effect at the cochlear apex and resulting, at least in the early stages, in a hearing loss (low frequency) similar to that which can occur after spinal anesthesia.Presuming that hearing impairment following spinal anesthesia or dural puncture has the same etiology as PDPH, i.e. , loss of CSF or decreased CSF pressure, then the treatment and prognosis should be similar. Figure 4indicates that untreated hearing impairments following dural puncture recover fully greater than 95% of the time. Several authors have noted improvement in auditory symptoms after an epidural blood patch. 4,29,55Lybecker et al. 46prospectively studied the effects of an epidural blood patch on hearing in patients with severe PDPH caused by dural puncture. They performed audiometry at several frequencies 1 h before and 1 h after an epidural blood patch. Twelve of the 16 patients had significant audiometric improvement in hearing. Simply changing position from sitting to supine improved hearing in half of the patients in the absence of the blood patch. This study offers clear evidence of the potential efficacy of epidural blood patch for post–dural puncture hearing loss. In another case report in which conservative measures followed by two epidural blood patches failed to relieve a severe PDPH and bilateral low-frequency hearing loss, an epidural dextran 40 infusion relieved the headache and reversed the hearing loss. 56Rosenberg et al. 57performed an audiometric study of 20 patients undergoing surgery with interscalene brachial plexus block anesthesia. Four of the patients (20%) experienced hearing impairment at various frequencies on the side of the block. The low frequencies (250–500 Hz) were affected in only one patient who also had hearing threshold decrements on the opposite side of 15–20 dB measured in the 6,000- to 10,000-Hz range (table 2). Farrell et al. 58described four patients with sudden permanent deafness following anesthesia for dental surgery. Anesthesia for three of the patients was local infiltration or nerve block, and the fourth had general anesthesia. The patient who had general anesthesia had bilateral SNHL, while the three other patients had ipsilateral SNHL. Similarly, Shenkman et al. 59reported a case in which permanent neurologic symptoms, ipsilateral hearing impairment, a facial nerve palsy, and ataxia occurred following an inferior alveolar nerve block. These findings are summarized in table 2.Within 24 h after the interscalene blocks, all four of the patients had spontaneous resolution of their hearing deficits. 57The authors postulated that the mechanism of hearing loss involved an effect due to sympathetic blockade. Vasodilation caused by the sympathetic block may have developed, resulting in edema of the mucosal membranes of both the Eustachian tube and the middle ear and producing a hearing decrement on that side. The hearing loss resolved within 24 h without treatment in all four patients.With regard to the hearing deficits following dental procedures, the authors 58,59could not identify a specific etiology for any of the cases. Several possibilities were considered. Noise-induced hearing loss from dental drills is known to result in temporary, noise-induced, bilateral hearing deficits. 60Dental extractions are known to cause microemboli that could reach the cochlear vasculature and cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment. 58Vasoconstrictors are usually used with local anesthesia for dental procedures. Intravascular injection could cause vasospasm of the cochlear division of the internal auditory artery. 58Finally, nociceptive afferents or autonomic nerve fibers could initiate a reflex vasoconstriction of critical vessels to the hearing structures. Hearing loss during dental procedures appears to be quite rare and usually temporary.Hearing impairment after general anesthesia for non–cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is rare. Our review of the English language literature through 2001 revealed only 35 reported (29 documented audiometrically) cases of hearing loss after general anesthesia (table 3).Evan et al. 61reported three cases of SNHL following general anesthesia; one patient recovered, and the other two sustained permanent hearing loss. The authors were unable to elucidate the etiology in any of the patients. Cox and Sargent 62reported three cases of hearing loss following nonotologic surgery. Two patients had permanent, profound unilateral hearing loss, and one patient had moderate bilateral hearing loss. Velazquez 63described a case of acute unilateral hearing deficit following abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Other authors have described bilateral hearing impairment immediately following minor abdominal surgeries. 64,65It should also be noted that some patients who receive general anesthesia come to the operating room from an intensive care unit having already sustained an unrecognized hearing loss. Halpern et al. 66have discussed the myriad causes of hearing loss in the critical care setting.Although the etiology of hearing loss associated with general anesthesia often cannot be ascertained, there are a number of potential etiologies: changes in middle ear pressure, vascular pathology, CSF pressure changes, embolism, ototoxic drugs, and other miscellaneous causes.Excessive or sudden changes in middle ear pressure can disrupt the tympanic membrane, the round window, and the conducting structures. Excessive middle ear pressure can cause the round window to rupture, resulting in significant hearing loss. 67,68This type of injury has been described as occurring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 69Two patients who were successfully resuscitated developed partial deafness, one from disarticulation of the incomalleal joint and the other from an oval window perilymph fistula. It was postulated that during vigorous mask ventilation, excessive pressure was suddenly transmitted through the Eustachian tube causing the middle ear injuries.Nitrous oxide (N2O) anesthesia was shown in the late 1960s to be capable of causing oscillations of middle ear pressures that could result in tympanic perforation and cause hearing loss. 70,71Depending on the uptake or elimination phase, N2O can displace tympanic membrane grafts outward or inward and disrupt reconstructed middle ear conducting structures. Segal et al. 72described a case of labyrinthine membrane rupture and sustained SNHL due to elevated intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. The degree of intratympanic pressure fluctuation is a function of N2O concentration and its rate of change. Several cases of middle ear injury have been described as resulting from sudden changes in intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. 73–77Further, the patency of the Eustachian tube may play a role in potential injury during N2O anesthesia. During N2O elimination, Eustachian tube obstruction can result in significant negative middle ear pressure and tympanic perforation. 78A vascular pathogenesis is another possible mechanism for hearing impairment after general anesthesia.

      "abstract": "Insomnia generally is defined a subjective report of difficulty falling sleep, difficulty staying asleep, early awakening, or nonrestorative sleep. It is one of the most common health complaints among the general population. In pathogenesis of insomnia predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors play an important role. Predisposing factors include arousal-prone personality, elevated baseline physiologic arousal, rigid circadian system, and other individual characteristics that make one vulnerable to or set the stage for the development of insomnia. Precipitating factors are the events or conditions that trigger the insomnia. Common examples include life stressors and change of sleep-wake schedule. The perpetuating factors, such conditioning of bedtime cues with arousal, maladaptive sleep-wake habits and worries over sleeplessness, then should become the focus of the treatment. Pharmacologic and non-pharmacological methods of treatment are used in the management of insomnia. In the case of the diagnosis of transient or short-term insomnia, a basic method of treatment is usually administrating the right hypnotics and information on the sleep hygiene. In chronic insomnia, a basic treatment is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help pharmacologically by regular use of sedative and hypnotic antidepressant medication in the evening only as needed taking hypnotics drugs (no more than 2-3 times a week).",

      "abstract": "By dictionary definition, an emergency is any sudden state of affairs which demands immediate action. In psychiatric terms there are at least three ways of looking at such an event: (1) the medical viewpoint. Doctors and hospitals are used to coping with physical emergencies in the course of their daily work. Therefore, when some abnormal mental state is the cause of the emergency the remedy is most frequently seen in terms of some form of medical intervention, usually implying the administration of drugs. (2) the psychological viewpoint. This is less concerned to classify overt symptoms and more willing to see the person in distress as somehow failing to cope with some stressful situation. This failure to cope may be due to the sheer size and impact of the stress or indicative of some breakdown of the usual defensive mechanisms, either because the ego is underdeveloped and therefore vulnerable, or because it has been undermined by illness. (3) the social worker's viewpoint. An emergency may be seen as being concerned less with the disturbance within one individual than with a breakdown within a system or a wider group. In these terms the focus shifts from a concern with one person and moves to a consideration of that person within the context of friends, neighbours and relatives.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of motor development is an important part of the study of the neuropsychic development of children, which is carried out by a pediatrician during preventive examinations. To identify the causes of motor disorders, in addition to studying the anamnesis, it is necessary to conduct a physical examination of the child with the appointment of additional research methods. It is important to remember that developmental delay does not always indicate the presence of any disease but requires dynamic monitoring. However, if they progress, then these patients are more likely to be diagnosed with specific neuromuscular disorders. In this case, the pediatrician should pay attention to the neurological status of the child, assess visual acuity and hearing. At the same time, one should not forget that motor disorders are often combined with a general developmental delay (mental retardation) of the child. Fasciculation of the tongue, loss of motor skills, organomegaly, coarsening of facial features, increased levels of creatine phosphokinase (more than 3 times higher than normal), respiratory failure, in the presence of general weakness, a sharp deterioration in the child’s condition, accompanied by lethargy, vomiting, development of convulsive syndrome, disorders detected on MRI of the brain, are alarming symptoms that require urgent intervention by specialists (neurologist, genetics). Also, some hereditary (chromosomal and monogenic) diseases are often combined with the development of motor disorders. The best results are achieved if the early diagnosis of diseases accompanied by movement disorders is carried out using an interdisciplinary approach.",

      "abstract": "The 'Other Primary Headaches' include eight recognised benign headache disorders. Primary stabbing headache is a generally benign disorder which often co-exists with other primary headache disorders such as migraine and cluster headache. Primary cough headache is headache precipitated by valsalva; secondary cough has been reported particularly in association with posterior fossa pathology. Primary exertional headache can occur with sudden or gradual onset during, or immediately after, exercise. Similarly headache associated with sexual activity can occur with gradual evolution or sudden onset. Secondary headache is more likely with both exertional and sexual headache of sudden onset. Sudden onset headache, with maximum intensity reached within a minute, is termed thunderclap headache. A benign form of thunderclap headache exists. However, isolated primary and secondary thunderclap headache cannot be clinically differentiated. Therefore all headache of thunderclap onset should be investigated. The primary forms of the aforementioned paroxysmal headaches appear to be Indomethacin sensitive disorders. Hypnic headache is a rare disorder which is termed 'alarm clock headache', exclusively waking patients from sleep. The disorder can be Indomethacin responsive, but can also respond to Lithium and caffeine. New daily persistent headache is a rare and often intractable headache which starts one day and persists daily thereafter for at least 3 months. The clinical syndrome more often has migrainous features or is otherwise has a chronic tension-type headache phenotype. Management is that of the clinical syndrome. Hemicrania continua straddles the disorders of migraine and the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias and is not dealt with in this review.",

      "title": "Role of Sertraline in insomnia associated with post traumatic brain injury (TBI) depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability (1, 2). Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, are very common following traumatic brain injury and have been reported in frequencies from 40% (3) to as high as 84% (4). Sleep disruption can be related to the TBI itself but may also be secondary to neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression) or neuromuscular (e.g., pain) conditions associated with TBI or to the pharmacological management of the injury and its consequences. Post-TBI insomnia has been associated with numerous negative outcomes including daytime fatigue, tiredness, difficulty functioning: impaired performance at work, memory problems, mood problems, greater functional disability, reduced participation in activities of daily living, less social and recreational activity, less employment potential, increased caregiver burden, greater sexual dysfunction, and also lower ratings of health, poor subjective wellbeing. These negative consequences can hamper the person’s reintegration into the community, adjustment after injury, and overall QOL. (5) The connection between depression and insomnia has not been investigated within the post TBI population to a great extent. For the general population, clinically significant insomnia is often associated with the presence of an emotional disorder (6). Fichtenberg et al. (2002) (7), in his study established that the strongest relationship with the diagnosis of insomnia belonged to depression. Given the high prevalence of depression during the first 2 years following TBI (8), a link between depression and insomnia among TBI patients makes innate sense. The present study aims at assessing role of sertralline in post TBI insomnia associated with depression.",

Los trastornos generalizados del desarrollo (TGD) corresponden a ninos con dificultades para alcanzar las funciones tempranas del desarrollo, como las habilidades del lenguaje, de la comunicacion, de la socializacion y motoras. Los sistemas de evaluacion del sueno son el polisomnograma nocturno y los cuestionarios. Desarrollo. Clasificacion de las alteraciones del sueno: inmadurez cerebral (desestructuracion del sueno que puede generar por si misma alteracion del neurodesarrollo, semejante a demencias organicas del adulto), disfuncionalidad (variaciones en la eficiencia y calidad del sueno, sin desorganizacion) y paroxismos (presencia de actividad epileptiforme mono o multifocal. Conclusiones. No existe alteracion de los mecanismos reguladores del sueno, salvo en la evolucion posterior del sindrome de Rett. Las alteraciones de la arquitectura del sueno en TGD y trastorno por deficit de atencion-hiperactividad no llegan a presentar signos de desestructuracion, mas bien son de tipo funcional, en la estabilidad y eficiencia del sueno. Los paroxismos epileptiformes con o sin crisis, frecuentes en estos trastornos, resultan mas prevalentes cuanto mas grave es el cuadro clinico. El tratamiento debe encaminarse a mejorar la eficiencia del sueno mediante pautas de higiene combinadas con farmacos especificos segun la situacion clinica.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Complex examination of 311 patients with chronic gastritis allows to differentiate three clinical types of this disease. The first type is characterized by superficial mucous disorders with constant or increased secretory function and motility of the stomach. It has relapsing course with moderate decrease of patient's life quality. The abdominal pains and dyspepsia are observed only at periods of exacerbation. Anxiety-phobic and anxiety-depressive tendencies prevail in the mental status. The attitude to illness differs mainly by emotional-willed disorders. Insomnia is manifested by a slight delay in awakening. Focal atrophic gastritis with moderate decrease in secretory and motor functions of the stomach is typical for the second type. It develops as relapsing or monotonous suffering with insignificant decrease in patient's life quality. The pains and dyspepsia in residual state persist after exacerbation reduction. The changes in the mental status are rare. The patient's attitude to the illness is basically adequate. Slight disturbances of falling asleep prevail among sleep disorders. Diffuse atrophic gastritis with secretory failure reaching the degree of an achlorhydria and hypokinesis of stomach are observed in the third type. The course of the disease is basically monotonous with pronounced decrease in patient's life quality, with the obstinate abdominal pains and dyspepsia irrespective of the exacerbation phases of chronic gastritis. A combination of asthenic and neurotic complaints and combined sleep disorders are typical. Emotional disorders with disharmonization of personality accompanied by signs of their social and mental disadaptation are observed in the patient's mental status.",

This syndrome is characterized by panic, flight, and anxiety during the actual event, which are followed by a relatively prolonged period of exclusion from consciousness of painful memories. Besides, there may be observed neurotic symptoms manifesting themselves in a decrease in proficiency level, refusal to establish contacts with other people, and mental digestion of the events. Assimilation of the events by intensive psychotherapy seems to be possible within about six months.

      "abstract": "The immediate response to the traumatic event in individuals who may develop ASD2 or PTSD involves intense fear, helplessness or horror. ASD is experienced during or immediately after the trauma, lasts for at least 2 days, and either resolves within 4 weeks or the diagnosis has to be adjusted. A diagnosis of PTSD may be appropriate provided the full criteria for PTSD are met [2]. Of individuals who respond to the trauma with intense fear or horror 15–35% will eventually develop a significant degree of dysfunction and distress [3], namely PTSD, for a considerable length of time. The PTSD symptoms can be grouped into three main clusters. The first is persistent re-experience of the traumatic event, such as recurrent dreams and flashbacks. The second is persistent avoidance of internal or external cues associated with the trauma, such as avoiding thoughts, avoiding activities, diminished interest, detachment, restricted affect, and sense of foreshortened future. The third is increased arousal, which is manifested as difficulty in concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response [2]. The marked discrepancy between the proportion of the general population exposed to traumatic events and the proportion that ultimately fulfills the criteria for PTSD is a challenging aspect of the study of stress-related disorders. Identification of factors that increase vulnerability of individuals and factors that increase resilience may have important implications in public health.

Central nervous system hyperarousal, either as pre-existing and/or induced by psychiatric pathology and worsened by stressful events, as well as aging- and menopause-related physiological decline of sleep mechanisms appears to be at the core of this common sleep disorder. Finally, there is emerging evidence that the levels of physiologic hyperarousal are directly related to the degree of polysomnographically documented sleep disturbance in insomnia patients, suggesting that objective measures of sleep duration in insomnia may be a useful marker of the medical severity of the disorder.",

      "title": "Walking abnormalities in children",
      "abstract": "Walking is a spontaneous movement termed locomotion that is promoted by activation of antigravity muscles by serotonergic (5HT) neurons. Development of antigravity activity follows 3 developmental epochs of the sleep-wake (S-W) cycle and is modulated by particular 5HT neurons in each epoch. Activation of antigravity activities occurs in the first epoch (around the age of 3 to 4 months) as restriction of atonia in rapid eye movement (REM) stage and development of circadian S-W cycle. These activities strengthen in the second epoch, with modulation of day-time sleep and induction of crawling around the age of 8 months and induction of walking by 1 year. Around the age of 1 year 6 months, absence of guarded walking and interlimb cordination is observed along with modulation of day-time sleep to once in the afternoon. Bipedal walking in upright position occurs in the third epoch, with development of a biphasic S-W cycle by the age of 4-5 years. Patients with infantile autism (IA), Rett syndrome (RTT), or Tourette syndrome (TS) show failure in the development of the first, second, or third epoch, respectively. Patients with IA fail to develop interlimb coordination; those with RTT, crawling and walking; and those with TS, walking in upright posture. Basic pathophysiology underlying these condition is failure in restricting atonia in REM stage; this induces dysfunction of the pedunculopontine nucleus and consequently dys- or hypofunction of the dopamine (DA) neurons. DA hypofunction in the developing brain, associated with compensatory upward regulation of the DA receptors causes psychobehavioral disorders in infancy (IA), failure in synaptogenesis in the frontal cortex and functional development of the motor and associate cortexes in late infancy through the basal ganglia (RTT), and failure in functional development of the prefrontal cortex through the basal ganglia (TS). Further, locomotion failure in early childhood causes failure in development of functional specialization of the cortex through the spinal stepping generator-fastigial nucleus-thalamus-cortex pathway. Early detection of locomotion failure and early adjustment of this condition through environmental factors can prevent the development of higher cortical dysfunction.",

Whether these decrements are caused by short sleep duration or extended wakefulness is unknown. In this study, healthy volunteers were randomized into either a chronically sleep-restricted or control protocol while living on a 20-h “day,” thus enabling short sleep without extended wakefulness. We demonstrate that chronic insufficient sleep, even without extended wakefulness, leads to neurobehavioral performance decrements at all times of the day, even when the circadian system is promoting arousal. These findings have implications for the understanding of basic physiology, the substantial population who chronically obtains insufficient sleep, and all of us who depend on sleep-restricted individuals working in safety-sensitive occupations.",

In the depressive phase, patients also reveal insomnia/hypersomnia, difficulty waking up and excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep pattern fluctuations are frequent in bipolar disorders and have a great clinic implication as a symptom.

      "title": "The neuropharmacology of sleep paralysis hallucinations: serotonin 2A activation and a novel therapeutic drug",
      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis is a state of involuntary immobility occurring at sleep onset or offset, often accompanied by uncanny \"ghost-like\" hallucinations and extreme fear reactions. I provide here a neuropharmacological account for these hallucinatory experiences by evoking the role of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Research has shown that 5-HT2AR activation can induce visual hallucinations, \"mystical\" subjective states, and out-of-body experiences (OBEs), and modulate fear circuits. Hallucinatory experiences triggered by serotonin-serotonergic (\"pseudo\") hallucinations, induced by hallucinogenic drugs-tend to be \"dream-like\" with the experiencer having insight (\"meta-awareness\") that he is hallucinating, unlike dopaminergic (\"psychotic\" and \"life-like\") hallucinations where such insight is lost. Indeed, hallucinatory experiences during sleep paralysis have the classic features of serotonergic hallucinations, and are strikingly similar to perceptual and subjective states induced by hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin), i.e., they entail visual hallucinations, mystical experiences, OBEs, and extreme fear reactions. I propose a possible mechanism whereby serotonin could be functionally implicated in generating sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions through 5-HT2AR activity. Moreover, I speculate on the role of 5-HT2C receptors vis-à-vis anxiety and panic during sleep paralysis, and the orbitofrontal cortex-rich with 5-HT2A receptors-in influencing visual pathways during sleep paralysis, and, in effect, hallucinations. Finally, I propose, for the first time, a drug to target sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions, namely the selective 5-HT2AR inverse agonist, pimavanserin. This account implicates gene HTR2A on chromosome 13q as the underlying cause of sleep paralysis hallucinations and could be explored using positron emission tomography.",

Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

      "title": "Current Problems in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Insomnia",
      "abstract": "CURRENT PROBLEMS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA QUENTIN R. REGESTEIN* and PETER REICHf Recently, interest has grown in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Over 2 decades of laboratory research have yielded information that may further rationalize treatment ofdisordered sleep. Reviews have appeared discussing newer understanding and treatments for sleep problems [1, 2], and attempts are being made to forge standardized classifications for sleep disorders. Special clinics for the management of these problems are now being organized upon the notion that greater specificity in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders is at hand. Insomnia is perhaps the most common sleep disorder faced by physicians . Insomnia must be distinguished from lack of sleep. Only a tinyfraction of insomniacs is ever objectively examined for the amount of sleep actually obtained, and such examinations when done last but 1 or 2 nights. The results of the examination, when done, are not always consistent with the patient's estimation of sleep loss, yet the patient may continue to complain of insomnia in the absence of objective substantiation ofsleep loss and persist in his demands for relief. For these reasons, we define insomnia as the complaint of sleep loss. Despite the years of clinical experience in treating insomnia and the added understanding of sleep more recently accrued from research, there remain several problems that prevent agreement on how to classify insomnia. Specificity in diagnosing and treating insomnia is therefore hindered. This paper is meant to articulate these problems in order to reconcile for the practitioner the broad, prolonged clinical experience accumulated with insomnia and the relative lack of specificity for its treatment. We will attempt to describe some of the difficulties surround- *Sleep Clinic, Division of Psychiatry, Department of Medicine, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, 721 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02115; associate in medicine and assistant professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School. tPhysician, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital; and associate professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School.© 1978 by The University of Chicago. 0031-5982/78/2102-0006S01.00 232 I Quentin R. Regestein and Peter Reich ¦ Chronic Insomnia ing both the diagnosis and the treatment of insomnia, in order, we hope, to guide further attempts to understand and relieve insomnia patients. Diagnosis Five percent of adult patients from a general medical practice presented complained of insomnia [3], 20 percent in a similar group admitted some sort of sleep disturbance [3], and 45 percent of adults in an epidemiological survey reported difficulties in falling asleep or staying asleep [4]. This remarkable prevalence may contribute to the lack of systematic classification for insomnia. Chronic insomnia is so common that some may consider it a normal experience rather than a pathological problem [5]. Although chronic insomnia may signify severe mental or physical derangement and correlate with augmented death rates [6], much insomnia is mild and temporary. A complaint that subsides rather than persists excites little interest. Nevertheless, much insomnia remains chronic, poses great difficulty for patient and practitioner, and still remains unclassified. The frequency of psychopathology among insomniac patients provides a second reason why insomnia has not been classified. Insomnia can stem from mental problems of all kinds, and many of these are not rapidly treatable. Chronic insomniacs are said to be complaining, oversensitive people [7]. In two series ofinsomnia patients, over 85% ofthose 274 subjects tested showed pathological scores on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, an elevation in the depression scale being most common [8, 9]. Even poor sleepers, discovered through research questionnaires rather than through clinical practice, prove to be anxious, depressed, obsessively worried types [10]. Furthermore, many insomniac patients depend on drugs [H]. Chronic insomnia, therefore, associated with chronic psychological troubles and complicated by drug abuse, may be considered an unattractive problem by many physicians. In these respects it resembles alcoholism by inviting disproportionately small clinical interest. Perhaps, for this reason, characterizing insomnia has recently been left to the psychiatrists, even though prescribing for insomnia is done mostly by other physicians [12]. Certain difficulties arise whenever conditions involving much psychopathology are categorized. The rich diversity of personalities and psychological disorders are not neatly categorized. They are, furthermore , enmeshed in the unique complexity of behavioral traits that characterize every person. Psychiatric nosology, therefore...",

      "abstract": "The relevance of the work is due to the fact that the professional activities of law enforcement officers in wartime conditions have become as close as possible in terms of content to the performance of combat missions. In this context, the issues of violations of law enforcement officers' adaptation to a new extreme professional environment have become relevant. The purpose of our work was to identify the most informative markers of law enforcement officers' maladaptation in conditions of participation in combat operations. Maladaptation in the work is presented as a violation of a person's adaptation to environmental changes, which is manifested by inadequate reactions to the nature of stimuli. The most common psychological phenomena that indicate a breakdown of compensatory mechanisms of the psyche and precede maladaptive disorders are: nervous demobilization syndrome, stressful search activity, torpid reaction, which manifests itself in a boring, disoriented state; reaction of dissociation of subject and object, indefinite temporary state, illusion of false invulnerability (frivolity, reckless actions, etc.), pseudo-primitivism (indifference, passive submission and apathy), delusion of grandeur in miniature, experience of loss of the future (feeling of inner emptiness and meaninglessness of existence), temporary addictive behaviour (aggressiveness, use of alcohol and drugs, etc.). It has been established that the psychological state of police combatants is influenced by a number of factors, the timely processing of which significantly reduces the level of maladaptive disorders. Such factors include the lack of combat experience and appropriate behavioural patterns, knowledge of what to do in a particular combat situation, necessary developed skills and abilities, clear organization, and, conversely, the presence of a negative example from a commander or reference persons, death, injury of colleagues, and personal level of response.",

Dreams offer unique insights into the patients' brains, minds, and emotions. Based on neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies, the biological core of dreaming stands on some brain areas activated or inactivated. Dream abnormalities in neurological disorders include a reduction / cessation of dreaming, an increase in dream frequency, changes in dream contents and accompaniments, and the occurrence of dreamlike experiences (hallucinations) mainly during the wake- -sleep/sleep-wake transitions. Dream changes can be associated with several neurological conditions, and the unfolding of biological knowledge about dream experiences can also have significance in clinical practice. Regarding the dream importance in clinical neurological management, the aim of this paper encompasses a summary of sleep stages, dreams neurobiology including brain areas involved in the dreams, memory, and dreams, besides Dreams in the aging people and neurodegenerative disorders.",

SRVAs typically involve running off the road or into the back of another vehicle, with no braking beforehand. Because of a high impact speed these accidents are often serious. SRVAs peak around 02:00h-06:00h and 14:00h-16:00h, when daily sleepiness is naturally higher. Hence, time of day is a critical factor, as important as the duration of the drive. Most SRVAs are not due to sleep pathology. Many are work-related. Non-sleeping rest is no substitute for sleep. Sleep does not occur spontaneously without warning, and is preceded by feelings of increasing sleepiness of which drivers are quite aware. Driving impairment is usually worse than is realised by the sleepy driver. The best countermeasure is sleep, or even a short nap. Even more effective is the combination of a nap with caffeine.",

They are mainly nocturnal and often progress to convulsions. Consciousness is usually impaired from onset or during the ictus. By definition, seizures lasting for more than half an hour are status epilepticus. In one third of these children, the phase of deviation of the eyes with vomiting and impairment of consciousness is prolonged for more than 30 minutes (partial status epilepticus) and usually ends with generalised convulsions. A typical case is of a child who wakes up from sleep agitated, vomiting, eyes deviated to one side, and who may or may not be able to communicate for minutes to hours before hemiconvulsions or generalised convulsions begin. Onset is between 1–12 years, peak is at 5 years, and remission occurs within 1–2 years from onset. In one third of the patients, seizures or even partial status epilepticus are single events in the child’s life.

      "abstract": "The passage from trivial snoring to heavy snorer's disease or obstructive apnea syndrome is a subtle and gradual process. The suspect clinical signs of this process are primarily the onset of intermittent snoring and daytime sleepiness. We propose a diagnostic assessment based on objective monitoring of respiratory behaviour (noise of snoring, endothoracic pressure, SaO2) during sleep and the tendency to daytime drowsiness (by means of the so-called multiple sleep latency test, MSLT). These parameters establish not only the presence of a disease state, but also give a fairly accurate indication of the different stages of the disease. The nocturnal respiratory pattern emerging from this objective assessment can be divided into four stages: stage 0 (or preclinical), with sporadic obstructive apneas; stage I (or initial), with obstructive apneas persisting during light (st. 1-2) and REM sleep; stage II (or overt), with obstructive apneas persisting for the whole length of sleep; stage III (or complicated), with alveolar hypoventilation persisting during wakefulness. In stage 0, episodes of O2 desaturation are sporadically present and linked to obstructive apneas or hypopneas. In stages I-II, phasic desaturations are correlated with the apneas. In stage II and above all stage III, phasic desaturation is associated with persistent falls of Sao2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The most prevalent sleep disorder, insomnia, includes difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, waking up too early, and non-restorative or poor quality sleep. Primary sleep disturbances are thought to be a disorder of hyperarousal, while a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction has also been confirmed. Secondary sleep disorders have been associated with a large number of potential causes, both physical and psychological. Sleep disturbances in palliative care can be due to either the advanced disease and/or its treatment.

      "abstract": "Drivers' sleepiness and falling asleep while driving account for a considerable proportion of vehicle accidents (studies show different results from 1% to 30%). Sleepiness is rarely well recognised as a causing factor of traffic accidents. 2.5% up to 20% people suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) with sleep deprivation as its most frequent cause. There is a strong association between sleep deprivation and medical problems--especially sleep disturbances. The sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) has been identified as the most common cause of habitual drowsy driving. Patients with SAS (apart from other health problems) are 6 times more likely to have accidents. After adequate treatment of severe SAS with continuous positive airway pressure the risk of accident lowered 5 x. Other important sleep disturbances include chronic insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement in sleep. Sleepiness was described in Parkinson's disease, dementia, epilepsy, in chronic cardiacs and in people with complex internal health problems. Regular or single intake of drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistaminics, antipsychotics and others) can itself induce sleep problems. Sleepiness in persons without sleep disorder may occur due to preventable causes such as poor sleep habits which lead to sleep deprivation.",

Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

In delayed sleep phase syndrome, patients may experience “sleep drunkenness” upon awakening, with confusion, disorientation, and impaired motor coordination. Generally individuals suffer with disturbances of circadian rhythm for years before getting treatment. Treatment approaches often involve a carefully planned, gradual shifting of sleep time and the use of melatonin as well as the bright light therapy that are timed carefully, depending on the clinical situation.

      "title": "Isn’t it Time to Use Opioid Drugs in Emergency Medical Services?",
      "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant feeling and experience that is caused by a potential or practical injury and its control is so important that the American Pain Society has introduced pain as the 5 th vital sign for emphasizing the importance of pain and controlling it. Almost all humans have experienced moderate to severe pain and most of the time the experience has happened following surgical procedures, medical conditions or trauma. When pain manifests in a clinical condition, health care staff are responsible for following it and relieving it as a goal and responsibility. Pain affects all individuals regardless of age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status and untreated pain can negatively affect various systems of the body and lead to many consequences. Increase in serum level of cortisol, nor epinephrine, and renin angiotension, hyperglycemia, decrease in insulin, manifestation of anxiety, cardiac effects such as ischemia, dysrhythmia, increase in pulse, increase in cardiac load, increased oxygen uptake, increased blood coagulation potential, hypertension especially in patients with head injuries, decreased blood oxygen level, increased body fluid volume, drop in blood potassium, fatigue, muscle cramps, decreased immune system function, decreased ability for wound healing and etc. are among the undesirable side effects of pain. In addition, not treating acute pains also leads to bearing unnecessary pain, elongated duration of hospitalization, increased medical costs and probability of acute pain progressing and developing into chronic pain. The financial burden of not treating pain in America has been estimated to be about 100 billion dollars per year. Pain is a common complaint and makes up a considerable portion of reasons that patients call pre-hospital emergency services and is usually present in the injured and trauma patients. Study results showed that 20% to 31% of the patients presenting via ambulances had moderate and severe pain. Additionally, with 52% to 86% prevalence in emergencies, pain is a key topic in health care of various countries. Pre-hospital emergency staff members are the first in line among health care staff that face patients at times of disaster and accident and are more exposed to the patients’ pain. Despite the quantitative growth of pre-hospital emergency bases to 1900 bases throughout Iran, observations of researchers and evidence and instructions of emergency medical services (EMS) of Iran are indicative of not using enough analgesic drugs, especially opioid analgesic drugs, as a means to relieve patients’ pain in EMS ambulances. Some studies have mentioned that about one third of the pre-hospital patients and more than 80% of patients with bone fractures report moderate to severe pain and on the other hand the positive effect of using pain killers in the regions that used them have been shown to be obvious in most patients. It seems that using analgesics in EMS is a very important topic and researchers express that proper pain management is an important principle in pre-hospital care and opioid analgesics such as morphine and fentanyl have a special place in the instructions of EMS as treatments for acute trauma and non-trauma pains, especially cardiac chest pains, in some advanced countries regarding emergency care. Considering the afore-mentioned points concerning the importance of pain and its treatment, especially the importance of treating pain in traumatic and ischemic cardiac diseases, high prevalence of pain in pre-hospital missions, severity and type of pre-hospital missions, which are mostly associated with pain, high costs of not treating pain and the obvious need for using pain killers in trauma and ischemic cardiac diseases, isn’t it time to introduce a more effective and scientific approach in EMS? Isn’t it better to add a few types of analgesics and opioid drugs to the equipment provided at patients’ bedside, at least for ischemic cardiac diseases and severe trauma? Although the result of a study carried out in Khuzestan province showed that EMS staff members were weak regarding drug information and calculations and other studies have also expressed that drug dosage and use of opioid drugs might not be done correctly or opioid drugs might be abused in some cases, none are convincing reasons for not using these drugs. These problems could be solved by more and better training for EMS staff, creating offline and online protocols and useful programs for preventing abuse of analgesic drugs and these drugs could be effectively used in EMS. Therefore, we again note that this treatment priority should not be overlooked for any reason.",

      "title": "“Tweeting” Seizures in a Patient with Tuberous Sclerosis with Refractory Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Cognitive, emotional, autonomic findings, automatisms, and clinical features as motor and sensory symptoms can occur in focal epileptic seizures. Focal seizures often originate from the temporal lobe, and the mesial temporal and amygdalohippocampal areas are commonly associated origins. Aura is frequently seen in temporal lobe seizures, and automatisms are one of the most prominent manifestations. Early head-turning, which is not usually forceful, is mostly ipsilateral and typically co-occurs with a dystonic posture in the contralateral upper extremity.[1] Postictal aphasia is commonly related to dominant temporal seizures.[2] The frontal lobe is known to be the second most common origin of focal-onset seizures after the temporal lobe. Many different seizure types can occur in frontal lobe seizures. Asymmetrical tonic or postural seizures are usually related to the involvement of the supplementary motor area. A nonspecific aura may precede frontal lobe seizures with impaired consciousness that start abruptly and are accompanied by bizarre behaviors and agitation. Misdiagnosis as a psychogenic seizure may result in challenging patient management. Although the semiology of seizures is beneficial regarding lateralization of the lobe where the seizure originates, semiologic findings can become confusing by the spread of ictal discharges to other parts of the hemisphere. It is essential to remember that seizures originating from the frontal lobe may propagate to the temporal lobe and imitate clinical signs typical of temporal lobe seizures. Ictal whistling is an extremely rare presentation, and ictal onset in electroencephalography (EEG) is defined primarily from the temporal lobe. It has also rarely been shown to originate from the frontal lobe.[3] Herein, we present a patient with tuberous sclerosis complex disorder and treatment-resistant seizures, accompanied by different types of whistling, one was like \"tweeting,\" who achieved significant benefits from everolimus treatment. A 34-year-old right-handed male patient had his first seizure when he was aged 13 years old when he was asleep at night, which manifested with screaming, snapping fingers, whistling, and kicking with his foot. He describes a strange feeling in his epigastric area before some but not all seizures. Afterward, his family describes hand automatisms, loss of awareness, whistling, snapping fingers, and pulling at his clothes. The patient is amnestic for this period. Despite multiple anti-seizure drug regimens, including valproic acid, carbamazepine, topiramate, levetiracetam, lacosamide, and zonisamide, the frequency of seizures continued once or twice per week. Due to the increased frequency of seizures to three to four times per week, the patient was admitted to the video EEG monitoring unit to differentiate between epileptic–nonepileptic seizures while he was receiving maximum doses of valproic acid, lacosamide, levetiracetam, and zonisamide polytherapy. Angiofibromas in the malar area on his face and ungual fibromas were noticed during hospitalization [Figure 1]. The patient was consulted by the dermatology department, and a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex was made according to the clinical criteria. In the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an increase in the focal sulcus distance, remodeling in the tabula interna in the bifrontoparietal region, and focal thickenings were detected in the calvarium. There were no cortical tubers [Figure 2]. In positron emission tomography–computed tomography, minimal hypometabolism was seen in the bilateral temporal lobe anterior cortex. Multiple angiomyolipomas were detected in the contrast-enhanced MRI of the abdomen.Figure 1: Black arrows indicate anjiofibromas involving the malar regions of the face (a) and ungual fibromas on the toes (b)Figure 2: White arrows indicate the increase in the focal sulcus distance and remodeling in the tabula interna in the bifrontoparietal region and focal thickenings in the coronal T2 brain magnetic resonance imaging (a), and hypometabolism in the bilateral temporal lobe anterior cortex in coronal slices of F18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (b)In video EEG monitorization, electrode placement was made according to the International 10–20 system with the addition of extra temporal electrodes (corresponding to positions T1 and T2). During monitorization, we recorded three seizures with the same clinical and electrophysiologic findings [Video 1]. First, the patient screamed, whistled briefly and loudly, and shook both hands. A head deviation that was not forceful was observed for a few seconds concurrent with hand clapping. Afterward, flexor dystonic posture occurred in the left hand while the right hand simultaneously rubbed his face. After 2 to 3 s, a low tone finger snapping started repeatedly on the right hand. Then, automatisms were observed in both hands, such as clapping hands and clothes pulling, predominantly in the genital area. The patient started to whistle softly and repeatedly like a tweeting bird. At the end of the seizure, he wiped his nose with his right hand. He nodded his head in a yes response to questions but could not respond verbally. This behavior gave the impression of regained partial awareness with aphasia. {\"href\":\"Single Video Player\",\"role\":\"media-player-id\",\"content-type\":\"play-in-place\",\"position\":\"float\",\"orientation\":\"portrait\",\"label\":\"Video Clip 1\",\"caption\":\"\",\"object-id\":[{\"pub-id-type\":\"doi\",\"id\":\"\"},{\"pub-id-type\":\"other\",\"content-type\":\"media-stream-id\",\"id\":\"1_3bejt9gl\"},{\"pub-id-type\":\"other\",\"content-type\":\"media-source\",\"id\":\"Kaltura\"}]} In EEG, concurrent with the beginning of the seizure, widespread low-amplitude fast-frequency activity started. After 10 s, diffuse muscle artifacts appeared for 2–3 s during the whistling and screaming. Immediately afterward, the EEG evolved to rhythmic slow spike and delta waves in both frontotemporoparietal areas with right dominancy, which continued for about 70 s, with a higher amplitude in the right hemisphere. At the end of the seizure, the amplitude and frequency decreased within 10 s and then ended. In the postictal period, there was a widespread voltage depression that lasted for 30 s, and then background activity returned to normal. During the video EEG monitorization, there were sharp slow wave discharges with phase confrontations in the F8-T2 and T2-T4 electrodes on the right hemisphere in the interictal period. Everolimus treatment was started on the patient who had renal angiomyolipomas and seizures resistant to polytherapy. After the 2nd month of treatment, the frequency of seizures decreased to 3 to 4 per month, and the patient was reportedly seizure-free after the 4th month of treatment. We first gradually reduced and then stopped the zonisamide treatment. The valproic acid treatment was also tapered and stopped at the 6th month of the everolimus treatment because the patient reported tremors in his hands. DISCUSSION Whistling seizures have been rarely described in the literature, with only eight cases reported, most of which were primarily associated with the temporal lobe and rarely with the frontal lobe.[3-8] It was also reported as postictal whistling in a patient with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome with generalized epileptic discharges and was associated with the involvement of multiple networks.[9] No lateralizing finding could be detected at the beginning of the EEG of our patient during different nonverbal vocalizations after short-term high-volume whistling. However, the time-match scalp EEG record showing generalized low amplitude fast frequency activity, and the left hand's dystonic posture were signs of frontal lobe origin. However, when the \"tweeting\" occurred, the rhythmic electrical activity evolved to bilateral frontotemporoparietal regions with higher amplitudes at the right hemisphere. Controversial reports exist regarding the lateralizing value of ictal whistling. Right temporal lobe focus examples have been described more frequently in the literature. It has been suggested that whistling seizures are often associated with complex motor behaviors due to the involvement of the nondominant hemisphere.[6] However, in functional MRI studies, early activation in the left supplementary motor area and the presupplementary motor area was observed in right-handed individuals during whistling.[10] It has been suggested that this area is effective in the onset of whistling. The ongoing whistling process continues through a more comprehensive bihemispheric network that includes structures such as the premotor cortex, cingulate cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, and amygdala.[10] Other motor findings of our patient, such as the dystonic posture in the left hand and postictal nose wiping with the right hand, indicate activation of the right hemisphere. Another finding in our patient was that finger snapping could occur in frontal and temporal epilepsy. Finger snapping that occurs once and loudly has been attributed to the frontal region in the literature.[11] Otherwise, temporal finger snapping occurs repeatedly. It is less loud, as in our patient, the finger snap occurred in the later phase of the seizure simultaneously with the bifrontotemporal EEG activity appearance.[12] All seizures of our patient in the video EEG monitoring unit started with widespread rapid activity and continued with ictal activity in both frontotemporoparietal regions with right dominancy as the tweeting began. This finding supports the idea that tweeting occurs with the activation of multifunctional networks in different brain regions. In our patient, the left dystonic posture and right nasal wiping point to the right hemisphere, but postictal aphasia is localized to the dominant hemisphere, most likely the left. The patient was right-handed, and most probably, the left hemisphere was dominant in this patient, yet a functional MRI could not be performed. We think such complexity regarding semiologic features is related to the fast temporal evolving model. Invasive EEG electrode placement may be informative about seizure onset and evaluation. Nevertheless, the contribution of the interhemispheric connections needs to be clarified. In conclusion, whistling seizures are extremely rare presentations of focal epileptic seizures. Our case report is rare and unique with tweeting seizure phonology. Furthermore, two types of whistling appeared in the same seizure; short and sharp whistling showing the frontal lobe, and tweeting, indicating temporal lobe involvement.

Respiration during wakefulness is influenced by not only automatic control but also voluntary and behavioral control. Sleep is associated with definite changes in respiratory function. With the onset of sleep, voluntary control of ventilation that overrides automatic control during wakefulness becomes terminated. Also ventilatory response to various stimuli including hypoxemia and hypercapnia is decreased. With these reasons respiration during sleep becomes fragile and unstable so that marked hypoxemia can be happened in patients with lung disease especially during REM sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea may also be developed if upper airway resistance is increased in addition to these blunted ventilatory responses.",

The purpose in removing symptoms may include trying to prevent suicide, restoring work and interpersonal function, or enhancing the patient's capacity to participate in psychotherapy.

      "abstract": "Anksiotnost (strah, tjeskoba) neizbježni su u svakodnevnom životu. Ona je prirodna reakcija na situaciju koju doživljavamo kao prijetecu ili koja nas zabrinjava. Anksioznost kao simptom postoji u svim psihickim poremecajima, ali kao primarni simptom javlja se u anksioznim, stresom uzrokovanim i somatoformnim poremecajima. Anksioznost kao psihicki poremecaj ukljucuje i specificne simptome koji dovode do neurobioloske disfunkcije, te zahtijevaju posebne terapijske procedure, a smanjuju socijalnu i radnu sposobnost. Simptomi karakteristicni za anksioznost dijele se na psiholoske i tjelesne simptome. Psiholoski simptomi su: pretjerana plasljivost i strahovanje, osjecaj unutarnje napetosti i nemira, smetnje koncentacije, pojacana osjetljivost na buku, smetnje spavanja, smetnje u pamcenju. Tjelesni se simptomi mogu ocitovati na gotovo svim organskim sustavima. Karakteristicni su : kardiovaskularni, respiratorni, gastrointestinalni, genito-urinarni, neuroloski. Anksiozni poremecaji praceni su visokom stopom suicidalnosti, a predisponiraju i za razvoj raznovrsnih psihosomatskih bolesti.\r\n Psiholoske teorije anksioznost objasnjavaju kao premjestanje intrapsihickog konflikta (psihodinamski model), te kao fenomen uvjetovanja (kognitivno bihevioralni model).\r\n Psihodinamska teorija anksioznost objasnjava kao konflikt između ida i ega.\r\n Kognitivna teorija anksioznost objasnjava kao tendenciju prekomjerne procjene potencijala za opasnost.\r\n Dijagnoza se temelji na pažljivo prikupljenoj anamnezi, procjeni psihickog i somatskog statusa te ucinjenih somatskih pregleda i pretraga.\r\n Najcesci anksiozni poremecaji su:\r\n *generalizirani anksiozni poremecaj\r\n *panicni poremecaj\r\n *fobije\r\n *anksiozno depresivni poremecaj\r\n *opsesivno kompulzivni poremecaj\r\n *anksioznost u organskih bolesnika\r\n *posttraumatski stresni poremecaj\r\n Lijecenje se sastoji od kombinacije farmakoterapije i psihoterapije.\r\n Provodi se ambulantno i bolnicki. Pri hospitalizaciji bolesnika medicinska sestra najcesce je prvi strucnjak koji dolazi u kontakt s njim. U radu sa psihijatrijskim bolesnikom medicinska sestra se pridržava nacela zdravstvene njege psihijatrijskog bolesnika. Medicinska sestra prati bolesnika prilikom boravka na odjelu u njegovim aktivnostima u koje je ukljucen na odjelu, susrece se sa pacijentovom obitelji, uocava promjene i izvjestava lijecnika i strucni tim.\r\n Osnova cjelokupnog terapijskog djelovanja u radu medicinske sestre s anksioznim bolesnicima usmjerena je na smanjenje tenzija. Medicinska sestra svojom emocionalnom toplinom, spremnoscu da razumije i reagira stvara i produbljuje odnos između nje i bolesnika. Spremnost medicinske sestre da razgovara sa pacijentom daje pacijentu osjecaj da se sestra brine za njega i da mu pruža sigurnost, te da ga prihvaca sa svim manama i vrlinama.",

      "abstract": "A 25-year-old man with essential startle disease has been reported. He had a history of sudden jerks and falls in response to unexpected stimuli. Abnormal falling developed when he learned to walk. No similar cases are known in his family. Physical examination revealed hyperreflexia. Pathologic startle reflex was elicited by light touching on the patient's nose, clapping or making other noises. EEG response to startle stimuli consisted of spikes recorded from both centroparietooccipital regions immediately preceding diffuse muscle and movement artifacts. The motor responses to auditory stimuli, which are startle reflex on the orbicularis oculi, sternocleidomastoid, biceps and quadriceps femoris muscles, habituated within 2–4 trials. Electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist elicited a consistent C reflex (cortical long loop reflex) but not any giant cortical somatosensory evoked potentials. Our patient showed early disease onset and habituation of motor response, which are not seen in other essential hyperekplexia cases, and clinically differs from the patients with hereditary hyperekplexia in which neonatal rigidity, epilepsy, apneic attacks, low intelligence, congenital dislocated hips and inguinal hernia can be seen in differing frequency.",

Primitive reflexes develop in the womb, are present at birth in the full-term neonate. Postural reflexes emerge after birth and take up to three and a half years to be fully developed. Collectively, abnormality in the profile of these two groups of reflexes provides indications of neurological dysfunction or neurological immaturity. Spinal reflexes function at the base of the hierarchical control system. A weak or absent Moro reflex is seen in cases of upper motor neuron lesions; an asymmetrical Moro reflex at birth may indicate a fractured clavicle or an Erb's palsy. The fear paralysis reflex is a highly alert but immobile state involving one or several following physical changes.",

Epileptic fits, unlike hysterical, appear more frequently not during the crucial phase of emotions, but after several hours or days of a psychic traumatization. The psychogenic factor as a rule is not reflected in the psychopathological structure of the disease. In the process of the disease the psychogenic influence leads to different neurotic conditions (depressive, asthenical, hysterical, phobic) which complicate the psychopathological picture of epilepsy. The epileptic fits as well as other expressions of the disorder also exert certain psychogenic influences.",

      "abstract": "The association of a constellation of sleep disturbances in adults with major depressive episodes is perhaps the most robust and widely replicated abnormality in psychobiological studies of psychiatric disorders. Reduced sleep efficiency, deficits of slow wave sleep (SWS), reduced latency to the first rapid eye movement (REM) period, an increase of REM sleep time, and increased density of rapid eye movements (REMD) during REM sleep are strongly associated with depressive illness in most samples (Benca, Obermeyer, Thisted, & Gillin, 1992). Studies of children, adolescents, and young adults with major depressive episodes find similar sleep disruptions, although only partially expressed relative to findings in adults. As Table 15.1 summarizes, certain studies of adolescents with major depression have reported increased REM density, reduced sleep latency, increased time to sleep onset, and increased arousals, whereas others have found mixed results or no differences with nondepressed controls. Even in adults, the specificity of the association of disturbed sleep parameters with the state of depression has been questioned (Benca, Obermeyer, Thisted, & Gillin, 1992). In general, however, the changes in sleep macroarchitecture have been strongly connected to core features of depressive illness and likely parallel aspects of the underlying pathophysiology of severe depression.",

Additionally 4 cases from our own experience were presented with neurophysiological and clinical aspects.Discussion on REM and NREM sleep, its phases and alternating share according to child's age was conducted. Sleep disorders were in accordance with their international classification. Parasomnias, occupying most of the space, were divided in two groups: primary and secondary. Among primary parasomnias disorders associated with falling asleep (sleep myoclonus, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rhythmic movement disorder, restless legs syndrome) are important. Another disorders are parasomians associated with light NREM sleep (bruxism, periodic limb movement disorder) and with deeper NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnabulism, night terrors), with REM sleep (nightmares, REM sleep behavior disorder) and associated with NREM and REM sleep (catathrenia, sleep enuresis, sleep talking). Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and epileptic seizures occurring during sleep also play an important role. Frontal lobe epilepsy and Panayiotopoulos syndrome should be considered in the first place in such cases.

Given that approximately half the brain circuits are involved in vision and the control of eye movements, a concussion frequently results in visual symptoms. Ophthalmic abnormalities are helpful in the assessment of acute concussion, identified by rapid automized naming tasks and eye movement assessments. In particular, convergence, eye-tracking and the vestibular-ocular motor screening tool may be used. For patients suffering from post-concussion syndrome more than 3 months from the original injury, abnormalities may be found in convergence, accommodation and smooth pursuit. Orthoptic exercises are useful rehabilitation tools to allow patients to return to school, work and recreation.

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

      "abstract": "Time for primary review 28 days.\n\nMore than any other organ of the body, brain integrity depends on the continuous blood supply of oxygen and glucose for covering the energy demands of the tissue. Cessation or severe reduction of blood flow results in almost instantaneous biochemical and functional deficits which become rapidly irreversible unless blood flow is promptly restored. The ischemia time that is tolerated by the brain depends, among others, on the density of ischemia, the tissue concentration of primary and secondary energy stores and the rate of energy consumption which, in turn, depends on the temperature, the degree of functional activity and the absence or presence of anesthetics and other drugs. There is also a major difference between the ischemic vulnerability of different regions of the brain. As an example, the CA1 sector of hippocampus may suffer irreversible injury after ischemia of as short as 5 min [94]whereas other nerve cell populations survive normothermic cerebrocirculatory arrest of as long as 1 h [77].\n\nThe pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is further complicated by the fact that the severity of cell injury is modulated by numerous indirect or secondary consequences of the primary ischemic impact. Recirculation disturbances, stress responses, peroxidative changes, or the activation of genomic responses are only few examples of the large number of hemodynamic and molecular responses which determine the final outcome [153, 97]. The interpretation of experimental data of cerebral ischemia, therefore, requires intimate knowledge of the models and conditions under which the data have been collected. The number and diversity of such models, has become very large over the years because researchers have sought in vain for the ideal approach to study ischemic injury and its therapeutic reversal. Such an ideal model should be relevant to the clinical situation, it should be … \n\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 (221) 4726 211; Fax: +49 (221) 4726 325; E-mail: hossmann@mpin-koeln.mpg.de",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by the breakdown of thought processes and emotional disorders. This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others. The following research article examines all the factors that can influence the onset and progression of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by partial or complete upper airway obstruction which leads to reduction of blood oxygenation often accompanied by frequent arousal during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea in children has many different clinical features, compared with adults. In children, obstructive sleep apnea is mainly caused by enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Other conditions such as obesity, craniofacial abnormality, and neuromuscular disease are also relevant predisposing factors. Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is associated with various secondary sequelae such as cognitive dysfunction, behavioral problem, attention deficit, reduced sleep-related quality of life and so on. The objective diagnostic test, standard polysomnograhy is often needed to diagnose and stratify the severity of obstructive sleep apnea, because subjective symptoms and signs related to obstructive sleep apnea are not always consistent with the severity of respiratory disturbance. Childhood obstructive sleep apnea should be diagnosed and treated, if clinically suspected, because various symptoms, signs and consequences can be improved with proper management. Adenotonsillectomy is the first-line treatment modality in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. In addition, continuous positive airway pressure, rapid maxillary expansion, weight control, topical steroids, and antileukotrienes may be considered as adjuvant treatment options.",

      "title": "TANGO2-Related Metabolic Encephalopathy and Arrhythmias",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Individuals with TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias can present in acute metabolic crisis (hypoglycemia, elevated lactate, mild hyperammonemia) or with developmental delay, regression, and/or seizures. The acute presentation varies from profound muscle weakness, ataxia, and/or disorientation to a comatose state. Individuals can present with intermittent acute episodes of rhabdomyolysis. The first episode of myoglobinuria has been known to occur as early as age five months. Acute renal tubular damage due to myoglobinuria can result in acute kidney injury and renal failure. During acute illness, transient electrocardiogram changes can be seen; the most common is QT prolongation. Life-threatening recurrent ventricular tachycardia or torsade de pointes occurs primarily during times of acute illness. Individuals who do not present in metabolic crises may present with gait incoordination, progressively unsteady gait, difficulty with speech, or clumsiness. Intellectual disability of variable severity is observed in almost all individuals. Seizures are observed outside the periods of crises in more than 75% of individuals. Hypothyroidism has been reported in more than one third of individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in TANGO2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Prevention of primary manifestations: Avoidance of triggers for acute metabolic crisis (e.g., prolonged fasting, dehydration, ketogenic diet). Infusion of intravenous glucose during significant acute periods of systemic metabolic stress caused by infection or general anesthesia may be required to prevent significant catabolism. Prevention of secondary complications: Provide hydration and alkalinization of the urine during an attack of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria to prevent renal failure. An emergency plan should be in place to initiate steps to suppress acute catabolism and promote hydration in order to minimize the risk of life-threatening rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrhythmias. Prior to determining the rate and amount of fluid administration, an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function should be considered. Surveillance: Regular cardiology evaluation for management of cardiac arrhythmias; annual TSH and free T4; neurology follow up to manage epilepsy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fasting; dehydration; ketogenic diet, which can precipitate severe metabolic crises. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing to allow prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Genetic counseling TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the TANGO2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Many patients suffering from the majority of anxiety disorders complain about their sleep by reporting difficulties in initiating and maintaining it. Polysomnographic studies have shown that, in comparison to normal subjects, the sleep of patients with panic disorder is characterized by longer sleep latency, increased time awake and reduced sleep efficiency. Sleep architecture is normal and there are no significant changes in REM sleep measures. Nocturnal panic attacks are non-REM-related events and occur without an obvious trigger in 18-45% of panic disorder patients. Regarding generalized anxiety disorder, the patients complain of 'trouble sleeping' in 60-70%, while polysomnography has shown increased sleep latency and decreased sleep continuity measures. The findings in REM sleep and sleep architecture generally do not show any aberration to exist. In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), results from the sleep laboratory do not seem to support the subjective complaints of poor sleep. The early reports of shortened REM latency in OCD could not be replicated by recent studies. A dysregulation of the REM sleep control system has been reported for patients with PTSD. Finally, no significant differences were found in all sleep parameters between social phobia patients and controls.",

Patients will often present with repetitive questioning and total anterograde memory loss that resolves within 24 hours. While there is disorientation with respect to other people and location, the patients will not lose self-awareness.

      "title": "Facial Nerve Paralysis After Cervical Traction",
      "abstract": "So EC: Facial nerve paralysis after cervical traction. Cervical traction is a frequently used treatment in rehabilitation clinics for cervical spine problems. This modality works, in principle, by decompressing the spinal cord or its nerve roots by applying traction on the cervical spine through a harness placed over the mandible (Olivero et al., Neurosurg Focus 2002;12:ECP1). Previous reports on treatment complications include lumbar radicular discomfort, muscle injury, neck soreness, and posttraction pain (LaBan et al., Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1992;73:295–6; Lee et al., J Biomech Eng 1996;118:597–600). Here, we report the first case of unilateral facial nerve paralysis developed after 4 wks of intermittent cervical traction therapy. Nerve conduction velocity examination revealed a peripheral-type facial nerve paralysis. Symptoms of facial nerve paralysis subsided after prednisolone treatment and suspension of traction therapy. It is suspected that a misplaced or an overstrained harness may have been the cause of facial nerve paralysis in this patient. Possible causes were (1) direct compression by the harness on the right facial nerve near its exit through the stylomastoid foramen; (2) compression of the right external carotid artery by the harness, causing transient ischemic injury at the geniculate ganglion; or (3) coincidental herpes zoster virus infection or idiopathic Bell's palsy involving the facial nerve.",

      "abstract": "The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) are a devastating group of rare disorders(1) that manifest with increasing action myoclonus, which is also present at rest but activates with stimuli such as noise, light, or touch. Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

Background electrical activity is always present and spontaneous changes in activity occasionally appear, even when it seems that an individual is relaxing or asleep. This makes the task of recording and correctly interpreting a subject's evoked response to a specific stimulus or situation a challenge. Most psychophysiological recordings can be analyzed in terms of three types of activity: spontaneous, tonic (background), and phasic (evoked responses). Tonic activity is often referred to as the background level or resting level of activity of a particular physiological measure, while phasic activity is a discrete response to a specific stimulus — an evoked response. What is referred to as spontaneous activity is in reality a change in physiological activity that occurs in the absence of any known stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Most people have periods in which they become at least moderately depressed: they feel sad, they lose their motivation and interest in their usual activities, they slow down and are chronically fatigued, and so on. For most people, these periods last only a few days and their symptoms never become debilitating. For others, these periods last weeks or months, and their symptoms become worse with time. I suggest that the ways people initially try to regulate or cope with their symptoms of depression can affect the severity and duration of these symptoms. Specifically, people who have a ruminative style of responding to their initial symptoms of depression will have longer and more severe episodes of depressed mood than people who have more active, less ruminative response styles. A ruminative response style for depression is defined as the tendency to focus passively and repetitively on one's symptoms of depression and on the possible causes and consequences of those symptoms without taking action to relieve them. Ruminative responses to depression exacerbate and prolong periods of depression through at least three mechanisms. First, rumination enhances the negative effects of depressed mood on thinking, making depressive interpretations of events and negative memories more accessible and more likely to be used in ongoing deliberations about one's life. Second, rumination interferes with complex interpersonal problem-solving, in part because it enhances pessimistic, distorted thinking. Third, rumination inhibits people from engaging in everyday instrumental behaviors that could enhance their sense of control and lift their moods.",

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

ATROPHY.Atrophy is a diminution in the bulk of one or more of the component parts of an organ.Since the more important tissue- elements are usually affected, there is also a diminution of functional activity.Normal examples are the atrophy of the thymus gland in early life; of the umbilical blood-vessels after birth; and of the female reproductive organs at the menopause.There may be small- ness of size not due to atrophy.For example, an organ may be diminutive from an arrest of development, a condition termed hypoplasia.It is seen in chlorosis, in which we frequently find that the sexual organs and the heart and great vessels are abnormally small.Total absence of an organ or a part of an organ is called aplasia or agenesis ; it gives rise to monstrosities.Morbid Physiology.-Atrophy is brought about either by an insufficiency in the food supply of the cells, or by an inability on the part of the cells to use the nutritive material brought to them.It is (a) simple, due to a diminution in the size of the cells, without marked change in their protoplasm, or (^) degenerative, due to a breaking down of the protoplasm of the cells.Morbid Anatomy.-(a) Macroscopy.An atrophic organ is smaller; its outline is usually retained, although the surface maybe lo NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.irregular; the consistency is, as a rule, greater than normal, on account of a relative or absolute increase of the connective tissue ; its color is darker, from a relative excess of pigment ; frequently, too, new pigment is deposited. .{b) Microscopy.The cells are diminished in size or degenerated ; the connective tissue is increased.Brown Atrophy occurs in organs the seat of chronic con- gestion, especially in the heart and liver.Clinical Causes.i.Senile changes.-These are to a certain extent physiologic ; are pathologic when occurring early.They affect especially the testicle, heart and lungs (senile emphysema).2. Defective nutrition.(a) General, as in starvation.(h) Local deficiency of blood-supply, as from obstruction of an artery.FATTY INFILTRATION.il it is termed obesity or polysarcia ; in the liver, in the heart, around atrophic organs, etc.In obesity certain parts, as the eyelids, the alae nasi, the lobules of the ears, the Hps, and the prepuce escape.His- tologically, the fatty deposit affects both the cells and the inter- cellular substance, the red corpuscles and the ganglion cells of the nervous system being alone exempt.Morbid Physiology.-There exists in fatty infiltration a disturbance of the fat-building and fat-storing functions.The deposit of fat may be due to an excess of food ingested or to an impairment in the consumption of the fat normally brought to cell.Defective oxidation is at the bottom of the process.All food-stuffs, fats, albuminoids, and carbohydrates may give origin to the deposit of fat, particularly the last-named.The albuminous food may be converted into fat within the body ; thus, the cow which consumes but little fat produces a large quantity of it out of the vegetable proteids.Certain post-mortem changes also illustrate the derivation of fat from albuminous substances ; adipocere^a fatty material, may be formed out of the muscles after death.Animals fed on carbohydrates deposit fat.Bees produce wax out of the plant-sugar upon which they feed.How this conver- sion is brought about within the body is not known.Morbid Anatomy.ia)Macroscopy.The size of the organ is increased, but the outline is preserved ; the consistency is usually diminished, yet it may not be greatly altered ; the color is yellowish, either uniformly or in streaks, the latter being the case especially in the heart.The surface of section shows minute fat droplets, and the knife used is oil-stained.(8) Microscopy.Primarily the fat is deposited in small granules, which have a tendency to run together to form large rounded droplets, possessing a light center and a dark contour, or vice versa, depending on the manner of focusing.The protoplasm and nucleus are pushed to one side.The latter retains its structure and can be seen distinctly unless covered by the fat-droplet.In fatty degeneration the tendency of the fat-granules to run together is excep- tional.Fatty infiltration may be selective, affecting particular parts ©f an organ.In the heart, for instance, it is found in the connective tissue between the muscle fibers, and beneath the pericardium.In 12 NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.the liver it is especially marked toward the periphery of the acini, where the portal vein deposits the fat coming from the digestive tract.Chemically, the fat of fatty infiltration is the same as that found in the body normally, namely, a mixture of the neutral fats, stearin, palmatin, and olein.In the horse olein predominates, the fat therefore is soft and yellow ; in cattle the harder and whiter stearin is chiefly found.After death, and in certain pathologic states, such as gangrene and other degenerations, dur- ing life, the fat may take on a crystalline form, the crystals being needle-shaped, the so-called margaric-acid crystals, or in large rhombic (a) choiesterin, (*) Fat-platcs, cach with a comcr cut out, constituting ''^'°'^;J:L'c:r\"°' the cholestenn-plates.Clinical Causes.i.Heredity.This is the important factor in general obesity.2. Disturbed digestion.This may cause chemical changes favoring the deposit of fat ; generally, however, it is associated with an excessive appetite.3. Lack of exercise.Not only does deficient physical exercise conduce to fatty infiltration, but also lessened mental activity, as is seen in certain forms of insanity.In fattening animals it is cus- tomary to restrict their exercise to the lowest limit by confinement.4. Anemia^probably by lessening oxidation-processes.We may have an extensive deposit of fat in chlorosis.The fattening of animals for slaughter may be hastened by one or two bleedings.5. Alcohol.The ingestion of alcohol, especially in the form of malt-liquors, favors the deposit of fat either by increasing the consumption of food or by diminishing oxidation.6. Local disturbances of circulation interfering with the proper nutrition of a part. CALCAREOUS INFILTRATION OR CALCIFICATION.Calcification is the deposition in the tissues of earthy salts, principally the carbonates and phosphates ot calcium and magnesium.Physiologic example.The deposit of salts in bone.The salts of pathologic calcification do not differ from those deposited in health.6 NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.Morbid Anatomy.-Wefind the insoluble pigments in bruises-here chiefly as hemosiderin-and in hemorrhages in the interior of organs.In the latter instance the pigment is apt to remain for a long time, assuming often a bluish or slate color, as in the intestines after an attack of dysentery.Tests for blood-pigment.To a watery solution of the blood- stain add tincture of guaiac; a white or whitish-red precipitate is produced which turns blue on the addition of an ethereal solution of hydrogen dioxid.The blue precipitate may be dissoiv^ed out with alcohol. (Almen's Test.)This test is very characteristic.The spectroscopic test, which is absolutely positive.The spectrum of hemoglobin (i.e. oxy-hemoglobin), consists of two dark bands, one at the junction of the yellow and green, the other in the middle of the green.Non-oxidized hemoglobin presents a single band, which may be considered to be the result of the union of the two oxy-hemoglobin bands.It is, however, smaller than the combined width of these two bands.Methemoglobin gives rise to three dark bands, the two characteristic of oxy-hemoglobin, with an additional one in the orange.Bile-pigmentation : Jaimdice^or Icterus.Since bile is elaborated exclusively by the liver, the origin of jaundice must always be hepatogenous.It may, however, arise in one of two ways : (a) from simple obstruction of the bile-ducts ; {$) from excessive forma- tion of bile-pigment, this generally occurring when there is an ex- aggerated destruction of blood-coloring matter.It is the latter form to which some clinicians give the name of hematogenous jaundice.Tests, Bile-pigment is insoluble in water and in alcohol ; it is soluble in chloroform, and gives a pretty play of color with nitrous acid or nitric acid containing nitrous acid fumes.{Gmelin-Heifits' Test)Ferrous sulphid, FeS.This results from the action of hydrogen sulphid on the iron contained in the hemoglobin.It is seen post- mortem in the abdominal walls and peritoneum, as a diffuse bluish discoloration.Metabolic Pigmentation.-Thepigment-called melanin -is elaborated out of the protoplasm of the cells, without the intervention of blood-pigment.It occurs normally in the skin the choroid, in hair, etc.Its composition is variable-sometimes it contains iron, at others it does not.Sulphur is generally present.I8 NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.any point, disease develops, at one time serous infiltration, at another, as we shall see later, inflammation.(4) Through changes in the walls of the blood-vessels : {a) over-distension {b) disease of the vessel-walls.Character of the Fluid.It has the same composition as the lymph, but contains more water and less corpuscular elements.From inflammatory fluid, which it resembles, it is distinguished by being less inspissated.Its specific gravity does not exceed 1016, and its proportion of albumin is less than three per-cent.Inflam- matory fluid is denser and contains more albumin.Morbid Anatomy-[a) Macroscopy.The part, as a limb, is swollen, pale, somewhat translucent in appearance, pits on pressure, and has a lower temperature than the same part in health.In the case of the lung, we find that the organ is enlarged and on section oozes a frothy serum.Different terms are employed, according to the seat of the effusion : NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.AMYLOID DEGENERATION.This is a progressive degenerative process, affecting especially the connective tissues, and giving rise to the formation of a sub- stance characterized by the amyloid reaction.It is not found in health, although it occurs at times in organs belonging to apparently healthy individuals-it is there indicative of local disease. Seats.Liver, kidney, spleen, walls of the intestines and heart, nervous system and prostate gland.The first three of these are affected with equal frequency, and more often than the other organs.Morbid Physiology-Amyloid substance is the result of a reaction occurring between something derived from the blood and the juices of the tissues.It does not exist preformed in the blood, therefore its deposit is not an infiltration.The ultimate cause of its formation is perhaps in many cases, but not in all, the loss of potassium salts.The amyloid material is an albuminoid.It contains less potas- sium and phosphoric acid and more sodium and chlorin than nor- mal tissue.Alkalies and acids do not dissolve it, and it is very resistent to peptic digestion and to putrefactive processes.Morbid Anatomy.-(a) Macroscopy.The affected organ is larger than normal, the increase in size being at times remarkable, the outline is uniform, the borders, if the organ have any, are rounded, the sub- stance of the organ is denser, i. e., less friable, the elasticity is decreased-the organ may be doughy and may pit on pressure.The surface of section is paler than normal, and is somewhat translucent at the edges.The appearance is well described by the term \" waxy \" or \" bacony.\"As a rule the organ is affected uniformly.Not rarely, however, the process is circumscribed to minute areas ; indeed, it may not be apparent to the naked eye at all, unless the characteristic test is applied.It is particularly in the spleen and kidney that the degeneration shows a tendency to limitation.In the former it selects the lym- phoid bodies and adjacent blood-vessels, the condition produced Amyloid degeneration in kidney. NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.The gentian-violet reaction is also given by levulose, while cholesterin and glycogen respond to the iodin-test.The amyloid reaction consists in the development of a blue color when iodin and sulphuric acid are applied to amyloid sub- stance.It is not always obtained, nor is it important.The failure to get it in all cases suggests the possibility that the amyloid substance is not always of the same composition, but that there is a series qf related degenerations leading up to amyloid.The starch reaction is most frequently given by the amyloid bodies.Clinical Causes.-Chronic suppuration^especially that dependent upon tuberculous or syphilitic bone-disease.Amyloid Bodies.-These are small masses of concentrically arranged amyloid material, which are found in the prostate gland ^.nd in the nervous system.The change is here not progressive.The bodies involve the epithelium rather than the connective tissue-at least in the prostate glands, where the epithelial lining of the follicles is affected.They may occur in healthy prostate glands, but are most common in the prostates of old persons in whom the organ is hypertrophied, and its follicles are in a state of catarrhal inflam- mation.In the prostrate gland the bodies are visible to the naked eye, and frequently contain pigment (\"grains of snuff\").In the nervous system they are microscopic in size, and are found beneath the ependyma of the cavities.Though met with in healthy brains and cords, they are most abundant in sclerotic conditions and in epilepsy.They give the iodin-reaction. HYALINE DEGENERATION.This consists in the formation of a substance similar in appear- ance and composition to amyloid material, but not presenting the reactions peculiar to the latter.It attacks almost exclusively the connective tissue, particularly of the walls of the blood-vessels, and shows no tendency to spread to surrounding tissues.The organs in the vessels of which",

Parasomnias can affect people of any age-infants, newborns, and even fetuses (as described in the documentary Sleep Runners: The Stories Behind Everyday Parasomnias []). It is believed that the kicking of a fetus in utero is a manifestation of \"spontaneous motility patterns,\" that is, the most primitive form of motor activation-without concurrent inhibition-during primordial sleep ().

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a common disorder among the general population, which has a chronic course and a heavy burden on patients and the health care system. Epidemiological papers on sleep disorders show that a large number of people complain of sleep disorders. Today, there are several classifications and definitions for sleep disorders, and first of all for insomnia. Insufficient sleep can contribute to the occurrence of rapid fatigue during the daytime, reduced activity, attention and efficiency. Studies have shown that long-term and severe sleep disorders can lead to and/or exacerbate various somatic, neurological and mental diseases. Insomnia can contribute to cognitive impairment. Although both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions are available, drugs are more often prescribed due to greater availability. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first line treatment for adults of any age. Pharmacological intervention may be offered, if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not enough effective or not available. At the same time, the pharmacotherapy for sleep disorders remains problematic despite a large number of sleeping pills. Sleeping agents that are widely used in medical practice both in terms of their mechanisms of action and final results such as their effect on sleep do not always contribute to the development of natural (or at least close to physiological) sleep. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin, and phytotherapeutic medicines can be used to treat insomnia.",

      "abstract": "【With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.】",

Experiments in nature have indicated that wake/sleep rhythm perturbations may occur either involving desynchronization of the basic 24 h wake/sleep cycle within the geophysical 24 h cycle (circadian rhythm disturbances) or involving the rapid oscillation or incomplete declaration of state (such as narcolepsy). The use of phase spaces to describe states of being may be of interest in the description of state determination in both illness and health.

The bidirectional association between sleep and headache is mediated by a temporal link (headache occurs during sleep, after sleep, and in relationship with sleep stages), by a quantitative relationship (excess, lack, bad quality, short duration of sleep may trigger headache), and by a reciprocal connection (headache may cause sleep disruption and may be associated with several sleep disturbances). This association is most evident for primary headache disorders, especially in childhood. A congenital alteration of neurotransmitter pathways (serotoninergic and dopaminergic) might predispose individuals to both disorders, presenting as sleep–wake rhythm disorder in infancy or as headache disorder later in childhood, as result of this neurotransmitter imbalance. Clinicians should be aware that a complete clinical evaluation of childhood headache includes a careful sleep history, taking into account that the treatment of sleep disturbances could lead to an improvement of headache symptoms and vice versa.

      "abstract": "The article deals with the issue of recovery and personal growth of people exposed to trauma events and who have post-traumatic disorders. This issue is considered to be relevant because there is the increase of traumatic events in current war situation in Ukraine. In addition, Ukrainians, especially those who live in war territory, have no opportunity to get professional assistance. In this situation, the main role in supporting the natural mental recovery processes be-\r\nlongs to people from the nearest social environment. A traumatic event causes a number of changes in the nervous system functioning, which can be manifested in nightmares, negative self-attitude, depression, aggression, or on the co ntrary, indifference. One should remember that none o f these manifestations means abnormality or deviation. All of them are a normal psychological reaction to traumatic events. One of the sig nificant factors of recovery after traumatic events is the sup port of relatives and close friends, their calm and encouraging attitude. A person who has experienced trauma \r\nbecomes sensitive to different triggers (reminders about the event). Everything associated with a traumatic event can cause tension, anxiety, aggression, etc. People, their actions, words or phrases, concrete situations or just things, so unds, scents can act like triggers. Thus, the following peculiarities of behaviour are the signals meaning that one should co nsult a psychologist: if a person avoids communication and prefers to spend all the time in his/her “safe place (at home)”; if he/she refuses to think about the traumatic event, denies the facts which have taken place in his/her life in reality; \r\nloses his/her interests and hobbies, becomes indifferent to everything; manifests no interest in his/her relatives’ or friends’ life; misuses alcohol or drugs, etc. In such situations, close people sho uld understand the symptoms and neurophysiological mechanisms o f posttraumatic reactions. They should master the skills of socio -psychological support, which include psychological recovery, creating emotionally calm conditions for safe memories, refocusing on a certain kind of activity (finding new hobby, etc.).",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: A subsequent headache within seven days of a head injury (or after regaining consciousness after the head trauma)is referred to as a post-traumatic headache (PTHA); it is referred to as chronic or chronic post-traumatic headache (CPTHA) if it lasts longer than three months after the injury. Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

These movements remind one of choreic movements and are quite independent of the ideas and feelings. They may be associated with the smacking of the lips, clucking the tongue, sudden grunting, sniffing, and coughing. Furthermore, in the lips we observe very rapid rhythmical movements. More often there exists a peculiar choreiform movement of the mouth which may be described as an athetoid ataxia. (1)",

      "abstract": "There are different forms of sleep apnea, each with different causes. Fortunately, they are all treatable. 1] Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the muscles and soft tissues in the upper airways relax and become blocked during sleep. It is often accompanied by loud snoring or snorting. OSA is the most common form of sleep apnea, 2] Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain stops sending signals to the respiratory muscles while sleeping. Although the airways remain open, breathing stops. CSA is less common than OSA, 3] Mixed sleep apnea is a combination of central and obstructive sleep apnea, and Common to all of these disorders is the occurrence of apneas and hypopneas. Apnea is when the muscles and soft tissues in the upper airways slacken and collapse to the point that they are completely blocked for 10 seconds or more. Hypopnea is a partial blockage of the airways that decreases airflow by more than 50% for 10 seconds or more.",

Aside from these specific instances, we rarely see every symptom of the syndrome so exaggerated.

For instance, during laparotomy the intestines in early shock lose their normal tone before blood pressure begins to fall. Persistent trauma may bring out the picture.

      "title": "At risk for pain : pain-related anxiety, cognition, and processing biases",
      "abstract": "Pain is a well recognizable and familiar experience to all human beings.In most cases, pain takes the form of an acute episode that temporarily disables individuals in their daily functioning, and that cures spontaneously within a short period of time, or after effective medical treatment has taken place.Nevertheless, there is a substantial part of the population that has to contend with daily recurrent pain complaints for a prolonged period of time.Although the prerequisite for pain duration has been debated, there is now general consensus that pain complaints lasting longer than three months can be considered 'chronic'.Apart from chronic pain complaints originating from evident physical or organic causes (e.g., cancer pain), a considerable part of the chronic pain patients suffers from non-specific pain complaints.That is, they experience pain even though no objective or somatic cause can be detected, or they suffer from persisting pain complaints after the somatic cause has been effectively treated.Non-specific chronic pain is predominantly localized at the musculoskeletal system, affecting the lower back, the lower-and upper limbs (knee, elbow, leg), the neck, and the shoulders (Kerssens, Verhaak, Bartelds, Sorbi, & Bensing, 2002; Verhaak, Kerssens, Dekker, Sorbi, & Bensing, 1998).An epidemiological study in a Dutch community sample demonstrated that about 75% of the general population indicates to have experienced pain at the musculoskeletal apparatus in the past period of twelve months.Moreover, for 45% of this group, these pain complaints persisted for longer then three months (Picavet & Schouten, 2003).In another study, examining the prevalence of low back pain and associated disability in the Belgian population, 41,8% of the respondents indicated to have experienced low back pain for at least one day in the past period of six months.Moreover, for 8,2 % of this group, low back pain was seriously impeding daily functioning (Goubert, Crombez, & De Bourdeaudhuij, 2004).Although the group of chronic patients constitutes a relatively small proportion of the general population (5-10 %), this group is responsible for a large proportion of health-care costs and levels of work absenteeism in western societies (e.g., Waddell, 2004).In addition, chronic pain is known to have an enormous impact on the personal and social relations of the individual in pain (Morley & Eccleston, 2004;Sullivan, Adams, & Sullivan, 2004).Given the detrimental effect of chronic pain on the individual and his or her surrounding, research into the factors and mechanisms that contribute to the aetiology, the persistence, and the effective management of chronic pain complaints has known a significant boost in the latest decades.This burgeoning research interest has amongst others resulted in the identification of a number of psychological factors and mechanisms that may predispose persons toward, or conversely protect them against the development and persistence of chronic pain complaints.The current thesis contributes to this line of research by zooming in on the specific contribution of some of these proposed vulnerability and resilience factors.Consequently, the main and overall objective of this thesis is to add to the understanding of factors, mechanisms, and processes that constitute a mediating or moderating role in pain and pain-related disability.Before introducing the exact research questions of this thesis, this first chapter will start with a brief overview of some of the most prevalent theoretical models of pain as they have been formulated throughout history.Next, the theoretical background against which this thesis has been conducted will be presented by introducing some central concepts and factors underlying the studies in this thesis.Last and concordantly with the outline of this thesis, the main research questions of the individual studies in this thesis will be presented.",

The active treatment of tetanus is twofold and consists specifically in the injection of tetanus antitoxin to neutralize the unbound circulating toxin and symptomatically in the administration of sedatives (such as solution of tribromoethanol or one of the barbiturates) or anticonvulsants (magnesium sulfate, for example) to control the spasms.

There are a number of adaptive physiologic mechanisms in place to maintain tissue oxygenation and, therefore, prevent the onset of shock. The main cause of shock in the foal is hypovolemia. Loss of fluid from diarrhea, inadequate nursing, and other causes results in dehydration and then hypovolemia. The brain has a high oxygen demand and is therefore affected early when oxygen supply is insufficient. The initial clinical sign is a depressed demeanor. As the shock evolves, the foal will stop nursing, stop following the mare, and then become recumbent. Weak pulses and cold extremities are often, but not always, a feature of shock. The hoof capsules and ear tips are frequently cold in hypovolemic animals, but they may be warm in septic shock due to peripheral vasodilation.",

      "title": "Prolonged Infantile Apnea: 1985",
      "abstract": "Knowledge regarding the etiology and optimal management of prolonged infantile apnea and its relationship to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is tentative. Consequently, infantile apnea is a controversial subject; professional discussion and media attention are often emotional and even erroneous. Prolonged apnea is defined as cessation of breathing for at least 20 seconds or as a briefer episode of apnea associated with bradycardia, cyanosis, or pallor. Brief episodes of apnea are a normal occurrence in infants, but prolonged apneic episodes may lead to morbidity and rarely mortality. The vast majority of infants with prolonged apnea are not victims of SIDS; most SIDS victims were never observed to have had prolonged apnea prior to the terminal event. The risk of death from SIDS is somewhat greater in the group of infants with prolonged apnea than in the general population. Infants with sleep apnea who have required active intervention, such as positive pressure \"resuscitation,\" may be at significant risk. Apnea of undetermined etiology that occurs in the premature infant between the actual date of birth and the original due date is apparently not predictive of SIDS. There is, however, indication that preterm infants as a group and perhaps siblings of infants who were victims of SIDS are at somewhat increased risk. Infants who have had an episode of prolonged apnea are perceived by parents and physicians as having experienced a life-threatening event and being at risk for another. Prolonged apnea can be a symptom of many disorders including infection, seizures, airway abnormalities, hypoglycemia or other metabolic problems, anemia (in preterm infants), gastroesophageal reflux, impaired regulation of breathing during sleeping and feeding, and abuse.",

Seizure attacks, if no additional releasing factors are present, are preceded by various clinically weakly expressed seizure phenomena. They include peculiar,very vivid dreams, sudden awakenings with partly obnubilated consciouness and a feeling of fear, abortive psychomotor and other seizure. The \"microseizures\" include also myoclonic twitches preceding sleep and during sleep, auras, brief viscerovegatative attacks, opercular symptoms, symptoms of dream-like states, twitches of isolated muscles without consciousness disturbances. In 44% of cases asthenic symptoms were present in connection with microseizures. They served as background for development long-standing irritative foci manifesting themselves clinically with sluggishness of thinking and affect and compulsive features. Presence of these microseizures may suggest epilepsy long before appearance of typical seizures and may be an indication to beginning of treatment which may prevent the development of severe epilepsy. The syndrome of seizure-like microsymptoms makes it possible to recognize the prodromal stage of epilepsy and to change our views on its sudden onset.",

Sleep attacks were characterized by lid fluttering and closure, upward turning of the eyes, rapid eye movements, myoclonic twitching of all extremities, and loss of consciousness, lasting one or two minutes and aborted by strong sensory stimulation. At their termination, reports of hallucinoid imagery were given. In a sleep record of 6.5 hours, there were 2.2 hours awake (34%), 4.3 hours desynchronized sleep (66%), and a complete absence of synchronized sleep. Reports of hallucinoid imagery were given after awakenings from desynchronized sleep. The findings support the hypotheses that desynchronized sleep is normally under brain stem control and that some types of narcolepsy may be pathophysiologically related to desynchronized sleep.",

      "abstract": "Hypocalcemia can manifest as a variety of presentations, ranging from neuromuscular irritability to seizures, and psychiatric manifestations such as emotional instability, anxiety, and depression. Here, we present a unique case of hypocalcemia-induced acute psychosis. A 24-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with confusion and agitation for four to five days. The patient was noted by the family to have decreased oral intake and sleep. Auditory and visual hallucinations prompted the family to bring the patient to the ED. The patient was mildly tachycardic. Initially, the patient was agitated, impulsive, and aggressive, exhibiting psychotic features including visual hallucinations, paranoid delusions, thought broadcasting, tangential and perseverative thought processes, and erotomanic delusions. She had mild leukocytosis and elevated procalcitonin on admission. A thorough workup ruled out infectious/inflammatory processes. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for acute meningitis/encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis antibodies, and paraneoplastic etiology. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal and thyroid antibodies were negative. The CT brain and MRI brain were unremarkable. The patient was severely hypocalcemic (6.7) with low parathyroid hormone (<6) on admission. To note, the patient has multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B (MEN2B). She underwent total thyroidectomy five months prior for metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma complicated by postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. The patient had been non-compliant with calcium and calcitriol supplementation postoperatively. The patient was started on IV calcium gluconate and transitioned to calcitriol with calcium level improvement over the next three days. She experienced marked improvement, with the resolution of her psychosis. The patient's subacute onset psychosis with no personal or family psychiatric history and a rapid response to calcium correction supports hypocalcemia etiology. This case illustrates new-onset acute psychosis in a patient with calcium regulation imbalance. The development of hypocalcemia secondary to thyroidectomy with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism and calcium supplement non-compliance precipitated psychosis. A few similar cases have been reported, and here, we note that treatment of hypocalcemia promptly resolves symptoms. As per our review, this will be the first case of neuropsychiatric symptoms without associated cortical calcifications seen on imaging. It is important to recognize hypocalcemia as a rare cause of psychosis so as to not mistakenly categorize such presentations as primary psychotic disorders and miss a medically treatable illness.",

The case study of a 60 years old man is based on psychiatric examinations, an intersive one-week observation including polygraphic sleep recordings, and on reviewing medical data over a period of 35 years. In this case, the insomnia developed during a life situation with social stress and continued over 30 years with a gradual sleep reduction to 2-4 hours. Our sleep recordings confirmed a total sleep time of nearly 3 hours, a marked rhythmicity of sleep and day-time activities, fragmentation of sleep, and psychogenic extrasystoles, all symptoms having been reported by the subject previously. Autonomic functions indicated a good efficiency of NREM sleep, whereas a first night effect with subsequent adaptation revealed a good regulatory function of the sleep-waking-system. In addition to a detailed documentation of this extraordinary case, an interpretation is undertaken in order to explain, how the insomnia developed and continued. Psychodynamic aspects show a set of characteristics which are most typical for psychosomatic syndroms. The authors expect, that the knowledge about psychosomatic insomnia will be helpful in diagnosis and treatment of severe insomnias.",

Explicit memory is a conscious recollection of either episodic or semantic memory. Episodic memory is from personal experience and is context-specific while semantic memory refers to general knowledge. Implicit memory is from priming, procedure memory or skills. On-line message held by the brain is the working memory. Prospective memory is about something to be done in the future. Over-reliance on gist memory brings in false memory. The stirring of emotion has effect on encoding and consolidation. Explicit memory depends on medial temporal and prefrontal lobes. Priming impinges directly on cerebral cortex. Procedure memory or motor skills are closely related to basal ganglia. Cerebellum plays an important role in classical conditioning and complex motor learning. Age effect on memory is mainly from decreased speed and capacity of the central executive function. Age-associated memory impairment could be normal aging while mild cognitive impairment could be preclinical dementia.

Sleep disorders result from multiple factors--including pharmacologic, physiologic, biologic, and behavioral--and can be mildly debilitating or life-threatening. Diagnosis includes consideration of the presence of physical or mental illness, drug and/or alcohol use or abuse, a primary sleep disorder such as sleep-disordered breathing or periodic limb movements during sleep, changes in circadian rhythms, or poor sleep hygiene. Despite a high rate of use, hypnotics are best suited for periodic rather than chronic sleep disorder symptoms and, in general, should be used only after adjustments in sleep hygiene prove unsuccessful as first-line therapy.",

      "abstract": "Since the first description of narcolepsy at the end of the 19th Century, great progress has been made. The disease is nowadays distinguished as narcolepsy type 1 and type 2. In the 1960s, the discovery of rapid eye movement sleep at sleep onset led to improved understanding of core sleep-related disease symptoms of the disease (excessive daytime sleepiness with early occurrence of rapid eye movement sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid eye movement parasomnia), as possible dysregulation of rapid eye movement sleep, and cataplexy resembling an intrusion of rapid eye movement atonia during wake. The relevance of non-sleep-related symptoms, such as obesity, precocious puberty, psychiatric and cardiovascular morbidities, has subsequently been recognized. The diagnostic tools have been improved, but sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods on polysomnography and Multiple Sleep Latency Test remain key criteria. The pathogenic mechanisms of narcolepsy type 1 have been partly elucidated after the discovery of strong HLA class II association and orexin/hypocretin deficiency, a neurotransmitter that is involved in altered rapid eye movement sleep regulation. Conversely, the causes of narcolepsy type 2, where cataplexy and orexin deficiency are absent, remain unknown. Symptomatic medications to treat patients with narcolepsy have been developed, and management has been codified with guidelines, until the recent promising orexin-receptor agonists. The present review retraces the steps of the research on narcolepsy that linked the features of the disease with rapid eye movement sleep abnormality, and those that do not appear associated with rapid eye movement sleep.",

Sleep terror (ST) is classified under parasomnias characterized by sudden fear attacks beginning with crying attacks or high-frequency screams and continuing with increased autonomic symptoms. ST occurs in the first few hours of sleep during the delta phase. Further, the lifetime prevalence of ST in adults is less than 1%. It is important to obtain; anamnesis from patients' bed partner for a clinical evaluation of ST. Methods, such as evaluating sleep diaries and video recordings, can help ST diagnosis. It is also important to evaluate patients' medical history, history of substance or alcohol abuse, psychological traumatic experiences, primary or secondary incomes, and detailed neurological aspects. Physician can select some serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCADs) as medical treatment if patients have a high frequency of attacks. Because of addiction and relapse of ST episodes, benzodiazepines are not preferred as the first-line treatment. In this study, we will discuss ST, which is rare in adulthood, and use of long-acting benzodiazepine based on two cases.",

      "abstract": "Unilateral spatial neglect is a disorder commonly encountered after hemisphere stroke, most often in the right hemisphere. Neglect patients fail to attend and respond to stimuli presented on the side of space opposite to the brain lesion. Neglect implies a complex dysfunction in the co-action between perception, motor behavior and the environment where the patients attentive capacities and the environmental space are of special importance. Patients difficulties can be seen in that they do not eat from the left side of the plate or omit words to the left when asked to read. Commonly patients do not have a complete insight into their neglect problems. Neglect in stroke patients has been associated with poor outcome on functional activities. Signs of neglect are not always obvious but can be explored and assessed quickly by bedside neuropsychological testing. Neglect is often more unclear to an observer than, e.g. if a patient suffers from paresis or aphasia. Education for patients, their relatives and others are therefore important.",

      "abstract": "THE subject of hypocalcemic states is one on which a great deal of work has been done but one in which there is as yet much disagreement concerning some points and a recognized lack of knowledge of others. In general it may be stated that hypocalcemic states are manifested clinically by signs and symptoms of tetany. The symptom complex of tetany is now less common than in former times when rachitic tetany was the most frequent cause of convulsions in infancy. It was well described in the older literature. The manifestations consist of central and peripheral nervous system symptoms, irritability often alternating with lethargy, nystagmus and strabismus, contractions and pain in the muscles of the face with \"half moon eyes,\" \"carp mouth,\" trismus and convulsions Edema, most marked in the hands, feet and around the eyes is often observed. Confirmatory signs of tetany may be elicited by special methods of examination. Chvostek's sign, jerking of the facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped, is a sign of tetany in children from one month to two years of age. It is unreliable in newborn infants, in older children and adults since in them it may be present normally. When the facial muscles are in spasm with manifest tetany it can seldom be elicited. The peroneal sign consists of dorsiflexion and abduction of the foot on tapping the peroneal nerve on the lateral surface of the fibula just before the knee. Trousseau's sign is carpopedal spasm induced by pressure applied for some time over the upper arm or leg. Erb's sign, or increased electrical excitability of the peripheral nerves to the galvanic current, was the most reliable proof of tetany in the days before blood chemical analyses were available. The procurement of electrical reactions is such a time consuming procedure that they are seldom sought for now.",

      "abstract": "Hypnotism is but one of several names that may be applied to a closely related range of ostensibly abnormal mental states associated for the most part with altered consciousness and the apparent abnegation of will. These analogous states include mental abstraction, lucid dreaming, induced trance (or deep relaxation), voluntary or induced somnambulism (commonly called sleepwalking), and certain varieties of catalepsy and epilepsy. When deployed within Gothic fiction, these states are usually enhanced further through a customary (though scientifically dubious) association with occult phenomena such as prescience and clairvoyance, and with suggestions of personal and sexual violations of the entranced self, the origins of which can be traced to the earliest days of systematic hypnotism in Europe.",

      "title": "Sexsomnia and Sexual Assault",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within rapid-eye-movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Also, instinctual behaviors can be involuntarily and pathologically released with the parasomnias, including sexual behaviors (sexsomnia), aggression, locomotion, and eating. The clinical consequences of a parasomnia can affect the patient, the bed partner, and any nearby individual. Sexsomnia is classified as a variant of confusional arousals (and sleepwalking), an NREM parasomnia, with amnesia for the sexual behaviors virtually always reported. The cumulative world published literature on sexsomnia consists of 220 cases, 84% males and predominant age in the 30s and 40s. Most cases were identified as NREM parasomnias, although obstructive sleep apnea was the identified trigger in 10.4% of cases. Various other triggers were identified. Forensic consequences were reported in 15 of the reported clinical cases. Sleep medicine physicians can expect inquiries from attorneys to solicit their involvement in criminal trials as forensic implications of parasomnias become increasingly more apparent. As courts generally have an implicit bias that is not favorable to the “sleepwalking defense,” sleep medicine physicians who take on the mantle of an expert medical witness should define their role and understand that supporting justice in the courtroom can only be optimally done through a strong collaborative effort with the attorney throughout the legal process.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State",
      "abstract": "Consciousness is a multifaceted concept that has two dimensions: arousal, or wakefulness (i.e., level of consciousness), and awareness (i.e., content of consciousness) (Laureys et al., 2004).An accurate and reliable assessment of the arousal and awareness of consciousness in patients with severe brain damage is of greatest importance for the differential diagnosis of low levels consciousness patients and for outcome evaluation.Following coma, some patients permanently lose all brainstem function (brain death), some progress to \"wakeful unawareness\" (vegetative state -VS), whereas others recover typically and progress through different stages before fully or partly recovering consciousness (minimally conscious state -MCS).Patients in VS can open their eyes and exhibit basic orienting responses, but show no conscious, purposeful activity.Reflex and other movements are seen, mediated by brainstem, spinal cord, and brainstem-diencephalic arousal systems (Laureys et al., 2004).VS can occur after patients emerge from an acute catastrophic brain insult causing coma, or can also be seen in degenerative or congenital nervous system disorders.The two common findings are necrosis of the cerebral cortex, thalamus and brainstem (usually after anoxic injury) and diffuse axonal injury (usually after trauma), although other pathological findings can be seen in degenerative and other disorders (Laureys, 2008).The MCS patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for coma or VS because they demonstrate some inconsistent but clear evidence of consciousness (Laureys et al., 2008;Giacino et al., 2002).In the MCS, there is variable impaired function of the cerebral cortex, diencephalons and upper brainstem.This allows occasional conscious behaviours to occur, unlike in VS or coma.Patients may enter the MCS as they emerge from coma or VS, or they can become minimally conscious as a result of acute injury or chronic degenerative diseases.Recent studies suggest a number of potential clinical and rehabilitative applications of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques.Although bedside clinical examination remains the criterion standard for establishing diagnosis, MR may provide an adjunctive diagnostic role when behavioural findings are very limited or ambiguous.The future of diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) envisions a battery of neurobehavioral and neuroimaging techniques (such as structural and functional MR imaging (MRI and www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging -Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience 182 fMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), fiber tracking, positron emission tomography (PET)) that serve as complementary clinical tools that may help differentiate the effects of underarousal, sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, and cognitive disturbance in the search for potential causes of behavioural unresponsiveness. Magnetic Resonance and Magnetization Transfer ImagingThe morphological MRI acquisitions usually include non-contrast-enhanced sagittal T1, axial diffusion, axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial T2-SE, coronal T2 sequences and a 3D T1-weighted volume acquisition.FLAIR and T2-SE sequences permit to detect brain edema, contusion, hematoma, herniation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus.T2 sequences are useful in detecting hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injuries (DAI).The total number of lesions detected by FLAIR and T2 are shown to be inversely correlated with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of traumatic coma patients; while the 3D T1 sequence provides an opportunity to evaluate the brain atrophy during the follow up of these patients.A lot of studies performed on traumatic coma patients with conventional MRI showed that lesions of the pons, midbrain, and basal ganglia were predictive of poor outcome especially when they are bilateral.Despite their encouraging results, these studies fail to explain why some patients in VS or with long-term marked cognitive impairments have no or minimal lesions on conventional MRI examination.This raises the question of the lack of specificity and insufficient sensitivity of conventional MR sequences which fail to reveal lesions such as ischemic axonal injuries.Therefore, it is clear that morphological and conventional MRI alone cannot be considered as a reliable tool to assess consciousness disorders severity or to predict their evolution and outcome (Tshibanda et al., 2009).Several studies investigated patients in VS and in MCS using non-conventional, quantitative and volumetric MR techniques, useful to provide information about the anatomical patterns, the prognosis and the outcome of these patients.Ammermann et al. (2007) have used volumetric analysis of MRI to determine the pattern of lesions in 12 patients with a severe neurological impairment after acute ischemic injury.At the time of scanning, the patients were either in VS or in an early remising state, that is MCS.Lesions were classified as having been present in the gray and/or white matter in four different brain regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital).An additional separate evaluation was performed for the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem.The total clinical follow-up period of all patients from the time of the causative event lasted for at least 5 months.The clinical outcomes were reported according to the Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale (RLACS) as a universal guide to assess a patient's level of functioning.The final RLACS levels were correlated to the MRI lesion size with a Spearman correlation.All patients demonstrated extensive white matter lesions, with the largest lesions observed in the frontal and occipital lobe.A preferential involvement of the white matter located in the periventricular area and in the subcortical regions below the motor and internal temporal cortices was found, in addition to the classifically described lesions of the striatum, motor and occipital cortices.Lesion magnitude showed an association with the severity of the outcome as quantitatively assessed by RLACS.With respect to gray matter lesions, the vulnerability pattern observed included frontal and occipital and in some cases parietal cortical areas, moreover in most cases the thalamus.Additionally, almost all of patients showed lesions of the hippocampus or lesions to the basal ganglia.An association between the extent of the MRI defined lesions located within the white matter and the clinical www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State 183 outcomes of the patients was found.All patients in the most unfavorable class III clinical outcome group (i.e.persistent VS) exhibited white matter lesions exceeding 2/3 of the volume of at least one lobe, most frequently the occipital lobe.Moreover, Juengling et al. ( 2005) investigated 5 patients in persistent VS due to prolonged cerebral hypoxia of non-traumatic origin, using combined Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) of 3D MRI and FDG-PET analysis.In the analysis of the regional distribution of gray matter atrophy, VBM revealed multiple areas of significantly decreased gray matter density at p<.001, corrected for multiple comparisons.Those were localized in multiple cortical areas, in particular including inferior parietal lobe, superior and medial frontal lobe, paracentral lobule, superior and medial temporal lobe, the cingulum, and the fusiform gyrus.Thalamic changes were limited to small voxel clusters in dorso-medial areas.These structural atrophic changes were compared with the local distribution of functional loss as assessed by regional hypometabolism in the FDG-PET group analysis.At the threshold pb0.001 (corrected for multiple comparisons), PET showed a widespread pattern of hypometabolic areas.In particular, the parietal and frontotemporal cortices, the cuneus/precuneus, the cingulum, the frontal medial and precentral gyrus, and the transverse temporal gyrus were involved, additionally the bilateral thalamus (mainly dorsomedial subnucleus).All changes were, similar to the VBM results, nearly symmetrical.Improved understanding of this complex lesion pattern gained by in vivo group analyses like here might help to provide deeper insights into the general pathoanatomy of patients in the persistent VS.Using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and a novel approach to shape analysis applied SIENAX software, Fernandez-Espejo et al. ( 2010) investigated thalamic global and regional changes in a sample of patients in a VS or an MCS.They found that total thalamic volume was significantly lower in patients than in healthy volunteers.Shape analysis revealed significant bilateral regional atrophy in the dorso-medial body in patients compared to controls; this atrophy was more widespread in VS than in MCS patients.Lower thalamic volume was significantly correlated with worsening of Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores.Shape analysis suggested that the dorso-medial nucleus and the internal medullar lamina were the main regions responsible for this correlation.These findings suggest that MCS and VS patients present different patterns of regional thalamic abnormalities.In particular, VS patients showed a more widespread pattern of atrophy than controls, producing differences in global thalamic volume.MCS patients did not show volumetric differences compared to controls, and regionally they showed a less pronounced inward collapse in both the dorsal and ventral areas, with the anterior-ventral body significantly spared.Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that thalamic damage is less common in MCS than in VS patients (Jennett et al., 2001).Another quantitative RM technique is the Magnetization Transfer Imaging (MTI).The MTI relies on the principle that protons bound in structures exhibit T1 relaxation coupling with protons in the aqueous phase.When an off-resonance saturation pulse is applied, it selectively saturates those protons that are bound in macromolecules.These protons subsequently exchange longitudinal magnetization with free water protons, leading to a reduction in the detected signal intensity (Sinson et al., 2001).The MTI may provide a quantitative index of the structural integrity of tissue and might be useful to study the outcome of patients with low levels of consciousness.However, further studies, on larger groups of patients, need to be performed to confirm the usefulness of quantitative MRI in the assessment of the eventual neurological prognosis and outcome of these challenging patients.",

      "title": "SS01-02 - Circadian dimension and severity of depression",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is the main cause of disability among psychiatric disorders worldwide. This surprisingly high burden is related to its high prevalence and its severity. Indeed, depression is often comorbid with somatic as well as psychiatric disorders (particularly suicide, anxiety, and substances), and response to antidepressants is only seen in a minority of patients. Other issues related to the difficulties of treating these patients are the frequency of residual symptoms (mood, fatigue, sleep or appetite disorders) that have been associated with relapses and recurrences. Furthermore, emotional regulation during euthymic periods may be viewed as predictive of subsequent intensity of depressive symptoms. Treatment of depression is a major challenge in daily practice, and researchers need to propose more effective treatments based on innovative approaches. The cyclic nature of depressive illness, the diurnal variations in its symptomatology, and the existence of disturbed sleep-wake and core body temperature rhythms all suggest that dysfunction of the circadian time-keeping system may underlie the pathophysiology of depression. Circadian misalignment of the phase-delayed type appears to be the common shift in unipolar depression and, interestingly, the misalignment between the timing of sleep and the pacemaker is correlated with depressive symptom severity. So, as circadian rhythm disturbances are at the core of depression, their normalizing may be a fruitful avenue for new therapeutic targets in depression.",

      "abstract": "Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients almost uniformly suffer from sleep disruption. Even though the role of sleep disturbances is not still adequately understood, they may be related to metabolic, immune, neurological and respiratory dysfunction and could worsen the quality of life after discharge. A harsh ICU environment, underlying disease, mechanical ventilation, pain and drugs are the main reasons that underlie sleep disruption in the critically ill. Polysomnography is the gold standard in evaluating sleep, but it is not feasible in clinical practice; therefore, other objective (bispectral index score [BIS] and actigraphy) and subjective (nurse and patient assessment) methods have been proposed, but their adequacy in ICU patients is not clear. Frequent evaluation of neurological status with validated tools is necessary to avoid excessive or prolonged sedation in order to better titrate patient-focused therapy. Hypnotic agents like benzodiazepines can increase total sleep time, but they alter the physiological progression of sleep phases, and decrease the time spent in the most restorative phases compared to the phases normally mediated by melatonin; melatonin production is decreased in critically ill patients, and as such, exogenous melatonin supplementation may improve sleep quality. Sleep disruption and the development of delirium are frequently related, both because of sleep scarcity and inappropriate dosing with sedatives. Delirium is strongly related to increased ICU morbidity and mortality, thus the resolution of sleep disruption could significantly contribute to improved ICU outcomes. An early evaluation of delirium is strongly recommended because of the potential to resolve the underlying causes or to begin an appropriate therapy. Further studies are needed on the effects of strategies to promote sleep and on the evaluation of better sleep in clinical outcomes, particularly on the development of delirium.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In children with sensorimotor dysfunction (SMD), a history of sleeping disorder can be regularly recorded. Many children describe the following sleeping disorders: they need light or at least an open door. Additionally, a parent is needed. They often use soft toys, which are built around them like a wall in order to have close physical contact. In the dark they are afraid because they feel ghosts, a presence or simply a monster under the bed or in the room. Sensorimotor dysfunction (SMD) is a functional disorder of the movement system caused by reversible segmental dysfunctions, mostly in several sensory regions. The SMD is manifested not only through gross and fine motor weaknesses but also through behavioral problems. The SMD is diagnosed using the motocybernetic test (MCT). The symptom of behavioral sleeping disorder is highlighted, especially since it is a general problem both in healthy children and in children with behavioral problems, such as SMD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). As a therapeutic alternative, the possibilities of manual medicine are emphasized, especially atlas therapy according to Arlen, since the complaints will disappear completely after just a few treatment sessions.",

Orbital myositis implies orbital inflammation confined to one or more extraocular muscles and usually begins acutely with unilateral (peri)orbital pain, particularly on eye movement, and diplopia due to restriction of extraocular muscle movement. In addition, eyelid swelling and conjunctival injection may be present1. Due to these additional symptoms and due to the occurrence of pain, orbital myositis usually can be easily differentiated from nerve lesions as causes of diplopia. Here, we report a case with recurrent orbital myositis sequentially affecting solely the lateral rectus muscles. The first episode was misdiagnosed as abducens nerve palsy in the absence of pain or other additional symptoms of myositis.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep (sleep onset disturbance), difficulty staying asleep (sleep maintenance disturbance), or poor quality (nonrestorative) sleep, leading to impairment of next-day functioning, including psychological distress. Published prevalence estimates of insomnia vary considerably, very likely due to differences in definitions, study setting, and data collection methods. However, estimates based on large population-based surveys provide a rather constant prevalence rate for chronic insomnia in the United States of about 10% (approximately 25 million people). Chronic insomnia is associated with numerous physical and psychiatric conditions and is more common in women and the elderly. Although it is often perceived as a symptom of depression, insomnia is also a precursor of depression and is associated with a substantial increase in the relative risk of major depression. Chronic insomnia is correlated with impaired mood, subjective functioning, and quality of life and, in some cases, with increased daytime sleepiness and accident risk. Those reporting insomnia have higher rates of absenteeism and health care utilization. Direct costs of insomnia have been estimated to be $13.9 billion annually, with a large majority of costs attributable to nursing home care. Chronic insomnia is a common problem, often associated with negative waking mood or function. As such, heightened clinical attention and clinical research appear warranted.",

A fearful experience can also lead to avoidant reactions due to raised negative emotions in situations similar to that, which evoked the fear. To analyse children's reactions after anaesthesia to anaesthetic play equipment, 49 children (three-six years old) were video-filmed during play with anaesthetic equipment 14 days after anaesthesia and surgery. The risk that the child avoided playing with anaesthetic equipment was increased if the child took the premedication unwillingly and if the child was younger. The risk for not telling about the experience was increased if the child took the premedication unwillingly and if the child showed signs of shyness. The risk for telling mostly unspecific memories increased if the child was younger and if the child showed signs of shyness. Avoidant reactions could bee seen in 50 percent of the children. It is important to be aware of the characteristics of a vulnerable child (age, shyness) and to meet the child without raising negative emotions in any part of the anaesthetic process, in order to avoid negative reactions in future encounters.",

      "abstract": "Il sonno copre circa un terzo del tempo totale della vita di ognuno. In questi ultimi anni e notevolmente aumentato l’interesse, sia a livello clinico che di ricerca, riguardo al sonno e alle patologie e ai disturbi ad esso correlati. In particolare, numerose ricerche dimostrano che la qualita del sonno ha un fortissimo impatto sulla qualita della vita e un sonno “disturbato” costituisce un fattore di rischio per numerose patologie. Quindi l’interesse e rivolto non solo a monitorare l’insorgere di patologie del sonno (quali apnee notturne, insonnia, ecc, ) ma anche insufficienza cardiaca, e patologie psichiatriche, quali i disturbi bipolari, sui quali la qualita’ del sonno ha un forte impatto e conseguenze a livello clinico. Il sonno inoltre e una condizione che consente il monitoraggio in modo continuativo in condizioni con elevato grado di ripetibilita, in quanto numerosi fattori esterni e non controllabili presenti durante il giorno, non sono presenti durante il periodo di sonno. Tutto questo giustifica la nascita di numerosi sensori e dispositivi per il monitoraggio domiciliare del sonno, in alternativa alla polisonnografia utilizzata invece a livello clinico e all’interno di specifici reparti ospedalieri. In questo lavoro di tesi vengono presi in considerazione due tipologie di sensori: una maglietta sensorizzata che permette di acquisire ECG, respiro e movimenti mediante un accelerometro triassiale, ed un materasso sensorizzato che registra il ballistocardiogramma (BCG) da cui si ottengono: serie RR (cioe le durate dei singoli cicli cardiaci, i movimenti respiratorio e i movimenti corporei. Lo scopo dello studio e creare un sistema che, a partire dai segnali registrati, possa fornire informazioni sulla qualita del sonno e riesca ad identificare ed a quantificare la presenza di alcuni eventi che possono verificarsi durante il periodo di sonno e sono correlabili alla presenza di patologie. La parte principale dello studio e rivolta alla validazione dei dispositivi utilizzati e allo sviluppo di metodologie specifiche di analisi e classificazione dei segnali, al fine di consentire una valutazione automatica delle registrazioni. In particolare, sono stati sviluppati metodi per la classificazione degli stadi del sonno, l’identificazione di eventi cardiovascolari e respiratori, la classificazione degli stati emotivi (con particolare riferimento al disordine bipolare). I metodi sviluppati sono stati validati su casistiche di soggetti di controllo e su soggetti patologici e hanno dimostrato l’efficacia delle metodiche implementate. Nuovi parametri verranno introdotti e testati e le procedure verranno rese completamente automatiche al fine di facilitare l’utilizza domiciliare da parte di utilizzatori che non abbiamo una specifica preparazione.",

      "title": "Apnea",
      "abstract": "Apnea, from the Greek “absence of breath,” refers clinically to the partial or complete cessation of respiratory flow. Three types of apnea differ in their underlying pathophysiology as well as in their clinical presentations. Central apnea is the absence of respiratory effort from failure of brainstem neurons to generate an excitatory impulse and subsequently stimulate respiratory muscles. Obstructive apnea results from partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway despite normal brainstem excitation. Mixed apnea is characterized by both central and obstructive components. Understanding the differences among central, obstructive, and mixed apnea is essential for selecting appropriate and effective treatment.Central apnea can affect term neonates and infants as a consequence of their relatively immature brainstem respiratory centers. Clinically, central apneic episodes are characterized by a lack of chest wall motion and the absence of air flow. Brief episodes of apnea, which are fairly common, simply reflect the immaturity of the neural regulatory system, but an episode lasting more than 20 seconds usually is considered pathologic and may be accompanied by cyanosis, hypotonia, bradycardia, or pallor.Preterm neonates can present with idiopathic apnea of prematurity or with apnea from a variety of serious underlying conditions. The apneic episodes may be central, obstructive, or mixed. Idiopathic apnea, which typically has an onset from the second to the seventh day after birth, results from an immature brainstem in association with an underdeveloped upper airway, giving it a mixed clinical picture. It is the most common type of apnea seen in preterm neonates, with the risk varying inversely to gestational age. Resolution usually occurs by 37 to 40 weeks postconceptional age, but rarely may persist up to 48 weeks.When not idiopathic, apnea in a preterm neonate can be the consequence of a multitude of disease processes, including sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, seizure, pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and hypoglycemia. It is critical to differentiate between a stable preterm neonate who has self-limited idiopathic apnea and one whose apneic episodes signal a serious, potentially fatal illness. Markers that suggest high risk for underlying pathology include apnea on the first day after birth, apnea in infants older than 36 weeks of gestation, episodes associated with cyanosis, and severe episodes requiring intense resuscitation. Any of these factors is a signal for further evaluation and appropriate treatment of the underlying condition.Obstructive apnea typically occurs in older children, although it can affect infants. The upper airway may be obstructed in the nose (polyps, hypertrophied adenoids), in the oropharynx (enlarged tonsils, macroglossia), or in the larynx (subglottic stenosis, laryngomalacia). Clinically, children may present with a broad spectrum of findings, including snoring, respiratory distress while sleeping, behavioral problems, failure to thrive, and developmental delay. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is not a benign condition and, if severe, can lead to cor pulmonale and death.Because it can be so diverse in its presentation, OSA is not always easy to diagnose. Frequently, a child does not have obvious symptoms while awake or behaviors resulting from sleep disturbance may be attributed erroneously to another condition, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Failing to take a sleep history is one mistake; not giving serious credence to parental reports of snoring and restless sleep is another. Even when parents are questioned properly about their child’s sleep, they may not be aware of habitual snoring. Children may not snore as loudly as adults or the parents may be deeply asleep when their child’s snoring is most likely to occur (in the last third of the night, when the body’s tone is most relaxed during REM sleep).Overall, 2% to 3% of children have sleep disorders, but a thorough sleep history is particularly important in children at special risk: those who have trisomy 21, craniofacial anomalies (Crouzon or Apert syndromes), or neuromuscular disorders (myotonic dystrophy). The following mnemonic tool created at Brown University’s Child Development Center can guide an appropriate sleep history: Between 75% and 100% of children who have OSA snore. A comprehensive sleep history also should include questions about enuresis, which has a strong predictive value for OSA, as well as diaphoresis and hyperextension of the head during sleep.The physical examination findings may be entirely normal in children who have OSA. Careful measurement of weight and height is important; affected children may lose weight and fail to grow because of interrelated difficulties with eating and chronic hypoxemia. The association of obesity with OSA is more prevalent in the adult population; almost 30% of children who have OSA are underweight.The presence of dysmorphic facies, mouth breathing, hyponasal speech, or cleft palate should raise the physician’s suspicion for OSA. A careful examination of the nose may reveal obstruction from polyps, septal deviation, hypertrophied adenoids, or even a foreign body. In the oropharynx, the size of the tonsils should be noted on a scale of 0 to 4; macroglossia (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hypothyroidism), micrognathia (Pierre Robin or Goldenhar sequence), or retrognathia may predispose a child to OSA. A complete neurologic examination is indicated because OSA can be associated with cerebral palsy or hypotonia.Most children who have OSA have no laboratory evidence of their disorder. Polycythemia, respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography are present only in the most severe cases. Radiographs may be useful in determining the cause of OSA. Among children who do not have tonsillar hypertrophy, a lateral neck radiograph can assess the size of the adenoids. In the absence of adenoidal and tonsillar hypertrophy, nasopharyngoscopy may assist in determining the cause of OSA.Several different strategies are available for confirming the diagnosis of OSA. Overnight pulse oximetry with in-hospital observation has a high positive predictive value in confirming OSA. At home, parents can record a sleep audiotape, although one limitation of this technique is the inability to identify a component of central apnea. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) can provide additional information when results of a sleep history and audiotape are inconclusive. It evaluates daytime sleepiness by measuring how long it takes a patient to fall asleep at different times. Having a short mean sleep latency (<10 min) during the day is abnormal, but the MSLT is of limited use in pediatrics because excessive daytime sleepiness is more common with obesity, which is not the usual finding among children who have OSA.The gold standard for diagnosing OSA remains polysomnography (PSG). The four essential components of a polysomnogram are a chest wall motion detector, nasal air flow meter, heart rate monitor, and a pulse oximeter. More complex instruments may have a pH probe and provide electroencephalographic monitoring. In 1996, criteria were set to standardize PSG interpretation in children. An abnormal study is defined by an apnea index (AI) greater than 1, an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 5, blood carbon dioxide levels of 45 mEq/L (45 mmol/L) for more than 60% of sleep time or 50 mEq/L (50 mmol/L) for more than 10% of sleep time, and a minimum oxygen saturation lower than 92%.Not all children suspected of having OSA require PSG, particularly when the indication for a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is already clear. PSG can provide critical information when there is uncertainty about the severity of OSA, in the presence of severe neurologic disease, with a very young child, and with a medical condition that might complicate surgical intervention. The major disadvantages of PSG are its expense and the time required for the study.As Drs. Matiz and Roman point out, the association between OSA and obesity is not as strong in children as it is in adults. About one third of children who have OSA actually are underweight, which makes sense, considering how failure to thrive might well be the consequence of poor sleep and chronic hypoxemia in a growing organism. The association of massive obesity with hypoventilation, daytime somnolence, and OSA has been called the Pickwickian syndrome. In fact, the syndrome is misnamed. In Dickens’ Pickwick Papers, the hero, although portly, is neither obese nor somnolent, and he is not remarkable for his snoring. Mr. Wardle’s young servant, known as “the fat boy, Joe,” has all the appropriate characteristics, but “Joe’s syndrome” doesn’t have much of a ring.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

After the anæsthesia, a period of facilitation of mental processes is observed, which is followed by a period of relaxation and sedation. 5. During the phase of facilitation, the patient has a feeling of increased well-being and shows greater spontaneity, less resistance, and enhanced insight, often expressing previously repressed ideational content and affects. 6. The period of sedation lasts for several hours and is not associated with drowsiness or confusion. Sleep is usually improved the following night and other sedation is often unnecessary. 7. In states of acute manic excitement, repeated daily administration of nitrous oxide has controlled and terminated the attack in some cases. 8. Nitrous oxide hypoxia produces some of the features of the \"shock treatments\" as well as of narcoanalysis, but it is safe, convenient, and simple in administration and may be used in ambulatory patients without interruption of their ordinary activities. 9.

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders (CRSWD) are sleep dysfunctions related to circadian functioning. They are characterized by symptoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness that occur because the intrinsic circadian pacemaker is not entrained to a 24-h light/dark cycle. Affected individuals with a free-running disorder or hypernycthemeral syndrome (N24SWD) have a longer sleep–wake cycle that produces a sleep pattern that typically delays each day. The disorder is seen in 70% of blind people, and among people with healthy vision, it is a rare pathology. Among sighted cases, 80% are young men and 28% have a psychiatric disorder. The patient was a 14-year-old boy with a psychiatric pathology diagnosed with a PANDAS syndrome (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci), a sudden acute and debilitating onset of intense anxiety and mood lability accompanied by obsessive compulsive-like issues and/or tics, in association with a streptococcal A infection that occurs immediately prior to the symptoms. As a comorbidity, he exhibited severe insomnia due to an irregular sleep pattern that strongly delayed his sleep schedule day to day. It affected his daily routines, as he was not going to school, and aggravated, furthermore, the psychiatric symptoms. He was referred for sleep consultation, where the case was explored by ambulatory circadian monitoring (ACM) using the novel system Kronowise ® (Chronolab, University of Murcia) and diagnosed with a non-24-h sleep–wake disorder (N24SWD). The first treatment approach for the patient was focused on improving symptoms during the acute infection and psychiatric symptoms. Additionally, sleep pathology was treated by light therapy and melatonin. After 8 months and different trials, it was possible to establish a treatment to normalize the symptoms and fix his sleep rhythm in a normal schedule as well as to reduce anxious symptoms during the day. The association of PANDAS and N24SWD has not previously been reported in the literature.",

      "title": "Night Shift Naps Improve Patient and Workforce Safety",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the body’s natural response to sleep loss.1 Interruption in the quantity or quality of sleep affects fatigue,2 which in turn disrupts physical and cognitive functioning. Fatigue not only impairs attention to detail, ability to remain focused, information processing/judgment, and problem-solving, but also memory, reaction time, motivation, communication, mood, and empathy.3–5Many factors contribute to fatigue. Topping the list are staffing and workload demands, scheduling (ie, shift length, rotations, consecutive and overtime shifts), and personal issues such as habits and family responsibilities.2,6 In particular, extended shifts (&gt; 8 hours) have been associated with greater fatigue, drowsiness at work, and need for recovery.7,8 Fatigued nurses are at higher risk of making errors6,9,10 (risk increases 3-fold if shifts are &gt; 12.5 hours),11 burnout,12 and work-related injuries and accidents.10 Patient satisfaction also suffers.12 In another systematic review of 21 studies,8 as shift lengthened, adverse outcomes for patients increased (eg, hypoglycemic events, pneumonia, death), and nurses experienced more occupational injuries such as needle stick and musculoskeletal injuries, health complaints, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes or near crashes.8 In an attempt to assess a countermeasure for fatigue, the PICO (patient/problem, intervention, comparison, outcome) question of interest for this evidence synthesis was, What effect do strategic naps have on sleep and cognitive/psychomotor outcomes of nurses?The search strategy involved CINAHL and MEDLINE. Key words were fatigue, nurses, health care workers, hospitals, and napping. The search was limited to the past 10 years.Ten original research studies were retrieved (Table 1): 3 qualitative, 1 participatory action, 2 descriptive, 1 quasi-experimental, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 1 systematic review. All studies examined the effects of naps on hospital nurses working the night shift, except for the systematic review, which related to shift workers across industries. In most instances, a single nap was studied, but researchers in one study22 examined nightly naps over 3 consecutive nights. Length of naps varied from 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes to 1, 2, and 3 hours. Nap times were highly variable from midnight to 1 am, 2 am to 3 am, and 4 am to 4:30 am.As outlined in Table 1, quantitative and qualitative studies validated that strategic naps rejuvenate nurses. More than 50% of nurses who napped in one study13 could sleep (albeit lightly). Sleep latency, or time to fall asleep, was shortest for nurses who napped from 2 am to 3 am.16 But some nurses had difficulty calming down and unplugging because they wanted to stay informed as patient care was top priority.21 If unable to nap, nurses reported that 4 am to 6 am was the most difficult period for drowsiness.18Nappers reported feeling “energized” and “refreshed,”13,18,21 and sleep inertia (ie, drowsiness and impaired cognitive/psychomotor performance upon awakening) occurred less often.13,18 Another study demonstrated physiological signs of reduced tension from sleeping, including changes in bispectral measures, body temperature, heart rate variability, and activity level.15 Sleep outcomes from napping included less subjective and behavioral signs of sleepiness, and increased vigor.16,19,22 Scott et al19 found that the amount of sleep on workdays improved by 50 minutes on average, and sleep quality improved significantly at 12 weeks. Compared with those who did not nap, nappers also experienced fewer performance lapses, better probed memory recall, faster reaction times, less drowsy driving and better driving performance, faster psychomotor skills during intravenous catheter insertion, and fewer errors or near errors.16,19,22 Intercepted or discovered errors increased because of higher alertness.Most of the evidence for strategic napping to combat detrimental effects of fatigue is level C evidence (Table 2). Strategic naps were rejuvenating with favorable cognitive and psychomotor functions, which led to fewer errors. The timing and duration of naps are important. Naps that occur after the middle of the night (but before 4 am)18,24 promoted better sleep quality and were associated with greater physiological benefit and psychomotor performance. Naps should also not last more than 1 hour25 to prevent sleep inertia, or 30 minutes should be allowed for recovery.18,22Several implications must be considered when developing strategic napping programs. Educating nurses about the effects of fatigue and good self-care—including taking naps before working a night shift or a prolonged stretch—is essential.2 The need for this education to be a higher priority was demonstrated by a recent survey24 where most nurse leaders indicated that their facilities did not educate either managers or staff on risk management issues related to fatigue.26A second consideration relates to assessing the conduciveness of the environment for sleeping. Good quality sleep is more likely if nurses can take a duty-free break with uninterrupted coverage of their responsibilities.2 Nurses in a qualitative study18 provided many reasons for their inabilities to nap— from understaffing to unstable patients. When staffing is an issue, Geiger-Brown et al13 advocated that naps should be offered to nurses with (1) self-perceived sleepiness or shiftwork sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea, insomnia), (2) commutes more than 20 minutes or on rural roads, and (3) rotating (vs fixed) shifts, especially those working their first shift or more than 3 in a row.In addition to acuity and staffing issues, Fallis et al18 reported other barriers to napping. These barriers centered on lack of comfortable spaces, interruptions due to shared space, and fear of sleep inertia. In a recent survey of critical care managers, only 11% reported that a specific nap room was available.27 In another study,20 nurses were challenged by the lack of a predefined nap time and consistent ability to take time to rest. Because of these challenges, nurses have shared preferences such as desire for a staff-exclusive area close to the unit (but separate from break rooms) that offers low lighting, pillows and blankets, timers, and either beds, couches, stretchers, or reclining chairs.18,21 Eye masks and ear plugs also may be helpful.2To compound these challenges, cultural barriers exist. Nurse managers in one study18 were surprised by the ease of implementing a napping program, but they stated that the professional/organizational culture and staff’s perceptual dissonance about the adequacy of staffing affected their ability to take restful breaks. Indeed, staff nurses and managers themselves have alluded to lack of support for napping from managers and senior leaders.18,27 Many nurses are reticent to take naps5 and feel guilty if they do.21 In a current survey, Steege et al26 found that although most nurse leaders recognized fatigue as a significant practice concern with negative consequences, most believed that stigma surrounds acknowledging fatigue because it is “part of the culture of nursing.” Thus, leaders concluded that these social norms have slowed the triggering of organizational priorities toward developing fatigue-management policies that include napping, as advocated for by the American Nurses Association.28Fatigue.

It is associated with loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the hypothalamus, hypocretin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid below 110 pg/ml, and the HLA genotype DQ B1*0602. A less common form of narcolepsy without cataplexy probably has a different, as yet unknown, pathogenesis. Once established, narcolepsy is lifelong; spontaneous recovery does not occur. Symptomatic treatment—which is essential for school performance, work, driving ability, and quality of life—is with stimulant (e.g. amphetamine) and anticataplectic (e.g. clomipramine) drugs. More recently, sodium oxybate, an anaesthetic, has been used to induce deep sleep overnight, resulting in improvements in all symptoms.",

      "title": "555 - Complex Visual and Haptic Hallucinations in an Elderly Patient… A diagnostic challenge",
      "abstract": "Background: Hallucinations are common in elderly. Understanding the diverse aetiologies and behavioural reactions to hallucinations is vital to provide the best level of care. Case report: An 85-year-old man, with several cerebrovascular risk factors (dyslipidaemia, atrial fibrillation, previous ischemic-stroke), developed cognitive impairment after an acute confusional state (two years before), characterized mainly by short-term memory deficit and executive dysfunction. In the meantime, he started recurrent periods of multimodal hallucinations, with predominant sundowning pattern, along several months, comprising complex visual hallucinations, with which he interacted, sometimes combined with haptic hallucinations, describing a plastic sensation in his hands, and manifesting carphologia and psychomotor agitation. Insight into the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon recovered after a few hours. The neurologic examination revealed partial left oculomotor nerve palsy (left exotropia and diplopia on the right conjugate eye movement), postural instability, slight truncal bradykinesia, and symmetrical rigidity. The neuroimaging studies confirmed small vessel disease with leukoaraiosis and lacunar infarcts in the lentiform nuclei. No lesions were observed within the visual pathway nor the midbrain. Discussion: This case leads to an interesting discussion regarding the differential diagnosis of combined hallucinations in elderly. The presence of the oculomotor nerve palsy selectively affecting somatic fibers, raised the suspicious of peduncular hallucinosis, in the framework of vascular disorder. Combination of visual and tactile may occur in peduncular hallucinosis. However, the neuroimaging studies did not reveal ischemic lesions in the midbrain. Therefore, the most plausible aetiology for hallucinations is a demential syndrome, namely a vascular dementia, considering the findings on neuroimaging. Additionally, a Lewy-body disease (LBD) cannot be ruled out by virtue of the clinical picture of recurrent well-formed visual hallucinations, symptom fluctuation and slight parkinsonism, or even a Lewy-body variant of Alzheimer disease, considering the presence of amnestic symptoms. Tactile hallucinations have been described in alfa-synucleinopathies. Contrarily to Parkinson disease, when the LBD patients touch their visual hallucinations, the perceived objects often do not disappear and may experience specific texture and thermic sensations. Future research would benefit from a more detailed investigation of the profile of similarities and differences in hallucinations across clinical disorders to facilitate differential diagnosis.",

      "title": "Psychogenic Vertigo",
      "abstract": "The sensation of vertigo, a subjective complaint, is sometimes defined as a hallucination of movement or an illusion. Since evaluation of hallucinations and illusions is an essential part of psychiatric practice, such definitions place vertigo at the doorstep of clinical psychiatry (Trimble 1984). Vertigo is a frequent symptom of psychiatric illness, in particular in anxiety, depression, and personahty disorders, but less frequent in psychosis. However, to complicate matters, because of its incapacitating nature vestibular dysfunction frequently causes psychiatric illness. This may bias the diagnosis of organic vertigo syndromes by a considerable neurotic overlay e.g. in patients with Menière's disease. Alternatively, a transient labyrinthine dysfunction, e.g. in vestibular neuritis, may initiate development of neurosis in which anxiety, panic attacks and depression are most common, and which typically preserves subjective vertigo and postural imbalance although the peripheral lesion is already either recovered or centrally compensated. In the latter case there is a history of an initial rotational vertigo, lateropulsion and nausea (with the objective clinical signs of horizontal rotatory nystagmus and unilateral hyporesponsiveness to caloric irrigation) which is followed by a more indefinite chronic dizziness with subjective postural imbalance or spells of vertigo during active body movements, associated with anxiety and change in behaviour (see Phobic Postural Vertigo, p. 292). Obsessional subjects are more likely to proceed from organic to psychiatric disease, and the obvious presence of an obsessional personality will support the diagnosis of this condition.",

The clinic is different according to the antineuronal Ac involved. Objectives To make a correct differential diagnosis between autoimmune encephalitis and primary psychiatric pathologies that may be similar in symptoms through a complete study of the patient including anamnesis, physical examination, imaging tests, cerebrospinal fluid and serum studies. Methods Description of a clinical case. A 31-year-old female patient, with no previous history of interest, was brought to the emergency department for a suspected seizure. The previous days she had presented emotional lability, difficulty in concentration and reading, blurred vision, confusion and hemicranial headache. Two days later she returned to the emergency room for insomnia, dysarthria, difficulty in reading, comprehension, naming, and excessive rumination of her problems. Incoherent and repetitive language. The Emergency service requested to rule out a conversive disorder. Results Neuropsychiatric manifestations (anxiety, depression, behavioral disturbances, insomnia, memory deficits, psychomotor agitation, mania, auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions) are the first symptom in 70% of autoimmune encephalitis due to anti-NMDA antibodies and usually respond poorly to psychiatric treatment, making the treatment of the primary cause necessary for the remission of these symptoms.

      "abstract": "A person's well-being and health are greatly affected by disorders of sleep and wakefulness. It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

It is often accompanied by a peculiar sense of discomfort, a desire to rest, and reduced motivation, referred to as fatigue sensation. Acute fatigue is a normal condition or phenomenon that disappears after a period of rest; in contrast, chronic fatigue, lasting at least 6 months, does not disappear after ordinary rest. Chronic fatigue impairs activities and contributes to various medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, epileptic seizures, and death. In addition, many people complain of chronic fatigue. For example, in Japan, more than one third of the general adult population complains of chronic fatigue. It would thus be of great value to clarify the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and to develop efficient treatment methods to overcome it. Here, we review data primarily from behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments related to neural dysfunction as well as autonomic nervous system, sleep, and circadian rhythm disorders in fatigue.

      "title": "Consequences of sleep deprivation",
      "abstract": "This paper presents the history of research and the results of recent studies on the effects of sleep deprivation in animals and humans. Humans can bear several days of continuous sleeplessness, experiencing deterioration in wellbeing and effectiveness; however, also a shorter reduction in the sleep time may lead to deteriorated functioning. Sleeplessness accounts for impaired perception, difficulties in keeping concentration, vision disturbances, slower reactions, as well as the appearance of microepisodes of sleep during wakefulness which lead to lower capabilities and efficiency of task performance and to increased number of errors. Sleep deprivation results in poor memorizing, schematic thinking, which yields wrong decisions, and emotional disturbances such as deteriorated interpersonal responses and increased aggressiveness. The symptoms are accompanied by brain tissue hypometabolism, particularly in the thalamus, prefrontal, frontal and occipital cortex and motor speech centres. Sleep deficiency intensifies muscle tonus and coexisting tremor, speech performance becomes monotonous and unclear, and sensitivity to pain is higher. Sleeplessness also relates to the changes in the immune response and the pattern of hormonal secretion, of the growth hormone in particular. The risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease increases. The impairment of performance which is caused by 20-25 hours of sleeplessness is comparable to that after ethanol intoxication at the level of 0.10% blood alcohol concentration. The consequences of chronic sleep reduction or a shallow sleep repeated for several days tend to accumulate and resemble the effects of acute sleep deprivation lasting several dozen hours. At work, such effects hinder proper performance of many essential tasks and in extreme situations (machine operation or vehicle driving), sleep loss may be hazardous to the worker and his/her environment.",

The latter occur with any focal lesion along the visual pathways, and as such have little localizing value, although they are most often placed in the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes; the release hallucinations are formed, variable in content, and modified by opening or closing the eyes and are seen within the visual field defect.<sup>2-4</sup>Peduncular hallucinations are vivid, animated, short-lived, and often recognized as unreal; most of the patients reported have had signs of brain-stem dysfunction pointing to lesions in this region. As noted, a sleep abnormality is prominent and the hallucinations often occur at a specific time, usually in late daytime or evening. One patient was treated successfully when 5-hydroxytryptophan restored normal sleep.<sup>4,5</sup> Ictal visual hallucinations are brief, stereotyped,",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis, physiopathology, and treatment of shift-work disorder irregular and non-24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorders. Shift-work disorder is caused by self-selected behavioral changes due to an atypical work schedule, whereas the other disorders are presumably caused by an intrinsic malfunction of the endogenous circadian timing system. The clinical management of these disorders requires long periods of investigation and observation. Various countermeasures such as improved light/dark exposure, sleep management, and careful use of hypnotics and stimulants when needed can be considered in shift workers with severe sleep–wake disturbances. For the other disorders, therapeutic decisions should seek to consolidate sleep at night; and a multimodal approach is suggested, although no clear guidelines are available. Exogenous melatonin or melatonin agonists are recommended for free-running patients with blindness. In all cases, a careful review of sleep hygiene is important as maladaptive behaviors are frequent.",

Tactile and thermal sensibilities are normal, and the only disturbance is the absence of reaction to painful stimulations, deep or superficial. The corneal reflex is absent in many cases.

      "title": "Report from the <scp>WPA</scp> Section on Psychiatry and Sleep‐Wakefulness Disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, which is considered a psychiatric disorder itself, is the most common sleep-related complaint in the general population. Furthermore, complaints about sleep and wakefulness are among the most common and impairing symptoms in psychiatric patients. Disturbed sleep frequently precedes the onset of several mental disorders, exacerbates as mental disorders progress, and frequently presents as a residual and treatment-resistant symptom. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in sleep research and the treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders in psychiatry, although many questions remain to be answered1. We still do not know exactly the causative link(s) between the various psychiatric disorders and sleep complaints, although it would be important to know, for instance, whether early treatment of sleep disturbances can prevent the development of depressive disorders. Moreover, the relationship between subjective complaints of insomnia patients and objective polysomnographic results remains elusive, and we do not know whether the health consequences of insomnia, for example on metabolic systems, are related to subjective or objective measures of sleep, or both. Besides objective methods for assessing sleep and wakefulness – such as polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, multiple sleep latency test, and maintenance of wakefulness test – there is now considerable literature on various biomarkers for sleep disorders. For insomnia, the measures with the highest performance include PSG-derived cyclic alternating patterns, actigraphy, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. These are followed by heart rate around sleep onset, deficient melatonin rhythm, and specific neuroimaging patterns, mainly reflecting the activity of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia2. For central disorders of hypersomnolence, novel measures derived from quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), high-density EEG, cognitive testing, structural and functional neuroimaging, and pupillometry have been proposed3. Significant progress has also been made in the assessment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. In addition to established laboratory protocols, circadian rhythms can now be assessed through long-term ambulatory monitoring of activity, skin temperature, heart rate, and light exposure4. Significant progress has also been made in the treatment of insomnia, emphasizing not only the role of appropriate pharmacotherapy but, above all, non-pharmacological treatment options. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is currently recommended as the evidence-based psychotherapy for chronic insomnia, also in patients with comorbidities5. This treatment includes techniques such as sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep education and hygiene, relaxation techniques, and cognitive restructuring. These techniques help strengthen the basic sleep-regulating mechanisms, including the homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm, and reduce sleep-related anxiety and arousal6. The treatment of insomnia in psychiatry should be based on an integration of pharmacotherapy (including novel medications, such as orexin antagonists) and non-pharmacological interventions, to address psychological and behavioral factors that contribute to the development or persistence of insomnia. It is particularly important to emphasize the need to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, getting up at the same time every day, even after a night of poor sleep, and to exercise regularly. Additionally, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and limiting naps and rest periods during the day are essential. To prevent insomnia, it is also important to limit screen time during the day and avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs) at least one hour before bed. Several new wakefulness-promoting agents have been introduced for the treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence7. Moreover, it is now well recognized that effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with mental disorders is critical for improving their response to treatment, quality of life, and overall health7. As the prevalence of sleep and wakefulness disorders has further increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in deterioration of mental health and increased alcohol and hypnotic use8, it is evident that mental health professionals require effective training in diagnosing and treating disrupted sleep. People with mental disorders can greatly benefit from mental health services that incorporate routine assessment and treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders within standard care pathways. Consequently, the main aim of the WPA Section on Psychiatry and Sleep-Wakefulness Disorders is to educate psychiatrists in recognizing and giving appropriate attention to sleep disturbances (such as insomnia and hypersomnolence) and in being able to provide guidance to their patients on the importance of basic sleep hygiene rules. The education of psychiatrists should also include awareness on obstructive sleep apnea, which can manifest with psychiatric symptoms, including increased daytime sleepiness, fatigue or loss of energy, loss of interest or pleasure, irritability, mood swings, emotional instability, and cognitive dysfunction such as impaired memory, attention and executive functions. These psychiatric manifestations highlight the importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea promptly, as managing the sleep disorder can improve overall well-being and quality of life. Moreover, since 30-40% of patients with chronic insomnia fulfill diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea, screening for this condition should be performed before initiating any hypnotic medication. This is crucial, because medications such as benzodiazepines are contraindicated in patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea. Such screening can be performed with short questionnaires such as the STOP-BANG. This questionnaire consists of eight yes-or-no questions, focusing on snoring, tiredness, observed apneas, pressure (high blood pressure), body mass index, age, neck circumference, and gender (male). Each \"yes\" answer scores one point. A higher total score indicates a greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea9. Our WPA Section has been active for many years. Its activities have been focused on providing information about sleep and sleep-related disorders to clinical health professionals, as well as optimizing the diagnosis and therapy of sleep disturbances in patients with mental disorders. Since sleep is an interdisciplinary field, one of our main goals is to connect sleep specialists from around the world. We believe that our Section can mediate between basic researchers, clinicians, educational institutions, scientific professional societies, health care institutions, and governmental authorities, in order to improve the recognition and treatment of sleep disorders. Our Section's action plan for 2023-2026 includes several goals. A primary one is advancing research and knowledge about disturbances of sleep and wakefulness in patients with mental disorders, by fostering collaboration between basic researchers, clinical scientists, and health care providers. Additionally, we will keep focusing on education and training on diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, by organizing workshops, webinars and scientific conferences with WPA involvement. Furthermore, we will be active in promoting clinical practice guidelines, to improve the quality and interdisciplinary nature of care in people with mental disorders suffering from disturbed sleep. A major goal also pertains to engaging in policy and advocacy, by calling for pertinent actions in support of research and public health initiatives to improve access of patients with mental disorders to sleep medicine services. We will also be supporting the building up of networking and collaboration, by fostering relationships with scientific societies to promote interdisciplinary research and clinical care. To this end, our Section has already organized a highly successful symposium, \"State of the Art in the Management of Insomnia\", during the World Congress of Psychiatry in 2023. Finally, we intend to develop public sleep health campaigns to educate the public on sleep hygiene, health consequences of poor sleep, and prevention of sleep disorders. By implementing this action plan, our Section can play a pivotal role in advancing the field, improving patient care, and promoting the importance of sleep health in the broader mental health context.",

      "title": "REM-sleep regulation: circadian, homeostatic, and non-REM sleep-dependent determinants",
      "abstract": "The amount, timing, and structure of REM sleep are regulated. Three major determinants in REM sleep regulation have been identified: (1) the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which through its outputs generates daily cycles in REM sleep propensity; (2) a homeostatic (i.e., need-based) drive for REM sleep that increases in the absence of REM sleep and decreases during its presence; (3) the inhibition of REM sleep by non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans, the circadian modulation of REM sleep shows a maximum shortly after the nadir of the circadian rhythm of core body temperature. A sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep (i.e., a gradual increase of REM sleep in the course of a sleep episode that is distinct from a circadian influence) is also evident and attributed primarily to the decrease in NREM sleep intensity. The circadian rhythm and the sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep are the dominant factors influencing the distribution of REM sleep within a sleep episode. In humans that are normally entrained to the 24-hour day, the interaction of these two factors results in maximal REM sleep propensity in the morning, coinciding with habitual wake time. The homeostatic regulation counteracts deviations from a reference level of REM sleep need such that loss of REM sleep results in increased REM sleep propensity. However, rebounds in REM sleep following selective deprivation often remain partial suggesting that the homeostatic drive is relatively weak. On the other hand, recent studies have emphasized that REM sleep can undergo changes in its quality that may compensate for its loss in duration. In the present chapter, the evidence for circadian and homeostatic regulation of REM sleep will be reviewed, the physiological markers that are indicative of such regulation will be presented, and the interdependence of REM sleep and NREM sleep regulation will be examined.",

      "abstract": "A 29-year-old man was admitted because of sudden onset of retrograde amnesia. The patient was unable to recall events having occurred during the past 2 years. The impairment was especially serious with regard to personal memories during the 5 months prior to admission, while he had first been working as a full-time employee under stressful circumstance. A diagnosis of dissociative amnesia was made on the basis of absence of any systemic or neurological diseases that could cause amnesia, the inadaptable character of the patient, the nature of amnesia, and presence of stressful condition possibly related to the amnesia. Visual event-related potential (ERP) studies recorded with human face discrimination tasks demonstrated a P3a wave in response to a face of his superior in the office, whom he said that he had never seen before. The similar P3a wave was observed in response to a face quite familiar to the patient, his mother, but not to a face truly unknown to him. These findings suggest that the visual memory of his superior's face exists in the brain, but the patient is unable to retrieve it by some psychogenic mechanism. 131I-IMP SPECT revealed decreased perfusion in the left medial temporal lobe and the basal forebrain, suggesting the association between dissociative amnesia and focal brain dysfunction. While dissociative amnesia has been understood as psychogenic nature, both ERPs and SPECT are quite important tools to understand the association between the psychological phenomenon and biological changes of the brain in this disorder.",

      "title": "Is there a dissociative process in sleepwalking and night terrors?",
      "abstract": "Abstract The enduring and contentious hypothesis that sleepwalking and night terrors are symptomatic of a protective dissociative mechanism is examined. This is mobilised when intolerable impulses, feelings and memories escape, within sleep, the diminished control of mental defence mechanisms. They then erupt but in a limited motoric or affective form with restricted awareness and subsequent amnesia for the event. It has also been suggested that such processes are more likely when the patient has a history of major psychological trauma. In a group of 22 adult patients, referred to a tertiary sleep disorders service with possible sleepwalking/night terrors, diagnosis was confirmed both clinically and polysomnographically, and only six patients had a history of such trauma. More commonly these described sleepwalking/night terrors are associated with vivid dream-like experiences or behaviour related to flight from attack. Two such cases, suggestive of a dissociative process, are described in more detail. The results of this study are presented largely on account of the negative findings. Scores on the dissociation questionnaire (DIS-Q) were normal, although generally higher in the small “trauma” subgroup. These were similar to scores characterising individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder. This “trauma” group also scored particularly highly on the anxiety,phobic, and depression scales of the Crown-Crisp experiential index. In contrast the “no trauma” group scored more specifically highly on the anxiety scale, along with major trends to high depressionand hysteria scale scores. Two cases are presented which illustrate exceptional occurrence of later onset of sleepwalking/night terrors with accompanying post-traumatic symptoms during wakefulness. It is concluded that a history of major psychological trauma exists in only a minority of adult patients presenting with sleepwalking/night terror syndrome. In this subgroup trauma appears to dictate the subsequent content of the attacks. However, the symptoms express themselves within the form of the sleepwalking/night terror syndrome rather than as rapid eye movement sleep related nightmares. The main group of subjects with the syndrome and with no history of major psychological trauma show no clinical or DIS-Q evidence of dissociation during wakefulness. The proposition that, within the character structure of this group, the mechanism still operates but exclusively within sleep remains a possibility.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is not a loss of consciousness, but an altered state of consciousness. What appears in the dream is preconscious and ready to move into consciousness. This material may be manifested also during free association. The difference between free association and REM dreaming is that the preconscious material is presented in response to internal and/or external stimuli in a more coherent form during free associations, whereas during a REM dream, the material of daily experiences and perceptions that are fragmented in the preconscious are recombined in a less coherent form. The material that cannot be easily expressed during free association in the wakeful state, due to inner or external inhibition, appear in dreams and thus, find an easier way of expression. The dreams of patients who have difficulty directly expressing their thoughts, feelings, and experiences serve as a useful means of communication during the initial stage of therapy and provide valuable analytic material to help the progress of the psychoanalytic treatment. This phenomenon is described with a case presentation. The very inhibited patient who could not openly express her life experiences, emotions, and conflicts found it easier to report her dreams at the beginning of the therapeutic process. Through the material presented from these dreams, it became possible to open the path to direct verbal communication, to work through her problems, and to monitor the progress of the therapeutic process.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and related diseases are becoming increasingly relevant for the health and wellbeing of the general and working populations. Sleep disorders affect all aspects of health, showing a bi-directionality with health conditions and comorbidity with several diseases. Consequently, sleep disorders may have severe negative consequences both for the individual and the enterprise, as well as for society on the whole, in terms of health, productivity and social costs. When considering the disturbances of the sleep/wake cycle, it is important to distinguish between those connected with endogenous biological factors from those related to socio-environmental conditions, including work, and those associated with mental and physical diseases, that are often associated and interact with each other. Many sleep disorders are still underestimated and under-valued in clinical practice and, to a much greater extent, in workers' health surveillance. The present paper is aimed at drawing the attention of the occupational health physician to some key issues, particularly regarding excessive daytime sleepiness, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and shift and night work, as well as their implications in terms of health and occupational consequences. Information on the main aspects of clinical diagnosis and health surveillance, as well as risk management and prevention at the workplace, are provided.",

Stress factors in elderly have their particularity. Anxiety states in elderly can develop in response to factors that wouldn’t cause mental disorders in a young persons. The most common chronic factors in elderly are lonely dwelling, change of life conditions and financial losses, diminished capacity of self-serving, helplessness and living in dependence of other people because of somatic diseases. Among acute stress factors could be mentioned on interrupted association with relatives, moving to a new place, had planned hospitalization and surgical treatment. Clinical picture of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder in elderly has its particularity. It is characterized by impairment of emotional and will functions expressed in depressive mood, fear, anxiety assessment of future. These factors lead to forming pathological motivation of behavior, accompanied by feeling of helplessness, uncertainty in abilities. Cognitive functions are also disturbed, especially in case of comorbide organic emotionally labile disorder of vascular genesis. In such cases symptoms of both disorders enforce each other. Firstly, attentive functions are disturbed because of fixation on unreal problems, connected with anxiety apprehensions. Voluntary memory is also reduced, especially on recent events. Although mixed anxiety and depressive disorder has a mild level of severity, it is accompanied with disturbance of critical functions. It has a great influence on persons’ capacity to make decisions and on level of social functioning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A hiccup is a sudden contraction of the inspiratory and diaphragmatic muscles followed by an abrupt closure of the glottis; that produces a characteristic noise resulting from vibrations of the vocal cords. Brief episodes of hiccups are common in humans at all stages of life and are usually benign. Prolonged attacks that last for days or weeks are considered a more serious phenomenon and may indicate an underlying disorder warranting a comprehensive medical evaluation. These attacks have been associated with significant burden and morbidity. The most common triggers for acute hiccups are linked with gastro-intestinal causes, such as the gastric distension that occurs after an abundant meal, or with gastroesophageal disease. Sudden changes in temperature, excessive alcohol consumption, as well as excitement or emotional stress, may also set off acute hiccups. Certain drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and many others, have been reported to induce hiccups. Drug-induced hiccups are diagnosed by exclusion of other causes and represent a very unusual side-effect of drugs like corticosteroids. We present a case of hiccups associated with intra-articular Diprospan (Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate) administration.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

The obtained results show that the patients with apnea syndrome sleep very badly, and consequently, shortened sleep latency and frequent body movements, along with apneas, are regarded as the leading polysomnographic symptoms. Vigilance profile during sleep, that is, interchange and frequency of each of sleep stages (I, II, III, IV, REM) are similar in both tested groups. The suppression of restitutive stages of sleep (III, IV, REM) is considered to be a dominant characteristic of vigilance during sleep in obese persons and obese persons with manifest apnea syndrome. Relatively prolonged sleep latency in obese persons without manifest apnea syndrome indicates, however, restitutively higher quality of their nocturnal sleep. Contrary to the patients with apnea syndrome, they do not suffer from excessive evening somnolence, so that their daily alertness and sleep vigilance during night are of a better quality, although the lack of deep and REM sleep is observed in them as well.",

      "title": "Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders and Cardiac Arrhythmia",
      "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes a range of conditions characterized by abnormalities in the frequency and/or depth of breathing during sleep. Cessations in breathing rhythm (apneas) are momentary and often cyclical, while reductions in breath amplitude (hypopneas) may be momentary or sustained (Dempsey et al., 2010). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome (HS), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, central sleep apnea (CSA), upper airway resistance syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) are the primary sleep-related respiratory disorders. Although CSA is accompanied by alterations in neural input, the obstruction characteristic of OSA, the most common form of SDB, is also neurally mediated (Veasey, 2009). Intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep characteristic of OSA result from collapse of the upper airway. The concomitant disruption of normal ventilation and sleep architecture is typically associated with snoring, repeated arousals from sleep, and daytime sleepiness (Bradley & Floras, 2003; Lattimore et al, 2003; Quan & Gersh, 2004; Shamsuzzaman et al; 2003;). Prevalence studies indicate that SDB, and particularly OSA, are common problems worldwide, affecting millions of individuals. However, OSA is also considered to be largely undiagnosed (Young et al, 1993; Young et al, 2002; Lavie, 2007). In the United States, for example, the estimated proportions of adults with OSA who are not diagnosed range from 60% to 80%, with an even greater under diagnosis suspected for children (Carter III, 2008). The increasing prevalence can be intuitively associated with the global obesity epidemic; however, a reverse association has also been postulated based on emerging evidence that OSA promotes weight gain (Carter III, 2008). The clinical relevance of OSA was thought for years to be limited to what was considered a benign but often annoying manifestation as snoring, ranging to the possibly serious consequences of daytime sleepiness affecting cognitive function and work performance, mental state, and driving ability. OSA is now known to be a risk factor for other serious conditions, and has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Bradley & Floras, 2009; Devulapally et al., 2009; Lattimore et al, 2003; Lopez-Jiminez et al., 2008). Cardiac arrhythmias are common in OSA, and the potential link between tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias and adverse outcomes in OSA patients continues to be an important area of research (Chan & Wilcox, 2010; Verrier & Josephson, 2009). However, the complex cascade of events triggered by OSA, the difficulty in determining",

The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

      "abstract": "Neuromuscular disease (NMD) is a diverse group of hereditary or acquired conditions involving the anterior horn cells, nerves, neuromuscular junction or muscles. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in children and adults with NMD with an estimated prevalence exceeding 40%. Characteristics of NMD like progressive neuromuscular weakness of respiratory and diaphragmatic muscles, anatomic or neurologic propensity to upper airway obstruction during sleep, and/or cardiomyopathy contribute to the development of SDB. Prevalence and pattern of SDB vary with different types of NMD, depending on the features of the disease and the tempo of progression to respiratory muscle impairment. Importantly, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and nocturnal hypoventilation are often the first signs of respiratory muscle weakness in patients with NMD. The imbalance between respiratory capacity and respiratory loads usually first manifests during sleep, if not acutely during respiratory decompensation in respiratory infection. In patients with NMD, SDB typically first develops in rapid-eye-movement sleep when muscle atonia occurs, followed by continuous nocturnal hypoventilation through the night and eventually by progression into daytime respiratory failure. Untreated SDB and hypoventilation in NMD carries high respiratory morbidity and mortality. Therefore, screening for SDB and nocturnal hypoventilation is a vital part of long-term management of NMD and to detect patients at risk for respiratory failure. Anticipatory approach with regular assessment of symptoms, pulmonary function and sleep in children affected by NMD can aid early diagnosis and management of SDB. Timely provision of respiratory care and non-invasive ventilation are essential components of a multi-disciplinary care to improve quality of life and survival of patients with NMD.",

      "abstract": "Humans are social animals attuned to reactions of others; however, some are exquisitely sensitive to--and often misperceive--perceptions of those they encounter. The core feature of social phobia is marked and persistent fear of embarrassment or humiliation in social situations where the individual worries that others may judge his or her performance as too much or too little. Anticipatory anxiety and avoidance occur when the individual is under scrutiny while speaking or performing publicly, eating with others, writing in public, or using public bathrooms. Diagnosis of social phobia is based largely on history obtained from the patient. Onset is usually around puberty; its course is chronic with comorbid depression common and alcohol and other substances routinely abused in misguided attempts to minimize anxiety and depressive symptoms. At examination, patients often have a moist hand, averted gaze, blushing, and other manifest signs of anxiety. Slight shyness is familiar to most, but a substantial number suffer dysfunctional and distressing social anxiety to the point that they become phobic. A few patients satisfy criteria for avoidant personality disorder, which can be socially incapacitating.",

      "title": "Nocturia. A rarely recognized symptom of sleep apnea and other occult sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "Nocturia, awakening from sleep to urinate, is a common symptom in a variety of medical disorders and in the elderly. Awakening from sleep as a result of nocturia is thought to be secondary to a sensation of urinary urgency resulting from an overextended bladder. Nocturia-related awakenings cause significant sleep disruption and fatigue in elderly patients and are correlated with an increased number of falls at night. Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea are also common in the elderly and are frequently the source of awakenings from sleep. The high incidence of both nocturia and sleep disorders in the elderly and other groups of patients suggests that sleep disorders may be the source of some awakenings from sleep usually attributed by patients to nocturia. Nocturia secondary to sleep disorders would be causatively different from nocturia secondary to pressure to urinate in common medical disorders and would require different diagnostic procedures and treatment.To determine the frequency of nocturia as a symptom of primary sleep disorders.Eighty consecutive patients, 27 women and 53 men with a mean (+/-SD) age of 58.7+/-14.1 years, undergoing polysomnography (sleep study or PSG) for the evaluation of a suspected sleep disorder and who met the sole criteria of awakening from sleep at least once and urinating voluntarily. Each patient had either a standard PSG recording or a PSG with administration of nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Immediately after each episode of nocturia during the PSG, patients were questioned about the reason they believed they had awakened. The PSG record immediately before awakening from sleep was then reviewed for potential causes of awakening. Patients were also asked on final morning awakening to fill in a questionnaire regarding their awakenings during the prior night. Patient reports were compared with the PSG to determine the accuracy of subjective reports.Patients awakened from sleep and voluntarily urinated a mean (+/- of 1.5+/-0.75 times per night for a total of 121 awakenings for the group. The majority (79.3%) of these awakenings from sleep were found to be directly secondary to sleep apnea, snoring or periodic leg movements in sleep. Patients correctly identified the source of their awakening from sleep on only five(4.9%) occasions and only once was sleep apnea correctly cited by a patient as a source of awakening during the night.Most awakenings from sleep attributed by our patients to pressure to urinate were instead a result of sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea. The fact that patients do urinate once awake likely contributed to faulty post hoc reasoning and might have limited further inquiry by patients and their physicians in clinical settings into the actual sources of awakening from sleep. Even in those patients with well-known medical reasons for noctruria, Sleep disorders were still found to be the source of almost all awakenings from sleep. Patients were extremely poor judges of the reasons they awoke from sleep. The diagnosis of a sleep disorder should be seriously considered whenever a patient reports frequent awakenings from sleep to urinate.",

      "abstract": "The authors review the literature on the epidemiology, the clinical and electrophysiological symptoms of somnambulism. The disorder specified as \"nREM parasomnia with awakening disorder\" belongs to the nREM sleep (awakening) parasomnias. In most of the cases its occurence is familial with the highest prevalence at age 12 year. Above age 12 year most cases recover whereas 6% of prevalence is reported in adults. It is probable that most patients seek medical help only in severe cases associated with injuries, accidents or violence. Its etiology is unknown; in essence it is a sleep regulation disorder characterised by a dissociated state of partial awakening from nREM sleep: the motor system becomes awake while consciousness remains clouded. There are several medicines inducing somnambulism in patients otherwise free from this disorder. In somnambule patients the most important provoking factors are sleep deprivation as well as pathological states and circumstances evoking sleep loss. Somnambulism should be differentiated from complex partial epileptic seizures and REM behaviour disorder. As there is no specific treatment at the moment it is important to assure safe sleeping circumstances - ground flour, closed windows, and no fragile furniture. Clonazepam and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors prove sometimes effective, but the most effective methods in decreasing the frequency of somnambule episodes are the regular sleep-wakefulness schedule and the avoidance of sleep deprivation.",

      "title": "Partially empty sella with generalized epileptiform discharges presented as manic episode in an elderly female",
      "abstract": "Sir, Epidemiological studies have shown that the first episode of mania is rare among the elderly.[12] There is no consensus guideline for older age bipolar disorder (OABD), but organic causes should be ruled out in all OABDs.[3] Pituitary lesions and seizure disorders have been reported to be associated with OABD. However, empty sella without endocrine abnormality or generalized epileptiform discharge without any seizure episode has never been reported to be associated with OABD. Hereby, we present a case of elderly onset mania with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities. CASE DESCRIPTION A 63-year-old female presented with a history of sudden-onset behavioral changes after a febrile episode. The patient had symptoms of irritability, decreased need for sleep, increased activity, and authoritativeness. She would claim to be goddess \"Manasa Mata\" and would threaten to curse her family members if questioned her power. On many occasions, the patient would be partially dressed while meeting male family members and relatives. There were several incidents when the patient would fight with family members, alleging them poisoning her food. The patient had a history of fever (up to 100°F) a couple of weeks before the onset of psychiatric symptoms. There was no history of seizure, head trauma, substance use, prior forgetfulness, or repeated mistakes in daily routine activities. There was no past or family history of any psychiatric illness. On mental state examination, the patient was oriented to time, place, and person with increased speech and psychomotor activity. Her affect was exalted with prolixity in the tempo of thought and grandiose and secondary persecutory delusions in thought content. General physical examination was normal with body mass index of 20 kg/m2and blood pressure of 122/78 mmHg. Detailed neurological examination and lobar function test did not reveal any abnormality. The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)[4] score at the time of hospitalization was 28 and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment[5] score was 27. All routine blood investigations were normal [Table 1]. Non-contrast computed tomography head revealed age-related cortical atrophy, whereas MRI brain revealed partially empty sella [Figure 1]. Her EEG revealed generalized epileptiform discharges [Figure 2]. She was already on tablet olanzapine 5 mg daily which was subsequently increased to 10 mg daily. Within the next 7 days, her symptoms improved markedly, and her YMRS score became 6. She was discharged on the same treatment as family members were not willing to stay beyond 10 days. After 3 months, in her routine hospital visits, she was continued to be euthymic on the same treatment.Table 1: Blood investigationsFigure 1: T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging brain (sagittal section) revealing cerebrospinal fluid-filled sella (orange arrow) with compressed pituitary at the bottom (white arrowhead) suggestive of partially empty sellaFigure 2: Electroencephalography with 10–20 international electrode placement system with monopolar/bipolar referential-generalized epileptiform discharge with a frequency of 8–10 Hz and 40–50 V (similar finding was obtained on repeat electroencephalography)DISCUSSION Primary empty sella syndrome (ESS) happens when defect above the pituitary gland results in an increase in pressure, causing the gland to flatten out. It is commonly associated with obesity and high blood pressure in women.[67] Secondary ESS is due to injury, surgery, or radiation therapy of the pituitary gland. ESS can present with various neuropsychiatric symptoms, secondary to endocrine abnormalities or electrolyte imbalance.[78] Yang et al. reported a case of late-onset mania in a 69-year-old female with ESS, where they found syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and symptoms resolved after correction of plasma sodium level.[8] In this case, however, there was no evidence of obesity, hypertension, or overt brain pathology. All efforts were made to search for any possible pituitary dysfunction. All hormone assays were normal except for marginally raised prolactin (can be explained by antipsychotic treatment). A possibility of SIADH was also ruled out given normal serum osmolality [Table 1]. Generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) are rare EEG patterns. Common etiologies include metabolic disorders and infectious disease.[9] In this case, despite a recent history of fever, all biochemical parameters came normal including blood culture, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. However, GPEDs can cause kindling of neuronal pathways, leading to psychiatric manifestations such as mania. Lateral hypothalamic kindling has shown to induce manic-like behavior in a rat model.[10] Current literature is also not clear if GPED with or without psychiatric symptoms (such as late-onset mania) to be treated with antiepileptics or not.[9] Another sizable factor was Vitamin B12 deficiency in this patient, which has been reported to be associated with a manic episode.[11] This patient also received parenteral B12 during ward stay, but the clinical response was apparent even before B12 supplementation was started. A general rule of thumb in medicine is if a patient has multiple symptoms and signs, clinicians should try to explain them by one illness rather than different diagnoses for each one. The current case hinted at the possibility of an organic cause of manic episode (late age of onset, preceding febrile episode, vitamin deficiency, EEG and MRI abnormalities, and rapid response to treatment), but we failed to establish the plausible mechanism for the same. This left us in the dilemma if these associations were merely coincidental or had any causal link! Further studies are needed to explore late-onset mania and its neurobiology, to give us a better insight about the illness and its management.

      "title": "Excitotoxicity, Synaptic Repair, and Functional Recovery in the Mammalian Cochlea: A Review of Recent Findings",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This so‐called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two‐step mechanism: (1) An acute swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry of Ca 2+ , which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in ischemic‐ or noise‐induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.",

      "title": "How once-nightly sodium oxybate is processed in the body in healthy volunteers: a plain language summary",
      "abstract": "What is this summary about? This is a plain language summary of an article originally published in the journal Sleep Medicine. Narcolepsy is a sleep condition in which people have periods of extreme sleepiness during the day. People with narcolepsy may also have symptoms of muscle weakness (cataplexy); seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling something that seems real but isn't actually there before falling asleep or while waking up (hallucinations); an inability to move before falling asleep or while waking up (sleep paralysis); and poor sleep at night. Sodium oxybate (SXB for short) has been used to treat narcolepsy for over 20 years. For more than 20 years, the only available form of SXB needed to be taken twice each night. Twice-nightly SXB (TN-SXB) requires people to take the first dose at bedtime. Most people fall asleep within 5 to 15 minutes after the first dose. Patients then need to wake up and take the second dose of TN-SXB 2.5 to 4 hours later, which is when most of the medicine has left the body. The United States Food and Drug Administration (also called FDA) approved a once-nightly form of SXB called LUMRYZ ™ (sodium oxybate for extended-release oral suspension; ON-SXB for short) in May 2023. ON-SXB treats excessive daytime sleepiness and muscle weakness, also known as cataplexy. People with narcolepsy who take ON-SXB only need to take 1 dose at bedtime. This summary describes a study that looked at how ON-SXB enters, travels through, and exits the body of healthy volunteers (people without narcolepsy). The study measured the amount of SXB in the blood after taking SXB in 2 different ways: as a once-nightly version and as a twice-nightly version. Looking at the amount of ON-SXB and TN-SXB in the blood at different time points helps researchers see if people who take the 2 medicines, with different dosing, have the same amount of drug in the body overnight. What were the results? Overall, the study found that healthy volunteers had the same amount of SXB in their bodies after taking ON-SXB as they did after taking TN-SXB. When they took the same amounts of ON-SXB and TN-SXB, the SXB stayed in their bodies for similar amounts of time. The highest amount and the total amount of SXB in the participants' blood were similar with ON-SXB and TN-SXB. The amount of SXB in the participants' blood 8 hours after taking the medicine was significantly lower with ON-SXB than with TN-SXB. This means that people taking ON-SXB will have less medication in their blood when they wake up the next morning and may be less groggy. What do the results mean? The results mean that if people with narcolepsy take the same dose amount of ON-SXB or TN-SXB, their bodies will receive the same amount of SXB in their blood. ON-SXB provides an option for people with narcolepsy to take their medicine once at bedtime without the need for a middle-of-the-night dose, which can improve quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and senseless thoughts, images, or impulses that occur repeatedly. Obsessions are experienced as unwanted and involuntary by the patient and can focus on such themes as contamination, aggression, orderliness, religion, sex:, doubt, or loss of possessions. Compulsions are ritualistic but seemingly purposeful behaviors that are often performed in response to an obsession. These compulsive behaviors, either observable or mental, alleviate or neutralize anxiety associated with the obsession. The patient fears the outcome should he or she not perform the ritual, despite the knowledge that the fear is irrational. Because the ritual does not entirely relieve the fear, the impulse to repeat the ritual returns. Common compulsive behaviors include hand-washing, checking, arranging, touching, repeating, or hoarding. Table 1 summarizes diagnostic criteria according to the American Psychiatric Association. l Obsessive-compulsive disorder occurs at some point during a lifetime in approximately 2.5 to 3 percent of the population; it is equally common in men as in women, and one-third of the cases begin by the age of 15 years.2 As with many other psychiatric illnesses, patients might not seek care until years after the onset of the disease. A variety of causes have been proposed: behavioral, developmental, biochemical, psychological, and genetic. Familial tendencies have been seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder. In one sample of children with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 71 percent had a parent with either full-blown obsessive-compulsive disotder or obsessive-compulsive symptoms.3 The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder have also previously been viewed as extreme variants of normal developmental rituals",

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "title": "Clinical Neuropharmacology of Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Within the context of the comprehensive treatment of sleep disorders, which includes medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and social interventions, use of medication is often indicated. Among the three benzodiazepine hypnotics that are available in the United States for the treatment of insomnia, flurazepam is effective for both sleep induction and maintenance, and it retains most of its efficacy over a 4-week period of nightly administration; temazepam is effective only for sleep maintenance, and triazolam improves both sleep induction and maintenance with initial but not with continued administration. Rebound phenomena are more frequent and intense with the more rapidly eliminated drug, triazolam, and to a lesser degree with temazepam. Also, with triazolam, certain behavioral side effects, such as amnesia and psychotic-like symptoms, have been reported. With flurazepam, which is a slowly eliminated benzodiazepine, daytime sedation is more frequent than with the other two drugs. When insomnia is secondary to major depression, antidepressant medication should be administered. Methylphenidate, amphetamines, or other stimulant medications are used for the symptomatic treatment of the sleepiness and sleep attacks of narcolepsy and hypersomnia. For cataplexy and the other two auxiliary symptoms of narcolepsy, imipramine or other tricyclics are the drugs of choice. Protriptyline and medroxyprogesterone have been used in treating mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea, but their efficacy is limited. Similarly, for the treatment of central sleep apnea, medroxyprogesterone and acetazolamide have shown only limited effects. Medication for patients with sleepwalking, night terrors, or nightmares should be prescribed judiciously, and primarily when treatment of an underlying psychiatric condition is desired. The neuropharmacology of sleep should also consider drugs that may cause sleep disorders. Medications with sleep disturbing effects include various antihypertensives, bronchodilators, and the energizing antidepressants. Withdrawal of REM-suppressant drugs, such as the barbiturates, may cause nightmares in association with a REM rebound. Occasionally, a drug or a combination of drugs may produce somnambulistic-like activity in some patients.",

      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus is a common emergency condition in paediatric practice. Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA).

      "abstract": "Acute, intermittent and recurrent convulsive seizures have been induced in monkeys by the application of discs containing various immunologically and chemically active substances to the cerebral cortex overlying the motor area. Acute seizures were either single attacks, or a series which usually terminated within one week of onset. Intermittent seizures occurred at widely-spaced intervals over a period of weeks or months. Recurrent seizures were frequent in occurrence (often daily) and persisted for many months. The seizures induced were either typically Jacksonian in nature, or generalized, and usually lasted one-half to two minutes. During unilateral seizures the attack was confined to the muscle groups on the side of the body contralateral to the treated cerebral hemisphere. Seizures occurred either spontaneously, or were induced by external stimuli. Egg-white placed on the brain of monkeys generally sensitized to egg-white, or egg-white injected intravenously into animals in which egg-white had previously been applied to the cortex, yielded acute seizures. Egg-white, egg-white followed by anti-egg-white rabbit serum, specific antigen-antibody precipitates, and typhoid vaccine proved to be effective agents in the production of intermittent seizures. Hydrous oxides of aluminum, alone or in combination with various proteins, invariably produced convulsive seizures, often recurring for many months (in one instance for more than one year to date). These recurrent seizures were of special interest since they represented a state of chronic convulsive reactivity. Control preparations of aquaphor, alone or in combination with rabbit serum, monkey serum or gelatin, or empty discs failed to induce seizures. Electric shock revealed a lowered threshold of convulsive reactivity of one motor area as compared with the other in monkeys exhibiting either unilateral or predominantly unilateral seizures. Electroencephalography indicated that the greatest degree of abnormality in monkeys with convulsive seizures was observed in the precentral cortex and the immediately surrounding area. The recordings also established differences between the two motor areas which were correlated with differences in the clinical manifestations observed on the opposite sides of the body. Luminal and dilantin were found to reduce the incidence of the recurrent seizures produced. Serologic studies revealed no correlation between the concentration of serum precipitins or agglutinins and the occurrence of seizures. Brain antibodies were not demonstrable. The histopathologic findings were of two main types: (1) an acute, destructive process; (2) a chronic, proliferative type of response. The acute lesion was usually associated with the acute or intermittent convulsive seizures produced by immunologic agents. The chronic pathologic response was found in monkeys treated with alumina, aquaphor preparations or empty discs, and was not pathognomonic of the convulsive state. Repeated convulsive seizures have been produced by a single application of various types of substances to the cerebral cortex. Although the mechanism remains obscure, the methods employed may prove useful in further studies of the nature of the convulsive state.",

      "title": "Burnout Syndrome in Professional Workers Who Deal with Treated Alcoholics",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONProfessional stress1 represents an imbalance of workplace requirements and surroundings with our abilities, wishes and expectations concerning fulfilling these requirements. The long-term exposure to professional stress results in the burnout syndrome, the most unfavorable outcome, which affects particularly the helping professions (psychiatrists, social workers, nurses...).2 One of the definitions states that the burnout syndrome is a gradual process in which once a productive and responsible worker loses all interest in his/her work or profession.3 It is a cumulative process that comes with small warning signs. Years can go by till symptoms are manifested as psychological or emotional problems as these signs are often diminutive. The burnout syndrome consists of four stages. The first stage, beginners enthusiasm is characterized by unreal expectations and self-investing of helper followed by high level of energy and good achievements. Second one is a stagnation stage in which helper starts to understand that work isn't as imagined, which is followed by the first appearance of physical and psychological exhaustion, pessimism and a lack of satisfaction with work. Isolation stage is the third stage, characterized by emotional withdrawal, avoiding contacts with colleagues, depression, negativism, angriness and hostility. Syndrome progression continues, sped by physical difficulties (chronic exhaustion, insomnia, headache, allergies etc.). Apathy and a lack of life interests, as a final stage, are the results of chronic frustration and complete lack of interest. Characteristics symptoms are loss of self-confidence, cynicism, serious emotional difficulties, not being able to communicate and work with colleagues and diminished interpersonal relations.4The burnout syndrome can be stopped before the helper arrives at the last stage. The whole process can be turned the other way around by changing the working goals, attitudes and behaviors in the work surroundings,5 as the cause of professional stress can be internal and external.The mental help of professional workers is at risk because of their everyday need to communicate with treated alcoholics, listen to the life problems, traumatic events, losses and similar issues.6 They are mostly unaware of how this line of work affects them and they avoid asking for help. Not recognizing the burnout syndrome, professional workers are themselves at risk of developing a negative attitude towards the treated alcoholics and provide ineffective and inadequate help.Aim of this study was to investigate if professional workers recognized the burnout syndrome in working with treated alcoholics; if professional workers who work with treated alcoholics suffered from burnout syndrome; which profession is the most affected by the burnout syndrome and if there were any differences in social-demographic features and to see used strategies of self-help.METHODS AND SAMPLEThe questionnaire consisted of 36 questions divided into two parts. The first part referred to professional workers' perception of the burnout syndrome and its causes, and the second part was The Burnout Syndrome Questionnaire1 (appendix).The study included 40 professional workers (doctors, social workers, nurses, psychologist, special teachers),8,9 mainly from the city of Zagreb (Table 1). 40% of them work with treated alcoholics in Departments of Psychiatry in three Zagreb University Hospitals, 37.5% work only in clubs for treated alcoholics and 22.5% work in both. The structure of professional workers in relation to the working place was expected. In hospitals, representation of nurses and doctors was highest, but in clubs for treated alcoholics there were more social workers (Table 2). The mean age of professional workers was 45 years (min. - 24, max - 68), while the mean duration of working with treated alcoholics was 15 years (min. - 1, max. - 40), which means 22 hours per week (min. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is debilitating and the most common circadian rhythm disorder. It is defined as having a sleep pattern delayed by at least 2–3 hours from conventional timing, with great difficulty sleeping at conventional sleep times despite the frequent desire to do so. It is assumed to be caused by a delay of the endogenous circadian rhythm. Although it has its own diagnostic criteria, it lies on a continuum spanning from intermediate to moderate and extreme evening chronotypes to DSWPD and to non-24-hour phase disorder. This continuum is mainly driven by endogenous circadian period length varying from just over 24 hours to an extreme of 25 hours. Behavioral, psychological, and societal variables also contribute to the difficulty adhering to conventional sleep times. The recent novel findings of many DSWPD patients who do not have a substantial circadian rhythm delay suggest the contribution of non-circadian factors to the intransigence of a late timed sleep period; there is considerable evidence of the association of mental and physical health risks with the apparent inability to synchronize with the earth’s 24-hour period of rotation. Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is defined as having a sleep pattern timed earlier than desired or conventional. Attempts to delay bedtime to a more conventional time are difficult and result in reduced total sleep time since wake times remain early. This condition is relatively rare, affecting 0.0%–0.33% of the population, and infrequently presents for treatment.",

She had a life-long history of two types of events: periods in which she would rapidly and uncontrollably lapse into unconsciousness, and spells in which she would \"pass out\" but maintain consciousness, the latter happening with increasing frequency in association with laughing, as of late. She also reported hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. A clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy was made. The prevailing pathophysiological concept of narcolepsy details \"partial intrusions of REM\" sleep into wakefulness. Healthy REM sleep includes generalized atonia, but with preservation of eye movements, respiratory function, and sphincter tone. Cataplexy recapitulates this pattern, and is often induced by extreme emotions, laughter in this case. Despite generalized and severe weakness and areflexia during this patient's cataplectic events, she was able to volitionally move her eyes, which is consistent with the physiology of REM sleep. The diagnosis of cataplexy is often missed, due to clinicians being unfamiliar with the findings and the lack of ability to induce sufficient emotional responses to trigger an episode. This example of cataplexy is also quite characteristic of the \"cataplectic facies.\" The ability to observe the infrequently observed phenomenon of cataplexy serves as a reminder that consciousness is preserved, as are extra-ocular muscle movements.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of the skin affect the psyche of a person significantly. The interplay between internal and external world can be depicted through the various skin reactions in regard to psychological or physiological stimuli. Psychocutaneous illness could be exclusively psychological or stress related or due to strong psychogenic factors. As per biopsychosocial model, it could be primary, multifactorial, or secondary to disfigurement. Whichever is the condition, invariably stress is a major contributing factor in prognosis and onset of disorders of the skin. Self-explanation, myth, stigma, and diminished self-confidence often lead to depression and suicidality followed by active avoidance of the workplace, in turn, causing significant disability in the individual. The conflict between self-image and perceived image frequently causes fear of rejection leading to social anxiety, reduced self-confidence, interpersonal communication, and impaired sexual intimacy with a partner. Maladaptive sets of coping strategies such as alexithymia, shame proneness, avoidance, concealment, and escape are very common among the sufferers which impair the attachment with family and friends. Children are the extreme sufferers as they develop inferiority, low self-esteem, loss of body image, and social withdrawal leading to rejection from parents and faulty development of attachment pattern. Hence, disorders of the skin can lead to impaired coping, impaired compliance, limitations in quality of life, negative body image, and stigmatization which invariably cause psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, phobia, and somatoform and adjustment disorders. Hence, there is a direct relationship between skin, mind, and society which we are going to explore in a detailed fashion to understand its impact on the psyche and the society.",

Recent observational data suggest that the intermittent hypoxemia often occurring with it may be associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome, including cerebral palsy, retinopathy of prematurity, and death. Treatment should follow an incremental approach, starting with head elevated positioning, followed by caffeine administration and nasal respiratory support. Sudden infant death syndrome has decreased markedly in incidence following primary prevention campaigns in many countries, yet continues to be a leading cause of death beyond the neonatal period. Although still incompletely understood, it seems that death is the result of an external trigger (e.g., prone sleep position) occurring in a vulnerable infant (e.g., born to a mother who smoked during pregnancy) during a critical developmental period (e.g., 2–4 months of age). Memory monitor recordings obtained during SIDS suggest that bradycardia, probably resulting from severe hypoxemia, is the primary abnormality in the sequence of events ultimately resulting in these deaths. Prevention should focus on a safe sleep environment, i.e., supine sleep position, a smoke-free environment, avoidance of overheating, use of a sleeping bag, and room but not bed sharing.",

      "title": "Unveiling the enigma of peduncular hallucinations: Visual hallucination following occipital lobe infarct",
      "abstract": "Dear Sir, Peduncular Hallucination (PH), initially delineated by Lhermitte in 1922[1] predominantly manifests as intricate visual phenomena, often endowed with realism and dynamism, frequently involving familiar figures and locales. Despite these vivid episodes, patients grapple with differentiating their hallucinations from actuality, though they generally retain a degree of insight into their hallucinatory nature. Remarkably, the authenticity of these hallucinations is so convincing that individuals frequently engage in verbal or even physical interactions with the perceived entities or environments. PH instances tend to occur more frequently during the nocturnal hours or in dimly lit settings. During interludes between these hallucinatory episodes, patients exhibit unimpaired memory and consistently provide accurate descriptions of their hallucinatory experiences, even in the presence of cognitive impairment affecting other facets of their daily lives.[2] Etiologically, the onset of PH typically follows an acute ischemic or hemorrhagic event affecting the midbrain, thalamus, or pons, with posterior circulation infarction emerging as the prevailing causative factor.[3] An intriguing neurological mechanism potentially contributing to the emergence of peduncular hallucinations involves the diaschisis phenomenon. In this context, a lesion in the left occipital region may induce dysfunction in midbrain structures through a diaschisis mechanism.[4] Over a span of 2 months, the patient experienced episodes of dizziness and stumbled while walking. Fortunately, these falls did not result in any physical harm or loss of consciousness. There were no post-fall complications such as seizures, confusion, memory impairment, or bleeding. Initial days following the falls seemed normal. However, after this period, family members noticed peculiar behavior. The patient began murmuring to himself consistently throughout the day and expressed a belief that a group of 6 to 7 individuals intended to harm him. He vividly described these people and their attempts to harm him, including methods like administering poison and electrocution. Strangely, he even reported seeing vehicles like trains inside his house, animals like rabbits, and vibrant colors such as pink, yellow, red, and green surrounding him. Remarkably, these visual occurrences persisted even when he closed his eyes and took place while he was fully conscious. Although initially distressed, he gradually comprehended that these were only images, leading to a reduction in his distress. The patient's basic functioning, including self-care, appetite, and interactions with relatives, remains relatively unaffected, as stated by family members and observed behavior. Upon examination of the central nervous system, parameters such as visual acuity, color perception, and eye movements appeared normal. Pupillary reflexes were within the expected range. Motor, sensory, and cranial assessments yielded normal results. Intentional tremors were present, but rigidity was absent. The patient exhibited a wide-based gait and faced difficulties during tests like the Romberg test and in performing tasks involving alternating movements and tandem walking. He is also a known case of hypertension for the past 5 years on Telmisartan 40mg, and his Blood pressure was maintained on this medication. Despite these issues, vital signs remained stable, and other systemic examinations revealed no notable abnormalities. However, a diagnosis of Parietal Hallucinosis was established based on his CT-Brain, which revealed an infarction in the left occipital lobe, as illustrated in Figure 1.Figure 1: CT brain (plain) showing the left occipital lobe infarct. The blue arrow marks shows the region of infarct in the left occipital regionThe patient commenced a daily regimen of Donepezil 5mg once daily and Melatonin 10 mg at bedtime. Following three days of consistent medication, there was a notable subjective reduction of approximately 50–60% in the frequency and vividness of visual hallucinations. In addition, the patient and their family members received psychoeducation regarding the nature and etiology of hallucinations and the underlying neurobiology. The presented case report sheds light on the intriguing and complex phenomenon of PH. PH is a rare and distinctive form of hallucination characterized by vivid and dynamic visual experiences that closely resemble perceptions yet lack external sensory stimuli. This case illustrates the typical features of PH, including the patient's struggle to differentiate between the hallucinatory experiences and reality, the realistic and complex nature of the hallucinations, and the tendency to engage in interactions with the perceived entities. The pathophysiology of PH remains under investigation. This report highlights its association with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic events affecting brain regions like the midbrain, thalamus, or pons, often linked to posterior circulation infarction.[5] These lesions disrupt neurotransmitter systems and sensory pathways, potentially due to imbalanced cholinergic and serotonergic activity.[6] Additionally, the concept of diaschisis proposes that a lesion in one area can impair interconnected regions, potentially explaining PH emergence from a lesion in the left occipital region affecting midbrain structures.[4] Treatment approaches encompass both pharmacological interventions targeting cholinergic and sleep-related pathways, as well as non-pharmacological strategies including cognitive-behavioral therapies and psychoeducation.[7] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

      "abstract": "Prevention campaigns to avoid risk factors for the occurrence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) during sleep have led to a significant decrease in the number of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly during sleep. Despite a growing amount of evidence, the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for SIDS is still largely incomplete. We will review the most recent epidemiological, electrophysiological, genetic and pathological research on this topic. From these data, a comprehensive model for SIDS has been proposed: the death would result from the combination of three factors (a prenatal vulnerability, a critical developmental period and an exogenous postnatal stress) and three potential mechanisms (deficiencies in breathing, autonomic and sleep-wake controls). As arousal represents the last chance of survival when an infant is exposed to a life-threatening challenge during sleep, failure to arouse could be involved in the final pathway of SIDS. An infant could be vulnerable to SIDS because of a deficiency in cardio-respiratory or in sleep/wake behaviour controls during sleep. Genetic, metabolic, nutritional or toxic prenatal brainstem injury could be responsible for these deficits. The infant s vulnerability lies latent until he/she enters the critical developmental period from 2 to 6 months when significant changes in sleep-wake, breathing and autonomic controls occur. The accident has a greater probability of occurring when the infant is exposed to an infection, or an unfavourable environmental factor which enhances the immature cardio respiratory and sleep/wake behaviours of the infant.

      "abstract": "Migraines can take many forms and often mimic medical disorders, such as epilepsy, stroke, or gastrointestinal disease. They are often accompanied by neuropsychological symptoms, including alterations in mood, irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, simple or complex visual and auditory hallucinations, distorted body perceptions, an altered sense of reality, or delusions. Migraine headaches occur periodically, are pulsating, vary in severity but are usually moderately severe, and last from hours to 3 days. Symptoms that can be part of an aura preceding a migraine headache generally include: irritability, depression, loss of appetite, diminished alertness, or elation and exhilaration. This chapter presents the possible mental signs and symptoms, physical signs and symptoms, variants or migraine equivalents, clinical presentation and the course and procedure. It discusses the Lilliputian hallucinations that a patient began to experience as part of her migraine aura when she was about 30 years old. The chapter also mentions a few details about cluster headaches.",

      "abstract": "Background Sleep disturbances comparable with insomnia occur in up to 80% of people with schizophrenia, but very little is known about the contribution of circadian coordination to these prevalent disruptions. Aims A systematic exploration of circadian time patterns in individuals with schizophrenia with recurrent sleep disruption. Method We examined the relationship between sleep–wake activity, recorded actigraphically over 6 weeks, along with ambient light exposure and simultaneous circadian clock timing, by collecting weekly 48 h profiles of a urinary metabolite of melatonin in 20 out-patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy control individuals matched for age, gender and being unemployed. Results Significant sleep/circadian disruption occurred in all the participants with schizophrenia. Half these individuals showed severe circadian misalignment ranging from phase-advance/delay to non-24 h periods in sleep–wake and melatonin cycles, and the other half showed patterns from excessive sleep to highly irregular and fragmented sleep epochs but with normally timed melatonin production. Conclusions Severe circadian sleep/wake disruptions exist despite stability in mood, mental state and newer antipsychotic treatment. They cannot be explained by the individuals' level of everyday function.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Fatigue Among Female Academicians",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

      "title": "Development of an inclusive and accessible non-pharmacological sleep aid device",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital physiological process essential for physical and mental health, characterised by reduced sensory activity and altered consciousness. Quality sleep enables critical functions such as tissue repair, memory consolidation, hormone regulation, and emotional stability. Conversely, inadequate sleep can lead to significant health issues, including mood disturbances, cognitive impairments, and increased risk of chronic conditions. Many individuals experience difficulty transitioning into the N1 stage of sleep which is the initial phase also known as the first stage of our sleep cycle where the body moves from wakefulness to sleep-often due to psychological factors, particularly stress. Consequently, there is an urgent need for effective, non-pharmacological interventions that can assist individuals in achieving a smooth transition from wakefulness to sleep. This research investigates the key parameters of sensory stimulation—specifically visual, olfactory, and auditory stimuli—that can be recommended for designing an effective non-pharmacological sleep aid device. stimulating sensory organs can enhance melatonin production, which is known to be the sleep-promoting hormone. non-pharmacological treatments account for a significant portion of sleep interventions; however, there is a lack of targeted research on visual stimulation techniques and their effectiveness in enhancing sleep onset. The study aims to explore how specific sensory stimuli can aid in the transition from wakefulness to sleep, especially for individuals experiencing sleep initiation difficulties linked to psychological factors. The primary objective is to identify non-invasive, sensory-based methods that promote relaxation and support sleep onset. Additional objectives include conducting pilot studies to evaluate the effectiveness of various stimulation techniques on sleep quality within a selected participant group, gathering and analysing data to establish optimal stimulation parameters, and providing recommendations that can guide the design of a sleep aid device. The methodology was structured to build a foundational understanding of sleep, beginning with the development of a framework for analysing sleep-related factors. Initial data collection involved survey studies, with an online survey yielding 72 responses, followed by printed questionnaires distributed to additional participants. Together, these methods provided a comprehensive set of insights that confirmed the validity of the research‘s direction. Subsequent test runs were organised to individually evaluate the effectiveness of each type of sensory stimulation, with participants completing feedback forms after each trial. User tests were conducted with six volunteers over nine nights, during which qualitative feedback was collected through structured questionnaires following each testing session. For visual stimulation, an experimental prototype was developed, featuring a pendulum with an amber light that gradually faded to darkness. This prototype was designed to be placed on the nightstand, where participants could observe the motion and light while preparing for sleep. In the olfactory stimulation test, participants received a choice of three essential oils—lavender, rose, and jasmine—based on individual preference, with instructions to spray the chosen oil before bedtime. Finally, for the auditory stimulation test, participants were provided with links to various relaxing soundscapes, which they could listen to via speakers or earbuds during their bedtime routine. Feedback gathered from each of these tests was synthesised into a feedback grid, leading to key findings that informed the final design requirements: the sleep aid device should prioritise external sensory stimulation to encourage relaxation, accommodate side and back sleepers, and offer customizable settings for each sensory mode. Additional features deemed essential included sleep-tracking capabilities, mobile compatibility, integration as a smart device, and rechargeable functionality. Participants expressed a preference for a device design incorporating white and blue shades, with amber lighting as the ideal light condition for sleep induction. Lower colour temperatures (2500K – 2700K) were identified as optimal for promoting relaxation and enhancing sleep quality. Furthermore, the repetitive motion of the pendulum was effective in reducing eye strain and encouraging a state of calmness conducive to sleep. In conclusion, this research provides a foundational understanding of sensory-based parameters that can be applied in the design of a sleep aid device, highlighting the potential of non-pharmacological, sensory-driven interventions to improve sleep onset and overall sleep quality. These findings offer actionable insights into sensory parameters that can guide the development of inclusive and effective sleep aid solutions for diverse users.",

      "title": "Volatile Anesthesia Does Not Satisfy Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Debt",
      "abstract": "A common statement made to patients before they undergo a general anesthetic is, \"We will watch you very carefully while you are asleep.\" The relationship between states of sleep and anesthesia raises clinically relevant questions. For example, sleep deprivation enhances pain, worsens obstructive sleep apnea, impairs immune function, and contributes to cognitive decline.1If a patient is sleep deprived, and if anesthesia is similar to sleep, will the sleep debt be diminished by anesthesia? In addition to being homeostatically regulated, mammalian sleep occurs with a prominent circadian rhythm. If a general anesthetic is administered during a patient's normal sleep time, will the patient be less sleepy after the anesthetic, as if he had maintained his normal sleep cycle?\"If a patient is sleep deprived, and if anesthesia is similar to sleep, will the sleep debt be diminished by anesthesia?\"In a report published this month by Pick et al. ,2the authors demonstrate that after a 6-h general anesthetic with sevoflurane, isoflurane, or halothane, mice exhibited a rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deficit, followed by a REM sleep rebound. The study also reports a nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep debt and rebound only after halothane. Pick et al. used an ingenious experimental design that made it possible to evaluate the effects of time, light-dark cycle, type, and duration of anesthetic agent on states of wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM. Their results documented significant main effects on the temporal organization of sleep and wakefulness caused by both duration and type of anesthetic. Analogous to the oxygen debt of exercise being compensated by an increase in minute ventilation, the Pick et al. results support the interpretation that the ability of volatile anesthetics to satisfy the homeostatic drive for sleep differs as a function of anesthetic agent and the NREM or REM phase of sleep. Pick et al. also raise the intriguing suggestion that the duration of anesthesia or sleep/wake states is monitored by some, as yet unknown, control systems. Their findings imply that the brain stores this information regarding the temporal organization of behavioral states and, after recovery from anesthesia, reactivates neuronal networks that generate the appropriate amount and type of sleep needed to reestablish homeostatic balance.States of sleep are different from states of anesthesia. Apply a painful stimulus and the individual who is asleep will awaken. One goal of a general anesthetic, of course, is to eliminate responsiveness to external stimuli. During sleep, humans cycle approximately every 90 min between the REM and NREM phases of sleep. During REM sleep, which is characterized by dreaming and skeletal muscle atonia, there are rapid eye movements, increases in brain metabolic and electrical activity, heart and respiratory rate irregularities, erection of the clitoris or penis, and oscillations in a large number of hormones.1In contrast, one of the goals of balanced anesthesia is to maintain prolonged intervals of stable autonomic function.In this last decade, there has been much progress documenting the similarities and differences between sleep and anesthesia. As recently reviewed,3there is consensus that states of anesthesia, like sleep, are actively generated by multiple brain regions, overlapping networks, and a humbling complexity of neurotransmitters and signal transduction cascades. Studies of sleep and anesthesia benefit from a viable interaction between clinical and basic research. Clinical concerns have led to interesting basic studies. Do patients in an Intensive Care Unit who are sedated for long periods get enough sleep? That question influenced a study in which sleep-deprived rats that received either propofol or isoflurane lost the righting reflex more quickly and also took longer to recover from anesthesia.4Additional studies found that sleep-deprived rats that received propofol showed reversal of both REM and NREM sleep debt.5Interestingly, the Pick et al. data from mice are consistent with recent data obtained from other studies. For example, rats deprived of REM sleep for 24 h that received isoflurane for 4 h had the same amount of REM sleep rebound as rats that were allowed to sleep ad libitum .6When rats were deprived of REM and NREM sleep and administered 6 h of sevoflurane, signs of NREM sleep deprivation were reduced to half the time of rats that did not receive sevoflurane anesthesia. REM sleep debt was not reduced by sevoflurane anesthesia, and sevoflurane induction time was significantly reduced in sleep-deprived rats.7The Pick et al. findings raise an interesting historical point regarding isoflurane. Most anesthesiologists today probably did not practice anesthesia during the early 1980s, when isoflurane was introduced. At that time, excluding enflurane, halothane was the most commonly used anesthetic. Recovery after isoflurane is remarkably fast compared with halothane, in large part because the metabolism of halothane releases bromide. The increase in bromide is related to minimum alveolar concentration hours of exposure, as the rise in bromide approaches sedative concentrations. In an editorial published in this journal in 1976, Nicholas Greene summarized other studies showing elevation of plasma bromide levels after halothane.8He noted that prolonged sedation can be seen after halothane anesthesia and that the peak levels of plasma bromide are in the range that can cause sedation.9The fact that recent studies searching for a relationship between sleep and anesthesia have not included halothane is probably because halothane is no longer used in many countries, including the United States.Going forward, more work is needed on the clinically relevant topic of sleep and anesthesia. The study limitations acknowledged by Pick et al. point to an exciting opportunity for bench-to-bedside investigations designed to document anesthetic effects on human sleep. Most patients who receive anesthesia also have pain on awakening, and sleep is significantly disrupted both by pain and by the use of opioids to treat pain.10The excellent study by Pick et al. encourages future research aiming to elucidate the contributions of pain to the sleep-altering effects of anesthetic molecules.",

Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014). While they may be dismissed as \"bad dreams,\" nightmares may be indicative of another disorder occurring in sleep. Nightmares are part of a category of sleep disorders referred to as parasomnias—\"undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousal from sleep\" (American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International classification of sleep disorders, 3rd ed. Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014). Parasomnias are categorized by the stage of sleep in which they occur: NREM sleep—typically observed in the first half of the night, versus REM sleep—associated with the latter half of the sleep period. NREM parasomnias are also referred to as \"disorders of arousal\" and include sleep terrors, sleepwalking, and confusional arousals. REM sleep parasomnias include REM behavior disorder (RBD) and nightmares (dreams with negative content that may cause awakening). It is important to identify what kind of parasomnia the \"nightmare\" represents, as there may be serious consequences such as injury to ones' self or others that can occur. Additionally, as in the case of RBD, it may be a potential sign of another neurodegenerative process, such as parkinsonism. Polysomnogram is often utilized in the evaluation of parasomnias and can also be helpful to exclude other disorders, which may mimic these conditions.",

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem.

      "title": "Editorial (Thematic Issue: Sleep and Psychiatry)",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake pattern constitute one of the major complaints of patients with a wide range of psychiatric conditions, including major depression disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol abuse. Recent advances have cast light on the mecanisms underlying modifications in sleep in psychiatric disorders, offering new approaches in management and opening new avenues of research. Isnomnia and psychiatric disorders, especially depression, are intimately linked. Insomnia, defined as a difficulty in initiating and/or in maintaining sleep leading to daytime repercussions, is not simply a symptom of depression but an independent diagnostic entity, and is known to be an independent risk factor for both depression itself and the development of a new depression episode or relapse. To date, the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the relationships between insomnia and affective disorders are not yet fully understood. The review by Chiara Baglioni et al. examines the latest findings from several fields of research, with particular attention to alterations of the arousal system leading to hyperarousal and to the possible biological mechanisms involved in the link between sleep alteration, insomnia, regulation of emotion, and mood symptoms. Links between depression sleep and circadian rhythms have long been suspected due to the existence of seasonal depression, where the onset of low mood correlates with a reduction in day length. Seasonal affective disorder (SA) is primarily a circadian rhythm disorder. Alfred Lewy discusses the theory of misalignement between the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion and the midpoint of the sleep bout, and emphasise the importance or careful timing of treatment administration (bright light or melatonin). Timing of treatment administration requiring detailed information on patients’ phase state and the role of new accessible tools such as dim light melatonine onset are evaluated as are different treatment modalities. The importance of biological rhythms in SA disorder has led to an interest in the role of circadian rhythms in the development of depression. The successes of chronobiotic treatments for SA disorder have led to the trialling of psychological and pharmacological treatments targeting circadian rhythms in unipolar major depression (MDD). The review by Sarah Hartley et al. focuses on the research linking circadian rhythms and depression, and on the evidence for effectiveness of chronobiotic treatments such as high intensity light, melatonin or melatonin agonist or behavioural therapy in MDD. The evidence base for novel antidepressants combining 5HT2c antagonist and melatonin agonist action in acute treatment of unipolar MDD and in relapse prevention is reviewed as is their use in clinical management of MDD. Managing bipolar disorder is a challenge for psychiatrists and it has been long known that sleep disorders are a sign of relapse. Carole Boudebesse et al. examine the evidence that sleep and circadian rhythms are disturbed in bipolar patients during both mood episodes and periods of remission. Therapeutic applications of chronobiology in bipolar disorder, such as specific psychosocial interventions, light therapy and physical exercise are described. Finally, psychiatrists are faced with frequent reports of sleep disorders in adults and children with attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, conversely, sleep specialists report certain symptoms of ADHD (attention deficits, fidgeting) in patients suffering from primary sleep disorders. Are ADHD symptoms secondary to sleep fragmentation due to sleep disorders such as sleep disordered breathing and periodic legs movements, and treatable with treatment of these specific disorders? Could some ADHD subjects share a common deficit in the sleep/wake regulation systems resulting in sleep fragmentation? The pathophysiological relationship between sleep disorders and ADHD is complex and probably multidirectional. The hot topic from the team of Astrid Claret et al. reviews the latest research and aims to help clinicians in developing a framework for understanding and treating patients suffering from ADHD and sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Recovery of central and peripheral neuromuscular fatigue after exercise",
      "abstract": "Sustained physical exercise leads to a reduced capacity to produce voluntary force that typically outlasts the exercise bout. This \"fatigue\" can be due both to impaired muscle function, termed \"peripheral fatigue,\" and a reduction in the capacity of the central nervous system to activate muscles, termed \"central fatigue.\" In this review we consider the factors that determine the recovery of voluntary force generating capacity after various types of exercise. After brief, high-intensity exercise there is typically a rapid restitution of force that is due to recovery of central fatigue (typically within 2 min) and aspects of peripheral fatigue associated with excitation-contraction coupling and reperfusion of muscles (typically within 3-5 min). Complete recovery of muscle function may be incomplete for some hours, however, due to prolonged impairment in intracellular Ca2+ release or sensitivity. After low-intensity exercise of long duration, voluntary force typically shows rapid, partial, recovery within the first few minutes, due largely to recovery of the central, neural component. However, the ability to voluntarily activate muscles may not recover completely within 30 min after exercise. Recovery of peripheral fatigue contributes comparatively little to the fast initial force restitution and is typically incomplete for at least 20-30 min. Work remains to identify what factors underlie the prolonged central fatigue that usually accompanies long-duration single joint and locomotor exercise and to document how the time course of neuromuscular recovery is affected by exercise intensity and duration in locomotor exercise. Such information could be useful to enhance rehabilitation and sports performance.",

Simple analgesics, purchaseable without a doctor's prescription, completely or markedly reduced the head pain in 20-60 min. Headaches due to insufficient sleep differ from tension headaches in their site, duration and response to analgesics. Assuming that pain implies a regional dysfunction, headaches caused by sleep loss provide support for the notion that sleep has a restorative function in the brain.",

      "abstract": "Visual discomfort occurs when the statistics of the retinal image depart from those of natural scenes, particularly in respect of an excess energy at spatial frequencies close to 3 cycles/degree. Computer models suggest that uncomfortable stimuli are processed with a larger and less sparse neural response. Uncomfortable stimuli usually evoke a relatively large oxygenation of the visual cortex of the brain, consistent with inefficient neural encoding. The discomfort may be homeostatic. The neural computation that sustains sight is therefore likely to be more complex when the visual scene is spatially periodic, when the colour contrast is high or when saccadic suppression is impaired by flicker that is too rapid to be seen.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

      "abstract": "by evidence of early histological damage, functional alterations, and signs and symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are prominent features of the radiation syndrome. In considering the nature of the altered physiology of the gastrointestinal tract produced by radiation, one is dealing with a very complicated system of the body. Digestion and absorption of food are complex and poorly understood. Symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract are reflected via a complex system of nervous control through the autonomic sympathetics and parasympathetics. To complicate matters further, the gut has an enteric nervous system of its own which allows for autonomous movements. Gastrointestinal symptoms may stem from diseases of the gastrointestinal tract itself, from diseases of other parts of the body via complex nerve pathways, from impulses arising in the central nervous system, or from a combination of these sources. Gastrointestinal symptoms of central origin are frequent and complex in character. Such complexity is exemplified in the phenomenon of vomiting which may be produced by the sight of blood, extreme fear, or a shocking experience. Other gastrointestinal functional disturbances of a more chronic nature may result from psychic imbalance. It is often difficult to distinguish between organic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and functional disturbances which are purely psychic in origin. In addition, disturbances of central origin are said to be produced by toxins affecting the vomiting and other higher centers. Many acute infectious diseases are ushered in with gastrointestinal symptoms which are believed to be due to central toxic as well as local effects. Disease or trauma of other viscera or parts of the body may produce gastrointestinal symptoms by reflex mechanisms through the central nervous system. Very little is yet known about the part the afferent and efferent nervous elements play in the symptomatology related to radiation injury of the gastrointestinal tract.",

Breath-holding attacks are relatively common and are an important problem. Although the attacks are not serious and the prognosis is usually good, parents often fear that their child may die during an attack. Parents therefore require explanation and reassurance from health professionals. Conduct disorders (often referred to as antisocial behaviours), such as aggression to others or theft, are more serious as they tend to be repetitive and persistent behaviours where the basic rights of others are violated. Emotional problems, such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder tend to occur in later childhood, and are often unrecognised because young children often find it difficult to express their emotions, or it may go unnoticed by the child's parents.

      "abstract": "At least three types of ictal atomic phenomena can be seen in partial seizures. Focal atomic seizures are partial seizures with ictal paresis or paralysis of one or more body parts preceding or independent of any convulsive activity. A diagnosis may be difficult without simultaneous EEG recording supplemented by video monitoring or polygraphy. Epileptic negative myoclonus manifests as brief lapses in tone in one or more muscle groups that interferes with motor coordination and postural control. Drop attacks can also occur in partial seizures, as have been well documented in patients with temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy. Different mechanisms may underlie these three phenomena. Focal atonic seizures probably result from relatively circumscribed seizure activity in one or more cortical areas that contribute to the elaboration and execution of motor functions. Whether this represents inactivation or interference in motor integration, or activation of inhibitory system, remains unresolved. The pathophysiology of epileptic negative myoclonus, like that of its positive counterpart, is probably to be found at a more local level, possibly from transiently enhanced local inhibition in the motor cortex. Drop attacks in partial seizures may be close in mechanism to that also seen in generalized seizures, possibly related to ictal activation of descending inhibitory pathways in the brainstem.",

This applies as much if not more to cases of mild head injury, because problems with memory and concentration and mood swings may be the only persistent after- effects. Thus the patients may appear to others to be fully recovered, yet continue to complain that they are forgetful, and that they get tired and irritable very quickly. Further, it may be difficult to accept their claim that they do have problems. They are generally very aware that they cope badly when they are tired, and may prepare themselves for the doctor’s appointment by having a rest or a sleep, so that he or she sees them at their unrepresentative best.",

      "abstract": "Tidur merupakan bagian hidup manusia yang memiliki porsi banyak,\r\nrata-rata hampir seperempat hingga sepertiga waktu digunakan untuk tidur. Tidur\r\nmerupakan kebutuhan bukan suatu keadaan istirahat yang tidak bermanfaat.\r\nNamun ada kalanya seseorang mengalami kesulitan tidur yang menyebabkan\r\nberkurangnya waktu tubuh untuk beristirahat, maupun untuk menjaga\r\nkeseimbangan metabolisme dan biokimiawi tubuh.\r\nBanyak sekali faktor yang menyebabkan seseorang mengalami insomnia,\r\nantara lain adalah faktor biologis dan psikologis. Kesulitan-kesulitan saat\r\npenyusunan skripsi sering dirasakan sebagai beban berat, akibatnya kesulitan yang\r\ndirasakan tersebut berkembang menjadi perasaan negatif yang menimbulkan\r\nketegangan, kekhawatiran, stress dan dapat menyebabkan insomnia.\r\nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat gambaran insomnia yang dialami\r\nmahasiswa selama menyusun skripsi, penyebab insomnia yang dialami subjek,\r\ngejala yang dialami subjek, serta strategi yang dilakukan untuk mengatasi\r\ninsomnia tersebut. Insomnia merupakan suatu kondisi ketidakpuasan seseorang\r\ndalam hal kuantitas atau kualitas tidurnya dan berlangsung selama beberapa waktu\r\n(Lumbantombing, 2004). Insomnia dapat disebabkan karena masalah psikis pada\r\nseseorang, rasa cemas dan perasaan takut yang berlebihan, bekerja terlampau\r\nlama dan keras, rasa sakit dan perasaan tidak menyenangkan.\r\nSubjek dalam penelitian ini adalah mahasiswa yang tengah menyusun\r\nskripsi yang mengalami insomnia selama lebih dari 1 bulan. Subjek berjumlah dua\r\norang subjek primer, dan dua orang subjek sekunder untuk masing-masing subjek\r\nprimer. Peneliti mengambil sampel penelitian dari mahasiswa psikologi\r\nUniversitas Negeri Semarang. Dalam penelitian ini peneliti menggunakan teknik\r\nobservasi non partisipan, yaitu peneliti secara pasif tidak terlibat langsung dalam\r\naktifitas yang sedang berlangsung dan terjadi sambil mencatat tingkah laku di\r\nsekitarnya. Peneliti juga menggunakan teknik wawancara yang bersifat\r\nsemiterstruktur yaitu wawancara dilakukan secara terbuka tetapi tetap\r\nberpedoman pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan tertulis.\r\nBerdasarkan keseluruhan hasil dan pembahasan dalam penelitian yang\r\ndiperoleh dalam penelitian studi kasus ini maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa, jenis\r\ninsomnia yang dialami subjek termasuk insomnia kronis (cronic insomnia). Bila\r\nsubjek sudah sama sekali tidak bisa tidur (dalam dua puluh empat jam subjek\r\ntidak tidur), subjek langsung meminum obat tidur yang diperjualbelikan secara\r\nbebas. Gejala-gejala insomnia yang dialami subjek antara lain subjek mengalami\r\nkesulitan untuk memulai tidur. AR harus membuat dirinya merasa lelah terlebih\r\ndulu agar dapat tidur, jika tetap tidak dapat tidur maka AR akan memaksakan\r\nmemejamkan mata agar dapat tidur, sedangkan NM harus menutup matanya\r\ndengan kain agar dapat tertidur. Gejala lain adalah kedua subjek merasa lesu dan\r\npusing saat bangun tidur dan susah berkonsentrasi saat melakukan pekerjaan.\r\nFaktor penyebab yang dialami subjek sehingga dapat menyebabkan\r\ninsomnia yaitu yang pertama karena permasalahan yang timbul saat penyusunan\r\nskripsi, yang kedua yaitu karena tuntutan orangtua yang menginginkan agar\r\nsubjek dapat menyelesaikan kuliahnya dengan cepat, dan mendapatkan gelar\r\nsarjana. Adapun faktor yang ketiga yaitu karena waktu perkuliahan yang sudah\r\nmendekati batas. Simpulan keempat, Gangguan insomnia memberikan dampak\r\nnegatif dalam kehidupan subjek. Pertama, akan mengurangi daya tahan tubuh\r\nsehingga berpeluang terhadap munculnya penyakit. Kedua, susah tidur akan\r\nberpengaruh terhadap stabilitas emosi sehingga mempengaruhi aktivitas\r\nkehidupan sehari-hari. Subjek mangalami penurunan tingkat motivasi,\r\nkonsentrasi, ketelitian, kreativitas, dan produktivitas kerja. Dari penelitian yang\r\ntelah dilakukan maka peneliti dapat memberikan saran pada subjek untuk\r\nmengurangi dan menghilangkan segala kekhawatiran dan kecemasan dengan\r\nbersikap optimis dan merilekskan diri saat melakukan pekerjaan, terutama saat\r\nakan tidur.\r\nSaran kedua adalah olahraga pada sore hari (enam jam sebelum tidur).\r\nMelakukan peregangan otot atau jalan kaki secukupnya selama duapuluh menit.\r\nHal ini akan meningkatkan metabolisme dan suhu badan, lalu akan menurun\r\nsekitar enam jam kemudian yang berefek pada tidur yang nyenyak. Ketiga,\r\nMengurangi rokok dan tidak merokok beberapa jam sebelum tidur karena rokok\r\nmengandung nikotin yang dapat meningkatkan semangat karena berefek sebagai\r\nneurostimulan. Selain itu rokok dapat membahayakan kesehatan diri sendiri dan\r\norang lain di sekitarnya, karena orang lain yang tidak merokok tetapi terkena asap\r\nrokok juga akan mengalami gangguan kesehatan dengan resiko yang sama.",

Mental changes can manifest as mild difficulties, but also as serious psychiatric disorders that require treatment. Baby blues, postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis and anxiety disorders, are changes that can occur in the puerperium period. The mildest ant the most common difficulty is baby blues or postpartum grief, which last for a short time and passes without consequence for the mther and her child. In the most cases treatment is not required, support from the environment and the family is enough. Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that needs to be treated.\r\n Simptoms of postpartum depression are feelings of sadness, loss of interest, insomnia, restlessness, etc. Treatment includes pharmacoterapy for alternative procedures.\r\n Postpartum psychosis is rare but the most serious form of postpartum disorders and can have very serious consequences for the mother and her child (even fatal outcome is possible). It is treated with pharmacotherapy and alternative methods, but sometimes requires hospitalization in the department of psychiatry. Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders, that is divided into panic disorders, obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress disorders and other specific phobias. The cause of anxiety disorders are mainly genetic factors, unwanted pregnancies, unprepared mothers for the role of motherhood and sudden hormonal changes. A large role in the prevention of mental health problems is played by a health visitor whose task is to educate women and their families, before and after birth and contribute with advice and skills to overcome postpartum stress and inital adjustment. During the preparation of the final survey was conducted trought social network Facebook („MeĊimurske mame i trudnice“, etc.) collected was 134 responses from April to May 2019. Results have shown 67,9% of participants did not have any psychological changes after birth. Nevertheless, 32,3% have manifested certain psychological changes, with baby blues being the most common ( 17,2%) followed by postpartum depression (7,5%) and anxiety disorder (6%). The age itself does not affect the change, while understanding and family support do. Quality education and awareness of the mother is very important , but it is important that the information is verified and accurate. The role of a health visitor, throught her education and advice, can prevent and identify certain difficulties in a timely manner is crucial and of great importance.",

The most frequent cause is stroke, followed by tumor, trauma, anoxia, vascular malformation, or multiple sclerosis. For some causes (and for stroke in particular), AIM can occur immediately after the brain lesion (for example, hemiballism during the acute phase of the stroke (Destée et al., 1990) whereas initial motor deficit may improve or be recovered rapidly. However, in other situations, AIMs (e.g. dystonia) emerge following a long period (a few months or years) of stable motor impairment (Marsden et al., 1985; Scott and Jankovic, 1996). AIMs can also be subdivided into transient (hemiballism, often in the acute phase) and persistent (dystonia, tremor, etc.). Whatever their timescales of appearance or disappearance, AIM may be the main symptom of stroke. This induces a delay in diagnosis or even a lack of knowledge of the specific diagnosis, since for the same underlying cause, the type of AIM can be quite different. This problem is sometimes clinically evident when the AIM is intense (hemiballism) or, in contrast, very moderate and focalized (asterixis). It is clear that a delay in diagnosis may have unhelpful consequences in terms of the patient's clinical and therapeutic management.",

      "title": "Nasal dilator for management of sleep apnea",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Sleep disorders are commonly caused by nasal obstruction. Fatigue, when present in those with nasal problems and otherwise unexplained, is often considered secondary to poor or inadequate sleep.‘,’ Nasal obstruction itself is associated with many systemic reflexes, including changes in intrathoracic pressure, pulse, and blood pressure.3 Reports during the 19th century proposed a nasal reflex rather than sleep disturbance as the origin of fatigue in many patients with nasal obstruction. The following case describes fatigue associated with nasal obstruction promptly relieved by a nasal dilator and therefore unrelated to sleep abnormalities. The patient was a 4%year-old man with a lo-year history of unexplained persistent fatigue unrelieved by rest. The fatigue was especially pronounced on awakening but continued throughout the day. It was not associated with pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, headache, or known sleep disturbance. Aside from fatigue, symptoms were limited to nasal congestion especially on the left side and a “heavy-headedness” sensation in the head. Four comprehensive examinations over the 10 symptomatic years were without relevant findings. Symptoms of nasal congestion and a cyst in the left maxillary sinus noted on a sinus roentgenogram prompted the following procedures: creation of antral windows, removal of the maxillary cyst, nasal septum reconstruction, and partial resection of the inferior turbinates; all with no effect on the fatigue. Approximately 8 years after the onset of fatigue, the patient noted that relief could be obtained by pressing up the left external nares. This observation suggested dysfunction of the nasal valve and prompted reconstruction using cartilage grafts, a procedure that was unsuccessful in relieving his inadequate air flow or his fatigue. At the suggestion of a consultant he purchased a nasal dilator for the left anterior nares and obtained almost immediate relief of the fatigue. Fatigue consistently returned within 15 minutes if the dilator was removed and promptly resolved when reinserted, indicating the lack of any association with sleep. Systemic reactions to nasal disease are well documented in the medical literature but fatigue, when associated with nasal obstruction, is generally considered secondary to sleep abnormalities. Before the clear association of nasal obstruction and sleep abnormalities was known, reports in the older literature postulated a “nasal reflex” to explain the resolution of fatigue and a number of other significant complaints after nasal surgery or cauterization. In 1898, Wells reported cases of neurological and mental manifestations of nasal disease associated with extraordinary fatigue.* At the time of the linkage of nasal symptoms with fatigue and inability to concentrate was well accepted enough to generate the term “aprosexia nasalis.” More recent research documents profound changes in blood pressure, pulse, and respiration with nasal obstruction. Furthermore, nasal stimulation is associated with vasoconstruction, laryngeal construction, and bronchoconstriction. Cottle maintained that air currents stimulating the nasal mucosa effect remote organs by nerve pathways and may be responsible for a state of ill health. Nasal valve movements, he also noted, were largely responsible for the “rest” obtained by the body during sleeps5 This case report suggests that unilateral nasal obstruction may be responsible for fatigue independent of any effect it might have on sleep.",

The excessive motor activity apparently is purposeless and is not influenced by external stimuli. There may be extreme negativism that is manifested by resistance to all instructions or the maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved. Additional features may include stereotypes, mannerisms, and automatic obedience or mimicry. 2 What follows is a case in which etomidate produced an unexpected arousal effect, rather than sedation, in a patient with catatonia caused by a high dose of steroids.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Excessive daytime sleepiness, hypnagogic-hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and cataplexy are symptoms associated with narcolepsy. It is not uncommon to occur co-morbidly between narcolepsy and psychiatric disorders. This association is poorly understood. Recent findings indicate that anxiety disorders also are associated with typical symptoms of narcolepsy. Objectives Study of the comorbidity between narcolepsy and psychiatric disorders, like anxiety, through a clinical case. Methods A 21-year-old female patient with no psychiatric history who consulted due to anxiety and panic attacks related to poor narcolepsy control. Debut of the neurological disease during adolescence with frequent cataplexy attacks that condition their daily activity and generate avoidance behaviors and agoraphobia. Results The patient complained of poor quality of sleep and reported a large number of different types of situations (eg, surprise, embarrassment) associated with cataplectic events. Treatment with SSRIs first and bupropion with pregabalin later was partially effective. Recent studies suggest efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation. Conclusions Anxiety disorders, especially panic attacks and social phobias, often affect patients with narcolepsy. Anxiety and mood symptoms could be secondary complications of the chronic symptoms of narcolepsy. Recent studies have shown that narcolepsy is caused by defective hypocretin signaling. As hypocretin neurotransmission is also involved in stress regulation and addiction, this raises the possibility that mood and anxiety symptoms are primary disease phenomena in narcolepsy. Recent studies suggest that vagus nerve stimulation could be potentially useful in the treatment of resistant depressive and anxiety disorder and it is not a contraindication in patients with narcolepsy.

      "abstract": "Light treatment stands as the first active clinical intervention for major depression, with an underpinning in basic lab research on the circadian timing system and seasonal physiological changes in animals. By contrast, pharmaceutical treatments were discovered as side effects of drugs targeted at other medical disorders. The first randomized, controlled clinical trial showed that winter depression (seasonal affective disorder) could remit by truncating long winter nights with bright artificial light in late evening and early morning. Morning light proved most effective, which implicated a change in circadian timing. Seasonality, however, is not essential for the light effect: The much larger cohort of patients with non-seasonal depression also responds to morning light. Bipolar depression can remit as quickly as after a single night awake, but with high risk of relapse after sleep the next night. By adding daily morning light treatment after the night awake, the remission is sustained. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders, especially with sleep onset insomnia, can be normalized by timed light treatment, avoiding recourse to hypnotic drugs. New applications of light treatment with promising initial data include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, fibromyalgia and other pain disorders, and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and dementia.",

      "abstract": "Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is plagued by many artifacts, that sometimes closely mimic pathology.[1] We review the most common artifacts in clinical practice.[2] 2.1 Motion artifacts Optic neuritis is characterized by T2 hyperintensity of the optic nerves [Fig. 1a]. Similar changes can also be produced by motion artifacts [Fig. 1b], which are recognizable by the associated blurring of nerve outlines and ghosting [Fig. 1b and c]. Repeating the scan with the patient fixing the gaze removes these artifacts [Fig. 1d].Figure 1: (a) Bilateral optic neuritis, (b) Eye motion during scanning causes motion artifacts, (c) Motion also produces ghosting and blurring, (d) Repeat MRI of the patient in Figure 1b during eye fixation2.2 Partial volume artifacts Signal changes similar to optic neuritis [Fig. 2a] can occasionally be seen in normal optic nerves [Fig. 2b]. This occurs when the nerves are tortuous and the MR section includes adjacent fat, which artifactually increases signal in the nerve [Fig. 2c]. Fat suppressed sequences [Fig. 2d] are immune to this artifact.Figure 2: (a) Right optic neuritis, (b) Similar changes in both optic nerves produced by partial volume artifact, (c) Genesis of partial volume artifacts, (d) Fat saturated scan shows normal optic nervesSimilar phenomena can affect the extraocular muscles. Extraocular muscles are enlarged and show T2 hyperintensity in disorders such as orbital myositis [Fig. 3a] and thyroid ophthalmopathy. However, even normally, the lateral rectus muscles can appear bulky and hyperintense to rest of the muscles on coronal images [Fig. 3b]. Oblique orientation of lateral rectus muscles to the coronal plane makes them more susceptible to this phenomenon [Fig. 3c].Figure 3: (a) Orbital myositis, (b) Bulky, hyperintense lateral rectus muscles in a normal individual, (c) Obliquity of lateral rectus makes it more prone for partial volume artifact2.3 Susceptibility artifact Signal changes produced by disorders affecting the inferior rectus muscle, such as myositis [Fig. 4a] can occasionally be seen on fat saturated sequences, in individuals with metallic dental implants [Fig. 4b]. Disturbance of the magnetic field along the floor of the orbit by dental implants or air in the maxillary sinus interferes with fat saturation and creates a false appearance of edematous changes [Fig. 4c]. The artefact is recognizable as it extends beyond the muscle boundaries and is worst inferiorly. A similar artefact can be seen when the patient uses eye makeup (mascara) containing metallic iron particles.Figure 4: (a) Inferior rectus myositis, (b) Susceptibility artefact due to dental implants (*) causes hyperintensity of all tissues along the orbital floor, (c) Magnetic field disturbance by the metallic dental implant extends into the orbital floor (dotted line)2.4 Chemical shift artifact The appearance of tumor deposits along the optic nerve [Fig. 5a] can be seen even in normal individuals [Fig. 5b] as the so-called \"Chemical shift artifact.\" This artifact is typically seen at the interface between fluid and fat containing structures (such as optic nerve and retroorbital fat) as a band of dark signal intensity on one side (along the frequency encoding direction). This is caused by \"mis-mapping\" (shift) of the signal from retroorbital fat, in relation to the perioptic fluid [Fig. 5c]. Fat suppressed sequences [Fig. 5d] are immune to this artifact.Figure 5: (a) Leukemic deposits on left optic nerve, (b) Curvilinear bands of bright and dark signal along superior and inferior aspects of optic nerves in a normal individual, (c) Illustration of chemical shift artifact, (d) Fat saturated scan in the same individual shows normal optic nervesThis artifact is also seen at the margin of fat containing structures surrounded by fluid (e.g., silicone oil in the globe or intracranial lipomas) and fluid containing structures surrounded by fat (e.g., cysts or hemangiomas within the retroorbital fat).

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONBruxism is psychopathophysiological disorder of orofacial muscle activity which is defined by American Academy of Orofacial Pain as a diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional activity including clenching, bracing, gnashing, and grinding of the teeth.1 The excessive and frequent nocturnal bruxist activity, unlike physiological muscular activity during sleep, results in non-physiological wear (attrition) of occlusal surfaces.2,3In multifactorial and often controversial bruxism etiology, peripheral (morphological) and central (physchological and pathophysiological) etiological factors can be distinguished.4 The most common morphological factors, such as occlusion (in particular occlusal discrepancies), along with the anatomy of the orofacial system have been considered more traditional than evidence based medicine and dentistry bruxism causative factors.4,5Bruxism is related to great number of pathophysiological factors. During sleep, sudden awakening or change in intensity of sleep may occur. That is arousal response. Then, generalized change of body activity occurs: higher heart rate, changes in breathing rhythm, peripheral vasoconstriction and muscular hyperactivity, including bruxism.6 Changes of the central neurotransmitter system in the nigrostriatal projection can cause the muscular activity disorders. Drug therapy can also induce bruxism: L-dopa, neuroleptics and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Numerous substances such as amphetamines, amphetamine-like substances, nicotine and alcohol can play major role in the etiology of bruxism, which has been particularly explained by effects via dopamine system.7Behavioral disorders and affective psychological factors, anxiety being one of the most prominent together with emotional stress, caused by sociological and psychological factors, can induce bruxism.8Dentistry and alcohol consumingAlcoholism is progressive mental disease with social and health consequences. The addiction to alcohol is more difficult to observe in early stages of alcoholism due to some traditional reasons related to alcohol consuming, which can have adverse side effects in dental treatment. Alcohol consumption leads to great number of systemic disorders, such as malnutrition and hypovitaminosis, neurological disorders, pathological changes in the digestive, cardiovascular and respiratory system.9,10Besides the poor oral hygiene, consumption of alcohol may cause oral diseases, periodontal diseases and premature tooth loss. Alcoholics are exposed to higher risk of orofacial trauma (for example, jaw fractures), fractures and even losing the removable dentures while under the influence of alcohol.11The aim of this paper is to give case report on Michigan splint treatment of very severe bruxism in female patient who was under psychiatric therapy due to alcohol consuming, which caused psychoorganic syndrome.CASE REPORTA previously treated 62 year old psychiatric female patient was referred to the Prosthodontic Department, School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb for prosthodontic treatment. She exhibited pronounced teeth abrasion.Psychiatric treatmentTaking her case history with the assistance of her son and from the available medical records of her previous psychiatric treatments, we found out that she had been an alcoholic for many years (F 10.2 diagnosis by the International Classification of Diseases - ICD) and subsequently developed pyschoorganic syndrome with characteristics of depression (F 10.7 diagnosis by the ICD). Although she has had the alcohol addiction problem for many years, her psychiatric treatment started in 2001. She was hospitalized for three months at the alcoholism ward and discharged in better health condition with recommendation to take 20 mg of fluoxetine in the morning and 3x5 mg of diazepam. In the same year, she was coming regularly for check-up in the Psychiatric patient clinic accompanied by her son who reported her abstinence from alcohol, but also less communication and more passiveness in behavior. …",

      "title": "Sleep Physiology, Circadian Rhythms, Waking Performance and the Development of Sleep-Wake Therapeutics",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle are highly prevalent and diverse. The aetiology of some sleep disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, is understood at the conceptual level of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep and in part at a mechanistic level. Other disorders such as insomnia are more difficult to relate to sleep regulatory mechanisms or sleep physiology. To further our understanding of sleep-wake disorders and the potential of novel therapeutics, we discuss recent findings on the neurobiology of sleep regulation and circadian rhythmicity and its relation with the subjective experience of sleep and the quality of wakefulness. Sleep continuity and to some extent REM sleep emerge as determinants of subjective sleep quality and waking performance. The effects of insufficient sleep primarily concern subjective and objective sleepiness as well as vigilant attention, whereas performance on higher cognitive functions appears to be better preserved albeit at the cost of increased effort. We discuss age-related, sex and other trait-like differences in sleep physiology and sleep need and compare the effects of existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep- and wake-promoting treatments. Successful non-pharmacological approaches such as sleep restriction for insomnia and light and melatonin treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorders target processes such as sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Most pharmacological treatments of sleep disorders target specific signalling pathways with no well-established role in either sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Pharmacological sleep therapeutics induce changes in sleep structure and the sleep EEG which are specific to the mechanism of action of the drug. Sleep- and wake-promoting therapeutics often induce residual effects on waking performance and sleep, respectively. The need for novel therapeutic approaches continues not at least because of the societal demand to sleep and be awake out of synchrony with the natural light-dark cycle, the high prevalence of sleep-wake disturbances in mental health disorders and in neurodegeneration. Novel approaches, which will provide a more comprehensive description of sleep and allow for large-scale sleep and circadian physiology studies in the home environment, hold promise for continued improvement of therapeutics for disturbances of sleep, circadian rhythms and waking performance.",

This is partly because the youngster becomes more independent and parental control over both the selection of particular sleep schedules and the consistent maintenance of these schedules across weekends diminishes. Even accurate descriptions of the existing problem may become difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, specific syndromes are common and may be identified and treated. There may be increased demands at both ends of the sleep period leading to later bedtimes, earlier wakings, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Periods of wakefulness confined to one portion of the night (beginning, middle, or end) may occur if sleep requirements are overestimated. Insomnia coupled with trouble waking may imply a circadian phase shift abnormality or a 'school-refusal' variant. And, variable sleep difficulties may be seen in a youngster with irregular schedules and poor sleep hygiene. Guidelines to the understanding, evaluation, and treatment of these syndromes are presented.",

Sleep is a state of inactivity accompanied by a loss of awareness and a markedly reduced responsiveness to environmental stimuli. When a recording is made of an electroencephalogram (EEG) and other physiological variables such as muscle activity and eye movements during sleep (a technique called polysomnography) a pattern of sleep consisting of five different stages emerges. This pattern varies from person to person, but usually consists of four or five cycles of quiet sleep alternating with paradoxical (active) sleep, with longer periods of paradoxical sleep in the latter half of the night. A representation of these various stages over time is known as a hypnogram, and one of these derived from a normal control subject is shown in Figure 1. The quiet sleep is divided further into four stages, each with a characteristic EEG appearance, with progressive relaxation of the muscles and slower, more regular breathing as the deeper stages are reached. Most sleep in these deeper stages occurs in the first half of the night.",

The monotony factor was responsible for typical changes in sleep function (difficulty involved in falling asleep, disturbed continuity of sleep as a process, decline in the depth, etc.), whose degree was related not only to the professional importance of the experiment but also to the individual intolerance to the main exposure. In these cases, the action of somnogenic mechanisms developed against the background of the action of analyzers (vestibular, accoustic, proprioceptive) that were under load and whose excitation during hypokinesia, noise, and rotation, especially in poorly adapted people, led to cumulation and was expressed in the phenomenon of spontaneous awakening. In addition to that, the genesis of dyssomnia, particularly during bedrest and water immersion, included hemodynamic disturbances induced by blood redistribution due to the recumbent position and monotonous motor activity. The psychosomatic feelings (congestion, edema, irresistible desire to stand up and stretch) brought about emotional strain which was later enhanced by the duration of the exposure.",

      "title": "Acute Dystonia during Sevoflurane Induction ",
      "abstract": "(Bernard, Le Roux) Anesthetist, Department d'Anesthesie Reanimation, Polyclinique Jean-Villar, Bruges-Bordeaux, France.(Pereon) Associate Professor, Laboratoire d'Explorations Fonctionnelles Neurologiques, INSERM CJF 9601, Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France.DRUG-INDUCED extrapyramidal syndromes occur most frequently with use of neuroleptic agents, but can also be induced by many drugs acting on the central nervous system. [1]Among these syndromes, dystonic reactions are characterized by involuntary contractions in opposing flexor and extensor muscles that produce sustained and fixed abnormal postures, such as oculogyric crises, tongue protrusion, trismus, laryngeal-pharyngeal constriction, torticollis, or bizarre positions of the limbs and the trunk. In the majority of cases, acute dystonia occurs within 1-3 days of initiating treatment or increasing neuroleptic dosages. Surprisingly, there are few cases of dystonic reactions induced by anesthesia in the literature (e.g., narcotics, propofol, diazepam, enflurane, barbiturates)[2-5]and only one in which the relation between acute dystonia and volatile anesthetics was probable. [6]We describe a patient being treated by phenothiazine drug, who experienced severe dystonia during inhalation of sevoflurane.A 19-yr-old man with a history of schizophrenia was scheduled for removal of multiple impacted teeth during general anesthesia. He had been treated by cyamemazine, a phenothiazine antipsychotic drug, in a daily dose of 75 mg for 2 yr, along with 180 mg dihydroergotamine to avoid neuroleptic-induced hypotension. Physical examination showed an anxious but docile, young man with normal vital signs, except for weight excess and gynecomasty. Findings from neurologic examination were normal. The patient had no history of involuntary movements or illicit substance consumption. No recent change was made in neuroleptic dosage, and medications were administrated up to the eve of surgery. Because he was afraid of venipuncture, a single-breath inhaled sevoflurane induction was planned after premedication by oral 5 mg midazolam. The patient was asked to take a deep breath of room air and forcibly exhale to residual volume, at which time a face mask was applied. He took 4 or 5 maximum breaths in a circle system filled with 8% sevoflurane in a 50% N2O-O2mixture and lost consciousness. Approximately 1 min later, a torticollic posturing began to develop, the stiffness rapidly extending to the left trapezius and scalenus muscles. Then, a severe rotation of the head developed, a trismus and an opisthotonus. An intravenous cannula was inserted and muscle spasm resolved with injection of 30 mg atracurium. The trachea was intubated and lungs were mechanically ventilated. During the sustained contraction of the neck and trunk muscles, the lowest oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) value was 87%. No significant changes in arterial pressure and heart rate were noted. Subsequent anesthesia (300 [micro sign]g fentanyl, 0.8% end-tidal isoflurane in 50% N2O-O2) was uneventful. No dystonic reaction was observed during recovery from anesthesia. Findings from postoperative neurologic examination were normal.Neuroleptic treatment is a frequent cause of dystonic movements, although dystonia can be provoked by any lesion in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and thalamus, or can be hereditary. Dystonic movements are characterized by an abnormal pattern of activity seen on the electromyogram, with cocontraction of antagonist muscles and overflow into extraneous muscles. [7]This could be caused by deficient reciprocal inhibition represented at multiple levels of the central nervous system. [8]Such cortical inhibition depends on thalamocortical messages released by the basal ganglia, for which the major role in movement control is to maintain an adequate balance between excitation and inhibition. Dopamine levels in the caudate nucleus and the putamen are clearly involved in the pathophysiology of dystonias. Curiously, the dystonia occurs during hyperdopaminergic and hypodopaminergic states, depending on dopamine relative influence on the direct or indirect striatothalamocortical pathways. [7,9]Moreover, other neurotransmitter mechanisms in the extrapyramidal system may be involved, and the ratios of dopamine:acetylcholine and of dopamine: serotonin blockade are important as well. [10]D2-dopaminereceptor blockade in the basal ganglia is widely believed to be the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes. Halogenated anesthetics do not have any known action on such receptors, but sevoflurane may have interacted with cyamemazine in the current patient by altering a dynamic relation between dopamine receptor blockade and other neurotransmitters in the brain.There are few reports of acute dystonia induced by anesthesia in the literature. Zabani and Vaghadia [4]describe a patient who exhibited a torticollic dystonia during propofol anesthesia, but the cause of this disorder was a focal cerebral trauma. Another case seems to be attributable to enflurane, but it was impossible to exclude pharmacologic interactions between many central drugs in this patient. [2]Stemp and Taswell [6]describe a woman in whom a spastic torticollis developed during isoflurane anesthesia. As our patient, she took antipsychotic drug (chlorpromazine) for a long time. However, dystonia occurred after 50 min of inhaled isoflurane at a 0.55% concentration in 70% N2O-O2, and the patient previously received 50 [micro sign]g fentanyl, 2 mg midazolam, and 250 mg thiopental; a possible interaction between any of these additional drug could not be excluded. In the current patient, acute dystonia occurred in the first minute after inhalation of sevoflurane, and responsibility of these drugs is very likely. However, the role of N2O cannot be precluded.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose : Absence status epilepticus (AS) is a prolonged, generalized, and nonconvulsive seizure that may occur in various circumstances. We report a series of patients in whom recurrent, unprovoked, typical AS was the main clinical feature. Method : We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients referred to our epileptic centers, on the following criteria: (1) recurrent, unprovoked episodes of typical AS representing the unique or the predominant seizure type, (2) at least one episode of AS recorded by video‐EEG or by EEG only, and (3) clinical and EEG features fulfilling the criteria of idiopathic epilepsy. We excluded patients with situation‐related AS. Results : We found 11 such cases (5F, 6M). The onset of AS was after puberty or in early adulthood in most; no clear triggering factor could account for the recurrence of AS episodes; infrequent generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and, rarely, absences, could also occur. These patients had no family history of epilepsy, normal neurological evaluation, normal neuroimaging, interictal EEG showing generalized spike‐ and polyspike‐wave discharges on a normal background, no photoparoxysmal response, variable response of AS to intravenous benzodiazepines, and usually good seizure control with valproate. This peculiar condition was misdiagnosed in most because of the unusual clinical presentation and of some atypical interictal EEG findings, often leading to the use of inappropriate drugs. Conclusion : Although there is some overlap with previously described epilepsy syndromes, specific and shared features point to the existence of a distinct epilepsy entity that we propose to name “absence status epilepsy.” This syndrome expands the spectrum of idiopathic generalized epilepsies.",

Cortical blindness follows bilateral occipital cortex damage, typically vascular. Deficits of verbal, visual and topographical memory become evident early in many dementias. Amnesias are common following a traumatic brain injury. Paramnesias are false or distorted recall – seen in acute confusional states or in dementia. Hallucinations are perceptual experiences without an external sensory stimulus – in other words, people see objects that are not there, hear voices, or believe there is a smell. Breakdown in speech production occurs in many dementias, such as motor neurone disease with dementia. Many find the classification of speech disorders difficult. Language competency depends on a discrete set of abilities: sensory decoding of the spoken message, appreciation of meaning, the capacity for repetition, and production of correctly articulated and correct speech.",

      "title": "Sleepwalking in four patients treated with quetiapine.",
      "abstract": "Sleepwalking (SW), also known as somnambulism, is characterized by episodes of complex motor behavior initiated during sleep, including rising from bed and walking about. It tends to occur between the ages of 4 and 8 and is likely to dissipate in adolescence. It occurs in 2-14% of children and 1.6-2.4% of adults (Remulla & Guilleminault 2004). SW occurs during the first third of the night, during non REM stages 3 and 4 of sleep. Throughout the various episodes, the individual has reduced alertness and responsiveness, a blank stare, and unresponsiveness to communication with others or to efforts to be awakened by others. On awakening, the individual has limited recall for those events of the episode and may be confused for a short period of time (American Psychiatric Association 2000). Most behaviors during SW are routine and of low complexity. However, also complex and dangerous behaviors, including screaming, running, and physical aggression, may occur (Bassetti et al. 2000). The disorder runs in families and does have a strong genetic basis, although the mode of inheritance is still unknown (American Psychiatric Association 2000). SW induced by medication has been reported for hypnotics (zolpidem, (Mendelson 1994, Harazin & Berigan 1999, Yanes Baonza et al. 2003, Sharma & Dewan 2005, Yang et al. 2005), zolpidem in combination with valproic acid (Sattar et al. 2003)), antipsychotics (perphenazine (Huapaya 1979), olanzapine (Kolivakis et al. 2001, Chiu et al. 2008), quetiapine (Hafeez & Kalinowski 2007, Seeman, 2010)), lithium (Landry & Montplaisir 1998), lithium in combination with neuroleptics (Charney et al. 1979, Glassman et al. 1986), antidepressants (amitriptyline (Huapaya 1979), bupropion (Khazaal et al. 2003, Oulis et al. 2010), mirtazapine (Yeh et al. 2009), paroxetine (Kawashima & Yamada 2003), reboxetine (Kunzel et al. 2004)), benzodiazepines (Lauerma 1991), diphenhydramine (Huapaya 1979), methaqualone (Huapaya 1979) and topiramate (Varkey & Varkey 2003). Since SW occurs out of slow wave sleep, the increase in slow wave sleep induced by lithium and certain neuroleptics, e.g. clozapine and olanzapine (Salin-Pascual et al. 1999, Sharpley et al. 2000, Cohrs 2008), may represent a favoring neurophysiological mechanism (Charney et al. 1979). As far as we know, (PUBMED, June 2012), SW associated with quetiapine treatment has solely been reported by Hafeez & Kalinowski (2007) in 2 patients, one affected by schizoaffective disorder and one by pervasive developmental disorder (both patients were also affected by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) as well as by Seeman (2011) in 1 patient, affected by schizophrenia. Hereafter, you will be told of four patients who presented SW during treatment with quetiapine, for the first time in their life.",

Cramps and improper breathing appear during speech. Stuttering is accompanied by physical symptoms that appear in stressful communication with the child. Stuttering is widespread in the world, and it originates from ancient times. First, it occurs between the second and third years of life, when speech develops intensively, but it may occur later. The cause of stuttering is explained by three theories: constitutional, developmental and environmental. The speech-language development of children is increasingly influenced by the media, which have become an important part of everyday life. There are more division of stuttering. The first division is on physiological, primary, secondary and acute / abrupt stuttering, while the other is psychogenic and neurogenic, which appear later in life. There are five stages of stuttering development, of which three stages appear during preschool age (developmental speech failure, border stinging, initial stuttering), stage during school age (transient stuttering) and stage during adolescence and further (advanced stuttering). Speech therapy is performed with the child - indirect and direct, before which diagnostic procedures are required. The child has fear of speaking and situations that require speaking, which affect his psychological state and selfconfidence. It is therefore important to provide support and encourage it in progress. A research was carried out to find out how often preschool teachers have interactions with a child who has a speech disorder and in cooperation with a therapist carries out speech excerises, how often do they cooperate with the child's parents and in which way those children included in working with other children. The results show that most preschool teachers do not consider themselves competent to work with children with a speech disorder, but they have cooperated with parents in every possible way. These children were daily involved in the work of the group that contributes to their further growth and development.",

In most cases, the trauma recalled was child sexual abuse, but in some cases the trauma was ritual abuse by satanic covens. Therapists who treat such patients theorize that memories of extremely traumatic events, especially of early sexual molestation, are so painful that they are barred from awareness by repression or dissociation.1 “Repressed” memories are those that are strictly forbidden to surface, while “dissociated” memories are allowed expression only when the patient is in an alternate state of mind, as in MPD. Whether in the context of MPD or another disorder, repressed or dissociated memories are thought to cause various symptoms, both mental and physical. Patients with repressed memories of childhood rape, for example, may fear intimacy with others or have undiagnosable pelvic pain.",

      "title": "Cognitive-behavioural Analysis and 1 reatment ot Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a condition characterized by subjective complaints of insufficient sleep and poor daytime functioning. Objective measures of sleep and daytime functioning, however, seldom show evidence of a similar degree of dysfunction. Most insomniacs, for example, do not suffer from sleep deprivation or daytime sleepiness. This discrepancy between subjective and objective measures of sleep and daytime functioning suggests that cognitive factors may play a central role in persistent insomnia. In particular, it is argued that fears about insufficient sleep and its adverse daytime consequences tend to interfere with sleep, thereby causing a vicious cycle which serves to maintain the insomnia. It is also argued that perfectionist standards and other dysfunctional beliefs may predispose people to these kinds of fears. Finally, existing models for cognitive-behavioural treatment of insomnia are criticized for being almost exclusively focused on the night-time aspects of insomnia. If insomnia is maintained by various kinds of vicious cycles involving fears, beliefs, and standards with regard to daytime functioning, these daytime aspects of insomnia should receive more attention in cognitive-behavioural treatment. Key Words: insomniasleep deprivation cognitive behaviour therapyvicious cycles",

      "abstract": "Many children with severely impaired sight exhibit stereotyped mannerisms. Visual self-stimulation, e.g. eye-pressing and light-gazing, normally is restricted to the visually impaired; prolonged eye-pressing is the most common. This behaviour depends on onset of visual impairment, age, degree and quality of residual light, type of ocular abnormality, the presence of additional handicaps, and the activities in which the child is involved. Children with bilateral optic-nerve defects never press their eyes; those with retinal disorders tend to press vigorously. A possible physiological explanation is that self-stimulation occurs when the demand of the brain for meaningful visual information is not adequately met.",

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Development in Adults and Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter reviews age-related changes in sleep, circadian rhythms, and sleep disorders in adults and older adults. With advancing age there are major changes in sleep, including sleep timing, the amount of slow-wave sleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings, sleep consolidation, and total sleep time. There are also changes in circadian rhythmicity with aging, including a reduced amplitude of some circadian rhythms and some evidence for reduced sensitivity to light. The interaction between the sleep and circadian regulatory systems also changes with age, resulting in greater difficulty sleeping during the biological daytime, the nocturnal sleep episode occurring at earlier circadian phases than in young adults, and a reduced ability to obtain a long and consolidated sleep episode. In addition to these general changes in sleep and circadian rhythmicity with aging, the sleep of many older people is impacted by a higher prevalence of specific sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements of sleep, and rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder; and they are also more likely to have chronic medical problems that interfere with sleep and to take medications that either disrupt nighttime sleep or impact daytime alertness.",

      "abstract": "The word “apnea” means literally \"without breath\", and thus “sleep apnea” means not breathing while sleeping. Normally, during sleep we do not have pauses in-between breaths. Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a common and disabling condition; its lifetime prevalence in general population is estimated by several studies to 1-5%. There are data that prove the fact that patients with bipolar disorder show cognitive deficits in all stages of the disorder, but also during remission phases. Within bipolar disorder, bipolar depression occurs more frequently, lasts longer and has a higher rate of relapses than mania. Bipolar patients usually complain of cognitive deficits such as attentional or memory deficits Patients with bipolar disorder experiment during depressive episodes dysfunctions in attention (difficulties in focusing and maintaining attention), memory (deficits of declarative and nondeclarative memory, affected verbal recall and recognition), language (bradyphemia with longer moments of pause during speech), psychomotor performance (psychomotor inhibition, slowness of motor functions when the number of tasks increases), executive functions (limited ability to acquire or relearn different skills), general intellectual functioning (information processing deficits). Recent studies have made some suggestion regarding a certain degree of cognitive impairment that is also found in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. In order to have a more accurate assessment regarding the degree of cognitive dysfunctions both during depressive episodes and euthymic phases in bipolar disorder, diagnosis criteria for depression and for remission should be strictly respected and coexisting factors that may influence the results should not be taken in consideration.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic twilight state on the one and amnestic episode (transient global amnesia) on the other side are as a rule easy to differentiate from the patient's age, his behavior during the acute state of disease and the kind of its improving. Contrary to other authors' opinion, differentiation is not just possible by diagnosing an injury or its absence. In minor skull traumata preceding the traumatic twilight states injuries are often not manifest and otherwise amnestic episodes occasionnally occur after minor traumata. In a 64 years old woman an obviously typical amnestic episode appeared in direct connection with a probable fall on the back of the head. A 28 years old man underwent a five-hour amnestic episode whereas the EEG showed normal curves. The episode occurred 15 minutes after striking hard upon the ground with the back of the head during a ground roll without following unconsciousness. In both cases traumatic twilight states were not involved. In account of the interval of 15 minutes the trauma of the second case seems not be be the direct cause for the manifestation of amnestic episode. It also shows that the aspect of the disease in the rare occurrence in younger or middle-aged persons is on principle not different from that in old ones. Since a special medical examination during the acute state is only possible as exception the patient's amnestically seizable behaviour obtains greatest importance in differential diagnosis. For the rare coincidence the trauma is given no pathogenetic relevance in amnestic episodes.",

      "abstract": "In autoimmune diseases, also called connective tissue diseases, many systems and organs are involved, including the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system. The frequency of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations varies in certain autoimmune diseases. One of the most common causes of these symptoms are vascular pathologies, including inflammatory and thrombotic, immunologic and atherosclerotic changes. Neuropsychiatric complications may present as a single symptom or might form a syndrome. In a particular patient, a syndrome might change its form in time, presenting itself as a different syndrome. Quite a lot of these symptoms are not a result of a disease itself but its treatment, metabolic abnormalities, arterial hypertension or infection. Steroids play a particular role in the induction of these complications. The role of increasingly used biological agents is uncertain. The most frequent psychiatric manifestations of the connective tissue diseases are: benign behavioural changes, emotional instability and sleep impairment. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are most frequently seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (up to 80% of these patients), particularly with the co-existent antiphospholipidsyndrome. Psychoses with or without seizures are included in the diagnostic criteria of the disease. A separate clinical problem is an induction of a synthesis of autoantiobodies by some drugs, including psychiatric drugs. These antibodies induce clinical symptoms of an autoimmune disease only in some patients, most frequently the symptoms of lupus erythematous, co called: drug induced lupus, including arthralgia, myalgia, fever, skin lesions and serositis. The diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric complications of autoimmune diseases is quite complicated. It is extremely important to distinguish whether a particular symptom is primary to the disease itself or secondary to its treatment. The most important recommendations are treatment of the underlying disease, its exacerbations and chronic phase, and prevention and treatment of vascular problems.",

Sleep disorder can cause many complications, including the worsening of the brain injury prognosis. Insomnia occurs in 29% traumatic brain injury patient. Insomnia suspected due injury in inferior frontal, anterior temporal including basal forebrain, also sympathetic nerve hyperactivity. Insomnia increase the risk of stroke, disability and mood disturbance. Hypersomnia occurs in 28% traumatic brain injury patients. Hypersomnia suspected due orexin decrease and injury in sleep promoting area. Hypersomnia suspected related to recovery, less activity time and accident due sleepiness. There are no prevalence data of circadian rhythm disturbance after traumatic brain injury. This disturbance is caused by injury in supra-chiasmatic nucleus and related to global worsening on the patient. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly linked with injury area, but hypersomnia is not particularly linked to any area and only related to orexin decrease. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly related to the worsening condition on the patient, but hypersomnia is associated with recovery and not particularly related to any disturbances. It is hoped that understanding the sleep disorder after traumatic brain injury can rise the alertness of this matter and encourage clinicians to increase the quality of sleep disorder due to traumatic brain injury management.

      "title": "In vivo exposure treatment for agoraphobia.",
      "abstract": "Agoraphobia is a condition that most often occurs in the context of panic disorder and is characterized by intense fear or anxiety of places or situations in which escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of a panic attack or panic-like symptoms (APA, 2000). The purpose of this paper is to examine the behavioral mechanisms that may be responsible for the development and maintenance of the disorder, as well as how the disorder can be treated. In particular, the effective use in vivo exposure is described. Key words: In Vivo Exposure, Agoraphobia, Behavioral Treatments, Anxiety Disorders. ********** Agoraphobia is characterized by intense anxiety or fear of places or situations in which escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of a panic attack or panic-like symptoms (APA, 2000). These symptoms may include increased heart rate, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, a feeling of choking, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, feelings of derealization or depersonalization, fear of going crazy, fear of dying, numbness or tingling sensations, or chills. The individual develops a fear of dying, losing control, or embarrassing themselves during these panic-like symptoms in a variety of situations such as driving, shopping, being in crowded places, traveling, standing in line, being alone, or attendance of meetings or social gatherings. Mowrer's two-factor theory (1960) proposes to explain the anxiety response based on the principles of both respondent and operant conditioning. Respondent conditioning is believed to have occurred with the pairing of a stimulus that evokes a fear response with stimulus by-products arising from strong bodily somatic sensations. Therefore, bodily sensations become conditioned responses triggered by high levels of private stimulation generated by anxiety and fear. When the individual is confronted with these triggers and the associated aversive emotions, the individual attempts to escape or avoid these triggers. The result may be a reduction in fear and distress and the individual learns through negative reinforcement that escape or avoidance of these cues reduces distress. Some debate exists on the completeness of the respondent conditioning mechanisms involved in the development of panic disorder (Bouton, Mineka, & Barlow, 2001). The debate in part centers on the role of selected cognitive appraisal processes in relation to fear conditioning. Nonetheless, behavioral researchers seem clear on the operant conditioning mechanism in the development of the agoraphobic response. Agoraphobia most often occurs in the context of panic disorder; however, it can become relatively independent of panic attacks (Craske & Barlow, 2001). An individual may not have had a panic response for some time, although the avoidance behaviors associated with agoraphobia remain. Not all persons who have experienced panic attacks or develop panic disorder go on to experience agoraphobia. There has been no evidence that age of onset or frequency of panic predicts an agoraphobic response, however, agoraphobia tends to develop in younger individuals. In a study by Bourden, Boyd, Rae, and Burns, (1988), 74% of the participants had developed agoraphobia before the age of 25. In addition, the likelihood that agoraphobia will develop increases as the length of panic increases (Craske & Barlow, 1988). Panic disorder with agoraphobia is diagnosed three times more often in women than in men (APA, 2000) and this gender difference increases as the severity of the agoraphobic response increases (Craske & Barlow, 1988). It can be challenging to differentiate agoraphobia from a specific phobia. A diagnosis of specific phobia must be considered if the avoidance is limited to one or only a few specific places or situations. Social phobia should be considered if the avoidance behaviors are limited to only social situations and fear of negative evaluation from others. …",

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention.

No pain medications required.2) Slight pain which lasts a bit longer, still able to perform usual tasks and again, if concentration is shifted away from the pain, the pain is forgotten about. No pain medications required.3) Pain is more noticeable and it comes and goes more frequently. Still able to perform usual tasks but it takes a bit of effort. Mild analgesic usually will help with this type of pain.4) The pain lasts for longer periods, it is much more noticeable and it is starting to bother and interfere with concentration and tasks requiring more effort and concentration. Mild analgesia should alleviate this type of pain, maybe more doses than one single dose may be required. A hot pack or ice pack may also help alleviate the pain.5) The Pain is now very noticeable, it is interfering with everyday tasks and a pain reliever is now required at 4 to 6 hourly intervals. Depending on the patient, someone with acute pain, may still respond well to mild analgesia probably at 4th hourly, maybe with added codeine (if the patient is able to take it) and even heat or ice may help with some relief of this level of pain.6) The Pain level is medium heading towards strong now and it is becoming more constant and it is not easily forgotten about. Pain relief is now required and it may need to be stronger than just mild analgesia, added codeine may help with the level of pain relief, this all depends on whether the pain is acute or chronic and on the patient's actual level of pain tolerance. A chronic pain patient may still have this level of pain even with strong pain relief.7) The pain level is now medium to strong and the pain is continuous. It is not relieved by mild to medium analgesia. Stronger narcotics are now required for pain relief. Chronic pain patients may still be at this level, even with strong narcotic pain relief. Heat may also aid with relief. Its becoming harder to concentrate due to the strength of the pain.8) The pain is becoming unbearable, strong narcotic pain relief is required. The chronic and acute pain patient will be irritable, hot and may be flushed, perspiration may be noticeable. Blood pressure may also be elevated. Patient may start to shake a bit if the pain has been going on for too long.9) The pain now is unbearable, only strong narcotic pain relief for the acute patient will help with the pain. The chronic pain patient will be irritable, the patient may be flushed and their palms are usually sweaty, blood pressure usually raised, pain relief needs to be increased and re-assessed. Nausea or vomiting may be present. The patient may be trembling or shaking due to the amount of pain, moaning and groaning may be present. Whether the pain is acute or chronic, the patient is usually unable to sleep or concentrate on the smallest task.10) The pain level is totally unbearable, the patient maybe vomiting or can even lose consciousness. The patient may also become delirious, moaning and groaning without making any sense. The blood pressure may still be elevated or by now may have dropped and the patient may go into shock. The patient must be treated by his/her symptoms, if cold, then the patient should be kept warm and if hot they should be cooled down. Pain relief is needed urgently. The patient may even become incontinent.",

Ictal semiology may vary depending on the etiology, age at onset, and cerebral areas involved in the epileptogenic network. In childhood, EE could manifest as tonic head drop seizures, generalized seizures, or late-onset epileptic spasms. However, in teenagers or adults, seizures are often preceded by aura and commonly manifest as focal seizures with or without impaired awareness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities are seen in less than half of the reported cases. Posterior or multifocal interictal discharges can be seen in patients with EE. No randomized data about treatment are available. Structural epilepsies or coexistent unprovoked seizures other than eating seizures are poor prognostic factors for pharmacological outcome.",

      "abstract": "Background and purpose: Sleep disorders are increasingly implicated as risk factors for stroke, as well as a determinant of stroke outcome. They can also occur secondary to the stroke itself. In this review, we describe the variety of different sleep disorders associated with stroke and analyze their effect on stroke risk and outcome. Methods: A search term-based literature review (“sleep,” “insomnia,” “narcolepsy,” “restless legs syndrome,” “periodic limb movements during sleep,” “excessive daytime sleepiness” AND “stroke” OR “cerebrovascular” in PubMed; “stroke” and “sleep” in ClinicalTrials.gov) was performed. English articles from 1990 to March 2023 were considered. Results: Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disorders are risk factors for stroke. In addition, sleep disturbance has been reported in half of all stroke sufferers; specifically, an increase is not only sleep-related breathing disorders but also periodic limb movements during sleep, narcolepsy, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, insomnia, sleep duration, and circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders. Poststroke sleep disturbance has been associated with worse outcome. Conclusion: Sleep disorders are risk factors for stroke and associated with worse stroke outcome. They are also a common consequence of stroke. Recent guidelines suggest screening for sleep disorders after stroke. It is possible that treatment of sleep disorders could both reduce stroke risk and improve stroke outcome, although further data from clinical trials are required.",

The neurological findings indicate that non-meaningful recurring utterances/automatisms, palilalia, tics and, possibly, acquired stuttering are symptoms of basal ganglia dysfunction. Echolalia seems to be related to dysfunction of the frontal lobe system. Production of verbal stereotypies and emotionally charged real word recurring utterances is viewed to indicate the activity of right hemisphere language mechanisms. The neurolinguistic data suggest that echolalia is generated quite high in the linguistic processes of formulation, non-meaningful recurring utterances close to the bottom of the formulation apparatus and palilalia downstream. Verbal perseveration remains an elusive symptom, both neurologically and neurolinguistically.",

The optimum strategy for reducing sleepiness in connection with irregular work hours would be to simple avoid night and early morning work and to ensure proper time for sleep between work periods. Still, if irregular work hours cannot be avoided, fatigue may be reduced through strategic sleeping (including naps), coffee intake, and phase adjustment through light or melatonin (not properly evaluated yet, though). As a complement, alertness may be protected through increasing the level of stimulation in the work situation. This may be accomplished through changing work tasks, controlled noise, light physical activity or interaction with work mates. To some extent also cold air, fresh air, and bright light may be effective. However, it should be emphasized that increased stimulation is effective only for as long as the stimulation is applied. The effect wears off very rapidly.",

Chronic fatigue, headache, hypersensitivity to visual stimuli are other classical features of MdDS. The impact of MdDS on quality of life is significant.

Transient insomnia is uniformly associated with objective sleep disturbances which have been documented following phase shifts of the major sleep period such as that caused by transmeridian travel.

Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed.

Conversely, a relatively rapid process of adaptation may suppress the manifestations of motion sickness. In addition, there are other ways of weakening or preventing the response. Thus, the effect of motion is minimized by assuming a supine position, which greatly reduces the stimulation of the utriculus. Further, the reduction of psychological, visual, visceral or other facilitating influences may lower the incidence of motion sickness. Finally, there are certain drugs which are preventive.

However, other abnormal movements can emerge during sleep, either as a primary phenomenon or in association with another underlying movement disorder, such as Parkinson's disease. In addition, some movement disorders are associated with excessive daytime sleepiness or insomnia. A history from the patient's bed-partner is very helpful in the assessment of movement disorders during sleep. The patient themself may not be aware of the problem, and may simply report excessive daytime sleepiness because of poor quality of sleep. Movement disorders during sleep are often a very early symptom of another underlying movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy, but may be overlooked unless specific enquiry is made during history taking. Table 12.1 lists causes of movement disorders which occur during sleep, and movement disorders which may be associated with sleep disturbance.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a life-long neurological, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder. Most frequent symptoms involve excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted night-time sleep. The estimated prevalence of narcolepsy is 0.05%. Initial symptoms usually start in childhood and young adults. Diagnosis of narcolepsy is often problematic, and it can take up to 20 years between the first observed excessive sleepiness and a fully developed disorder. Both genetic and environmental contribute to narcolepsy onset. A very strong association was observed in the case of human leukocyte DQ antigens, especially DQB1_0602. We distinguish narcolepsy type 1 and 2. Diagnosis of both types is based on the patient’s history, confirmed by multiple sleep latency test (MLST) with preceding polysomnography (PSG). Highly specific findings in these examinations are SOREMPs – occurrence of REM period within 15 minutes after falling asleep. In narcolepsy type 1 cataplexy is present, and CSF hypocretin-1 concentration is undetectable as opposed to narcolepsy type 2. Early diagnosis and implemented treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of patients with narcolepsy. Non-pharmacological treatment such as good sleep habits and daytime naps play an important role in better symptom control. Pharmacological treatment helps to overcome hypersomnia and cataplexy. This review includes the most important clinical features of narcolepsy.",

For example, sleep apnea in adults affects men more than women, is more prevalent in the obese, and presents with symptoms of snoring and excessive somnolence. In preadolescent children, sleep apnea affects both sexes equally, is more closely correlated with adenotonsillar enlargement than obesity, and may be more likely to present with daytime inattention and learning problems rather than frank somnolence. Likewise, the insomnia and associated bedtime struggles of a 3-year-old bear little resemblance to the insomnia of a mature adult apart from the fact that both individuals are unable to easily fall asleep. Sleep disorders in children are reviewed with particular focus on age-related changes in normal sleep and on sleep disorders that primarily or exclusively affect children. Pediatric aspects of other sleep disorders will be reviewed in more limited detail, with examination of how age, developmental level, and comorbid conditions cause clinical presentation and treatment to differ from that of adults.",

      "title": "Impact of Cognitive Behavior Therapy on Anxiety and Depression in Adolescent Students",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAnxiety and depressive disorders in adolescents were thought to be relatively rare and low impact conditions. As a result, our empirical knowledge about adolescent anxiety and depression is less extensive than it is for the adult conditions. When adolescents suffer from a severe anxiety disorder their thinking, decision-making ability, perceptions of the environment, learning and concentration get affected. They not only experience fear, nervousness, and shyness but also start avoiding places and pleasurable activities. Anxiety also raises blood pressure and heart rate and can cause nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, ulcers, diarrhea, tingling, weakness, and shortness of breath.Other symptoms can be seen in adolescents who are suffering from anxiety are frequent self-doubt and self-criticism, irritability, sleep problems and in extreme cases, thoughts of not wanting to be alive. If these adolescents are left untreated, they may face risks such as poor results at academic activities, avoidance of important social activities, and substance abuse. Adolescents who suffer from an anxiety disorders are likely to suffer other psychological disorders such as depression, eating disorders, attention deficit disorders both hyperactive and inattentive, and obsessive compulsive disorders (Ipser et al., 2009).Depression can be viewed as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel in this way at one time or another for short periods. Clinical depression is a mood disorder in which we could see a feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of time (Ballas, 2009).Adolescents who are having depression could experience feelings of emptiness, anxiety, loneliness, helplessness, guilt, loss of confidence and self-esteem and changes in sleeping and eating habits. In addition to these they often act out. That is, they always try to cover their depression by acting angry, aggressive, running away or becoming delinquent (Verma and Saraswathi, 2002).Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a popular psychotherapeutic approach, which aims to alleviate distress by modifying cognitive content and process, realigning thinking with reality (Longmore and Worrell, 2008). Cognitive Behavioural therapists identify and treat difficulties arising from an individual's irrational thinking, misperceptions, dysfunctional thoughts and faulty learning. CBT includes cognitive techniques as well as behavioural components. The former emphasizes on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and maladaptive beliefs while the latter involves graded task assignments, pleasant events scheduling as well as other skills training such as relaxation skills, communication skills, assertiveness skills and problem solving skills (Soloman & Haaga, 2004).METHODObjectives1. The main objective was to study the Impact of Cognitive Behavior Therapy on Anxiety and Depression in adolescents.2. To study the impact of Cognitive Behavior Therapy on gender difference with regard to Anxiety and Depression in adolescents.Participants380 adolescent students from different schools and Pre University colleges in Bengaluru Rural and Tumakuru, Karnataka, were administered with Beck's Anxiety Inventory and Beck's Depression Inventory-II. Finally 120 adolescents were selected who scored high on Anxiety and Depression. They were randomly assigned to Experimental Group and Control Group with 30 boys and 30 girls in each group. CBT intervention was given to the experimental group and no intervention was given to the control group.MeasuresBeck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI), by Aaron T Beck (1990):The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), created by Aaron T. Beck, and colleagues, is a 21-item multiple-choice self-report inventory that measures the severity of an anxiety in adults and adolescents. Each symptom item has four possible answer choices: Not at All; Mildly (It did not bother me much); Moderately (It was very unpleasant, but I could stand it), and, Severely (I could barely stand it). …",

      "title": "Cases of Senile Insanity, with Remarks",
      "abstract": "Admitting the difficulties that one has in the classification of insanity, it seems to me, at all events, reasonable that we should recognise classes associated with definite physical changes. Symptoms may be ever changing and deceptive. A patient may to all appearances be weak-minded, but on recovery it may be found that such patient's apparent abstraction and mental weakness were merely the result of an overbearing and overpowering sense of misery, so that, in fact he was suffering distinctly from melancholia, and the mental faculties were in abeyance through the assertion of other painful sensations. A severe grief or an intense occupation of any kind may make one forgetful of his surroundings, regardless of the state of the weather, the time of day, the condition of one's general health, and so on; and so it is that in many cases of profound melancholy there is an apparent arrest of function. This by the way. We have to consider the fact that at certain periods of life there are certain special tendencies to an intellectual breakdown. Any serious affection of the brain in early childhood so affects the as yet undeveloped structure that it totters readily to its fall, and, once having suffered a severe shock, it is with difficulty restored. In the period of adolescence other functions of the body are developed, and with them many stirring sensations are aroused, which have a great tendency to upset the highly nervous and unstable neurotic patient. As life progresses some people exhibit marked tendencies to die out through their nervous systems. Certain persons develope phthisis late in life; others develop cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, or other constitutional vices. But the thing that interests me most in this consideration is that there are definite forms of disease seen in patients dying out from exhaustion or wearing out of their nervous tissues. As has so often been said, age is purely relative. A man may be a boy at 70 or an old man at 35. Age, from the physician's side, is a relative advance towards decay and destruction of the most important of the vital tissues and organs. A man may have all his organs slowly degenerating before he has reached middle life, the degeneration being due to some constitutional disease, or to some such condition as atheroma of the vessels. In an asylum one constantly comes across patients who have inherited insanity from their parents, and who have inherited a special form of insanity, and even others who have not inherited any special form, but have inherited the tendency which produced the insanity; thus whereas one person has atheroma of the vessels and dies of apoplexy, another has atheroma of his vessels and dies of aneurism, and another patient has atheroma of his vessels and angina pectoris, so that the offspring of these patients may have not only the atheroma of the artery, but either the apoplexy, the aneurism, or the angina pectoris, according to whether the parents had the one or the other. I have seen many cases in which a parent has suffered from mental disease only when he has become 60 or 70, and the children have gone on very well until they reached a similar age, and then have broken down under similar circumstances in a very similar way. It would not be right always to say that this has no relationship to mental effects and to predispositions. One knows that suicide, for instance, is not only associated with a family disposition to nervous disease, but is in many cases also associated with a dominant idea which has from early days been before the patient's mind—that suicide has been, as it were, the evil genius of the family; and so the fact that a parent has died of nervous breakdown has been reported to a patient, or has been remembered by him, and when he comes to a like age he necessarily thinks more about the fate of his parent, and this alone, in some temperaments, might be a cause of producing insanity. In some families it is very noteworthy that a certain age is looked upon as being critical, and if that age be satisfactorily passed, the individual may live to a considerable age beyond, but immediately before this crucial period many members have begun with ailments and have certainly worried themselves into their graves. But what I would distinctly assert is that in certain families the tendency is to die of some affection of the nervous system in preference to dying by any other system; and it is interesting to note that in some of these cases the tendency is not always transmitted in exactly the same way, but that the offspring of such parents, if they have not been placed in otherwise favourable circumstances, may break down earlier in life; and although I am not in a position to assert positively that such is the case, many instances have inclined me to the belief that the offspring of those parents who have broken down, say at the climacteric or from advanced age, are more liable than other insane patients to break down at special periods, such as at adolescence and the climacteric. When one comes to consider the changes that we mean by old age, I should say that the mark I have used as the test as to atheromatous condition of the arteries is seen by the tortuous temporal arteries, and the rigid and rather high-tension in the radial pulse. Other symptoms, such as capillary congestion about the cheeks, white hair, and a tendency to leanness, have, of course, been considered, as well as the condition of the eye called arcus senilis . All the patients to whom I shall refer have the above characteristics, as well as years over 60. They suffer either from progressive dementia, with or without paralysis, or from melancholia of one form or another. As we shall see presently, they suffered from hypochondriacal symptoms, or in some cases exhibited maniacal excitement with exaltation, and I shall have to refer specially to at least one case in which these symptoms were so markedly like those of general paralysis of the insane that I was constantly asking myself in what the difference consisted between our typical cases of general paralysis of the insane and cases such as the one under consideration. We were obliged to confess that if the patient had been brought before us, and that blindfold we had been told that his age was 35, we should not have hesitated for a moment in saying that his was a typical case of the disease. General paralysis does occur in old men sometimes as well as in young men, but it is not nearly so common, and when we meet with these cases wo are obliged to consider them as a special sub-variety of the disease, or else must look upon them merely as cases of degradation of nerve tissue, having somewhat similar symptoms, to the symptoms seen in general paralysis of the insane. I am rather fond of regarding these cases as not truly those of general paralysis, but as examples of progressive nerve degeneration, and I prefer to look upon symptoms of general paralysis of the insane as symptoms that are produced solely by a steady and progressive degeneration of the highest nerve centres; and under these circumstances I would expect that any disease which produced steady, progressive degeneration of these highest centres would also produce similar symptoms, just as in the lung, whether it be a tubercle, a mass of smoke, or a piece of steel or stone that sets up irritation, inflammation, degeneration, and a cavity, the course and symptoms of the disease are the same.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive processes are crucial for human performance. Basic cognitive processes, such as attention, working memory, and executive functions, show homeostatic (time awake, sleep deprivation) and circadian (time of day) variations. Each of these cognitive processes includes several components, which contribute sequentially to the homeostatic and circadian modulation of performance. Sudden (lapses) and gradual changes in cognitive performance occur with sleep deprivation or with time of day. The time course of human cognitive processes throughout the day is relevant to the programming of different human activities. The lowest level of cognitive performance occurs during nighttime and early in the morning, a better level occurs around noon, and even higher levels occur during afternoon and evening hours. However, this time course can be modulated by conditions such as chronotype, sleep deprivation, sleep disorders or medication that affects the central nervous system.",

      "abstract": "The photic sneeze response is a well-established clinical phenomenon in which patients respond by sneezing in an uncontrolled manner. This paroxysm of sneezing is evoked by a sudden exposure to an intense or bright light source. The pathogenesis of this response is apparently quite complex. Sudden exposure to bright light involves the optic, oculomotor, and trigeminal nerves, the autonomic nervous system and central brainstem functions. Anecdotal reports have suggested the photic sneezing response may occur as an autosomal dominantly inherited condition. However, such a familial pattern is not always present.This article presents a descriptive report of a case in which a patient sought comprehensive eye care and, during the course of the examination, reported a relationship between light and a predictable auditory response. The mechanism for this involuntary auditory response to a bright light may be similar to that involved with photic sneeze response.This patient's history, specific features of the auditory response, and ophthalmic findings as a result of the comprehensive eye examination are reported.The photic sneeze response is not an uncommon phenomenon. A similar mechanism may explain the auditory response to a photic stimulus reported in this article.",

Research findings now suggest that different types of sleep can affect different types of memory It appears that sleep also can influence emotional aspects of our memory Some studies 1 even suggest that certain types of memory can be enhanced during sleep with instrumentation capable of promoting greater slow wave activity.",

Although synesthesia can occur in response to drugs (LSD, mescaline, peyote), sensory deprivation, or, in rare cases, brain damage, research has largely focused on individuals with the heritable trait of developmental synesthesia. Synesthesia has no known association with any disorder or condition, and research suggests a higher occurrence among artists and musicians.

Agitation can arise from any number of sources, including pain, physiological compromise, or anxiety [2].

Despite numerous attempts to explain the causes of emergence agitation/delirium, there is no definitive explanation. Possible causes include pain, preoperative anxiety, type of surgical procedures, personal characteristics of the patient, and type of anesthetics, although no sole factor can explain the etiology of emergence agitation/delirium [4], in large part due to the greatest obstacle to understanding emergence agitation/delirium is the lack of a standardized tool to assess it. The reported prevalence of emergence agitation/delirium varies greatly in the literature, ranging from 10% to 80% [5,6], depending on the definition and criteria of emergence agitation/delirium.

There was no family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions. Ictal EEG demonstrated a typical 3 Hz spike-wave pattern, while there were no abnormalities, either in wakefulness or during sleep. The neurodevelopmental examination was unremarkable and MRI of the brain was normal. The attacks disappeared 3 weeks after initiating sodium valproate, and have not reappeared since then (follow-up 3 years and 3 months); today, at 4 years of age, the patient has normal psycho-motor development.

      "abstract": "Anxiety is the most universal of all human emotions. It is an energy that cannot be observed directly and must therefore be inferred from behaviour. Most people when faced with a new and unfamiliar situation will experience some degree of anxiety. Normal anxiety is proportional to the threat a person is faced with and can provide arousal that is appropriate to the situation. Mild levels of anxiety can be beneficial, acting as a motivating force, which enhances productivity and performance. Severe anxiety can have an inhibiting effect and move a person away from his optimal level of performance towards behaviours which are non-coping and maladaptive (Graves and Thompson1). The manifestations of anxiety are both physical and psychological (see Figure 1.1) and prepare the individual for fight or flight. While under normal circumstances changes in the functioning of the autonomic system heighten a person's capacity to deal with threats, severe anxiety can severely inhibit a person's level of functioning in so much that the ability to perceive accurately and without distortion is narrowed. In panic, the most extreme manifestation of anxiety, there is a total lack of focus and the person may thrash about purposelessly, his attention being unfocused and unchannelled in such a way that his safety may be threatened.",

      "abstract": "Blurry vision after concussion can mean many different things. A loss of acuity in one eye is often due to direct injury to the eye. Intact acuity in each eye, but worse vision with both eyes open is often due to a subtle cranial nerve injury. Subtle 3rd cranial nerve or 4th cranial injuries typically cause vision to be worse looking up or down, whereas 6th nerve injuries are typically worse looking to one side. Visual attention deficit is sometimes described as blurry vision. Migraine auras often cause visual impairment. The chapter suggests modes of treatment for these situations. Paroxysmal changes in vision after concussion should be treated as presumptive migraine, or migraine equivalent even if there is no severe headache. Patients will benefit from best-corrected vision when starting aggressive cognitive rehabilitation even if preexisting visual impairments did not impair them much in everyday life before the concussion.",

The data, past illnesses, prodromal symptoms, and psychosocial information were obtained from the plant medical records, the private physicians, and mainly from direct interviews with the surviving next-of-kin, usually the wife. The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal, and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P enrichment (> or = 100 micrograms SRP/L), suggesting a stimulatory role of nutrients.

In the present day and age sleep disorders irrespective of the reason the growth in the sleep disorders is alarming. Although many people tend to experience sleep disturbances on an occasional basis owing to stressful life situations, alterations in job schedules, traveling, and many other external influences, but when these issues occur regularly and become an impedance in the day-to-day activities, it may be suggestive of a sleeping disorder. A deficiency of a good quality sleep can have overall undesirable consequences on the vitality, temperament, attentiveness, and well-being of an individual. Sleep difficulties are linked to both physical and emotional problems. Sleep problems can both contribute to and exacerbate existing mental problems as well as serve as an important indicator of other mental health conditions. While the various sleep problems may resolve on its own or eventually conclude after a successful course of therapy, in a few resistant cases the treatment normally involves a combination of medical treatments and lifestyle changes.",

The usual way to judge whether or not subjects \"passed\" posthypnotic amnesia is to employ an objective criterion. Spontaneous posthypnotic amnesia seems to occur more often in clinical settings, where clients fail to recall certain aspects of a session, than it does in experimental settings. Laboratory research has led to the development of standardized, reliable measurements of suggested posthypnotic amnesia. The degree of recognition recall in posthypnotic amnesia is usually higher than free recall, it also is in studies of normal memory. Posthypnotic amnesia should not be considered unusual, because other findings in memory research have shown that material can be available in memory storage but cannot be retrieved for recall. Breaching amnesia addresses the question whether subjects who initially respond to posthypnotic amnesia will report more before the reversal cue, when external pressures to recall are placed on them.",

Case report We describe a patient with a longstanding episodic cluster headache who experienced, on two occasions, a period of nocturnal awakenings without pain or autonomic symptoms, lasting one week before the onset of a cluster bout. Awakenings occurred twice/night at the same hours of impending cluster attacks and had no apparent trigger, being unusual for this patient who had no previous sleep disturbances. Neurological examination and brain imaging were normal. Discussion This case documents two new aspects of cluster headache. It suggests that repeated nocturnal awakenings can be a warning sign of an impending cluster period, a finding that may have therapeutic implications, and also that hypothalamic activation may begin several days before trigemino-autonomic symptoms, thus behaving as a true bout generator.",

Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized as those who cannot sleep, those who will not sleep, those with excessive daytime sleepiness, and those with increased movements during sleep. Insomnia, defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that results in daytime impairment, is diagnosed using history findings and treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without sleep hypnotics. Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an urge to move the legs that worsens with rest, is relieved by movement, and often occurs in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome is treated based on the frequency of symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. It is diagnosed using a sleep log or actigraphy, followed by overnight polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test. Narcolepsy is treated with stimulants, such as modafinil; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; or gamma hydroxybutyric acid (sodium oxybate). Patients with snoring and witnessed apneas may have obstructive sleep apnea, which is diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Continuous positive airway pressure is the most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in the patient acting out dreams with possible harmful consequences. It is diagnosed based on history and polysomnography findings, and treated with environmental safety measures and melatonin or clonazepam.",

      "abstract": "The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) includes a constellation of symptoms, most prominently excessive daytime somnolence and unrefreshing sleep, associated with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The periodic respiratory events constituting SDB may be complete cessation of airflow (apneas), reductions in airflow of various degree (hypopneas), increased respiratory \"effort\" events with no increase in airflow (flow limitation events), or a combination of these events occurring at various times during the sleep period. Unrefreshing sleep and excessive daytime somnolence are thought to be because of disruption of the normal sleep architecture from recurrent brief arousals associated with the respiratory events, usually resulting in reduced \"deep\" (slow wave) and rapid eye movement sleep. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation, often severe, usually accompanies the respiratory events and may be a major factor in the cardiovascular morbidity associated with OSAHS. However, this satisfyingly simple and logical construct for OSHAS is likely an oversimplification. The lack of universally accepted criteria for defining a specific disease entity and the lack of certainty about the causal relationship of the various types of respiratory events and associated arousals/desaturations with symptoms and the pathophysiological consequences, limit the understanding of the prevalence, risk factors, and natural history of clinically important SDB.",

      "title": "Fatigue and sleep disturbance following traumatic brain injury: A role for light therapy?",
      "abstract": "Fatigue and sleep disturbances are common and disabling symptoms following traumatic brain injury (TBI). They occur chronically, and impact significantly on the ability of individuals with these injuries to return to pre-injury function, as well as overall quality of life. The aetiology of these symptoms appears to be complex and most likely multifactorial in nature, involving the primary effects of mechanical neuronal injury, but also secondary factors such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive disturbance (particularly in the domain of attention). In the context of unclear aetiology, current understandings of fatigue and sleep disturbances have primarily relied on patient self-report, particularly for fatigue which is inherently a subjective complaint, but also for sleep disturbances. Identification of suitable objective measures for fatigue and sleep or their associated symptoms may assist in further understanding these complaints. Related to the limited understanding of these complaints following TBI, is the lack of well established treatment regimens. In theory, an optimal treatment of fatigue and sleep disturbance following TBI would involve focus on the symptoms themselves as well as their associated factors, such as depression and impaired attention. Recent research in the field of sleep and chronobiology, particularly research investigating the therapeutic applications of light exposure, suggests that light therapy may offer an efficacious modality for treatment of fatigue, sleep disturbance and associated symptoms in the TBI population. \n\nThe aims of the current thesis were to: (1) assess the utility of objective assessment tools in order to aid further understanding of disturbances to sleep-wakefulness and sustained attention (i.e. psychomotor vigilance) performances following TBI; and (2) investigate in a randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of blue light therapy, in the treatment of fatigue and its related symptoms in patients with TBI. This was achieved across three separate studies. \n\nSpecifically, study one investigated the utility of actigraphy as an objective measure of sleep following TBI. The findings of the study revealed significant associations between actigraphic and self-reported (diary) estimates of nocturnal total sleep time (TST) and daily TST in patients with TBI and healthy age- and gender- matched controls. While stronger associations between diary and actigraphy were observed in the control group, the magnitude of these associations did not differ significantly between groups. The study thus provided preliminary support for use of actigraphy as an objective assessment of sleep duration in the TBI population. \n\nIn light of previous research that has demonstrated associations between vigilance/sustained attention and both fatigue and sleep disturbances in patients with TBI, study two compared psychomotor vigilance performance in patients with TBI and healthy age- and gender- matched controls using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). The PVT was selected as a potentially useful objective measure in patients with TBI as it has been commonly used within the sleep science field and is well accepted for its sensitivity to sleep loss, circadian timing, and countermeasures for sleepiness. Consistent with past research, study two demonstrated that patients with TBI showed slower performances and increased attentional lapses relative to healthy controls. Distribution analyses additionally revealed that patients with TBI performed more slowly across the entire performance distribution, consistent with a generalised cognitive slowing. Depression, fatigue and daytime sleepiness were found to have varying impacts on aspects of psychomotor vigilance performance. Previous use of the PVT in TBI groups has been limited and the study highlighted the sensitivity of the PVT to sustained attention deficits in patients with TBI. \n\nTaken together, the findings of study one and two have implications for the ongoing assessment of sleep and performance deficits in patients with TBI, and have potential to provide greater understanding of fatigue and sleep complaints in this population. \n\nFinally, given the lack of efficacious treatments for fatigue and sleep disturbances following TBI, study three examined the efficacy of blue light therapy as a potential treatment of fatigue and its associated symptoms in patients with TBI. Blue light therapy was selected for use given prior research findings which have demonstrated its alerting, circadian phase shifting, and mood enhancing properties. In a sample of patients with TBI who had self-reported fatigue and sleep complaints, study three demonstrated the efficacy of daily, morning exposure (45 minutes) to blue light over a 4 week treatment period in alleviation of self-reported fatigue and daytime sleepiness. This is the first demonstration of efficacy for a non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue and daytime sleepiness in patients with TBI. These findings establish the basis for large-scale randomised controlled trials of light therapy for fatigue in TBI, and have important implications for enhancing rehabilitation participation and long-term quality of life following TBI.",

      "title": "Chronobiology and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "The clinical observations of diurnal variation of mood and early morning awakening in depression have been incorporated into established diagnostic systems, as has the seasonal modifier defining winter depression (seasonal affective disorder, SAD). Many circadian rhythms measured in depressive patients are abnormal: earlier in timing, diminished in amplitude, or of greater variability. Whether these disturbances are of etiological significance for the role of circadian rhythms in mood disorders, or a consequence of altered behavior can only be dissected out with stringent protocols (eg, constant routine or forced desynchrony). These protocols quantify contributions of the circadian pacemaker and a homeostatic sleep process impacting on mood, energy, appetite, and sleep. Future studies will elucidate any allelic mutations in \"circadian clock\" -related or \"sleep\"-related genes in depression. With respect to treatment, antidepressants and mood stabilizers have no consistent effect on circadian rhythmicity. The most rapid antidepressant modality known so far is nonpharmacological: total or partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night. The disadvantage of sleep deprivation, that most patients relapse after recovery sleep, can be prevented by coadministration of lithium, pindolol, serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors, bright light, or a subsequent phase-advance procedure. Phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle alone also has rapid effects on depressed mood, which lasts longer than sleep deprivation. Light is the treatment of choice for SAD and may prove to be useful for nonseasonal depression, alone or as an adjunct to medication. Chronobiological concepts emphasize the important role of zeitgebers to stabilize phase, light being the most important, but dark (and rest) periods, regularity of social schedules and meal times, and use of melatonin or its analogues should also be considered. Advances in chronobiology continue to contribute novel treatments for affective disorders.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Occupational stress was perceived to be a problem only in jobs with high pressure and low pay, such as teaching and social services. Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

It is this fragmentation that is believed to be an important factor affecting impaired daytime wakefulness. Studies have suggested a strong association between sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness (55). Treatment studies also demonstrate a close link between sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness. Reduced frequency of arousals from sleep with resultant reduction in the level of sleepiness is commonly seen in patients who are successfully treated for sleep apnea, whereas those who do not subjectively beneﬁt from treatment show no decrease in arousals or sleepiness, despite improved sleeping oxygenation. It must, however, be stressed that lack of fragmented sleep does not exempt one from feeling sleepy. Partial sleep deprivation may occasionally be seen in patients who are unable to sustain sleep from repeated sleep disruption. This is commonly seen in patients with anxiety predispositions or superimposed insomnia.",

Cerebral ischaemia may result from vaso‐vagal syncope or vago‐vagal syncope, the latter being associated with an abrupt fall in blood pressure. Many events may precipitate syncope and convulsions: rectal examinations, micturition syndrome, tussive syncope, ingestion of food and liquids (i.e. the Banquet Syndrome) are some examples. Sudden death may occur due to stress, the causal mechanisms usually involving the cardiovascular system. Cardiac dysrhythmia is frequently implicated. Stress may incude a broad variety of autonomic responses mediated often through the vagal system resulting in syncope, seizures and fatal collapse.

This paper reviews the frequency and features of this outcome, and its association with relapse. Residual symptoms occur in many depressed patients after acute treatment. They span the typical symptoms of depression, except those characteristic of severe disorders. Other persistent abnormalities include social dysfunction, dysfunctional attitudes, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivity, shortened REM sleep latency, and mood lowering after tryptophan depletion. Associations of some of these with residual symptoms are not clear. There is growing evidence for similar residual symptoms in bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar depression. The most important consequence of residual symptoms is a much-increased risk of relapse, particularly in the first year. Residual symptoms are a strong indication for vigorous and longer than usual continuation of antidepressant treatment in order to prevent relapse. There is good evidence for the use of cognitive therapy as an adjunct.",

      "title": "Ask About Daytime Sleepiness!",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is being recognized increasingly as a significant public health problem.1 Sleep loss or inadequate sleep time is the most common cause of EDS in the general population.1–3 Primary sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, and periodic leg movements in sleep are prevalent, particularly among older persons, and can contribute to EDS.4 Other medical conditions, such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, psychiatric illness, chronic pain syndromes, and several neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders, can disrupt sleep and lead to EDS. Moreover, widely prescribed medications, including diuretics, antihypertensives, sympathomimetic agents, corticosteroids, sedative-hypnotics, analgesics, and certain antidepressants, can cause EDS by interfering with sleep continuity and/or by having a direct sedating effect in the daytime. The adverse consequences of EDS are numerous. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hypersomnolence is associated with neurocognitive deficits, including decrements in attention, vigilance, and memory.5 Evidence also supports a strong association between EDS and an increased risk for domestic, work-related, and motor vehicle accidents.6,7 Impaired general health status and limitations in activities of daily living are yet other common sequela.8,9 Furthermore, landmark epidemiologic studies such as the Honolulu Heart Program and the Cardiovascular Health Study have associated EDS with a higher prevalence of heart disease, congestive heart failure, and dementia.10,11 The important report by Newman et al. in this issue extends our understanding by documenting an independent association between EDS and incident cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. In addition, the gender differences noted in the current investigation are consistent with previous reports of the high prevalence of sleep complaints among women and with the association of sleep disordered breathing with increased mortality in women in the nursing home setting.12 The causal pathway between EDS and morbid events, including cognitive dysfunction, accidents, and impaired quality of life, is readily envisioned. The occurrence of brief “microsleeps” and even prolonged sleep episodes in the daytime can decrease vigilance and lead to compromised performance at home, work, or during safety-sensitive tasks such as driving. Moreover, the inability to maintain wakefulness during the day can have a deleterious influence on social functioning and can lower one's sense of well-being. See also p 115 Yet unresolved, however, are the mechanisms through which EDS relates independently to cardiovascular end-points and mortality. At least three different causal pathways are proposed. First, it is possible that the increased morbidity and mortality associated with EDS are a function of underlying sleep disorders that cause EDS. It is well established that sleep-disordered breathing is prevalent in the general population. In middle-aged adults the prevalence is estimated to be at least 2 to 4%, and in certain subgroups it may be much higher.13 Several investigators have shown that the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing increases with age, with estimates that perhaps 30 to 40% of older individuals may have this chronic disorder.12,14,15 Recent work indicates that the frequency of disordered breathing events, severity of associated oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and degree of sleep fragmentation contribute independently to the occurrence of EDS.16 Clinic- and population-based studies have also shown an association between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension and prevalent cardiovascular disease independent of the effects of age, gender, smoking, and obesity.17 Therefore, in this setting, morbidity and mortality caused by EDS reflect underlying primary sleep disorders that are, in turn, associated with cardiovascular end-points and mortality. Second, many of the chronic medical conditions that are prevalent in older people, such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, emphysema, and depression, can be related indirectly to EDS through their interference with nocturnal sleep quality. It is now appreciated that congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease can predispose to sleep-disordered breathing, which can potentially exacerbate the predisposing condition.18,19 As with the occurrence of a primary sleep disorder, EDS in this setting is merely a surrogate marker for these chronic ailments, Third, it is possible that EDS has a direct role, through an undefined mechanism, in increasing morbidity and mortality, independent of either underlying primary sleep disorders or other recognized chronic medical illnesses. Experimental sleep deprivation studies in normal volunteers demonstrate a heightened sympathetic drive with elevated levels of circulating catecholamines.20,21 Extensive data indicate that sleep deprivation is also linked with significant alterations in the neuroendocrine axis characterized by an increase in serum Cortisol levels and a slower rate of daylong decline following the early morning circadian elevation.21,22 In the context of multiple chronic illnesses that are common among older adults, such neurohumoral alterations can increase further the probability of precipitating adverse events and require further delineation. Daytime sleepiness is assessed either objectively or subjectively. Objective methods include the multiple sleep latency test and the maintenance of wakefulness test.21–24 The former is used commonly in the clinical setting and many consider it to be the gold standard for the assessment of sleepiness. Subjective methods utilize self-report to identify sleep propensity and include validated questionnaires such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale.24,25 Since patients often underestimate their own degree of sleepiness, validated questionnaires addressing the likelihood of feeling drowsy or falling asleep during specific activities are more effective than general inquiries regarding the presence or absence of EDS. Moreover, questions about specific sleep-wake habits and input from family members, bed partners, and/or caregivers can provide a more accurate estimate of the degree and functional impact of EDS. In their study, Newman et al. use a general inquiry for identifying sleep-related problems and daytime sleepiness, raising the possibility of some degree of misclassification in their exposure variable (i.e., daytime sleepiness). In another recent prospective population-based study, the presence of self-reported snoring and general EDS was associated with total death rate and cardiovascular mortality. This effect was age-dependent and persisted after adjustment for body mass index, history of hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes. Interestingly, isolated snoring or hypersomnolence were not associated with increased mortality.26 In each of these investigations, the use of validated questionnaires to assess EDS and information regarding the presence of documented sleep-related disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing) would have been invaluable in examining the true independent effect of EDS on cardiovascular endpoints and all-cause mortality and the pathogenesis of this relationship. Newer initiatives sponsored by the National Institutes of Health have addressed some of the limitations of these important initial studies. The Sleep Heart Health Study, a multi-site longitudinal cohort study, is investigating the links between sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular endpoints.27 Until such prospective data clarify these relationships, we believe that currently available evidence supports the simple, noninvasive measure of asking our patients about their sleep and, in particular, about the presence of inappropriate hypersomnolence. All healthcare professionals have an important role in recognizing EDS as a sign and symptom that is amenable to effective treatment, The time-honored notion that somnolence is an expected (and accepted) concomitant of normal aging requires reevaluation: EDS that intrudes on daytime function not only compromises the quality of life but may also threaten lifespan. Despite the high prevalence of primary and secondary sleep problems among older persons, health professionals have often not prioritized the sleep history essential to recognition of potentially treatable conditions, and an important opportunity for health promotion is lost.28 We can and must do better.",

      "title": "The influence of sleep on fear extinction in trauma-related disorders",
      "abstract": "In Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), fear and anxiety become dysregulated following psychologically traumatic events. Regulation of fear and anxiety involves both high-level cognitive processes such as cognitive reattribution and low-level, partially automatic memory processes such as fear extinction, safety learning and habituation. These latter processes are believed to be deficient in PTSD. While insomnia and nightmares are characteristic symptoms of existing PTSD, abundant recent evidence suggests that sleep disruption prior to and acute sleep disturbance following traumatic events both can predispose an individual to develop PTSD. Sleep promotes consolidation in multiple memory systems and is believed to also do so for low-level emotion-regulatory memory processes. Consequently sleep disruption may contribute to the etiology of PTSD by interfering with consolidation in low-level emotion-regulatory memory systems. During the first weeks following a traumatic event, when in the course of everyday life resilient individuals begin to acquire and consolidate these low-level emotion-regulatory memories, those who will develop PTSD symptoms may fail to do so. This deficit may, in part, result from alterations of sleep that interfere with their consolidation, such as REM fragmentation, that have also been found to presage later PTSD symptoms. Here, sleep disruption in PTSD as well as fear extinction, safety learning and habituation and their known alterations in PTSD are first briefly reviewed. Then neural processes that occur during the early post-trauma period that might impede low-level emotion regulatory processes through alterations of sleep quality and physiology will be considered. Lastly, recent neuroimaging evidence from a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in patient groups and their controls will be considered along with one possible neural process that may contribute to a vulnerability to PTSD following trauma.",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drugs. Risk of recurrent seizures should guide their use. In adults, key risk factors for recurrence are two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography, abnormal brain imaging, nocturnal seizures, or an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures. In children, key risk factors are abnormal electroencephalography results, an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures, severe head trauma, and cerebral palsy. The risk of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs is considerable and includes potential cognitive and behavioral effects. In the absence of risk factors, and because many patients do not experience recurrence of a seizure, physicians should consider delaying use of antiepileptic drugs until a second seizure occurs. Delaying therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year remission rates. Treatment should begin with monotherapy. The appropriate choice of medication varies depending on seizure type. Routine monitoring of drug levels is not correlated with reduction in adverse effects or improvement in effectiveness and is not recommended. When patients have been seizure free for two to five years, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs may be considered. For patients with seizures that are not controlled with these agents, alternative treatments include surgical resection of the seizure focus, ketogenic diets, vagus nerve stimulators, and implantable brain neurostimulators. Patients who have had a recent seizure within the past three months or whose seizures are poorly controlled should refrain from driving and certain high-risk physical activities. Patients planning for pregnancy should know that antiepileptic drugs are possibly teratogenic.",

      "abstract": "A seizure is the manifestation of symptoms or signs produced by excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. It usually presents as brief, self-limited episodes of involuntary movements that can affect a part or the entire body and that are sometimes accompanied by loss of consciousness and sphincter control. Epilepsy may be considered after a single unprovoked seizure in a patient with a high risk of recurrence. Paroxysmal non-epileptic disorders are defined as episodes of sudden onset and short duration that imitate an epileptic seizure, caused by a brain dysfunction of diverse origin that, unlike epilepsy, is not due to excessive neuronal discharge. Its incidence is much higher than epilepsy and it can appear at any age. It is important for diagnosis to analyze the triggering factors, the details of each episode, physical examination and only proceed to basic complementary tests such as video-electroencephalogram in case of doubt or for diagnostic confirmation. There is a tendency to overdiagnose epilepsy and excessive use of anticonvulsant drugs. Those that can most frequently be confused are syncope, \"daydreams\" and pseudoseizures.",

      "abstract": "Les exigences operationnelles du metier de pilote sont susceptibles d'engendrer de la somnolence et des niveaux de charge mentale inadequats (i.e., trop faible ou trop eleve) au cours des vols. Les dettes de sommeil et les perturbations circadiennes liees a divers facteurs (e.g., longues periodes de services, horaires de travail irregulier, etc.) demandent aux pilotes de repousser sans cesse leurs limites biologiques. Par ailleurs, la charge de travail mental des pilotes presente de fortes variations au cours d'un vol : elevee au cours des phases critiques (i.e., decollage et atterrissage), elle devient tres reduite pendant les phases de croisiere. Lorsque la charge mentale devient trop elevee ou, a l'inverse, trop faible, les performances se degradent et des erreurs de pilotage peuvent apparaitre. La mise en oeuvre de methodes de detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale en temps quasi reel est un defi majeur pour le suivi et le controle de l'activite de pilotage. L'objectif de la these est de determiner si la voix humaine peut permettre de detecter d'une part, l'etat de somnolence et d'autre part, le niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Dans une premiere etude, la voix de participants a ete enregistree lors d'une tâche de lecture avant et apres une nuit de privation totale de sommeil (PTS). Les variations de l'etat de somnolence consecutives a la PTS ont ete evaluees au moyen de mesures auto-evaluatives et electrophysiologiques (ElectroEncephaloGraphie [EEG] et Potentiels Evoques [PEs]). Les resultats ont montre une variation significative apres la PTS de plusieurs parametres acoustiques lies : (a) a l'amplitude des impulsions glottiques (frequence de modulation d'amplitude), (b) a la forme du signal acoustique (longueur euclidienne du signal et ses caracteristiques associees) et (c) au spectre du signal des voyelles (rapport harmonique sur bruit, frequence du second formant, coefficient d'asymetrie, centre de gravite spectral, differences d'energie, pente spectrale et coefficients cepstraux a echelle Mel). La plupart des caracteristiques spectrales ont montre une sensibilite differente a la privation de sommeil en fonction du type de voyelles. Des correlations significatives ont ete mises en evidence entre plusieurs parametres acoustiques et plusieurs indicateurs objectifs (EEG et PEs) de l'etat de somnolence. Dans une seconde etude, le signal vocal a ete enregistre durant une tâche de rappel de listes de mots. La difficulte de la tâche etait manipulee en faisant varier le nombre de mots dans chaque liste (i.e., entre un et sept, correspondant a sept conditions de charge mentale). Le diametre pupillaire - qui est un indicateur objectif pertinent du niveau de charge mentale - a ete mesure simultanement avec l'enregistrement de la voix afin d'attester de la variation du niveau de charge mentale durant la tâche experimentale. Les resultats ont montre que des parametres acoustiques classiques (frequence fondamentale et son ecart type, shimmer, nombre de periodes et rapport harmonique sur bruit) et originaux (frequence de modulation d'amplitude et variations a court-terme de la longueur euclidienne du signal) ont ete particulierement sensibles aux variations de la charge mentale. Les variations de ces parametres acoustiques etaient correlees a celles du diametre pupillaire. L'ensemble des resultats suggere que les parametres acoustiques de la voix humaine identifies lors des experimentations pourraient representer des indicateurs pertinents pour la detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Les resultats ouvrent de nombreuses perspectives de recherche et d'applications dans le domaine de la securite des transports, notamment dans le secteur aeronautique.",

      "title": "Cardiorespiratory adaptation during sleep in infants and children",
      "abstract": "Abstract The cardiorespiratory control system undergoes functional maturation after birth. Until this process is completed, the cardiorespiratory system is unstable, placing infants at risk for cardiorespiratory disturbances, especially during sleep. The profound influence of states of alertness on respiratory and cardiac control has been the focus of intense scrutiny during the last decade. The effects of rapid‐eye movement (REM) sleep on various mechanisms involved in cardiorespiratory control are of particular significance during the postnatal period since newborns spend much of their time in this sleep state. In fullterm newborns, REM sleep occupies more than 50% of total sleep time, and this percentage is even greater in preterm newborns. From term to six months of age, the proportion of REM sleep decreases. 2 Since respiratory and cardiac disturbances are known to occur selectively during REM sleep, the predominance of REM sleep may be a risk factor for abnormal sleep‐related events during early infancy. 3 Awareness of these developmental changes in sleep patterns is important for clinicians dealing with problems such as apparent life‐threatening events (ALTE), sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and/or cardiorespiratory responses to respiratory disorders. Our current understanding of respiratory and cardiac control rests mainly on studies conducted during the first months of life. There is a paucity of data on late infancy and early childhood. The present paper will review available data on how sleep affects 1) ventilatory mechanics, in particular of the upper airways and the chest wall; ventilation and apnea; gas exchange; chemoreceptor function; and arousal responses; 2) changes in heart rate and heart rate variability, and the occurrence and mechanisms of bradycardia. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

      "abstract": "The commonality of cognitive impairment and depression is discussed. Cognitive symptoms are the main symptoms of depressive disorder and, most often, it is cognitive impairment that reduces the performance and quality of life of depressed patients. The most common cognitive disorders in depressed patients are: attention deficit (both visual and auditory), decrease in the level of short-term and operative memory, difficulties in processing information of any modality, a decrease in the speed of information processing, as well as difficulties in building an activity program and monitoring her execution. A cognitive symptom that requires further discussion is the so-called cognitive distortion – a shift in focus from positive to negative stimuli, as well as incorrect reactions to negative feedback and decision making. A depressive episode develops against the background of dysmetabolic and dysfunctional cerebral changes in the amygdala, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, orbitofrontal and mediobasal frontal cortex. Cognitive impairment in patients who have had depression persists after recovery from depression; according to the figurative expression adopted in the scientific community of specialists studying cognitive impairment in depression, each depressive episode forms permanent “cognitive scars”. Presumably, cognitive dysfunction may be one of the risk factors for the development of a depressive disorder; depression, in turn, is a risk factor for the development of dementia, including in Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease: studies have shown that the transformation of severe cognitive impairment associated with depression into dementia in elderly patients can reach 70% in five years. The undoubted commonality of depression and cognitive dysfunction is emphasized by the frequency of depression in patients with cognitive impairment.",

They also test the brain's basic functions by checking the size of the pupils and their response to light, assessing reactions to sensations such as heat and stab of the needle, and testing the ability to move their arms or legs. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is required to evaluate possible brain injury. Traumatic brain injury occurs when an external mechanical force causes brain dysfunction. Brain trauma is usually the result of a violent hit to the head. An object that pierces the skull, such as a bullet, can also cause brain trauma. Mild trauma can be caused by temporary brain cell dysfunction. More serious brain trauma can lead to bruising, torn tissue, bleeding and other physical injuries to the brain, which can result in long-term complications or even death. Head injuries are the cause of disability and death of people under the age of 50, more than any other type of neurological impairment. Nearly half of people with severe head injuries die. The brain can be damaged even when the skull is not pierced.",

The term \"epilepsy\" is reserved for the latter group. Some of the factors responsible for the so-called acute convulsions are also responsible for certain of the chronic recurring convulsive disorders, but only by virtue of the structural changes in the brain that may result from the action of these etiologic factors. Table I attempts to summarize these etiologic agents. In the left hand column are listed the more important factors that may stimulate convulsions in children. Those marked by an arrow identify the factors that may, in addition, produce cerebral structural changes which then may serve as the causes for the recurring convulsions, or epileptic state. Some of these etiologies need only be mentioned in passing; others require more comment. Birth Trauma: It is not uncommon to observe newborn infants, usually following prolonged or difficult deliveries, who develop convulsions during the 1st few days of life, which usually are generalized, but may also be focal in nature. Sometimes, the delivery in these cases may have been considered by the attending obstetrician as entirely within normal limits. Whether treated with sedatives or untreated, these spells usually cease after some days never to recur. In the absence of other causes, it must be assumed that these convulsions are the result of a \"cerebral insult\" the nature of which is often not entirely clear and which leads to no significant cerebral pathology.",

      "abstract": "Seizure is one of the most common neurologic conditions in children, occurring most often in the first year of life. Identification of provoking factors, such as fever, illness, head trauma, electrolyte disturbance, or central nervous system infection, is important for determining prognosis and likelihood of recurrence. In patients presenting with a suspected first seizure, a history should be taken and a neurologic examination performed to determine whether the event was a seizure. If seizure is confirmed, it should be determined whether it was a first seizure and was provoked or unprovoked. The final step is to determine the cause. For children who present with simple febrile seizures, no additional evaluation typically is needed. An electroencephalogram performed during wakefulness and sleep is recommended for children with a first unprovoked seizure. For children with new-onset seizures, particularly focal seizures or status epilepticus, neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging study is recommended. Most children will have only a single seizure, whereas a small number will develop epilepsy. Risk factors for epilepsy development include a history of febrile seizures, status epilepticus, a family history of epilepsy, developmental delay, and abnormal neurologic examination results.",

      "title": "Sleep, Pain, and Breathing",
      "abstract": "Sleep and pain have a difficult, multidimensional relationship. Pain disturbs sleep.1–4 Disturbed sleep aggravates pain.5–8 Treatment of sleep disorders can reduce pain.9 Relieving pain can improve sleep although, as shown by Correa and colleagues10 in this issue of Anesthesia & Analgesia, where opioids are involved this is not uniformly the case. Sleep is a vulnerable state for breathing. Ventilatory drive is reduced because of loss of the stimulatory effects of wakefulness, accompanied by reduction in hypercapnic and hypoxic responsiveness. Sleep depresses muscle activation, reflex gain, and arousal responses. These changes are more prominent in rapid eye movement than non-rapid eye movement sleep. Upper airway obstruction and/or hypoventilation occur in predisposed subjects.11 This makes sleep of enormous relevance to anesthesiologists, as these state-related physiological changes are also present during anesthesia. Knowledge of breathing behavior during sleep is helpful in predicting likely behavior under drug-induced sedation. Furthermore, it is important to appreciate the potential for sleep to potentiate the effects on breathing of drugs that depress ventilatory drive.12 It is only now that these relationships are becoming widely appreciated. In a 1997 consensus statement, the American Academy of Pain Medicine and American Pain Society took it upon themselves to announce that “withholding the appropriate use of opioids from a patient who is experiencing pain on the basis of respiratory concerns is unwarranted.”13 They did so because they contended “it is now accepted by practitioners of the specialty of pain medicine that respiratory depression induced by opioids tends to be a short-lived phenomenon, generally only occurs in the opioid-naive patient and is antagonized by pain.” Predictably, the number of opioid prescriptions written exploded in the years that followed. Sadly, so did the number of opioid-related deaths. The compounding effects of sleep on the ventilatory depressant effects of opioids were not considered at the time of the statement. This appears to have been a fatal flaw in the guidance.12 The review of Correa et al.10 helps make this clear. As they point out, adequate breathing during wakefulness does not provide any assurance that it will be adequate during sleep. This wake-sleep dichotomy in breathing behavior is self-evident in the case of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). While more subtle, it is also evident with sleep hypoventilation and central sleep apnea, the particular focus of the article by Correa et al..10 The stimulatory effect of wakefulness on ventilation and muscle activation acts both to ensure a patent upper airway and to augment ventilatory drive and dampen oscillations in it. It has long been understood that the breathing periodicity (Cheyne-Stokes ventilation) associated with heart failure is more prominent during sleep than wakefulness. So, it appears, is breathing periodicity from other causes including those associated with neurologic disease, high altitude, and opioid use.14–17 Opioids have complex effects on breathing that are particularly prominent (and may only be clinically evident) during sleep. They reduce upper airway muscle activation, predisposing to snoring and upper airway obstruction (i.e., OSA).18 They depress hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory drive, particularly in opioid-naive subjects, leading to hypoventilation.19 With chronic opioid use, breathing periodicity becomes evident, particularly if doses are high.16,17 This breathing periodicity can take the form of regular waxing and waning of ventilatory drive or more ataxic breathing patterns with irregularly placed central apneas and hypopneas. While common among chronic opioid users, the mechanism of this periodicity is not well understood. Teichtahl et al.20 present some evidence to suggest that the mechanism may relate to chronic opioid use changing the balance between hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory drive. With chronic opioid use, hypoxic ventilatory drive may recover, or even be augmented, while the opioids still depress hypercapnic ventilatory drive. If so, this would help explain recurrent periods of under-breathing terminated by augmentation of ventilation once stimulated by sufficient hypoxemia. The review of Correa et al.10 is a timely reminder that the relationships among sleep, anesthesia, and breathing go well beyond consideration of OSA and its perioperative implications. Awareness of sleep-related breathing disorders and their physiologic basis helps inform anesthesiology practice. The presence of such disorders indicates increased vulnerability to breathing disturbances when under the influence of opioids and sedative drugs. Conversely, observation of these disturbances in patients not previously known to have a sleep-related breathing disorder should alert anesthesiologists in their role as perioperative physicians to that possibility.

The causes of SB range from psychosocial factors to an excessive sleep arousal response. Some studies showed that SB episodes during sleep are under the influences of transient activity of the brainstem arousal. Nocturnal groaning (NG) is a parasomnia characterized by an expiratory monotonous vocalization occurring during sleep, especially in REM sleep and during the second half of the night. The pathogenesis of NG remains still unclear and many hypotheses arose, ranging from the persistence of a vestigial ventilatory pattern rather than an expiratory upper airways' obstruction. Sleep microstructure fluctuation might modulate the NG, since the end of the NG episode usually is synchronized with a cortical arousal and an autonomic activation. Further studies should clarify the pathophysiology of SB and NG, especially when the two phenomena are associated.",

      "title": "Sleep and Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Sleep problems and fatigue are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The etiology of these disturbances is multifactorial. Sleep disturbance and fatigue after TBI can be a result of the trauma itself or can be secondary to medical problems, pain, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and/or side effects of medications. Because sleep disturbance is common in the general population, the clinician needs to differentiate between premorbid sleep problems and those that are temporally related to TBI. The complex relationship between sleep and TBI can be understood as a series of mutually independent processes. First, acute brain injury can lead to disrupted levels of consciousness and a disrupted sleep process. A second and distinct type of sleep disruption often develops in the chronic phase of recovery; during this phase, severity of injury is often another factor that influences the type and nature of sleep problems experienced by patients. Finally, subjective and objective measures of sleep disturbance may be discordant, in that subjective complaints may occur without objective evidence, and vice versa (Orff et al. 2009). The relationship between sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders is also complex. The neural mechanisms that mediate sleep also have a role in the regulation and stabilization of mood. Dysfunction of these neural circuits after TBI can, therefore, cause both mood and sleep problems. In addition, psychotropics can exacerbate sleep problems, and sleep disturbances can precipitate psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety and dysphoria. Fatigue is a nonspecific and highly subjective symptom that is often reported in patients with TBI. It is described as a feeling of exhaustion, tiredness, or weakness. In many ways, sleep disturbances after TBI are better defined and understood than symptoms of fatigue. Therefore, in this chapter, we first discuss the normal sleep cycle, and then the prevalence, pathophysiology, and types of posttraumatic sleep dis-orders, followed by the evaluation and treatment of these sleep dis-turbances. We then focus on fatigue after TBI. Although sleep disturbances and fatigue overlap, we treat them as separate entities, for clarity. We briefly review the literature and make practical suggestions for the management of sleep and fatigue following TBI. A more detailed description of TBI sleep disturbances can be found in the chapter \"Fatigue and Sleep Problems\" in the Textbook of Traumatic Brain Injury (Rao et al. 2005).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Positioning is an important aspect of any surgical procedure. Anesthetized patients cannot reliably express discomfort; thus, the burden of ensuring safe positioning falls on the provider. Assigning roles to staff is important to efficiently and smoothly achieve proper positioning for any case. Potential harm that may befall a patient as a result of poor positioning includes but is not limited to pressure injuries, peripheral nerve injuries, and complications related to unfavorable hemodynamics. The American Society of Anesthesiologists Closed Claims Project identifies perioperative nerve injury as the second most common injury (16%). Nerve injuries may be a result of stretching, compression, ischemia, or metabolic derangements. General anesthesia has been shown not to be a risk factor for peripheral nerve injury as compared to cases under regional anesthesia and/or varying levels of sedation. Risk factors that contribute to nerve injuries include advanced age, history of peripheral neuropathy, and diabetes. Eye injuries (&amp;lt;0.1% of all anesthetics) range from mild discomfort to permanent vision loss. For instance, the prone position risks excessive pressure placed on the eyes. If that pressure exceeds arterial pressure, a patient may experience retinal ischemia. If the eyes are left open, corneal drying can occur in 10 minutes. Corneal abrasions, the most common eye injury, are usually secondary to foreign objects, such as masks and drapes, causing direct trauma. This chapter discusses the different positions seen in surgery and special considerations for each one.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Allergic rhinitis is classically characterized by sneezing, pruritus, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. These symptoms can lead to impaired nocturnal sleep, and this impairment results in daytime fatigue and somnolence, reducing both learning and work efficiency and decreasing quality of life. STUDY DESIGN In addition, the mediators of AR, including histamine, leukotrienes, cytokines, and prostaglandins, may play a role in sleep regulation and, thus, may be directly involved in this impairment independent of nasal obstruction. Recumbency and/or diurnal variation augments turbinate swelling, causing nasal blockage during nocturnal sleep. Medications directed toward reversal of nasal congestion often concomitantly work through suppression of inflammatory mediators and constitute the primary therapy for sleep disturbance associated with allergic rhinitis. Some pharmaceutical interventions that reduce nasal congestion have adverse effects on sleep. Decongestants effectively reduce nasal congestion but frequently produce stimulatory effects and even insomnia. Antihistamines reduce sneezing and pruritus, but are less effective in relieving congestion. Earlier, “first‐generation” antihistamines are associated with significant sedation. They also have anticholinergic properties, which can cause dry mouth and make mouth breathing even more uncomfortable in the allergic individual with nasal obstruction. The absence of anticholinergic properties in second‐generation, largely nonsedating antihistamines limits their efficacy in rhinorrhea. Azelastine, a topical antihistamine, significantly reduces rhinorrhea and congestion and improves subjective sleep quality, but is also associated with increased sedation. Intranasal corticosteroids and oral leukotriene receptor antagonists effectively reduce rhinorrhea, congestion, and inflammatory mediators. CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of these medications at improving subjective sleep quality has been established through multiple randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trials.",

      "title": "Imaging the brain : neuronal correlates of cognitive impairment in children with frontal lobe epilepsy",
      "abstract": "called cryptogenic epilepsy) is used for defining syndromes for which no etiology has been identified. 4 frontal lobe epilepsy Frontal lobe epilepsy (FLe), that is localization-related epilepsy with a primary seizure focus anywhere within the frontal lobe, represents the second most common form of localization-related epilepsies, after temporal lobe epilepsy.While the exact incidence of FLe is unknown, it is estimated that 20 to 30 percent of patients with localization-related epilepsy has an epileptogenic focus in the frontal lobe. 5,6 as the frontal lobe is the largest of all brain lobes, a wide variety of different types of seizures can occur from a frontal lobe origin, depending on the localization of the seizure focus and subsequent spread of seizure activity. 7n general, frontal lobe seizures are brief (varying from seconds to two minutes), stereotypic (every seizure is similar in an individual patient), often nocturnal, and frequent.Clinical features often include an abrupt onset consecutive to a precedent aura, impaired consciousness, motor signs such as tonic posturing, myoclonia and automatisms (for example kicking or bicycling of the legs), Chapter 1 figure 1. eeg of a generalized seizure in a 9-year-old child.The epileptic activity is bilateral and widespread in both hemispheres (i.e., all electrodes demonstrate rhythmic epileptic spike and wave complexes). Aims and outline of this thesisWithin this thesis, we first aimed to gain insight in cognitive functioning and behaviour in children with FLe.Therefore, in chapter 2, we reviewed the literature to investigate the main comorbid disorders, i.e., cognitive impairment and behavioural disturbances in children with FLe.Subsequently, we investigated the cognitive and behavioural outcomes in 71 children with FLe of unknown cause seen at the epilepsy Centre Kempenhaeghe and investigated potential risk factors for cognitive impairment and behavioural disturbances.Chapter 1 figure 3. eeg of a frontal seizure in an 11-year-old child with a rapidity of seizure spread that suggests a bifrontal onset (i.e., the epileptic spike and wave complexes start and have their highest amplitude within both frontal lobes (all F-electrodes)).Chapter 1 healthy age-matched controls, to investigate functional and microstructural abnormalities associated with FLe and cognitive impairment.to be able to investigate differences between cognitively unimpaired and impaired patients, all enrolled cases and controls underwent full neuropsychological assessment.The topological organization of the cerebral network was studied in chapter 7.In this chapter, we compared graph theoretical measures derived from functional brain networks of children with FLe with those of the healthy controls and related findings to cognitive performance.Finally, chapter 8 is a general discussion of the results and conclusions from the constituting chapters.

      "title": "Higher Brain Areas Involved in Respiratory Control",
      "abstract": "Neural mechanisms underlying cyclic respiratory activity for metabolic needs include brainstem and spinal cord networks which provide synchronous activation and suppression of breathing musculature. Control mechanisms which use respiratory musculature involve structures from widely spread regions of the brain, and include cortical areas as indicated by recording, stimulation, lesion, and perceptual evidence. The conscious perception of breathing efforts, and the sensation of air hunger, or dyspnea, likely involves integrative sensory cortical elements, with the addition of affective limbic areas, possibly in the amygdala, for mediating distress of the perception. A number of cortical areas could mediate affective recognition and influence respiratory efforts. Major midbrain and medullary structures which have been implicated in aspects of respiratory control receive substantial projections from rostral limbic brain areas; these projections are often reciprocal. Limbic structures may especially contribute to the appearance of momentary breathing events such as apnea or sighs, or momentary sighs associated with fright.",

      "title": "1171 Hypersomnia Secondary to Long Covid",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Recognition of Long Covid is increasing. In a recent meta-analysis in youth with Long Covid, the most prevalent clinical symptoms were mood (16.50%), fatigue (9.66%), and sleep disorders (8.42%). However, there is a paucity of data in the management of these symptoms. Report of case(s) We present a case of severe hypersomnolence after a mild Covid-19 infection in a 13 year-old female with no significant history, an acceptable age-appropriate sleep-wake schedule without nighttime awakenings or sleepiness prior to infection. Post-infection, she developed a one year history of sleep onset and maintenance insomnia, significant circadian delays, sleep inertia, brain fog and headaches. She was referred to sleep medicine and responded to treatment for a circadian rhythm disorder with sleep-wake restructuring, melatonin, and strict sleep hygiene. Sleep fragmentation, unrefreshing sleep, and hypersomnolence persisted; ESS=15/24. Sleep duration was often ≥12 hours in a 24 hour period. The patient could not wake easily, and often missed school or left early for sleepiness and headaches. A trial of gabapentin 200mg at bedtime failed. Sleep diagnostics were performed. Polysomnography showed no sleep disruptors, 8 hours of sleep, and some delayed slow wave sleep periods. Mean sleep latency testing (MSLT) showed MSL of 15.4min; 1 SOREM (nap #1). With a working diagnosis of hypersomnia due to medical condition vs. idiopathic hypersomnia, methylphenidate up to 36mg ER was trialed with some improvement. A recent adult case with Long Covid and ADHD-like syndrome also responded to stimulant use, though no guidelines are established for Long Covid. Oxybate was later added up to 2g once nightly which helped resolve sleep inertia, improve sleep quality and reduce sleepiness(ESS=4/24). She was able to return to school full time and reached normal functioning. Conclusion While the pathophysiology of Long Covid is still under investigation, symptom management of sleepiness can impact functioning. This case demonstrates a successful treatment of a patient with Long Covid and hypersomnolence with resolution of excessive sleepiness, morning inertia, and sleep fragmentation with a treatment approach similar to that of idiopathic hypersomnia, using an oxybate along with daytime stimulant use.

      "abstract": "Symptoms of peripartum depression are the same as those of major depressive disorder, and include depressed mood, insomnia, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, guilt, worthlessness, fatigue, impaired concentration, change in appetite, and change in motor activity. Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

Emergency signs in headaches are: violent headache (hemorrhage meninges), convulsions in epilepsy, fever, neck pain (meningitis), neurological disorders (vertigo, paresis, diplopia). Migraine begins with aura (20%), with reversible phenomena within 60 min, with small scotoma that expands, associated with homonymous, lateral hemianopsia (or blindness), scotoma bordered by zigzag bright spots (sensory aura may present progressively transient hemiplegia, auditory hallucinations). All signs regress without sequelae. Treatment in primary headache requires elimination of risk factors: stress, fatigue, food chocolate, coffee, wine, cheese, aspartane, prophylactic treatment as needed with propanolol methysergyl, calcium channel blockers, amitriptyline. Treatment of the acute migraine episode with acetaminophen; in aura, ergotamine tartrate, sumatriptan, topiramate, metoclopramide are indicated. Secondary headache recognizes multiple causes: ocular, cerebral, postneoplazic, posttraumatic, postinfectios, in which the treatment is that of the causal condition.",

The mental signs and symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy most often include slowed cognition, apathy, anxiety, and depressive mood. Problems with attention, cognitive flexibility, and verbal fluency also are common. Sleep disturbances are common. The most characteristic finding in progressive supranuclear palsy is difficulty with voluntary (not involuntary) eye movement in the vertical direction. First voluntary downward gaze is affected. Later, upward gaze and looking side to side are impaired. Difficulty with articulation of speech and with swallowing usually develop in patients over time.

Το ΣΑΑΥ αποτελεί μια δυνητικά απειλητική για τη ζωή διαταραχή της αναπνοής στον ύπνο που χαρακτηρίζεται από επαναλαμβανόμενα επεισόδια πλήρους (άπνοια) ή μερικής (υπόπνοια) απόφραξης των ανώτερων αναπνευστικών αεραγωγών. Κύρια συμπτώματα των ασθενών με ΣΑΑΥ αναφέρονται το έντονο ροχαλητό, τα επεισόδια της άπνοιας στον ύπνο, η ημερήσια υπνηλία και η διαταραχή της συγκέντρωσης, μνήμης και προσοχής. Στις σοβαρές αρνητικές επιπτώσεις του συνδρόμου περιλαμβάνονται η δυσρύθμιστη αρτηριακή υπέρταση, η ανεξήγητη πνευμονική καρδιά, η πρωινή καταβολή, το καταθλιπτικό συναίσθημα και ο αιφνίδιος θάνατος στον ύπνο. Η ευρέως διαδεδομένη συντηρητική αντιμετώπιση του ΣΑΑΥ με συσκευή συνεχούς θετικής πίεσης αεραγωγών (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)) θεωρείται μια ικανοποιητική θεραπευτική λύση στο πρόβλημα των ασθενών. Εντούτοις, η μη εύκολη αποδοχή της θεραπείας, αναφέρεται σε ποσοστό 46-83%, οδήγησε πολλούς ερευνητές στην εφαρμογή εναλλακτικών και εξίσου αποτελεσματικών μεθόδων αντιμετώπισης του ΣΑΑΥ όπως είναι οι οδοντιατρικές ενδοστοματικές συσκευές (ΕΣ).Σκοπός: Σκοπός της παρούσας μελέτης είναι α) η διερεύνηση της επίδρασης των ενδοστοματικών συσκευών προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου στην αντιμετώπιση ασθενών με αποφρακτική άπνοια ύπνου και ροχαλητό και β) η διερεύνηση της επίδρασης των ενδοστοματικών συσκευών προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου στο στοματογναθικό σύστημα (ΣΣ) και στη γενική υγεία των ασθενών με ΣΑΑΥ.Υλικό και μέθοδοι: Στην παρούσα ερευνητική μελέτη συμμετείχαν συνολικά 59 ασθενείς, οι οποίοι προσήλθαν στο Κέντρο Μελέτης Διαταραχών Ύπνου, Α’ Κλινική Εντατικής Θεραπείας, Γ.Ν.Α «Ο Ευαγγελισμός», Ιατρική Σχολή ΕΚΠΑ, με σκοπό τη διάγνωση και θεραπευτική αντιμετώπιση των επεισοδίων του ροχαλητού και του συνδρόμου της αποφρακτικής άπνοιας στον ύπνο. Η μελέτη αποτελεί μέρος μιας ελεγχόμενης κλινικής δοκιμής με δύο παράλληλες ομάδες ασθενών. Τριάντα ασθενείς (ερευνητική ομάδα) αντιμετωπίστηκαν στην Κλινική Αντιμετώπισης Στοματοπροσωπικού Πόνου της Οδοντιατρικής Σχολής του ΕΚΠΑ με ενδοστοματική συσκευή προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου (ΕΣ) και είκοσι εννέα ασθενείς (ομάδα ελέγχου) αντιμετωπίστηκαν στο Κέντρο Μελέτης Διαταραχών Ύπνου του Γ.Ν.Α «Ο Ευαγγελισμός» με συσκευή συνεχούς θετικής πίεσης αεραγωγών (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)). Η διάγνωση του συνδρόμου της αποφρακτικής άπνοιας στον ύπνο και το ροχαλητό έγινε με βάση τα αποτελέσματα ολονύκτιας πολυυπνογραφίας (Polysomnography (PSG)). Ενδοσκόπηση του αναπνευστικού αεραγωγού υπό φαρμακευτικό ύπνο (Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE)) πραγματοποιήθηκε πριν την έναρξη της θεραπείας, στους ασθενείς της ερευνητικής ομάδας, για την καταγραφή του σημείου απόφραξης του αναπνευστικού αεραγωγού και τον προσδιορισμό του βαθμού προώθησης που θα έχει η κάτω γνάθος με την ενδοστοματική συσκευή ώστε η θεραπεία να είναι αποτελεσματική. Στους ασθενείς της ομάδας ελέγχου, πριν την έναρξη της θεραπείας, πραγματοποιήθηκε χειροκίνητη τιτλοποίηση (titration) της θετικής πίεσης αέρα της συσκευής CPAP υπό πλήρη παρακολούθηση με πολυυπνογραφία (PSG). Η επιλεγμένη πίεση αέρα της συσκευής CPAP κατά την τιτλοποίηση, καταγράφηκε ως άριστη πίεση που έλυνε το πρόβλημα της απόφραξης του αναπνευστικού αεραγωγού κατά τον ύπνο και αυτή προτάθηκε για τη θεραπεία κατ’ οίκον. Έγινε σύγκριση και στατιστική ανάλυση των αποτελεσμάτων α) της πολυυπνογραφίας (Polysomnography (PSG)), β) του κλινικού δείκτη δυσλειτουργίας του στοματογναθικού συστήματος κατά Helkimo (Di), γ) της ημερήσιας υπνηλίας (κλίμακα υπνηλίας κατά Epworth και δ) της σχετιζόμενης με την υγεία ποιότητας ζωής (Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)) πριν την έναρξη της θεραπείας και οκτώ εβδομάδες μετά τη θεραπευτική παρέμβαση.Αποτελέσματα: Η διακύμανση του δείκτη άπνοιας-υπόπνοιας ύπνου (Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)) των 59 σθενών της μελέτης παρουσίασε σημαντική μεταβολή οκτώ εβδομάδες μετά τη χορήγηση της θεραπείας καθώς παρατηρήθηκε σημαντική μείωση της μέσης τιμής του δείκτη AHI από 35.14 επεισόδια/h σε 6.82/h στους ασθενείς που ακολούθησαν θεραπεία με ενδοστοματική συσκευή προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου και από 35.22/h σε 3.01/h στους ασθενείς που ακολούθησαν θεραπεία με συσκευή συνεχούς θετικής πίεσης αεραγωγών (p&lt;0.001). Δεν παρατηρήθηκε στατιστικά σημαντική διαφορά μεταξύ της ερευνητικής ομάδας και της ομάδας ελέγχου όσον αφορά τη μέση τιμή του μέσου κορεσμού του αρτηριακού αίματος σε οξυγόνο (SpO2) (p=0.571), τη μέση τιμή της κλίμακας υπνηλίας κατά Epworth (p&lt;0.422) και τη μέση τιμή της σχετιζόμενης με την υγεία ποιότητας ζωής (p&lt;0.197) οκτώ εβδομάδες μετά τη χορήγηση της θεραπείας. Δεν παρατηρήθηκαν σημαντικές μεταβολές στην κατάσταση της υγείας του στοματογναθικού συστήματος των ασθενών της μελέτης με βάση τα αποτελέσματα του κλινικού δείκτη δυσλειτουργίας του ΣΣ κατά Helkimo (Di) (p=0.789).Συμπεράσματα: Βραχυπρόθεσμα, οι ενδοστοματικές συσκευές προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου αποτελούν μια εναλλακτική μέθοδο αντιμετώπισης των ασθενών με ήπια, μέτρια και σοβαρή αποφρακτική άπνοια ύπνου και ροχαλητό και μπορούν να θεωρηθούν εξίσου αποτελεσματικές με τη συσκευή συνεχούς θετικής πίεσης αεραγωγών. Η συσκευή CPAP φαίνεται να έχει καλύτερα αποτελέσματα στη μείωση του δείκτη άπνοιας-υπόπνοιας ύπνου όπως καταγράφεται στην πολυυπνογραφία. Ωστόσο, συγκρίσιμα αποτελέσματα βρέθηκαν μεταξύ των δύο θεραπευτικών μεθόδων όσον αφορά τη βελτίωση της κλινικής συμπτωματολογίας και τη σχετιζόμενη με την υγεία ποιότητα ζωής. Η χρήση των ενδοστοματικών συσκευών προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου για χρονικό διάστημα παρακολούθησης οκτώ εβδομάδων δεν φαίνεται να σχετίζεται με σημαντικές μεταβολές στη λειτουργία του στοματογναθικού συστήματος ασθενών με ΣΑΑΥ και ροχαλητό.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorder in Spinal Cord Injuries",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders occur more frequently in people with spinal cord injuries than in the general population and likely contribute to reduced societal participation and quality of life. Primary sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), especially in people with high thoracic and cervical lesions, sleep-related movement disorders while awake and asleep (Peters et al. J Spinal Cord Med. 41:318–325, 2018), and insomnia disorders are common after spinal cord injuries. In addition, various factors can negatively affect sleep after spinal cord injury, including pain, insomnia, and/or the circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders. Subsequently, people with spinal cord injuries report daytime symptoms such as fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, difficult concentration, and impaired quality of life. Fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness can be associated with pain, spasticity, depression, side effects of medications, postural discomfort, and autonomic dysfunction in people with spinal cord injuries.",

      "title": "The role of depression in coronary artery disease",
      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "abstract": "Introduction Insomnia, which is characterized by difficulty in initiating or maintaining a physiological sleep, is a relevant clinical issue, affecting not only the elderly population (from 20% to 40%), but also the general population since 30% of adults report problems in sleeping properly. In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "The long term development of periodic syndromes among children is little known. Our research has revealed that about one third of periodic headaches, two thirds of cyclic vomiting and half the cases of recurring abdominal pain disappear either before puberty or during adolescence. Other Authors have shown that this also happens in most cases of early-onset vertigo. The remaining headache cases develop into migraines in adults. When there is persistent cyclic vomiting, the collateral neurologic phenomena (headaches, vertigo, pallor, hypotonia, drowsiness) become more intense. This also happens in some cases of abdominal pain and paroxysmal vertigo which start in late childhood. Other sufferers from acute abdominal pain develop ulcers, gastroduodenitis and colitis as adults. Altogether, some infantile periodic syndromes (in particular the multi-symptomatic ones) have a common outcome, i.e. develop into more or less typical migraine syndromes. In these cases one can presume a common pathogenetic mechanism. In those cases where the outcome is favorable the pathogenesis may be different. These cases may often be spotted in early childhood on account of the monosymptomatic nature of the complaint or the absence of collateral neurologic symptoms as well as of the infrequency of critical episodes.",

      "title": "A Case of Musical Hallucinations in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Aims: New onset psychosis in the elderly is rare with lifetime prevalence rates of 0.3–1%. Schizophrenia occurs in 0.1–0.5% of the elderly, however more common causes of new onset psychosis include dementia, delirium, drug-induced psychosis, and primary psychiatric disorders, most commonly depression. More than 50% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease experience psychotic symptoms and 70% develop delusions, in particular, persecutory type. Visual hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination occurring in 80% of patients with Lewy Body dementia. Second person auditory hallucinations occur in schizophrenia-like psychosis, however musical hallucinations where one perceives music without an external source are rare. Methods: An 84-year-old female patient with no psychiatric background reported a 2-month history of musical hallucinations, causing distress and poor sleep. Patient denied hearing voices and other modalities of hallucinations. The musical hallucinations were not lateralised to either ear or side of space but experienced as external. Delirium was ruled out and patient’s medications were screened for anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics. Patient had good cognition and a CT head excluded organic causes. The patient appeared distracted by the musical hallucinations, however, was not agitated and her mood was euthymic with congruent affect. No evidence of mood disorders ruled out psychotic depression and other affective disorders with psychotic symptoms. No thought disorders or delusions were present. Antipsychotics quetiapine and amisulpride proved no benefit for the patient. Results: The patient’s presentation showed no clear reversible pathology and was unresponsive to antipsychotics. Musical hallucinations was given as a diagnosis of exclusion. A musical hallucination is a type of auditory hallucination involving the perception of music without an external source. Patients are usually female, over 60 and subdivided into those with hyperacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy and intoxication. Our patient was female and over 60 with presbycusis. Musical hallucinations are proposed to be due to abnormal autonomous activity in the auditory brain systems responsible for normal music imagery. Sensory auditory deprivation or acquired peripheral deafness leads to impoverished auditory input and spontaneous activity occurs within the network for the perception and imagery of music. Conclusion: This case report describes a rare phenomenon of musical hallucinations in an elderly patient. It identifies important diagnoses to exclude including delirium, dementia and other organic causes. The patient was female, over 60 yrs and diagnosed with presbycusis, characteristic of patients with musical hallucinations. The patient showed no improvement with antipsychotics and so treatment consisted of psychoeducation.",

      "abstract": "Changes in the mental condition of the patient are frequently to be recognised as one of the earliest symptoms of exophthalmic goitre. These mental changes may be present before the cardiac or ocular symptoms have been established and before the changes in the thyroid have been observed. The most common feature is an intense and indefinable agitation leading to a more or less marked motor and mental restlessness, which causes the patient to look for constant change in her surroundings and work. There is an inability to settle long to any one occupation or recreation. Work begun with a feeling of relief at the change involved soon becomes irksome, is then done only with an effort, and with the cumulative feeling of effort and concentration required soon causes distress and the work is laid aside. Any sudden noise, any unexpected news, any of the ordinary disturbing elements of everyday life may be followed by an attack of palpitation lasting some hours, and yet, in spite of this, there is an imperative desire to keep moving; to go where such incidents may be experienced. Dr. Geo. Murray, in the Bradshaw Lecture of 1905, states that he has not noticed this craving for entertainment. It seems to be entirely a question of degree. If the stimulus is moderate there may be pleasure in its fulfilment; if more marked it may pass into an apprehensive dread with inhibition of this desire.",

VVS may be triggered by pain, fear, anxiety, or emotional upset and loss of blood perse. It is an exaggeration of an adaptive response meant to assist in reducing the amount of bleeding/loss of blood. The four major components necessary for rapid cardiovascular adjustments to supine or upright posture, otherwise called orthostasis, are the autonomic nervous system, adequate blood volume, and intact skeletal and respiratory muscle pumps. The taxing of these autoregulatory mechanisms and their inability to compensate sufficiently results in VVS. VVR episodes can be described in 3 phases; Presyncope, Syncope, and Postsyncope. The actual syncope generally lasts for <15 s, comprising staring, muscle jerks, eye deviation/rolling, sometimes incontinence, loss of consciousness, gasping, snoring, apnea, inability to move/react, etc., The postsyncopal phase is the longest, which is generally manifested as fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Headache pain impacts most of the population at some point in life, at an enormous cost to day-to-day functioning. Determination of the variables that are associated with prevalence and severity of headaches has been inconsistent. One area that deserves more attention is the relationship between headaches and sleep. For instance, several sleep parameters may precipitate or exacerbate headaches, but previous research often used inconsistent and limited assessments of both headaches and sleep, making results difficult to interpret and compare. The current study seeks to extend previous research by using more comprehensive and empirically validated assessment techniques to study the relationship between sleep and headaches in a healthy sample. Greater self-reported sleep quality is related to lower headache frequency and severity, and lower self-reported sleep quality is characteristic of individuals having migraine-type headaches. Greater sleep efficiency is related to lower headache severity and shorter headache duration. Greater sleep onset latency is related to longer headache duration and greater headache severity. Greater number of nighttime awakenings is related to greater headache severity and is characteristic of individuals having a diagnosable headache disorder (either tension-type or migraine-type). Stress appeared to be a partial mediator between self-reported sleep quality and headache severity. Further experimental studies may clarify causality between sleep and headache.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep medicine is an increasingly important specialty as the adverse health consequences of disturbed sleep are recognised by patients and physicians, and the current classification of sleep disorders, as recognised by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), is summarised. Two primary sleep disorders, narcolepsy with cataplexy and the disorders of arousal, a symptomatic cluster that includes sleepwalking, confusional arousal and sleep terrors, are reviewed in greater detail. Both disorders can be summarised as being caused by inappropriate switching between the states of vigilance, although they are very different in age of onset, severity and impact on health. In narcolepsy the boundary between sleep and wakefulness is uncontrolled but in the disorders of arousal the boundary between states of sleep is affected. These two disorders also have a genetic predisposition suggesting that advances in knowledge of the relevant mutations could eventually translate into better understanding of the possible mechanisms and hence lead to improved treatments. Key Concepts: The disorders of sleep are primary, for example as a result of pathology in the mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness, or secondary, for example resulting from a medical condition. Apnoea, interruptions of breathing lasting longer than 10 s that result in arousal from sleep, is the principal presenting condition at sleep clinics. Polysomnography is used to record physiological parameters such as respiration rate, heart rate and blood oxygen level simultaneously with data allowing the stage of sleep or wakefulness to be defined. Basic research into the neurophysiology, molecular genetics and neurochemistry of sleep and wakefulness has been critical for understanding the causes of many sleep disorders. The classification of sleep disorders is continuously evolving and being refined as new disorders are recognised in the clinic and neurophysiological and neurochemical pathologies are better understood.",

      "title": "The neurobehavioral toxicity of trichloroethylene.",
      "abstract": "Trichloroethylene is an industrial solvent used primarily in degreasing operations with some use as an anesthetic agent as well. The primary route of exposure is inhalation and the central nervous system effects consist of headache, nausea, sleepiness, burning of the eyes. Human cases of intoxication have been associated with trigeminal neuropathy, however this is probably caused by a breakdown product dichloroacetylene. Fatal exposures may be the result of cardiac failure. Chronic exposure in industrial settings may cause alterations in a variety of behavioral parameters such as reduced memory and intellectual functioning. Experimental human exposures reveal fatigue and sleepiness effects and possible alterations in reaction time, but no deterioration in performance on manual dexterity tasks up to 300 ppm exposures. Animal experiments using acute exposures generally fail to reveal behavioral effects at concentrations below 1000 ppm, with a range of 75-2000 ppm. Cessation of exposure results in rapid behavioral recovery with no residual behavioral deficits. Exposure of dogs to 3000 ppm chronically results in severe cerebellar pathology, with no trigeminal nerve damage. No neurochemical effects of exposure have been documented. The neurobehavioral literature on the toxic effects of trichloroethylene is fragmented and poorly documented suggesting that more and better quality work is needed to understand the potential toxicity of this compound.",

      "abstract": "Violent behavior during sleep is a common problem, affecting > 2% of the population > 15 years old as found in two large epidemiologic studies. The differential diagnosis of sleep related injury and violence includes: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD); NREM sleep parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep terrors); parasomnia overlap disorder (RBD + NREM sleep parasomnias); obstructive sleep apnea; sexsomnia (sleep related abnormal sexual behaviors); sleep related dissociative disorder; trauma-associated sleep disorder/post-traumatic stress disorder; periodic limb movement disorder; rhythmic movement disorder; nocturnal scratching disorder; nocturnal seizures; and miscellaneous/mixed conditions. Careful clinical interviews, preferably with bed partners participating, and extensive, hospital-based, technologist-attended, overnight video-polysomnography (for one or more nights), is crucial for determining the accurate diagnosis that will guide proper therapy. Most of the disorders mentioned above are classified as parasomnias in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, with parasomnias defined as abnormal behavioral, experiential and/or autonomic nervous system activity during entry into sleep, during any stage of sleep, and during emergence from any stage of sleep. Parasomnias are often manifestations of \"state dissociation\" in which components of one state of being (wake, REM sleep, NREM sleep) intrude into, and become admixed, with other states of being, with clinical consequences. There are forensic implications related to the parasomnias, with inadvertent and unintentional assaults, murder, and \"pseudo-suicide\" resulting from aggressive and violent behaviors arising from sleep with suspended awareness and judgement.",

The reported incidence of phantom limb pain after trauma, injury or peripheral vascular diseases is 60% to 80%. Over half the patients with phantom pain have stump pain as well. Phantom pain can also occur in other parts of the body; it has been described after mastectomies and enucleation of the eye. Most patients with phantom pain have intermittent pain, with intervals that range from 1 day to several weeks. Even intervals of over a year have been reported. The pain often presents itself in the form of attacks that vary in duration from a few seconds to minutes or hours. In most cases, the pain is experienced distally in the missing limb, in places with the most extensive innervation density and cortical representation. Although there are still many questions as to the underlying mechanisms, peripheral as well as central neuronal mechanisms seem to be involved. Conservative therapy consists of drug treatment with amitriptyline, tramadol, carbamazepine, ketamine, or morphine. Based on the available evidence some effect may be expected from drug treatment. When conservative treatment fails, pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the stump neuroma or of the spinal ganglion (DRG) or spinal cord stimulation could be considered (evidence score 0). These treatments should only be applied in a study design.",

The reductions in quality of life associated with excessive sleepiness may be substantial, involving compromised cognitive performance and work productivity as well as possible harm to the individual and the public. Excessive sleepiness may be the result of a number of extrinsic and intrinsic causes. Although it is an established symptom of certain psychiatric illnesses, abnormal excessive sleepiness in psychiatric patients may be the result of a comorbid disorder of sleep or wakefulness. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of sleep disorders are common in community psychiatric practices because clinicians may not be aware of the different causes and consequences of excessive sleepiness. It is essential to recognize and treat the underlying cause of this disorder. In cases where sleep disorders are suspected, a comprehensive treatment program might include nonpharmacologic approaches, pharmacologic approaches, or both may need to be initiated to encompass the complexity of sleep disorder treatments. Careful monitoring and follow-up of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, including counseling and long-term support, are essential to ensure treatment compliance and to maintain improvements over time.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Testicular torsion is a serious urologic emergency that can present with unusual or atypical history and examination. Classical pain from testicular torsion is of sudden onset, significantly severe, and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. However, in some patients, the initial scrotal pain appears to considerably subside within the next few hours. In others, testicular torsion tends to occur while sleeping, and many patients recount a history of being woken up from sleep by intense pain. Furthermore, some patients in this subset can resume normal activities and even sleep through the night with little or no discomfort, without a perceived need for pain medications. Other patients initially experience mild pain, which worsens over time. Consequently, these patients are less likely to be evaluated immediately. In view of these atypical cases, the question remains unanswered regarding sleep as a predisposing factor for testicular torsion. This narrative review focuses on exploring the association between sleep and testicular torsion.

      "abstract": "• Summary: Somatoform disorders and functional somatic syndromes are defined as the presence of physical symptoms in the absence of sufficient tissue or organ damage to account for the degree of pain or dysfunction. Many people who suffer from these disorders have a history of childhood abuse. Because these individuals may also have a number of other difficulties in living, social workers encounter such clients in diverse fields of practice. Clients who fall into the category of adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder may experience certain interventions by doctors, therapists, and other helping professionals (including social workers) as repeating interactions they had with their abusers. • Findings: Adult survivors of abuse who have a somatoform disorder often have parallel experiences in terms of their abuse and their somatic symptoms: important others communicate that the abuse and the symptoms are not real, are the client’s fault, and/or that the client is over-reacting to the abuse and symptoms. Furthermore, adult survivors of abuse may experience helping professionals as distinctly non-nurturing and as engaging in distancing behaviours. These interactions may stand in the way of helping members of this population, or even add to the client’s distress. There are specific practices in which the social worker may engage to help avoid these kinds of relations. • Applications: Social workers in a number of fields of practice may be alerted to dynamics common among adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder. In the event that a client falls into this category, the informed social worker can avoid recapitulating abuse dynamics as well as help clients understand their diagnosis and why interactions with helping professionals may have been upsetting.",

      "title": "Epileptic Encephalopathies: A Brief Overview",
      "abstract": "Summary Epileptic encephalopathies are conditions in which neurologic deterioration is attributable entirely or partly to epileptic activity. It can be due to very frequent or severe seizures and/or to subcontinuous paroxysmal interictal activity. The former mainly consists of Dravet syndrome, in which patients have seizures from the middle of the first year of life and repeat episodes of severe febrile status epilepticus and migrating partial epilepsy in infancy, in which from the first trimester of life, partial seizures affect various areas of the cortex randomly and in a subcontinuous fashion. In Rasmussen syndrome, also, epileptic activity contributes at least partly to the neurologic deterioration. Subcontinuous paroxysmal interictal activity affects newborn infants with suppression bursts, thus consisting in either Ohtahara syndrome or neonatal myoclonic encephalopathy. In infants, it is either myoclonic epilepsy of nonprogressive encephalopathy or West syndrome. In school-age children, it consists of various types of generalized seizures combined with slow spike waves of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, and continuous spike waves in slow sleep combined with various motor or cognitive deficits including negative myoclonus, orofacial dyspraxia, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and frontal lobe syndrome. Treatment differs for all of these syndromes. It is important to avoid potential drug-induced worsening, and valproate is preferred when a definitive diagnosis is not reached in children and especially infants.",

Complex visual hallucinations have been described in patients with occipito-temporal and anteromedial temporal epileptic activity. The potential atypical character of seizures' manifestations in elderly patients,a reduced tendency to secondary generalization, associated with the high frequency of confusional syndromes, makes the interpretation of perception and thought disturbances a challenge. Patient 76 years, male gender, with hypertension, light alcohol consumption and without prior history of cognitive impairment. Medicated with benzodiazepines for insomnia (suspended during hospitalization). History of one episode of generalized seizure in his youth. Admitted to the stroke unit with a left occipital hematoma diagnosed after a sudden onset headache. The neurological examination was unremarkable. On the 2nd day of hospitalization initiated episodes of nocturnal restlessness, disorientation and persecutory delusions accompanied by visual and auditory hallucinations which were scenic and stereotyped. This clinical picture was initially interpreted as an acute confusional syndrome and haloperidol was administered. These episodes lasted about 20 minutes and did not respond to therapy. There was interepisodic full recovery and no other clinical or analytical abnormalities. Considering the nature of these episodes an EEG was performed, which revealed right anterior temporal intercritical epileptic activity. Therapy with neuroleptic was discontinued with resolution of symptoms. We intend to point out that in cases of stereotyped hallucinations epileptic etiology should be considered as a differential diagnosis for the clinical pictures with psychotic symptoms, which are often interpreted as acute psychosis or delirium, especially in elderly hospitalized patients.",

      "abstract": "Acute respiratory failure is a common complication of drug abuse. It is more likely to develop in the setting of chronic lung disease or debility in those with limited respiratory reserve. Drugs may acutely precipitate respiratory failure by compromising respiratory pump function and/or by causing pulmonary pathology. Polysubstance overdoses are common, and clinicians should anticipate complications related to multiple drugs. Impairment of respiratory pump function may develop from central nervous system (CNS) depression (suppression of the medulla oblongata, stroke or seizures) or respiratory muscle fatigue (increased respiratory workload, metabolic acidosis). Drug-related respiratory pathology may result from parenchymal (aspiration-related events, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, infectious and non-infectious pneumonitides), airway (bronchospasm and hemorrhage), or pulmonary vascular insults (endovascular infections, hemorrhage, and vasoconstrictive events). Alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and benzodiazepines are the most commonly abused drugs that may induce events leading to acute respiratory failure. While decontamination and aggressive supportive measures are indicated, specific therapies to correct seizures, metabolic acidosis, pneumothorax, infections, bronchospasm, and agitation should be considered. Drug-related respiratory failure when due to CNS depression alone may portend well, but in patients with drug-related significant pulmonary pathology, a protracted course of illness may be anticipated.",

      "title": "Perspectives in affective disorders: Clocks and sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mood disorders are often characterised by alterations in circadian rhythms, sleep disturbances and seasonal exacerbation. Conversely, chronobiological treatments utilise zeitgebers for circadian rhythms such as light to improve mood and stabilise sleep, and manipulations of sleep timing and duration as rapid antidepressant modalities. Although sleep deprivation (“wake therapy”) can act within hours, and its mood‐elevating effects be maintained by regular morning light administration/medication/earlier sleep, it has not entered the regular guidelines for treating affective disorders as a first‐line treatment. The hindrances to using chronotherapeutics may lie in their lack of patentability, few sponsors to carry out large multi‐centre trials, non‐reimbursement by medical insurance and their perceived difficulty or exotic “alternative” nature. Future use can be promoted by new technology (single‐sample phase measurements, phone apps, movement and sleep trackers) that provides ambulatory documentation over long periods and feedback to therapist and patient. Light combinations with cognitive behavioural therapy and sleep hygiene practice may speed up and also maintain response. The urgent need for new antidepressants should hopefully lead to reconsideration and implementation of these non‐pharmacological methods, as well as further clinical trials. We review the putative neurochemical mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation and light therapy, and current knowledge linking clocks and sleep with affective disorders: neurotransmitter switching, stress and cortico‐limbic reactivity, clock genes, cortical neuroplasticity, connectomics and neuroinflammation. Despite the complexity of multi‐system mechanisms, more insight will lead to fine tuning and better application of circadian and sleep‐related treatments of depression.",

      "title": "Autonomic Cardiorespiratory Physiology and Arousal of the Fetus and Infant",
      "abstract": "Despite intensive research over the past decades, the mechanisms which lead to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) still remain elusive. SIDS is presumed to occur in an apparently healthy infant during a period of sleep (1). A failure of cardiorespiratory control mechanisms, together with an impaired arousal from sleep response, are believed to play an important role in the final event of SIDS. Sleep has a marked influence on respiratory and cardiovascular control in both adults and infants, although sleep states, sleep architecture, and arousal from sleep processes in infants are very different from those of adults and undergo significant maturation during the first year of life, particularly in the first six months when SIDS risk is greatest (2).Arousal from sleep involves both physiological and behavioral responses and has long been considered a vital survival response for restoring homeostasis in reaction to various life-threatening situations, such as prolonged hypoxia or hypotension (3). There are two distinct arousal types defined in infants, subcortical activation and full cortical arousal, which reflect the hierarchical activation from the brainstem (including heart rate, blood pressure, and ventilation changes) to the cortex (4). Any impairment of these protective responses may render an infant vulnerable to the respiratory and cardiovascular instabilities that are common during infancy and that have been postulated to occur in SIDS. In support of this possibility, extensive physiological and neuropathological studies have provided compelling evidence that impaired cardiovascular control, with a concomitant failure to arouse from sleep, are involved in the final events leading to SIDS. The first six months of life are a critical period of development when rapid maturation of the brain, cardiorespiratory system, and sleep state organization are all taking place (2, 5). Thus, the investigation of sleep physiology in healthy infants during this high-risk period provides important insights into the likely mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of SIDS.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by involuntary repetition, prolongation or cessation of a sound. This dysfluency may be developmental or acquired. Acquired dysfluency can be classified as neurogenic or psychogenic. Objectives This case report aims to describe and discuss a case of psychogenic stuttering, providing an updated review on this disorder. Methods In and outpatient interviews were performed by Neurology and Psychiatry. Investigation to exclude organic causes included lab exams, electrocardiogram, electroencephalography, computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging. A literature review in Science Direct database, with the keywords “psychogenic stuttering”, was also conducted. Results A 63-year-old man was admitted to the Beatriz Ângelo Hospital with an acute stuttering. Speech was characterized by the repetition of initial or stressed syllables, little affected by reading out loud or singing. Comprehension, syntaxes and semantic were not compromised, as weren’t sensory and motor abilities. During admission, stuttering characteristics changed. Multiple somatic complaints and stress prior to the onset and bizarre secondary behaviors were also detected. Work-up didn’t show an organic etiology for that sudden change. An iatrogenic etiology was considered, as sertraline and topiramate were started for depression 1 month before. However, the stuttering pattern, the negative results, the psychological and the social life events suggested a psychogenic etiology. Conclusions Psychogenic stuttering finds its origin in psychological or emotional problems. It is best classified as a conversion reaction. The differential diagnosis between psychogenic and neurological stuttering can be challenging. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "The biological basis of injury and neuroprotection in the fetal and neonatal brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract A compromised intrauterine environment that delivers low levels of oxygen and/or nutrients, or is infected or inflammatory, can result in fetal brain injury, abnormal brain development and in cases of chronic compromise, intrauterine growth restriction. Preterm birth can also be associated with injury to the developing brain and affect the normal trajectory of brain growth. This review will focus on the effects that episodes of perinatal hypoxia (acute, chronic, associated with inflammation or as an antecedent of preterm birth) can have on the developing brain. In animal models of these conditions we have found that relatively brief (acute) periods of fetal hypoxemia can have significant effects on the fetal brain, for example death of susceptible neuronal populations (cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex) and cerebral white matter damage. Chronic placental insufficiency which includes fetal hypoxemia, nutrient restriction and altered endocrine status can result in fetal growth restriction and long‐term deficits in neural connectivity in addition to altered postnatal function, for example in the auditory and visual systems. Maternal/fetal inflammation can result in fetal brain damage, particularly but not exclusively in the white matter; injury is more pronounced when associated with fetal hypoxemia. In the baboon, in which the normal trajectory of growth is affected by preterm birth, there is a direct correlation between a higher flux in oxygen saturation and a greater extent of neuropathological damage. Currently, the only established therapy for neonatal encephalopathy in full term neonates is moderate hypothermia although this only offers some protection to moderately but not severely affected brains. There is no accepted therapy for injured preterm brains. Consequently the search for more efficacious treatments continues; we discuss neuroprotective agents (erythropoietin, N‐acetyl cysteine, melatonin, creatine, neurosteroids) which we have trialed in appropriate animal models. The possibility of combining hypothermia with such agents or growth factors is now being considered. A deeper understanding of causal pathways in brain injury is essential for the development of efficacious strategies for neuroprotection.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are becoming more prevalent. There is an overlap of symptoms related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and many psychiatric conditions. Complaints of excessive sleepiness, insomnia, cognitive dysfunction, and depressive symptoms can be related to both disease states. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by repetitive disruption of sleep by cessation of breathing and was first described in the 19th century by bedside observation during sleep. Physicians observed this cessation of breathing while the patient slept and postulated that these episodes were responsible for subsequent complaints of sleepiness. OSAS can coexist with major depressive disorder, exacerbate depressive symptoms, or be responsible for a large part of the symptom complex of depression. Additionally, in schizophrenia, sleep apnea may develop as a result of chronic neuroleptic treatment and its effect on gains in body weight, a major risk factor for the development of OSAS.It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of sleep apnea, namely excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Recognition of the existence of sleep apnea, prompt referral to a sleep specialist, and ultimately treatment of an underlying sleep disorder, such as OSAS, can ameliorate symptoms of psychiatric disease.",

      "title": "1440 Fractured Sleep: Serious Injury Uncovers a Challenging Case of Abnormal Movements in Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Disorders of arousal (DoA) and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) are difficult to distinguish. Both involve abnormal movements in sleep that may lead to serious harm to the patient or others. We present a case of abnormal movements in sleep leading to serious injury and discuss diagnostic features of SHE. Report of case The patient is a 48-year-old male with severe OSA on CPAP. He presented after multiple falls from bed. One fall resulted in a right tibial-fibular fracture requiring surgical fixation. He described five to ten episodes of nightly rhythmic limb movements leading to falls out of bed. The episodes occurred in the first half of the night. After an event, he would experience full awakening with preserved memory of rhythmic body movements leading to fall. Events were not dream related and devoid of sleepwalking, sex-related behavior, or sleep eating. Comprehensive physical and neurologic exam was only notable for ecchymoses on the right forearm. In-lab polysomnography on CPAP showed successful control of OSA and simultaneously captured eight episodes of abrupt onset stereotyped motor activity arising out of N3 sleep. These 30-90 second episodes included rhythmic arm flapping, head bobbing and synchronized leg movements. EEG during episodes was obscured by muscle artifact. EEG following episodes showed wake rhythm. There were no epileptiform discharges, hypersynchronous activity or build up to the episodes. The patient was treated with one milligram of oral clonazepam nightly and the episodes improved. He has had no falls out of bed or injuries since starting medication. Conclusion Distinguishing SHE from DoA is challenging. EEG abnormalities are not found in the majority of cases of SHE and more than half of patients are reported to have a normal scalp EEG. This patient had stereotyped movements captured on video with no epileptiform discharges on EEG. Unrecognized and untreated SHE may lead to serious injury. Diagnostic and confidence level criteria have been described by Tinipur et al. to support this important diagnosis in the absence of EEG-confirmed epileptiform activity. Video recording of episodes is a critical contributor to accurate diagnostic assessment of patients with abnormal movements in sleep. Support (if any)",

Sleep and wakefulness are modulated by homeostatic and circadian regulatory mechanisms. Like most physiological systems, sleep and wakefulness are also governed by a circadian oscillator located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Patients with sleep disorders often benefit from a general medical evaluation to investigate contributing factors. Fatigue and sleepiness may be associated with endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism. The major symptom of Insomnia Disorder is dissatisfaction with the quantity or quality of sleep. Insomnia is associated with a wide variety of medical disorders, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorder.

      "abstract": "Four hundred and six asthmatic attacks occurred in 9 patients with severe, chronic bronchial asthma who had been studied intensively in psychiatric or (in two instances) psychoanalytic interviews. Feelings and fantasies concomitant with asthma tended to be dominated by absorption in the physical illness. At times this appeared to serve as a protection against obvious psychological problems. In somewhat more than half of the episodes other emotional concomitants appeared after asthma had become established. The vast majority of these were depressive--a sense of sadness, helplessness, and hopelessness, at times accompanied by ideas of a dangerous or poisonous inner substance. Contrasting with these, in somewhat less than half of the attacks there were prodromal emotionaxl manifestations which preceded and led directly into acute asthma. The principal prodromal feature was excitement, usually with an angry or anxious coloring, occasionally elated and erotic, resembling a miniature hypomania. We suggest that in asthma an initial phase of drive arousal and excitement is followed by a later phase of drive restraint and inhibition. Antecedent changes in the environment occurring in the 48 hours prior to an attack varied widely. Eight categories could be discerned, the two most prominent being loss of a person and closeness to a person. Most of the categories could be divided into one of two groups: events which seemed to lead to frustration of powerful impulses and those which seemed to stimulate erotized or dangerous wishes. We postulate that both types of event, although neither is of itself specific for asthma, might activate a respiratory apparatus having both intake and expulsion functions, which has become vulnerable to psychological as well as physiological stress.",

There was no childhood or family history of parasomnia. The events had gradually become more frequent over the years, occurring in the first half of the night within 2 h of sleep onset. There were no triggers, and she had partial amnesia for the events. A diagnosis of adult-onset sleep terrors was made on clinical grounds and supported polysomnographically. Seizures and periodic limb movements were excluded as triggering factors. There was some mild sleep disordered breathing (predominantly non-desaturating hypopnea with a propensity for REM sleep of debatable significance). Imaging of the brain and spine and neurophysiological investigations ruled out lesions, entrapments, or neuropathies as possible causes of pain. Treatment (clonazepam, paroxetine, or gabapentin) was poorly tolerated and made no difference to the nocturnal episodes, while trazodone worsened them. This is the first report of hypnopompic psychic pain in association with a NREM parasomnia. We hypothesize that the pain may represent a sensory hallucination analogous to the more commonly recognized visual NREM parasomnia-associated hypnopompic visual hallucinations and that, as such, it may arise during arousal of the sensory neocortex as confabulatory response.",

Agrypnia excitata (AE) is a rare syndrome characterized by sleep-wake cycle disruption, autonomic hyperactivation and episodes of oneiric stupor. Only a few diseases are known to present with AE. An autoimmune etiology must be considered when accompanied by neuromyotonia. A case of anti-LGI1 encephalitis presenting with AE is reported.Detailed clinical, video-polysomnographic, laboratory, radiological and long-term follow-up assessments were performed.A previously healthy 58-year-old man was referred for a rapidly progressive change in mental status, characterized by persistent drowsiness and confusion, accompanied by frequent episodes of unconscious gestures ranging from simple stereotyped movements to more complex actions mimicking various daily activities. Other symptoms included tachycardia, hyperhidrosis, mild hyponatremia, rare faciobrachial dystonic seizures, and a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure, but no neuromyotonia. Prolonged video-polysomnography excluded epileptic activity and showed continuous monomorphic slowing of background activity not consistent with a regular wakefulness or sleep state. A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan was unremarkable. Brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed hypermetabolism of the hippocampi, amygdala and basal ganglia. Anti-LGI1 antibodies were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. The sleep disorder resolved progressively after starting immunotherapy.Agrypnia excitata can be a dominant, treatable manifestation of anti-LGI1 encephalitis. Oneiric stupor episodes are a useful clinical feature for establishing diagnostic suspicion and could provide a window to understanding the mechanisms behind some movement disorders in autoimmune encephalitis.",

This term covers at least four types of sleep disorders: difficult falling asleep, frequent awakening, too early awakening and impairment of sleep quality--sleep quantitatively sufficient but failing to produce a feeling of rest. Insomnia may be sporadic, short-lasting and chronic. The last type requires particularly medical assistance since impairment of sleep quality can lead to drug dependence. In every case of insomnia it should be tried to explain its cause /neurosis, depression, somatic diseases with symptoms leading to sleep disturbances, toxic factors such as alcohol, drugs, inappropriate sleep hygiene etc./. In the treatment the basic role is played by removal of causes and better observation of sleep hygiene. Hypnotic drugs are indicated in sporadic and short-lasting insomnia, but in chronic insomnia they should be used cautiously and not continuously. Barbiturates have been abandoned recently and benzodiazepines have replaced them. They are, however, fraught with numerous faults. Cyclopyrolones /Zolpidem, Zopiklon/ are the new generation of hypnotic drugs in which the negative features of benzodiazepines have been partly excluded. Their half-life is short, they cause no rebound effect, adverse effects are better tolerated and are less frequent, drug dependence is not produced.",

The present theoretical formulation proposes five different models conceptualizing the relationship. According to Model 1, dissociative experiences result from OCD/S through inward-focused attention and repetition. According to Model 2, dissociative absorption causally brings about both OCD/S and associated cognitive risk factors, such as thought-action fusion, partly through impoverished sense of agency. The remaining models highlight common underlying causal mechanisms: temporo-parietal abnormalities impairing embodiment and sensory integration (Model 3); sleep alterations causing sleepiness and dreamlike thought or mixed sleep-wake states (Model 4); and a hyperactive, intrusive imagery system with a tendency for pictorial thinking (Model 5). The latter model relates to Maladaptive Daydreaming, a suggested dissociative syndrome with strong ties to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum. These five models point to potential directions for future research, as these theoretical accounts may aid the two fields in interacting with each other, to the benefit of both. Finally, several dissociation-informed paths for further developing clinical intervention in OCD are identified.",

In connection with the morning shift the circadian psychophysiology makes it difficult to fall asleep as early as needed during the preceding night. Around 0400 to 0500, when the individuals should rise, they have difficulties awakening because of the sleep loss and the circadian rhythm, which at that point is at its lowest. Subsequently, day work is characterized by sleepiness and reduced performance. It should be emphasized that it does not seem possible to improve one's ability to adjust over time, even with permanent night work. Older age and \"morningness\" personality are related to higher than average problems in adjusting.",

      "abstract": "Comorbidity of sleep disturbances in dementia may lead to aggravation of cognitive and behavioral problems such as agitation, delirium and wandering in night time. Especially, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) frequently showed a disturbance of the sleep-wake circadian rhythm, on the other hand, dementia with Lewy bodies showed REM sleep behavior disorder. This disturbance of circadian rhythm is associated with degeneration of responsible area for sleep-wake regulation (i.e. suprachiasmatic nucleus: SCN, tuberomammillary nucleus: TMN etc.) and decreased melatonin secretion. To prevent or treat sleep disturbance in dementia, mixed modality approach with pharmacological, physical and social intervention and sleep-wake scheduling is needed. Management of the symptom is important for maintaining QOL of not only patients themselves but alsotheir caregivers.",

      "abstract": "Impulsive reactions in social interactions may result in poor or even detrimental outcomes. Particular cognitive states, such as mental fatigue induced by extended practice with cognitively demanding activities, especially if combined with sleep restriction or deprivation, seem to impair the individuals' ability to exert self-control effectively and may result in impulsive behaviors, including aggressive acts. We demonstrate that exertion of self-control for as little as 45 min can lead to an increased propensity for engaging in aggressive acts in the context of socially relevant choices, as measured by a set of economic games. Also, we show that such behavioral changes are associated with increased sleep-like (delta) activity within frontal brain areas related to decision-making and impulse control. The local occurrence of sleep-like slow waves may lead to a disengagement of frontal areas and explain the reduced ability of individuals to exert self-control effectively. Our results suggest that sleep-like activity may emerge within the awake brain within a relatively short time scale, with detectable effects on socially relevant behavior.",

Amnesia for the episodes of sleepwalking or sleep terror must be present, and the child should have little or no dream imagery recalled. The next step is to measure interference through the Feelings Thermometer, inquiring how much the problem has interfered with the child's friendships, caused problems at school or at home, or stopped the child from doing the things they would like to do.

There are many physiological changes in sleep such as fall in blood pressure, decrease in heart rate, reduction in pH of the blood, reduction in urine secretion, decrease in metabolic rate, slow and regular breathing, muscular relaxation and the disappearance of deep reflex actions, but almost any of these physiological changes may be absent in a sleep which is normal in all other respects. It is therefore more accurate to refer to the physiological accompaniments than to the physiology of sleep (Gillespie, 1929).",

After an incubation period usually lasting weeks or longer, a variety of prodromal symptoms may occur. Encephalitic rabies (80% of cases) is associated with episodes of generalised arousal or hyperexcitability and hydrophobia, in which spasms involve the contraction of inspiratory muscles with swallowing. Paralytic rabies (in 20% of cases) is characterised by progressive lower motor neuron weakness. Laboratory investigations are important for confirming an ante mortem diagnosis of rabies. Cardiopulmonary and many other complications, including multiple organ failure, are common in aggressively managed rabies patients in critical care units. No effective therapy is available for rabies and survivors are uncommon. In contrast, preventative measures for rabies are highly effective after recognised exposures.La rage est une maladie neurologique aiguë affectant les personnes et les animaux infectés par le virus de la rage, lequel est généralement transmis par la morsure d’un animal. Des signes précurseurs peuvent apparaître après une période d’incubation de quelques semaines voire plus. La rage encéphalique (qui représente 80 % des cas) est associée à des épisodes d’agitation ou d’hyperexcitabilité et d’hydrophobie durant lesquels surviennent des contractions spasmodiques des muscles pharyngés lors de la déglutition. La rage paralytique (20 % des cas) se caractérise par une dégénérescence progressive des neurones moteurs inférieurs. Des analyses de laboratoire sont nécessaires pour obtenir confirmation ante-mortem d’un diagnostic de rage. Des complications notamment cardiopulmonaires ainsi que des défaillances de plusieurs organes sont fréquentes chez les patients atteints soumis à des traitements très lourds dans les services de réanimation.

An exception would be presyncopal light-headedness caused by postural hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia. Patients with psychophysiologic dizziness often report being dizzy from morning to night without changes for months to years at a time. Vertigo is typically aggravated by head movements, whereas nonvestibular dizziness is often aggravated by movement of visual targets. Episodes of dizziness induced by position change suggest a vestibular lesion if postural hypotension has been ruled out. Although stress can aggravate both vestibular and nonvestibular dizziness, dizziness that is reliably precipitated by stress suggests a nonvestibular cause. Finally, episodes of dizziness occurring only in specific situations (e.g., driving on the freeway, entering a crowded room, or shopping in a busy supermarket) suggest a nonvestibular cause.",

Sensations often involve both legs but can be unilateral or may alternate between lower extremities. Common complaints include a sensation of creeping, crawling, tingling, wormy, throbbing, pulling, burning, or increased “tension” located deep within the legs (rather than affecting the skin superficially) when sitting or lying down. Some patients are simply unable to describe adequately the sensation they feel. Although symptoms are typically not described as painful, a complaint of pain does not exclude the diagnosis. These uncomfortable sensations extend from the feet and ankle proximally to the legs and, occasionally, thighs. Similar sensations have also been described in the arms. Symptoms tend to occur at night, although unpleasant sensations may emerge during the daytime during prolonged periods of immobility (eg, airplane flights). There is often an accompanying irresistible urge to move the limbs (motor restlessness) to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Less frequently, an isolated urge to move is present without any accompanying unpleasant sensations.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

Sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea, exacerbate seizures. Seizures, in turn, can disrupt sleep structure, particularly rapid-eye-movement sleep.

      "title": "[Non-epileptic motor paroxysmal phenomena in wakefulness in childhood].",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. Fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos motores en vigilia en la infancia.Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migraña (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described. Good sleep should be understood as a substrate for psychological health and a reasonable expectation in later life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fact: Actually, inadequate or poor-quality sleep can affect you in many different ways, both psychologically and physically. So much is this the case that often this explanation of your difficulties gets overlooked instead of being dealt with. Many people know they do not sleep well, although many do not ask for help and soldier on as best they can. Others are less aware that their sleep is unsatisfactory and that they could benefit if their sleep was improved. Ideally, a person’s sleep at night should be both long enough (adequate sleep) and also of sufficiently good quality to restore them, so that they feel well and can function properly during the day. Good-quality sleep means that sleep is sound and unbroken. In addition, sleep quality can be impaired (also called ‘fragmented’ sleep) by very brief arousals without you consciously waking up. This happens particularly in later life and in various sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (see Chapter 9), causing daytime sleepiness.",

      "title": "Vulnerabilidad cognitiva a la hipocondría: intrusiones, valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales/ cognitive vulnerability to hypochondriasis: intrusions, appraisals and dysfunctional beliefs",
      "abstract": "Hypochondriasis is a disorder characterized by the fear or belief of suffering from a serious illness based on the negative interpretation of bodily signs and symptoms. After a thorough evaluation, confirmation by a physician that the patient does not have a medical condition does not result in safe and lasting reassurance. Generally, people with hypochondriasis may experience a reduction in anxiety after a visit to the doctor, but this reduction lasts only hours or days. When another symptom occurs, anxiety reappears, and the cycle of hypochondriacal worry resumes. In addition, hypochondriasis can manifest itself in different ways. Some patients have numerous intrusive thoughts and sensations during the day that lead them to consult family, friends, the Internet, or different medical specialists to make sure they are not seriously ill or to identify the course of the disease. Other patients, on the other hand, avoid health care providers and any reference to the disease in their daily lives, so that the anxiety they seek to suppress does not increase. Hypochondriasis has also been conceptualized in cognitive models as an extreme form of health anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral proposals of hypochondriasis and health anxiety and recent research on this disorder have suggested different cognitive variables as possible risk factors for the development and maintenance of the problem. They include intrusive thoughts about possible health hazards (illness-ITs), the dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs associated with these thoughts, and dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness. Although these variables have been pointed out in the literature as vulnerability factors for hypochondriasis and health anxiety, there are hardly any studies analyzing their role in the genesis and development of the disorder, and the results obtained are not entirely conclusive either. The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the role played by these variables in hypochondriasis and health anxiety. The preliminary study provided a reliable and valid instrument to evaluate health anxiety in Spanish-speaking adults, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Study 1 explored the presence and characteristics of illness-ITs in the general population, and through this study, a new self-report instrument has been provided, the Illness Intrusive Thoughts Inventory (INPIE), to evaluate illness-ITs. Study 2 examined differences between patients with hypochondriasis and community participants in the recurrence of illness-ITs and the consequences of experiencing them. Studies 2 and 3 also evaluated the role of dysfunctional appraisals and beliefs about illness-ITs. Study 4 analyzed the importance of the family context in the adoption of dysfunctional beliefs about health/illness and thoughts. The results show that (1) the SHAI is an appropriate self-report instrument to measure health anxiety in the Spanish-speaking adult population; (2) the INPIE is an adequate self-report questionnaire to assess the frequency of illness-ITs, as well as the appraisals and control strategies associated with these thoughts; (3) illness-ITs are a universal and dimensional phenomenon; (4) dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs about illness-ITs play a significant role in the escalation from normal intrusive cognitions and their associated consequences to clinical health anxiety-related symptoms; and (5) dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness and thoughts can be acquired within the family. These results have substantial clinical implications because understanding the functioning and characteristics of some of the key elements in the genesis and development of hypochondriasis and health anxiety may improve and update the treatment protocols for these patients. La hipocondria es un trastorno caracterizado por el miedo o la creencia de padecer una enfermedad grave a partir de la interpretacion negativa de los signos y sintomas corporales. La confirmacion por parte de un medico, despues de una evaluacion exhaustiva, de que el paciente no padece una enfermedad medica, no tiene como resultado una tranquilizacion segura y duradera. Por lo general, las personas que presentan hipocondria pueden experimentar una reduccion de la ansiedad despues de visitar al medico, pero esta reduccion dura solo horas o dias. Cuando se presenta otro sintoma, la ansiedad reaparece y el ciclo de preocupacion hipocondriaca se reanuda. Ademas, la hipocondria se puede manifestar de diferentes maneras. Algunos pacientes tienen numerosos pensamientos intrusos y sensaciones durante el dia que los llevan a consultar con la familia, amigos, internet o diferentes especialistas medicos para asegurarse de que no estan gravemente enfermos o para identificar el curso de la enfermedad. Y, otros pacientes, por el contrario, evitan a los proveedores de servicios de salud y cualquier referencia a la enfermedad en su vida diaria, para que no aumente la ansiedad que buscan reprimir. La hipocondria se ha conceptualizado tambien, desde los modelos cognitivos, como la forma mas extrema de ansiedad por la salud. Las propuestas cognitivo-conductuales de la hipocondria y las investigaciones recientes en torno a este trastorno han sugerido diferentes variables cognitivas como posibles factores de riesgo para el desarrollo y mantenimiento del problema. Entre ellos, destacan: los pensamientos intrusos sobre los posibles peligros para la salud (PIEs), las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a estos pensamientos, y los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad. Aunque todas estas variables se han senalado, en la literatura cientifica, como factores de vulnerabilidad hacia la hipocondria, no existen apenas estudios en los que se analice su papel en la genesis y evolucion del trastorno, y los resultados obtenidos tampoco son del todo concluyentes. Por todo ello, la presente Tesis tiene como finalidad clarificar el rol que juegan los pensamientos intrusos, las valoraciones/interpretaciones y las creencias disfuncionales (sobre los pensamientos y sobre la salud/enfermedad) en la hipocondria y la ansiedad por la salud. El estudio preliminar proporciono un instrumento fiable y valido para evaluar la ansiedad por la salud en adultos de habla hispana, el Inventario Breve de Ansiedad por la Salud (SHAI). El Estudio 1 exploro la presencia y caracteristicas de los PIEs en la poblacion general, y a traves de este estudio se ha proporcionado un nuevo instrumento de autoinforme, el Inventario de Pensamientos Intrusos sobre la Enfermedad (INPIE), para evaluar los PIEs. El estudio 2 examino las diferencias entre los pacientes con hipocondria y los participantes de la comunidad en la recurrencia con la que se experimentaban PIEs y las consecuencias derivadas de su experimentacion. Los estudios 2 y 3 tambien evaluaron el papel de las valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs. El estudio 4 analizo la importancia del contexto familiar en la adopcion de supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos. Los resultados muestran que (1) el SHAI es un instrumento de autoinforme apropiado para medir la ansiedad por la salud en la poblacion adulta de habla hispana; (2) el INPIE es un cuestionario de autoinforme adecuado para evaluar la frecuencia de los PIEs, asi como las valoraciones y estrategias de control asociadas a estos pensamientos; (3) los PIEs son un fenomeno universal y dimensional; (4) las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs juegan un papel significativo en la escalada de los pensamientos intrusos normales y sus consecuencias funcionales a los sintomas clinicos relacionados con la ansiedad por la salud, y (5) los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos pueden adquirirse en el seno familiar. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones clinicas sustanciales, ya que la comprension del funcionamiento y las caracteristicas de algunos de los elementos clave para la genesis y el desarrollo de la hipocondria y la ansiedad para la salud puede mejorar y actualizar los protocolos de tratamiento para estos pacientes.",

The clinical feature of this type of poisoning varies from headache and nausea to more severe conditions. After recovery from the acute intoxication, neurological or behavioral problems may emerge. In 3%-40% of cases, delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome (DNS) in post CO poisoning, generally develops within few weeks after a preliminary remission from acute poisoning. Case Presentation: We report a patient with relatively suitable premorbid. He was admitted to the hospital with fire burning, co poisoning and discharged home with good general conditions and mental status by receiving normal baric oxygen 100%. later in post-operative management of skin graft he developed a fulminant neurological deficit by impaired memory and concentration, loosening of association, disorientation to place, time and person, agitation, aggression, mood labiality, urinary incontinency and encopresis, slow psychomotor retardation, false and approximate answers to questions, auditory and visual hallucination, staring and inappropriate laughing. As the patient was not responsive to neurological treatment, he was referred to psychiatric service. DNS in this patient resolved gradually during a short period of psychopharmacotherapy and supportive psychotherapy. Conclusion: CO poisoning may lead to neuropsychiatric sequel and neuroimaging changes which could be reversible.",

      "abstract": "THREE CLASSES OF CENTRAL SRBD ARE DISTINGUISHED: 1. Central sleep apnea (CSA), 2. Cheyne-Stokes Respiration as a subgroup of CSA and 3. central hypoventilation syndromes. Reduced or completely absent central respiratory drive without upper airway obstruction is the common feature of central SRBD. Hypoventilation syndromes most often occur secondary in patients with neuromuscular, pulmonary or sceletal diseases or in patients with massive obesity. In patients with hypoventilation during sleep nocturnal and exertional dyspnea and headaches are frequently reported symptoms. Excessive daytime sleepiness is the key symptom in patients with central sleep apnea syndrome. Cheyne-Stokes Respiration is frequent in heart failure patients but in many cases does not cause symptoms specific for the breathing disorder. If there are symptoms or if ambulatory recording of breathing during sleep suggests a sleep related breathing disorder, polysomnography is then performed to definitively rule out or confirm the diagnosis and to initiate treatment, if needed. The indication for treatment in asymptomatic patients with central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes Respiration may be difficult, as there are very little data concerning the long-term benefit in these patients. Symptomatic patients and those with severe central sleep apnea should be treated. Oxygen and CPAP may be effective in 20-30% of patients each. If these treatment options are ineffective, non-invasive pressure support ventilaiton can be used. In patients suffering from hypoventilation syndromes the treatment of choice is non-invasive pressure support ventilaiton combined with supplemental oxygen, if required.",

Turgid painful erections (five to seven episodes of tumescence) during the sleep hours caused pain together with burning and tingling sensations in the penis and perineal zone during the daytime hours. Swelling of the pubic and perineal area was recurrent. Sleep loss, chronic fatigue, mild anxiety, lack of concentration and decreased work occurred along with this condition. Polysomnographic findings indicated REM sleep fragmentation.

Typical onset is in infancy with a male preponderance of 4:1. Episodes such as head banging occur at sleep onset or during periods of sleep-wake transitions. Successful treatment is often difficult with scant evidence for the four typically recommended modalities: Aversion Therapy – non-punitive arousal Sleep restriction and hypnotics- Delaying sleep along with hypnotic use Clonazepam – low dose at bedtime Stimulus Substitution – rhythmic sounds or vestibular stimulations e.g. metronome/hammock. <h3>Methods</h3> Retrospective case review of 15 patients with RMD, attending a tertiary Sleep clinic from 2005–2013. <h3>Results</h3> Most common presentation – head banging (n = 9), body rolling (n = 6); or both (n = 5). Strong male preponderance (13:2); median age of presentation 7yrs (range 2yrs–13.5yrs). Majority (3) had symptom onset in infancy. Majority, (n = 13) had RMD at sleep onset and then repeatedly during sleep-wake transitions. Two, did not have RMD at sleep onset. Comorbidities: Four had behavioural difficulties like ADHD and three had mild to severe learning disability. Aversion therapy was considered appropriate for 6 patients of whom 3 showed complete or significant (&gt;50%) resolution of symptoms. Clonazepam (for 6–16 weeks only) was considered appropriate in 8 – only one showed significant resolution of symptoms. Sleep onset RMD persisted in 3, although symptoms during sleep resolved. Stimulus substitution used in 3 with minor beneficial effect. Hammock use led to complete resolution of symptoms in one child. Sleep hygiene advice and RMD education was the only intervention in 3 patients with significant improvement of RMD. In all children motivation to improve affected outcome. <h3>Conclusion</h3> RMD is a conditioned behaviour and treatment is likely to have the maximum chance of success if the child is motivated to change and an appropriate behavioural strategy is used. Randomised treatment trials are urgently needed for this distressing condition.",

      "title": "Promoting sleep and other simple, non-pharmacological interventions for preventing and treating ICU Delirium: case report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Delirium is common among critically ill patients and it prolongs the length of ICU and hospital stays and is associated with worse outcomes, including cognitive impairment and increased mortality. No medications have been shown to have a consistent therapeutic benefit. Delirium is a form of brain dysfunction characterized by the acute onset of fluctuating mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. These features are also seen in states of acute sleep deprivation. It is believed that the state of delirium contributes to disrupted sleep just as sleep deprivation is considered a modifiable risk factor for delirium. Improving sleep conditions and other nonpharmacologic interventions to promote sleep may be an underused approach to preventing and treating delirium in critical illness.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia: a brief synopsis Beck and Emery (1985) described a model of anxiety in which an 'emergency response system' is activated by the organism's perception of danger. The system evolved to abet survival, in the face of actual physical danger, by preparing the organism for aggression or escape (fight, flight) or inhibiting it from sudden movement (faint, freeze). But the 'emergency response' may itself alarm the individual, as it generates disturbing body sensations and transient cognitive dysfunctions that may themselves be perceived as sources of danger: racing heart, feelings of dizziness or weakness, a sense of unreality, other discomforts. When the emergency response is activated, as in a panic attack, fear and anxiety accelerate rapidly, and rational thinking is undermined. The terrifying experience tends to increase apprehensiveness, predisposing the sufferer to experience more symptoms. A vicious spiral of fearful expectations and frightening symptoms is established.",

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "title": "New Strategies Show Promise for Concussion",
      "abstract": "Figure: concussion, treatment, brain injury, supplements, exercise, cooling, irritability, headache, nausea, insomnia, forgetfulness, light sensitivity, vertigo, blurry vision, brain fog, symptomsFigureFigureResearchers are studying supplements, exercise, and cooling to treat brain injury Irritability, headache, nausea, light sensitivity, forgetfulness, insomnia. We tell parents to look for these post-concussive symptoms. (They are also what emergency physicians experience after too many night shifts.) Vertigo, brain fog, blurry vision. Yes, it is a long list, and every concussion is different. Difficulty finding words. Yes, this might be difficult to discern from baseline in a 16-year-old. Rest, limit activities that make symptoms worse, avoid too much screen time, and don't return to play until cleared. Sorry, there is no definitive treatment. Concussions have myriad symptoms and can vary greatly in duration and severity. Once dismissed as a temporary affliction with a veneer of masculinity and toughness (“He got his bell rung!”), concussion is now seen as a major public health challenge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 2.8 million head injury ED visits occurred in the United States in 2013. (MMWR Surveill Summ. 2017;66[9]; https://bit.ly/3JgO8qR.) Nearly 300,000 of these (10%) affect children and adolescents who sustain concussions during sports. The pendulum has swung in recent years about awareness and diagnosis. Watch even one quarter of an NFL game and you are likely to see at least one player escorted into the blue tent for a neurological assessment by a physician. We've also made progress with prevention, especially in children under 17 playing contact sports, resulting in 32 percent fewer ED visits for sports-related head injuries between 2012 and 2018. (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2020;69[27]:870; https://bit.ly/3JfnvSX.) We encounter patients in the ED at particularly uncertain and challenging points in the gamut of concussion pathology. We recognize that concussions usually aren't difficult to diagnose but are hard to predict and nearly impossible to treat, with nearly as many proposed treatments and studies as there are symptoms. The only firm recommendation until recently, however, was physical and mental rest. Recent evidence has questioned this beyond the short term, and luckily, there are promising, easily accessible alternatives. Supplements It would be convenient if there were a cheap, readily available, and safe nutritional supplement for concussion, but the evidence hasn't identified one, despite what marketers would like you to believe. Certain supplements—omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins C, D, and E, curcumin (found in turmeric), resveratrol, melatonin, and creatine—have been studied but not shown benefit in humans with concussions. Future investigations may change this: Two clinical trials are starting, one on the effect of omega-3 and vitamin D plus creatine on persistent post-concussion symptoms and one on melatonin in acute pediatric concussion. A small, randomized trial of N-acetylcysteine in older adults with mild traumatic brain injury also recently demonstrated improvement in post-concussion symptom scores seven and 30 days after injury. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2022;93[5]:644; http://bit.ly/3R0yNwn.) Sleep disturbances are common after concussion, and many symptoms (like trouble concentrating and irritability) mirror those of sleep deprivation, so perhaps a sleep aid can help treat concussion. At the very least, melatonin is unlikely to cause harm in post-concussive insomniacs. Exercise Wouldn't it be great if a simple intervention like moderate exercise could help speed recovery? Good news! Moderately convincing evidence has shown that the early initiation of targeted exercise can make a positive difference. The physiological concept here is that aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain, which in turn helps with oxygen delivery and producing brain-derived neurotrophic factor to stimulate neuron growth and enhance neuroplasticity. Several studies demonstrated the benefit of post-concussive exercise using the hypothesis that such neuro-processes could help the brain recover after concussive injury. One study was even titled “Exercise is Medicine for Concussion.” (Curr Sports Med Rep. 2018;17[8]:262; http://bit.ly/3j4K0PV.) The old post-concussion return-to-sport protocols recommend a week or more of strict rest, but the new consensus is that exercise can start almost immediately if done with constraints. The goal is subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise, which means a concussed athlete tests her tolerance on a treadmill, stationary bike, or similarly safe activity by tracking her heart rate. She dials back if symptoms worsen until her heart rate is roughly 10 percent slower and then exercises for about 30 minutes. This work demonstrated that this regimen can speed recovery by four days or more, at least in adolescents. (JAMA Pediatr. 2019;173[4]:319; http://bit.ly/3DcY2WB.) Beyond aerobic exercise, there may also be a benefit of physical therapy interventions, in certain patients at least. This might be considered in those with vestibular symptoms. A systematic review published earlier this year screened more than 7000 studies to find eight high-quality investigations (including the two above [Curr Sports Med Rep and JAMA Pediatr] from well-known concussion researcher John J. Leddy, MD, from the State University of New York at Buffalo) into the benefits of physical therapy interventions for adolescent and young adult athletes post-concussion. (Int J Sports Phys Ther. 2023;18[1]:26; http://bit.ly/3ZDRJni.) They concluded that multimodal approaches to post-concussion rehabilitation, in addition to moderate aerobic exercise, were likely beneficial for youths and adolescents with concussion. These supplemental recovery-enhancing modalities may include coordination and balance activities, visualization techniques, and cervical spine and vestibular rehabilitation. Stimuli Management What if the best way to treat concussions is to confine the concussed individual in a dark noiseless room? That sounds just awful. But, as we know, strict stimuli mitigation—no exercise, school, screens, or fun at all—was once recommended for concussed patients. Fortunately for this generation of youngsters, the treatment is no longer worse than the condition, at least not by such a degree. Recently published guidelines allow for gradual increase in typical activities such as texting, reading, and screen time as soon as 24 hours after a concussion as long as these do not exacerbate symptoms. (JMIR Pediatr Parent. 2022;5[2]:e36317; http://bit.ly/3ZEcr6l; CJEM. 2021;24[1]:12; http://bit.ly/415ECw2.) We know that bright lights and loud noises can be irritating to just about everyone and even more so to those with head injuries. Without much evidence other than common sense, guidelines also give a soft recommendation for ear plugs or noise-cancelling headphones and sunglasses. Thermal Treatment What about a treatment that could be started immediately after head trauma to prevent or mitigate concussion symptoms? Our response is not as frosty as you might expect. A recent study examined immediate head and neck cooling for concussed ice hockey players. (J Neurotrauma. 2022; doi: 10.1089/neu.2022.0248; https://bit.ly/3iVzjiF.) We know that increasing temperature after an injury can be deleterious, causing more inflammation and cellular damage, which is why we ice sprained ankles and run cool water over burns.Figure: Two football players were imaged before the football season; the concussed player was imaged again within a week of his concussion, the control player again at the end of the season. Colored areas show cortical and subcortical regions of significantly greater activation in the concussed player compared with the nonconcussed one.The researchers in this study tested whether the same principle might apply to injured brains and used a protocol of 45 minutes of immediate cooling with a head and neck cooling cap to measure its impact on time to return to play. The investigators enrolled adult male hockey players (average age 26) over five years with 132 sport-related concussions, and found those in the cooling group returned to play in nine days while those receiving standard post-concussion care went back in 13 days, a four-day difference quite similar to what was seen in the subthreshold exercise study. This is promising, but it would be challenging to replicate broadly because the cooling cap is more technologically nuanced than an ice pack. The authors said it uses a high-powered portable cooling system with a circulating coolant maintained at 0°C that flows through a silicone cap with an insulated neoprene cover. It doesn't seem far-fetched to have such systems in the NFL's blue tent, but it would be a stretch to have them on the sidelines of tens of thousands high school fields. The cap was also applied extremely quickly, only 10 minutes after injury in the study, so teen sports would need it on the sidelines, and coaches and parents would need to make the decision to use it stat. Maybe delayed cooling could be beneficial too, but that is unlikely: You can't unboil an egg. Collision. Clock cleaning. Header. Knock out stage. The vernacular of head trauma is omnipresent in sports and so are concussions in our health care system. There is still much to be done to wrap our heads around this challenging condition, but there have been advances, and we think we can look forward to more. Consensus on Concussion The International Conference on Concussion in Sport was expected to release a consensus statement this spring summarizing the current literature that could be used to prevent, detect, and manage sport-related concussions, but it was not available at press time.

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that rapid eye movement sleep (REM) supports the consolidation of extinction memory. REM is disrupted in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and REM abnormalities after traumatic events increase the risk of developing PTSD. Therefore, it was hypothesized that abnormal REM in trauma-exposed individuals may pave the way for PTSD by interfering with the processing of extinction memory. In addition, PTSD patients display reduced vagal activity. Vagal activity contributes to the strengthening of memories, including fear extinction memory, and recent studies show that the role of vagus in memory processing extends to memory consolidation during sleep. Therefore, it is plausible that reduced vagal activity during sleep in trauma-exposed individuals may be an additional mechanism that impairs extinction memory consolidation. However, to date, the contribution of sleep vagal activity to the consolidation of extinction memory or any emotional memory has not been investigated.",

      "abstract": "A series of studies with humans as well as experiments carried out on animals could show that physical exercise leads to temporary hypoalgesia. Reduced sensitivity to pain is not only demonstrable after long-distance exercise (such as marathon run) but also after intensive physical exercise on a laboratory ergometer. Pain threshold elevation is most pronounced during maximal exertion, but hypoalgesia remains present also after exercise is stopped demonstrating that a systemic analgetic effect is induced by the exercise process. Pre-exercise pain threshold level is returned to approximately 60 minutes after the exercise. The cause of the exercise-induced hypoalgesia is probably an activation of central pain inhibitory mechanisms by the \"stimulus\" of physical exercise (stimulation- or stress-induced analgesia). Central pain inhibitory systems are thereby triggered by the stimulation of afferent nerve endings (group III and IV) in the skeletal muscle. The same trigger mechanism also plays a role as a release stimulus for hormones such for beta-endorphin which is increased under physical exercise. Plasma-beta-endorphin is probably not directly involved in the exercise-induced hypoalgesia but is rather a \"marker\" for the activating of central analgesia mechanisms. Stress-induced hypoalgesia plays also a role in the coronary heart disease. The activation of endogenous analgetic mechanisms leads to a part of the myocardial ischaemia provoked by exercise being silent under exercise. Completely asymptomatic myocardial ischaemia patients display a generalized hypoalgesia which is demonstrable independent of an exertion stimulus and which indicates a central set-point change in the antinociceptive system.",

There was marked restlessness, distractibility and an inability to concentrate for more than a few seconds at a time. The affected children showed an apparent compulsive need to touch every object which they saw, and to suck or chew them. Outbursts of aggressive and irresponsible behaviour occurred frequently, and the patients seemed to be incapable of responding to reprimand or chastisement for longer than a few minutes.

This is because certain of the early symptoms of the disease that they may have heard described on radio or television, or read about in magazines, have a superficial resemblance to banal, everyday experiences. To lie on an arm or to sit awkwardly with legs crossed at the knee for too long causes temporary numbness, pins and needles, and even weak, ness, as everyone is aware. Many people do not have perfect balance between the movements of the two eyes so that, particularly when tired, vision may become blurred or double for a moment as the eyes drift apart, clearing at once on blinking or rubbing the eyes.

      "abstract": "Background COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread psychosocial distress. In addition to pandemic associated psychological distress, there is increasing evidence to suggest direct effects of the COVID- 19 virus itself and the subsequent host immunologic response on Central Nervous System manifesting in the form of wide range of neuropsychiatric complications in both acute and post recovery phase. Neuropsychiatric manifestations The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as “long Covid,” is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. Psychoneuroimmunology of COVID-19 Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. Role of psychiatrist Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. Management The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. Conclusion Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term. Although the mechanisms to neuropsychiatric complications is still under study, the better understanding will not only augment screening of at-risk individuals but also help in prevention and management of these neuropsychiatric complications.",

There is no weakness of the affected muscles, and the sufferer is more often than not a woman of middle age. The movements usually start in the muscles around the eye, and in time may spread to all the muscles on one side of the face. Each twitch is over in a flash and may be rapidly repeated for as long as a minute before gradually fading away. An attack will appear for no reason and once it starts cannot be suppressed. Emotion plays little or no part in the disorder and it may even start up during sleep. A bout is sometimes provoked by strong voluntary contraction. For instance, a request to shut the eyes tightly is sufficient, in most patients, to bring on a bout of twitches.",

It can rarely be induced by some drugs, including zolpidem. We present a video report of a patient with a 1-year history of SRED caused by zolpidem causing important repercussions in the sleep structure and life quality. The night eating episodes ceased promptly with discontinuation of zolpidem. Upon the follow-up, the sleep structure improved and the daily consequences disappeared. As in few reported cases of zolpidem-induced SRED, our patient was suffering from the parasomnia for a long time before the diagnosis. Active exclusion of symptoms suggestive of SRED in patients under zolpidem treatment can avoid the deleterious effect of the sleep disorder.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances, including not being able to fall asleep easily/difficulty falling asleep, waking up frequently, or waking up too early and being unable to fall asleep again/resume sleep are diagnosed as insomnia if they cause significant disruption to daily life and are not caused by other sleep disorders such as pain or sleep apnea. Although insomnia is not considered a serious life-threatening condition, it has not only a high prevalence rate but also a high recurrence rate and tends to become chronic. Chronic insomnia patients tend to show common behavioral and cognitive patterns, typical of which are worrying about not being able to fall or stay asleep, excessive awakening because of this worry, limiting and reducing daytime activities or attempting to stay in bed for long periods to compensate for lack of sleep. These cognitive and behavioral characteristics are important contributing factors for the continuation of insomnia. To date, the most popular and effective treatment option/approach recommended by experts for insomnia is cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT for insomnia consists of the following three non-pharmaceutical treatment elements: 1) behavioral elements such as stimulus control therapy, sleep restriction therapy, and muscle relaxation, 2) cognitive elements, and 3) educational elements focusing on sleep hygiene. However, there are barriers to insomnia patients receiving this treatment including accessibility and cost, despite the abundance of evidence demonstrating their effectiveness. Recently, online CBT for insomnia has become available as an alternative, and its emergence is providing a solution to the barriers to access.",

Data Sources: Revision of the relevant medical literature, research in “MEDLINE” for the period between 1976 and 2004. Textbook chapters were also consulted. Summary: The sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a breathing disorder during the sleep characterized by partial prolonged obstruction of the upper airway and/or intermittent complete obstruction, which interrupts the normal breathing ventilation and sleep standards. The difficulties of gas exchange occurring during sleep constitute a spectrum of diseases which varies, in increasing severity, from primary snoring to sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome with severe complications and death risk. Conclusions: During the pediatric routine clinic visit, an item of the anamnesis that should be always present is whether the child snores during the night; in case a history of snoring is found, a more detailed anamnesis, mainly with regard to the existence of signs and/or symptoms of difficult breathing, must be carried out.",

Stroke involving the insula, can manifest with cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial injury that may be potential cause of sudden death and carry poor long-term prognosis. Contralateral hemihyperhidrosis may be a manifestation of large hemispheric strokes with involvement of the opercular and insular cortex and may be an indicator of poor prognosis.The most common autonomic manifestation of frontal or temporal limbic seizures is cardiac arrhythmia, particularly ictal tachycardia; they may also. produce ictal bradycardia and asystole. Hypothalamic involvement typically manifests with disturbances of circadian rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle, and thermoregulation. Brainstem lesions, particularly those affecting the medulla, manifests with several autonomic disturbances including baroreflex failure, neurogenic hypertension, respiratory dysrhythmias, and gastrointestinal dysmotility.",

      "abstract": "Paraschemazia is characterized by distortions of body image, and has been observed in neurological disorders (epilepsies, migraine, and non-dominant cortical lesions), retinal damage, and hallucinogenic drug use. This complex symptom cluster of subjective and objective perceptual abnormalities forms an essential feature of Todd's Alice in Wonderland syndrome. This neuropsychiatric manifestation must be phenomenologically differentiated from hallucinations, illusions, and agnosias. Herein we report a patient with paraschemazia that occurred during the ictal phase of temporal lobe epilepsy; the patient was referred to the department of psychiatry due to symptoms of transient intense fear and abnormal perceptions. We also discuss the diagnostic difficulty and phenomenological implications associated with this rare phenomenon. A 45-year-old female presented with brief episodes (30-45 s) of sensory distortion, during which the faces and limbs of other people and her own appeared distorted (e.g. protruding eyes, elongated nose, and oval or square head). The episodes of sensory distortion were associated with intense fear and were followed by loss of consciousness for 5 min. She had been experiencing these episodes since the age of 12 years and responded poorly to several antiepileptic medications. 3-Tesla MRI performed using a complex partial seizure protocol showed altered signal intensity and volume loss in the right hippocampus, suggestive of right mesial temporal sclerosis. Neuropsychological assessment showed impaired sustained attention, working memory, and verbal and visual learning and memory, suggestive of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal lobe deficits. She improved in response to a combination of levetiracetam and clobazam, and was seizure free at the 2-year follow-up.",

Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes.

      "title": "Low-Dose Clozapine for an Adolescent with TBI-Related Fregoli Delusions",
      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration. He is the youngest of 3 sibs emanating from nonconsanguenious monogamous family with no genetic load of neuropsychiatric disorders. Unremarkable developmental trajectories. Distinguished scholastic achievement. No history of smoking or illicit drug use. No medical comorbidities.

He was faring well following this accident, as reported by parents, apart from occasional complaints of low-grade headaches and giddiness. Lately, he started to voice out non-sensical talk that the man who hit him by the car is disguising and morphing in the bodies of neighbours, doorkeeper and servants, stalking him in order to kill him. He was panic-stricken by the idea. Fragmented sleep. Lost appetite. Dropped from school attainment. He was seen by a private psychiatrist, a diagnosis of psychotic depression was entertained, and fluoxetine (Prozac",

      "title": "Design of an Assistive Device for Older Age People Suffering from Essential Tremor",
      "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is a nerve disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking, or tremors, in different parts and on different sides of the body. Areas affected often include the hands, arms, head, larynx (voice box), tongue, and chin. The lower body is rarely affected. ET is not a life-threatening disorder, unless it prevents a person from caring for him or herself. Essential tremor is characterised by rhythmic shaking that occurs during voluntary movement or while holding a position against gravity. The two types of tremor include: Action tremor – a voluntary movement such as lifting a cup to one's mouth and Postural tremor – a voluntary holding of a position against gravity such as reaching or extending one's hand or arm. Most people with essential tremor experience both postural and action tremor. Most people are able to live normal lives with this condition -- although they may find everyday activities like eating, dressing, or writing difficult. It is only when the tremors become severe that they actually cause disability. So, the aim of this project is to design an assistive device for older age people suffering from essential disorder which can be able to nullify the tremor produced in the hand with maximum percentage of efficiency and ergonomically designed for easy use. The main objective of the project is focusing on the design of an intelligent device that can recognize the tremor automatically by differentiating the frequency at normal stage and at the shaking stage in order to accomplish the neutralizing effect in the shortest possible time",

      "title": "Blunt Force Trauma",
      "abstract": "Abstract Blunt injuries are caused by mechanical force resulting in damage to the affected tissues mainly due to compression, traction, torsion, and shear stresses. The impact is induced either by a moving blunt object hitting the body or the victim's movement against an obstacle having a hard surface. In forensic practice, injuries from blunt force are often seen after criminal assaults where they may be inflicted, for instance, by fist blows or kicking. They not only occur in physical child abuse and other kinds of domestic violence, in traffic, sports, and industrial accidents but also in falls brought about by the victims themselves for various reasons (e.g., in drunken, infirm, or sick persons or in suicides jumping from a height). On skin, blunt traumatization produces abrasions, contusions (bruises), and lacerations. In some cases, a patterned configuration helps to determine characteristic features of the causative instrument. Within the body, blunt traumatization may be followed by bone fractures and laceration/rupture of vessels and organs with concomitant blood loss and potential failure of vital functions. The article shortly describes and illustrates the most important manifestations of blunt force injuries (including head trauma) under reconstructive aspects and from the medicolegal point of view.",

      "abstract": "Side effects play a significant role in the selection of drugs to be used in panic disorder/agoraphobia whose polyphobic symptomatology often includes a suspiciousness about taking drugs and a fear of undesired side effects which may lead to the refusal of treatment. The safety, side effects and patients' acceptance of alprazolam and imipramine versus placebo were evaluated in 1168 subjects with panic disorder/agoraphobia who had been enrolled in the second phase of the Upjohn World Wide Panic Study. Side effects that worsened over baseline to a greater extent with alprazolam than with imipramine and placebo were sedation, fatigue/weakness, memory problems, ataxia and slurred speech. In the imipramine group blurred vision, tachycardia/palpitations, insomnia, sleep disturbance, excitement/nervousness, malaise, dizziness/faintness, headache, nausea/vomiting and decrease in appetite were worse than in the other groups. In the placebo group the anxious symptoms were most prominent. The highest level of compliance was shown in the alprazolam-treated group and the lowest in the placebo-treated group. Strong predictors of side effects were not observed. If a side effect profile is known, it will be easier for a clinician to choose the right drug and the appropriate management by taking into account compliance, safety and efficacy in each patient under treatment. Further information about side effects in long-term maintenance treatment would be of great clinical pertinence in ensuring safety and enhancing patients' quality of life.",

Primary headaches have no identifiable underlying cause whilst secondary headaches have an underlying pathology. Delirium is a more specific term for an acute episode of fluctuating altered mental status. Altered mental status may herald the onset of a life-threatening or of a reversible condition. Symptoms of weakness include difficulty with activity of daily livings or problems with gait and loss of balance.

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "title": "1199 A Novel Approach to REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Safety Measures",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia occurring during REM sleep, characterized by loss of normal REM sleep atonia and dream enactment behaviors. Behaviors include yelling, punching, kicking, and complex or violent movements causing a fall out of bed and result in injury to the patient or their partner. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends maintaining a safe environment for patients. For patients with uncontrolled severe symptoms, recommendations include having partners sleep separately from patients. This may not be practical for small living spaces, may result in loss of intimacy between partners, or delay response to injuries caused by RBD. We present the case of a patient devised novel approach to keep their partner safe while maintaining close-proximity while sleeping. Report of case(s) A 63-year-old man with a past medical history of moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on CPAP presented to sleep clinic with symptoms of dream enactment. Behaviors included yelling, punching, and kicking. He had kicked his wife and had fallen out of bed resulting in an injury. He underwent a polysomnogram that showed REM sleep without atonia and was diagnosed with RBD. He was advised on safety precautions and started high dose melatonin. Clonazepam was added, but symptoms were not eliminated. He and his wife did not want to sleep separately, so he pushed two twin beds together and separated them with a large sheet of plexiglass. He reported he had hit the plexiglass many times without inuring himself and prevented injury to his wife. The patient’s wife was able to safely sleep near him which helped maintain their sense of intimacy. Conclusion We report a novel approach to create a safe environment for patients with RBD while maintaining partner proximity and intimacy. As patients struggle with progressive neurodegenerative disease, it is important to have their partners nearby overnight when patients are at risk for falling and self-injury. With two twin beds separated by plexiglass, a patient can safely sleep next to their partner and significantly reduce the risk of injuring them. This may be a useful technique for patients with severe, refractory symptoms of RBD. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population and are associated with adverse effects such as motor vehicle collisions, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized into three groups: people with problems falling asleep, people with behavior and movement disturbances during sleep, and people with excessive daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is defined by difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or both, resulting in daytime consequences. Insomnia is diagnosed by history and is treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without medications. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in patients acting out their dreams with potentially harmful effects. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with melatonin or clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome is defined by an urge to move the legs that worsens when at rest. Restless legs syndrome is treated with gabapentin or dopamine agonists, depending on the severity. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep hallucinations. Diagnosis is suggested by the history and can be confirmed with polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test the following day. Narcolepsy is treated with behavior modifications and medications such as stimulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sodium oxybate, and pitolisant. Obstructive sleep apnea may be diagnosed in patients with excessive snoring and witnessed apneas and can be diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Treatment consists of positive airway pressure therapy while sleeping in conjunction with weight loss.",

In general it may be stated that hypocalcemic states are manifested clinically by signs and symptoms of tetany. The symptom complex of tetany is now less common than in former times when rachitic tetany was the most frequent cause of convulsions in infancy. It was well described in the older literature. The manifestations consist of central and peripheral nervous system symptoms, irritability often alternating with lethargy, nystagmus and strabismus, contractions and pain in the muscles of the face with half moon eyes, carp mouth, trismus and convulsions Edema, most marked in the hands, feet and around the eyes is often observed. Confirmatory signs of tetany may be elicited by special methods of examination. Chvostek9s sign, jerking of the facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped, is a sign of tetany in children from one month to two years of age. It is unreliable in newborn infants, in older children and adults since in them it may be present normally. When the facial muscles are in spasm with manifest tetany it can seldom be elicited. The peroneal sign consists of dorsiflexion and abduction of the foot on tapping the peroneal nerve on the lateral surface of the fibula just before the knee. Trousseau9s sign is carpopedal spasm induced by pressure applied for some time over the upper arm or leg. Erb9s sign, or increased electrical excitability of the peripheral nerves to the galvanic current, was the most reliable proof of tetany in the days before blood chemical analyses were available. The procurement of electrical reactions is such a time consuming procedure that they are seldom sought for now.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling or remaining asleep with associated daytime consequences. It is among the most common clinical complaints in the general adult population. The prevalence is significantly higher in people with psychiatric disorders. Insomnia in psychiatric patients may be affected by particular disorders, the illness severity, and the treatment approaches. Mood and anxiety disorders are especially likely to be comorbid with insomnia; however, many other psychiatric disorders increase the probability of sleep disturbances. Insomnia frequently is the first symptom heralding an episode of depression, and it may continue as a residual symptom following the resolution of the mood disturbance. Many different sedating substances and medications have been used with the intention of improving sleep. The insomnia treatment medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration comprise a variety of benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics and a single selective melatonin receptor agonist. The prescribing guidelines of the recently approved medications have no implied limitation on their duration of use and specify whether they are indicated for sleep onset and maintenance. There are significant safety concerns or inadequate efficacy evidence for the treatment of insomnia with many alternative pharmacologic strategies, including herbal preparations, over-the-counter antihistamines, and the off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Advances in understanding the regulation of the sleep–wake cycle now are leading to new pharmacologic targets to treat insomnia and related sleep disorders.",

Improvement is commonly preceded by a transient worsening of the unwanted behaviours, creating the initial number of days of treatment most difficult. Before embarking on management, it's better for fogeys to line clear expectations for night-time behaviour (‘You have to be compelled to keep in your bed overnight’) and do a fast check for desires (eg rest room or drink) before lights out. folks will then make a choice from ‘controlled comforting’ (see above), ‘extinction’ or ‘bedtime pass’ technique.",

Medications are sometimes effective, and thalamic deep brain stimulation is an effective treatment for patients with severe disabling tremor. A variety of tremors are associated parkinsonian syndromes, including rest and action tremors, which may respond to anti-Parkinson medications but also can improve with deep brain stimulation of the thalamus or subthalamic nucleus. Cerebellar dysfunction can also result in a variety of tremors present at rest and with action and intention. A large number of other rare tremors have been poorly characterized, most notably orthostatic tremor and primary writing tremor.",

We have here to deal with a dual consciousness, a knowledge of states apparently incompatible with, and distinct from, each other. We are all familiar with states of acute mental disturbance where there is difficulty in making the patient understand what we are saying—not necessarily difficult or involved questions, but simple queries relating to what we think are matters in the patient‘s consciousness, such as it is. Here it is doubtful if the patients really understand what we are saying, though there is no doubt about their hearing the question, e.g. , they may hear the question but the reply will be merely the reiteration of some particular delusion which has no connection with the question, or there need not be any reply at all, as if we were addressing them in a foreign language which they did not understand, or as if what is said to them has a different meaning from what is intended.",

      "abstract": "Delayed awakening from anaesthesia remains one of the biggest challenges that involve anaesthesiologists. Most commonly, delayed awakening is due to drugs effects persistence. 1 The time taken to emerge to fully consciousness is affected by patient factors, anaesthetic factors, duration of surgery and painful stimulation. Non pharmacological causes may have serious sequel; thus recognising these organic conditions is important. 2 Unexpected delayed emergence after the use of general anaesthesia has a plethora of causes. 3 The most common cause for delayed awakening following anaesthesia is medications and anaesthetic agents used in the perioperative period. There may be an over dose of medications. Emergence from anaesthesia depends on the tissue uptake of the drug, average concentration used and the duration of exposure. Certain underlying metabolic disorders such as hypoglycaemia, severe hyperglycaemia, electrolyte imbalance especially hyponatremia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, central cholinergic syndrome, chronic hypertension, liver disease, hypoalbuminemia, uraemia and severe hypothyroidism may also be responsible for delayed recovery after anaesthesia. Preoperative medications such as opioids and sedatives and hypothermia can further interfere with postoperative recovery. Intraoperative cerebral hypoxia, haemorrhage, embolism or thrombosis also can manifest as delayed awakening from anaesthesia. The ultimate goal of treatment is to find the cause and treat the cause, but primary management is to maintain airway, breathing and circulation.",

      "abstract": "How often has this scenario happened? You are driving at night behind a car that has bright light-emitting diode (LED) taillights. When looking directly at the taillights, the light is not blurry, but when glancing at other objects, a trail of lights appears, known as a phantom array. The reason for this trail of lights might not be what you expected: it is not due to glare, degradation of eyesight, or astigmatism. The culprit may be the flickering of the LED lights caused by pulse-width modulating (PWM) drive circuitry. Actually, many LED taillights flicker on and off at frequencies between 200 and 500 Hz, which is too fast to notice when the eye is not in rapid motion. However, during a rapid eye movement (saccade), the images of the LED lights appear in different positions on the retina, causing a trail of images to be perceived (Figure 1). This disturbance of vision may not occur with all LED taillights because some taillights keep a constant current through the LEDs. However, when there is a PWM current through the LEDs, the biological effect of the light flicker may become noticeable during the eye saccade.",

      "abstract": "Characteristic of the intimate relationship between sleep and epilepsy are an increase in IEA in nonREM sleep and a decrease in REM sleep, in both generalized and partial epilepsies. The morphology of epileptiform discharges may also be affected by sleep, with a change or breakdown of the generalized pattern in generalized epilepsy, but a better definition of sharp waves in partial epilepsy, during nonREM sleep. One notes a predilection for certain types of epilepsy to occur in sleep, such as benign focal epilepsy of childhood, or to occur shortly after awakening (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). Epilepsy may disrupt the sleep architecture with an increase in light sleep and a decrease in deep sleep, and an increase in awake time after sleep onset. Sleep is an important activator of IEA and is of value both in the routine EEG evaluation of epilepsy as well as in more prolonged studies used in epilepsy monitoring units.",

Here we report an atypical case of an adolescent with episodes of \"sleep-related vocalization\" occurring every night, especially during the first part of the night. The patient had moderate mental retardation and a dysfunctional dysphonia; she had no recollection of the episodes and complained exclusively of mild excessive daytime sleepiness. A video polysomnography recording documented two typical manifestations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, characterized by the persistence of slow waves and without any electroencephalographic or breathing abnormalities. The quantified analysis of the acoustic features while confirming the rhythmic and stable characteristic of the sound suggests the involvement of the vocal fold vibration on its production. We interpreted these episodes as an atypical form of NREM parasomnia. A possible influence of the otolaryngologic abnormality can be hypothesized.",

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive episodes of sleeprelated upper airway obstructions, which usually are associated with oxygen desaturation. A special situation of abnormal sleep disorders in the elderly is degenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), and prion diseases all pose different challenges and disruptions to sleep.

Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

      "abstract": "There are immediate and long-lasting harmful consequences to the nervous system when infants experience severe or repetitive pain. These effects are especially significant in preterm infants, who are vulnerable to neurological damage during this critical time of neurodevelopment. Painful experiences may cause structural and physiological changes within the nervous system. Repeated painful procedures may result in decreased pain thresholds and hypersensitivity to pain. Immediate harmful effects of pain include physiologic instability and increased incidence of serious complications such as intraventricular hemorrhage. Painful stressors may lead to sleep disturbances, feeding problems, and inability to self-regulate. Long-term effects of pain may include altered pain perception, chronic pain syndromes, and somatic complaints. Repetitive pain in the preterm infant may be associated with attention deficit disorders, learning disorders, and behavioral problems in later childhood. Nursing involvement with pain management is crucial to achieve positive health outcomes for high-risk infants and older children and adults who have experienced repetitive or severe pain as infants.",

These symptoms are attributable to disruption of vestibular processing in the temporoparietal cortex or associated limbic structures. Neurological dysfunction at high altitude is usually ascribed to high altitude cerebral edema or acute mountain sickness. However, transient neurological symptoms occur abruptly at more extreme altitudes, often following vigorous exertion, without overt altitude-induced prodromes. These symptoms may be caused by intense neuronal discharge or neuronal synchronization as a feature of epileptic discharges or cortical spreading depression. Transient high altitude neurological dysfunction should be recognized as a separate complication of extreme altitude, distinct from high altitude cerebral edema.",

Controversy surrounds the definition of delirium, because its manifestations are pleomorphic and its mechanisms poorly understood. The American Psychiatric Association, in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), emphasizes four key features (Table 60.1). The first of these is disturbance of consciousness. Patients with delirium characteristically are less aware of their surroundings and have difficulty focusing, sustaining, or shifting attention. They become easily distracted and have difficulty following commands or maintaining a conversation. Accompanying delirium is an impairment of cognition and perception not attributable to prior or progressing dementia. This is manifested by memory problems, disorientation, misperceptions, hallucinations, and language problems (e.g., dysnomia, dysgraphia). The course of delirium is acute (defined as hours to days) and fluctuating (patients may be lucid during morning rounds yet combative or confused at night). Finally, delirium in an individual patient has one or more underlying medical etiologies.1 KeywordsFemoral Neck FractureNeuroleptic Malignant SyndromeAcute Confusional StateDelirious PatientElderly Medical PatientThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are central features of many movement disorders, exacerbating motor and non-motor symptoms and impairing quality of life. Understanding these disturbances to sleep is clinically important and may further our understanding of the underlying movement disorder. This review evaluates the current anatomical and neurochemical understanding of normal sleep and the recognised primary sleep disorders. In addition, we undertook a systematic review of the evidence for disruption to sleep across multiple movement disorders. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has emerged as the most reliable prodromal biomarker for the alpha synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, often preceding motor symptom onset by several years. Abnormal sleep has also been described for many other movement disorders, but further evidence is needed to determine whether this is a primary or secondary phenotypic component of the underlying condition. Medication used in the treatment of motor symptoms also affects sleep and can aggravate or cause certain sleep disorders. Within the context of movement disorders, there is also some suggestion of a shared underlying mechanism for motor and sleep pathophysiology, with evidence implicating thalamic and brainstem structures and monoaminergic neurotransmission. This review highlights the need for an understanding of normal and abnormal sleep within the movement disorder clinic, an ability to screen for specific causes of poor sleep and to treat sleep disturbance to improve quality of life. Key sleep disorders also act as important biomarkers and have implications in diagnosis, prognosis and the development of future therapies.",

The biological effects of vibrations depend on the frequency, amplitude, and duration of the vibration. The most unfavorable are those with a frequency of 100-250 and an amplitude of .005 mm. General vibrations over a prolonged period of time lead to a typical syndrome of vegetative dysfunction and angiodystonic effects on a neurological basis. In the cardiovascular system, these effects are normally in the form of spastic reactions and perinephritis. The genital system function is particularly sensitive to vibrative disruptions, increasing with the frequency of the vibrations (such as with vehicle operators). Menstrual dysfunction is the most common of such disruptions. The cardiac, nervous, and muscular types of anomalies are well documented. What is now encouraged is research into prophylatic measures to prevent such disruptions.",

      "title": "Pain Is An Uncomfortable Sensation",
      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable sensation that indicates that the body is damaged or threatened with injury. Pain starts at special pain receptors that are found all over the body. These pain receptors transmit messages as electrical impulses along nerves to the spinal cord and then upward to the brain. Sometimes the signal when it reaches the spinal cord elicits a reflex response. When this happens, the signal is immediately sent back by the motor nerve to the site of pain, encouraging the muscles to tighten. An example of a reflex reaction is an immediate withdrawal reaction after something very hot is inadvertently touched. The pain signal is also transmitted to the brain. Only when the brain processes the signal and perceives it as pain does the person become aware of it. Pain felt in some areas of the body does not have to indicate exactly where the problem is, because the pain can be transferred to another area. Transmitted pain occurs because signals from several areas of the body often go to the spinal cord and brain through the same nerve pathways. The ability to endure pain varies with mood, personality, and conditions. Pain can change greatly with age. As people get older, they complain less about pain, perhaps because changes in the body reduce the sensation of pain. On the other hand, older people may simply be more stoic than younger people.",

      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a prevalent complaint among patients in psychiatric and medical care. Patients with EDS have often been misdiagnosed with depression due to their complaints of lack of energy and poor concentration. Also, they have even been diagnosed erroneously with a psychotic disorder in case of coexistence with hypnagogic hallucination. EDS can seriously affect the person's quality of life by causing decreased academic achievement or work performance, low self esteem, and social withdrawal. EDS is also frequently associated with various medical and psychiatric conditions, and often fatal traffic or on-the-job accidents. The causes of EDS range from insufficient sleep to central nervous system-originated hypersomnia. The conditions that can lead to EDS include circadian rhythm disorders, primary disorders of alertness such as narcolepsy, sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, sleep-related movement disorders such as periodic limb movement disorder and restless legs syndrome, chronic medical conditions such as cancer, and medications causing sleepiness. Treatment options should be tailored according to the underlying condition and include sufficient sleep time, light therapy, sleep scheduling, wakefulness-promoting medications, or mechanical airway managements such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose of Review: This article provides a review of disturbances of sleep comorbid with common neurologic disorders. Recent Findings: A wide variety of neurologic disorders are frequently complicated by comorbid sleep disturbances. In many cases, a bidirectional relationship appears to occur between sleep function and the neurologic disease, such that treatment of comorbid sleep disturbances may improve the symptoms of the neurologic disease. Summary: Neurologic disorders are often associated with abnormalities of sleep. Sleep influences the severity of both epilepsy and headache, and treatment of comorbid sleep disorders may improve seizure and headache frequency. Alzheimer disease is characterized by circadian phase delay and poor nighttime sleep and is strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Parkinson disease is associated with several sleep disorders, including insomnia, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, daytime hypersomnia, and sleep-disordered breathing. Hypoventilation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neuromuscular disorders often presents initially with sleep problems, and treatment with noninvasive ventilation improves survival and quality of life.",

One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness characterized by alternating periods of elevated and depressed mood. Sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder are present during all stages of the condition and exert a negative impact on overall course, quality of life, and treatment outcomes. We examine the partnership between circadian system (process C) functioning and sleep–wake homeostasis (process S) on optimal sleep functioning and explore the role of disruptions in both systems on sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder. A convergence of evidence suggests that sleep problems in bipolar disorder result from dysregulation across both process C and process S systems. Biomarkers of depressive episodes include heightened fragmentation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, reduced REM latency, increased REM density, and a greater percentage of awakenings, while biomarkers of manic episodes include reduced REM latency, greater percentage of stage I sleep, increased REM density, discontinuous sleep patterns, shortened total sleep time, and a greater time awake in bed. These findings highlight the importance of targeting novel treatments for sleep disturbance in bipolar disorder. Keywords: bipolar disorder, circadian rhythms, sleep–wake homeostasis",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric emergencies are conditions that mostly destabilize the already frenetic activity of the Emergency Department. Sometimes the emergency is clearly referable to primitive psychiatric illness. Other times, psychiatric and organic symptoms can independently coexist (comorbidity), or develop together in different conditions of substance abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs. Differentiating between substance induced and pre-existing psychiatric disorder (dual diagnosis) may be difficult, other than controversial issue. Finally, an organic disease can hide behind a psychiatric disorder (pseudopsychiatric emergency). In this review (part I), psychiatric disorders that occur with organic symptoms are discussed. They include: (1) anxiety, conversion and psychosomatic disorders, and (2) simulated diseases. The physiologic mechanisms of the stress reaction, divided into a dual neuro-hormonal response, are reviewed in this section: (1) activation of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla with catecholamine production (rapid response), and (2) activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with cortisol production (slow response). The concept of the fight-or-flight response, its adaptive significance and the potential evolution in paralyzing response, well showing by Yerkes-Dodson curve, is explained. Abnormal short- and long-term reactions to stress evolving toward well codified cluster of trauma and stressor-related disorders, including acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, are examined. A brief review of major psychiatric disorder and related behaviour abnormalities, vegetative symptoms and cognitive impairment, according to DMS IV-TR classification, are described. Finally, the reactive psychic symptoms and behavioral responses to acute or chronic organic disease, so called \"somatopsychic disorders\", commonly occurring in elderly and pediatric patients, are presented. The specific conditions of post-operative and intensive care unit patients, and cancer and HIV positive population are emphasized.",

      "abstract": "The syndromes of oculogyric crisis (OGC) and paroxysmal perceptual alteration (PPA) in chronic schizophrenics have been investigated. The perceptual symptoms of PPA are characterized by hypersensitivity of perception, psychedelic experience (brightening of colors, sharpening of contrast, visual distortion, etc.) and a disorder of somatic schema (one feels that one is floating, one's extremities are pulled and elongated, etc.). PPA in chronic schizophrenics occurs abruptly mainly in the evening, often precipitated by fatigue. During the attack patients also suffer from mood and thought alteration (anxiety, agitation, depressive mood and inability to distract their thought from one thing), but they are aware that symptoms of PPA are not real and apprehensive about them. The attack ceases gradually and spontaneously while the patient rests or sleeps. The syndrome of OGC occurs in a similar fashion as in PPA; the attack occurs mainly in the evening and is also associated with a variety of transient mood and thought disturbances similar to those in PPA. Four cases have been described in this study, who experienced both PPA and OGC simultaneously. Among 223 schizophrenic patients admitted to our hospital between April 1987 and September 1988, 18 cases with OGC, 5 cases with PPA, and 4 cases with both PPA and OGC were found. The mean +/- SD dose of neuroleptics (chlorpromazine equivalent) at the latest occurrence of these syndromes was 761 +/- 470 mg (N = 22, ranging from 195 to 2010 mg) for OGC and 773 +/- 587 mg (N = 9, ranging from 227 to 2010 mg) for PPA. The appearance of OGC in cases with 195 mg or more dose (chlorpromazine equivalent) of neuroleptics of OGC in cases with with 195 mg or more dose (chlorpromazine equivalent) of neuroleptics (NLP) is significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that in cases with less than 195 mg of NLP. Similarly, the appearance of PPA in cases with 277 mg or more dose of NLP was higher (p less than 0.1) than that in cases with less than 277 mg of NLP. In paranoid schizophrenic patients the incidences of OGC and PPA were significantly lower (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively) than those in other types of schizophrenics. In disorganized schizophrenic patients the incidence of PPA was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than those in undifferentiated, residual and schizoaffective types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

This is the first report of somnambulistic sleepeating in which polysomnographic studies were performed to document the sleep-related nature of the nocturnal eating. During all-night sleep studies, three patients complaining of eating during sleep had episodic behavior in non-REM sleep, consistent with a somnambulistic etiology. In all three patients, a conscious preoccupation with food was present and two patients showed a high percentage of slow-wave sleep.

      "abstract": "Sedatives are used therapeutically for treatment of anxiety and insomnia; they are also used illicitly for these effects, as well as their sedating effects. An estimated 1.8 million Americans are current nonmedical users of sedatives. Many sedatives act on the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor, producing depressed cortical function and disinhibition. Toxicity is characterized by slurred speech, impaired judgment, and unsteady gait; overdose results in stupor, coma, respiratory depression, vasomotor collapse, and even death. Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications. Patients can be withdrawn with a taper of a long-acting benzodiazepine or phenobarbital; inpatient treatment may be required for severe use disorder or withdrawal. There are few data on the long-term treatment of sedative use disorders.",

      "title": "NARCOLEPTIC SYNDROME AND PARADOXICAL SLEEP",
      "abstract": "S ummary In order to elucidate the mechanism of the narcoleptic syndrome, the course of all‐night sleep was investigated by means of poly graphic methods or by using inducing stimuli. Further study on each symptom was performed in relation to the sleep mechanism using similar methods. Thirty‐three cases of typical narcolepsy were examined. The results from these studies are summarized as follows. 1. The paradoxical phase of sleep occurs immediately after sleep onset in the natural nocturnal sleep of narcoleptics. The proportion of sleep time spent in the paradoxical phase (30%) in narcoleptics is higher than in normals, whereas that of the deep sleep stage is lower. 2. In narcolepsy, hypnagogic hallucination and sleep paralysis appear mostly during the paradoxical phase. During these episodes the level of cerebral vigilance ascends temporarily but slight differences are found between these two episodes. The responses to the stimuli (auditory evoked response, the H reflex and the knee jerk) are similar to those in normals in each stage of sleep. 3. Chlorpromazine, being effective against hypnagogic hallucination and sleep disturbance, stabilizes a night's sleep and prolongs the duration of deep sleep and the paradoxical phase. Imipramine with a suppressing action on cataplectic attack, inhibits the occurrence of the paradoxical phase at sleep onset and diminishes the following paradoxical phases, accompanied by a decrease of hypnagogic hallucination. 4. The level of wakefulness tends to descend easily in narcoleptics. In sleep attacks, the subjects fall rapidly into the paradoxical phase from alert or drowsy state. Both sleep attacks and a tendency to fall asleep are apt to occur periodically in the daytime with lucid intervals. 5. A cataplectic attack closely relates to the paradoxical phase. During the episode, a great discrepancy is found between hypofunction of the arousal system and function of the motor and autonomic systems. Cataplectic occur frequently concomitant with the sleeping‐waking rhythm. 6. Fundamental disorders of narcolepsy are considered as follows: the abnormal occurrence of the paradoxical phase of sleep, the tendency to fall asleep easily, the sleep cycle through night and day and the remarkable dissociation of the arousal system from the motor or autonomic systems. Accordingly, disorders in the sleep‐wakefulness regulating mechanisms are found. Dysfunction of the brain stem reticular formation, especially in the pons, and disturbances of the interrelationship among them are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Enuresis is more commonly known as bed-wetting. Enuresis is diagnosed when children repeatedly urinate in inappropriate places, such as clothing (during the day) or the bed (during the night). In most cases, the child’s urination problem is involuntary in nature, and is perceived by the child as an unavoidable loss of urinary control. This condition is most likely a symptom of psychological stress, although physiological causes, such as bladder infection, should not be ruled out. In general, the causes of bedwetting are related to anxiety, life stress, and possibly trauma, both inside and outside the home. Psychological factors such as a stressful life situation (death of a parent) or birth of a new sibling, disturbed family patterns, and delay toilet training, personality characteristics, parenting style, anxiety or presence of other emotional problems may predispose factors of enuresis. Many Children with enuresis experience significant distress or impairment in their social, academic, or everyday lives and the disorder can also drastically affect their families. The aim of the study is to find out the Anxiety level of Enuretic and Non-Enuretic Children.Test Anxiety Scale for Children (TASC) questionnaire made by A. kumar to determine anxiety level administered over 80 (Boys and girls) children of enuretic and non-enuretic.

      "abstract": "Myoclonic Seizures: As noted above, myoclonic movements are one of the main symptoms of JME and consist of generalized seizures which are brief, irregular jerks of the head, trunk, and limbs that can be either symmetric or asymmetric, and may involve isolated regions of the body or the whole body.They usually predominate in the upper limbs (mostly distal muscles), although they occasionally involve muscles in the abdomen, paraspinal distributions, and lower extremity [27].It is not uncommon for myoclonic seizures to be so subtle or brief that they are perceived as benign \"inner shocks\".As subtle as the may be, patients tend to more readily notice asymmetric jerks involving the dominant upper extremity because such movements noticeably impair daily functioning.The jerks, if violent, may cause the patient to drop or throw objects, or fall to the floor-which may be mistaken for nonpathological clumsiness.Myoclonic seizures can manifest as discrete, single events or they may occur in clusters.They are usually not associated with loss of consciousness but it is not uncommon for patients to lose awareness during the jerks.Moreover, clusters of myoclonic events can evolve into a GTCS and cause post-ictal confusion.They can occur during transition to sleep or during awakening from sleep, usually in the early morning hours [28].This early morning pattern of seizures is associated with an increase in cortical excitability during that time of day, which has been noted in other patients with GGE, but to a greater extent in JME patients [29].Developmentally, these jerks often subside in the fourth decade of life, although GTCS or absence seizures tend to persist [30].Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures: About 80% of the patients with JME have GTCS.These seizures are also more likely to occur if precipitated by sleep deprivation or alcohol intake.Usually, these events are immediately preceded by a series of myoclonic jerks and associated tongue biting prior to generalization.Because, as noted above, myoclonic events are often insidious, patients first seek treatment following an initial GTCS and are then subsequently diagnosed with JME.Typically, upon further evaluation, such patients acknowledge also that they have experienced myoclonic jerks, a description which adds additional clinical support for a JME diagnosis.Due to this association, some authors have proposed that clinicians should",

Although it is the symptoms that are of prime importance to the patient, the role of sensory nerves and psychology in the generation and perception of symptoms has been relatively neglected compared to the large amount of research on inflammatory mediators. This paper discusses how physical and chemical changes in the nasal epithelium result in the generation of inflammatory mediators that are responsible for symptoms. Inflammatory mediators can cause symptoms in three ways. (J) By having direct action on glands and blood vessels to cause glandular secretion, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and transudation of a plasma exudate. (2) By stimulation of sensory nerve endings to cause reflex glandular secretion, sneezing, and sensations such as itching, irritation, pain, and pressure. (3) By effects on the central nervous system to cause, headache, fever, tiredness, and mood changes.",

      "title": "Reactive Psychoses Revisited",
      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided. Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination. Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "title": "Stress, Coping Behavior and Resistance to Disease",
      "abstract": "Psychosocial factors affect resistance to a wide variety of diseases in animals. Stimuli often assumed to be noxious (e.g., electric shock, isolation housing) have been found to exert either potentiating or protective effects on an animal's response to potentially pathogenic stimulation. This variability has often been attributed to the influences of these stimuli on aspects of neuroendocrine or immunological function which are related to specific forms of pathogenic stimulation. The impact of a particular form of stimulation on the physiological state of the organism is also determined by the ability of the animal to cope with the stimulus environment. Factors shown to influence have included: (a) other aspects of the immediate environment at the time of stimulation; (b) prior experience with the same or other forms of stimulation; (c) the animal's ability to control its relationship to the stimuli by learning to escape or avoid them; (d) the availablility of relevant feedback regarding stimulus onset (e.g., warning signal), and (e) the stage of the disease process at which stimulation is imposed. These findings by various investigators indicate that it may be inappropriate to place a priori value judgements on any form of psychosocial stimulation or stress either as conceptually or operationally defined. The adaptive value of the psychosocial environment will depend upon its perception by the animal, the animal's ability to cope with the stimulus environment, and the particular disease system being studied.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sleepiness is associated with many different conditions and, as a neglected topic, it can be the cause of serious psychologica l and social disadvantages. In the aspect of learning, additional pro blems may arise from poor progress in school caused by the effe ct of sleepiness on concentration, memory, and other cognitive functi ons. Narcolepsy is by no means the most common cause of excessive sleepiness. Nonetheless, it is not a rarity, especial ly in young people. The non-specific nature of early features o f narcolepsy, combined with very limited awareness that the condition can start in various ways, leads to many misinterpretations. Misinterpretation of narcolepsy symptoms is not confined to the medical profession. Teachers may well be critical of a student with narcolepsy because of their perception of narcolepsy symptoms a s laziness, poor motivation, or difficult behavior and dull lea rning ability. Inappropriate reactions by parents, teachers, and peer s, based on misinterpretation of narcolepsy symptoms or the pat ient’s reactions to them, make a difficult situation worse. Especially in Korea, where schooling is focused on college entrance exami-nations, the problem is very serious and intensified by inappro priate or delayed diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, psychiatr ists should be aware that narcolepsy in young adolescents is not rar e and that they need to be familiar with its clinical features in both its classic and less obvious forms. Narcolepsy should be suspec ted if a adolescent’s excessive sleepiness can not be explained in other ways. Therefore, we report on two patients who portray the tendency o f dull learning ability and are mistaken as idle students. We diagnosed narcolepsy through polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing. We treated the students with methylphenidate and pemolin. The students showed improvement in learning a bility and were able to adapt better to school.",

      "title": "Overtraining from a sports psychiatry perspective",
      "abstract": "Overtraining is characterized by a mismatch between exerted strain and exercise tolerance. Overtraining is generally not sufficiently feared nor is enough attention paid to its prevention. As a result, the first warning signals and symptoms are often either perceived too late or there is a delay in the correct interpretation of signs. This often leads to negative consequences over months, which, in turn, can lead to more frequent injuries as well as Depression. Due to the increasing professionalism and density of competition in competitive sports, overtraining occurs more frequently as athletes are left with a shorter period of time to recover. In order to treat overtraining, it is first necessary to identify the syndrome. Symptoms are often disregarded and trainers and athletes attempt to compensate for poor performance with excessive training. This leads to a vicious cycle with significant reduction of the overall performance of the athlete as a consequence. Psychological parameters can also be signs of non-func-tional overload. Examples include restlessness, irritability, emotional instability, recurring states of fear, emerging indifference or reduced performance motivation. However, disturbed cognitive processes as an impairment of central elements of movement control can also occur. As part of sports psychiatric support, conspicuous psychological parameters can be recorded and contextualised. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) is available for systematic recording and corresponding process management. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) can be used as an instrument for load, training and competition control to prevent non-functional overload and overtraining. It is also suitable for promoting performance and preventing injuries as well as stabilizing the psychological structure.

      "abstract": "Our memories can be accurate, but they are not always accurate. Eyewitness testimony, for example, is notoriously unreliable. Insights into both veridical and false remembering have come from recent investigations of memory distortion. Behavioral measures have been used to demonstrate false memory phenomena in the laboratory, and neuroimaging measures have been used to provide clues about the relevant events in the brain that support remembering versus misremembering. A central category of misremembering results from confusion between memories for perceived and imagined events, which may result from overlap between particular features of the stored information comprising memories for perceived and imagined events.",

      "title": "[Physiopathology of the autonomic nervous system activity during sleep].",
      "abstract": "Sleep consists of two phases that periodically alternate: the rapid eye movement (REM) phase and the non-REM phase. The non-REM stage is characterized by wide synchronous waves in the electroencephalogram, by a low heart rate and by a decrease in arterial blood pressure and peripheral resistances. This hemodynamic setting is the consequence of the autonomic balance characterized by high vagal activity and low sympathetic activity. Such an autonomic condition is adequately described by the spectral analysis of heart rate variability documenting a prevalence in the high frequency band (the respiratory vagal band). The REM stage of sleep is characterized by asynchronous waves in the electroencephalogram and it is associated with a further increase in the vagal dominance of the autonomic balance resulting in a lower heart rate and decreased peripheral resistances. The REM phase of sleep is, however, also characterized by hemodynamic instability due to sudden bursts of sympathetic activity, associated with the rapid eye movements. These sympathetic bursts cause sudden changes in heart rate and peripheral resistance and may influence cardiac electrical stability both at the atrial and ventricular levels. Additionally, REM sleep may enhance the risk of anginal attacks in coronary artery disease patients. Analysis of the autonomic balance during the different phases of sleep may also help in the identification of autonomic derangements typically associated with myocardial infarction.",

      "abstract": "In neurological practice one often encounters various forms of disturbances of the waking state. Sometimes somnolence is one of the manifestations of a pathological process, and in others it is the major and dominant symptom bringing the patient to the doctor. Our experience in the study of hypersomnia (we have observed 120 patients in recent years) demonstrates that physicians have inadequate familiarity with this problem. Sometimes somnolence is regarded not as the result of pathology, but as a manifestation of excessive fatigue. There is inadequate differentiation of the forms of hypersomnic disorders. One of the causes of these errors is the absence of a logical classification. The most thorough classification is that of A. Epshtein, (1) etiological in nature: 1) random sleep disorders; 2) secondary sleep disorders; 3) constitutional neuropathic; 4) reactive; 5) symptomatic; 6) essential disorders; and 7) sleep disorders associated with psychosis. It has become obsolete, and does not cover the clinical forms of hypersomnia. We have deemed it desirable to make a classification based on clinical principles, with due consideration for etiology.",

      "title": "The role of sleep in neuromuscular disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep represents a major frontier both in clinical myology and as a new possibility for delivering treatment to neuromuscular patients since various neuromuscular cases present a variable degree of disordered sleep and such conditions should be diagnosed and prevented, i.e., sleep apnea and hypoxemia. These sleep disorders are present in dystrophinopathies and in various types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD). Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is found in patients affected by spastic paraparesis or cerebellar ataxia but is rather common in both myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2, and the correction of sleep disorders is therefore important to improve their daily quality of life (QoL) and consequent daily functioning. Other types of sleep dysfunction such as insomnia, a reduction in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, loss of normal REM, or sleep-disordered breathing are found in other disorders including myasthenia, ataxias, spastic paraparesis, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and neurogenic disorders, including polyneuropathies, and need appropriate treatment. Research done on this topic aims to incorporate a variety of nuances in metabolic disorders such as those in late-onset Pompe disease and are such as those in late-onset Pompe disease who are susceptible to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The overarching goal is to explore both the diagnosis and methodology of sleep-related problems in both genetic and acquired neuromuscular disorders. We also review the type of available treatment opportunities utilized to improve neuromuscular patients’ QoL.",

Settling problems, excessive daytime sleepiness, night waking problems, and sleep apnoea are some of the most common sleep problems that adults and children with ID experience. There is considerable evidence to suggest that sleep problems are highly associated with a number of problematic factors in the individuals themselves, their first line carers (i.e. mothers) and their families as a whole. Insufficient sleep has been highly associated with increases in aggression, self injury and property destruction.  Improving sleep and providing successful treatment for individuals with ID can benefit the families and alleviate, if not reverse these trends.  Aims: 1. To assess the efficacy of psychological sleep treatment techniques, such as extinction and sleep hygiene, for severe sleep disorders in adults with ID using a RCT design. 2.

Several mechanisms, alone or in combination, can interfere with the animal's ability to sustain an optimal activity level. Cardiac disease often limits exercise capacity when the heart is unable to increase forward cardiac output (CO) sufficiently. Abnormal peripheral circulation contributes to inadequate skeletal muscle perfusion and fatigue during exercise. A weak or absent arterial pulse, coolness, pallor, pain, lack of sweating and venous return (horses), muscle contracture, or even paresis might be evident in the pelvic limbs.

Patients often present as an emergency due to the sudden spontaneous onset and anxiety the fit may cause in witnesses. Fits occur as a result of sudden disorganized electrical activity in the brain. They normally last between 30sec and 2min. The effect upon the individual will depend on the area and extent of the brain involved. Most authors prefer the term ‘seizure’ as the word ‘fit’ has differing connotations; ‘to have a fit’ may be used to describe anger or loss of temper. There are many causes of seizures which can be classified into five main groups: 1. Cerebral irritation 2. Metabolic disorders 3. Substance withdrawal 4. Idiopathic 5. Pseudo-seizures Regardless of the classification all seizures require a consistent approach to assessment. Key signs and symptoms The symptoms of seizures vary widely between individual patients.

Tearfulness often precedes or accompanies such emotional outburst. In addition to these emotional symptoms, mild physiological symptoms similar to those seen in a panic attack, such as palpitations, dizziness, trembling and so on, may appear. Immediately after this emotional outburst, distressing trains of thought or images related to recent or past unpleasant events are experienced and ruminated on repeatedly. They are often manifested as flashbacks with or without visual images. Since these conditions are the bitterest experiences for most patients, they may cope with them in various ways such as deliberate self-harm. These patients generally have a more or less depressive mood. These conditions are considerably different from a panic attack, in that the emotional and cognitive storm dominates the physical one. The author named this condition as an Anxious-Depressive Attack (ADA). In this study, we present five cases of ADA and discuss their psychopathology and differential diagnoses. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report proposing the term ADA, which is a unique but common syndrome. Awareness regarding ADA may help improve understanding and treatment of the patient.",

The condition is multi-factorial, dependent on lifestyle, mood and personality, as well as on familial factors but no single factor in isolation is sufficient to explain the delay in sleep timing. Refusal to attend school may be important in some instances but will not explain cases with delayed age of onset. In half the subjects the delay in sleep phase started in childhood or adolescence. The syndrome causes severe disruption to education, work and family life. Polysomnography, motor activity monitoring of rest-activity cycles, plasma melatonin profiles and urinary melatonin metabolite excretion are normal. Different patterns of sleep phase delay seen in the syndrome include stable, progressive, irregular and non-24 hour sleep-wake cycles. These patterns may result from different social and other Zeitgebers (\"time-markers\", for example sunrise, sunset) in the normal environment. Treatment by forced sleep-wake phase advance or with melatonin resulted in a partial sleep-phase advance but this was not maintained on stopping treatment.",

After a rapid switch to near maximal intensity of affective symptoms, slow changes in symptomatology were documented by significant slopes and correlation coefficients over the course of each episode. Decreases in depression, anxiety, drowsiness, helplessness/hopelessness, anger, and sadness preceded the switches into mania; decreases in mania, euphoria, seeking others, and talking preceded the switches into depression. Psychologically important events appeared to regularly precede rapid mood switches. It is suggested that the consistent, slow clinical changes which occur during affective episodes may reflect part of an underlying rhythmic biological process and that environmental events may be capable of triggering a final common pathway for the mood switch during a vulnerable period.",

Results The most common accompanying symptoms were tachycardia, fear, and muscle jerks/twitches with the most severe associated with respiration difficulties. Visual phenomena were more common than expected (27%). EHS episodes were perceived as having a random course, but were most likely to occur during wake-sleep transitions and when sleeping in a supine position. Only 11% reported EHS to a professional, and 8% of those with recurrent EHS attempted to prevent episodes.

ILesults suggested that at some stage during childhood, particularly under 8 years of age, the majority of children with autism will experience sleep problems. These problems are likely to be severe in many cases and will generally include one or more of. extreme sleep latencies; lengthy periods of night waking; shortened night sleep; and early morning waking. Such problems may have some specificity for autism as they appear to be rare in non-handicapped children and in children with mild degrees of intellectual handicap. It is likely that sleep problems in early childhood are related to the severe social difl:culties present in autism and the consequent inability of these children to use social cues to synchronise their sleep/wake cycle. Continued sleep dilticulties at older ages and with higher IQ may also be related to arousal and anxiety factors.",

      "abstract": "Various occupations can lead to exposure to vibration, which can be transmitted to the whole body or localized to the hands. The main clinical effect of whole body vibration exposure is low back pain. Effects from hand-transmitted vibration can be (1) vascular, with manifestations of secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon; (2) neurological, often presenting as paraesthesia and reduced sensory perception; and (3) musculoskeletal, including reduced grip strength and loss of manual dexterity. Management requires exclusion of differential diagnoses, and the identification and reduction of exposure to vibration at source. Diagnosis of an index case should prompt further investigation and (if possible) modification of the workplace to prevent other cases....",

      "title": "Musical Hallucination in a Patient With Frontal Lobe Meningioma",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Many conditions can mimic psychiatric symptoms. Amongst them, intracranial mass and space occupying lesions have a significant importance. Aggression and hallucination are seen in association with a basal frontal lesion, and may mimic psychotic syndromes. Case Presentation: A 37-year-old man with no previous mental illness presented with a month history of headache, blurred vision, diplopia, aggression, loss of interest, fatigue, insomnia, and depressed mood. He was suffering from daily auditory hallucination which described as musical hallucination lasting about an hour per day. The headache was tension-type which appeared swinging, two times per week lasting 30 minutes. After auditory hallucination, the patient disclosed nausea, vomiting, and transient loss of consciousness. He referred from a neurologist, because, conventional therapy for the patient had not response. There were no other neurological symptoms or deficits. The results of neurologic examination including evaluation of the cranial nerves as well as head and neck examination were normal; But, psychiatric symptoms developed. Therefore, he was admitted to the psychiatric ward. The patient was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic feature by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV criteria and received psychiatric treatment. He started on antipsychotic agent (olanzapine 5 mg tablet/bid), antidepressant (sertraline 50 mg tablet/qhs) and valproate sodium 200 mg tablet/bid for treatment of aggression and headaches. After five days of admission, primary symptoms of headache and auditory hallucination were better but diplopia and blurred vision were still present. Ophthalmology examination revealed. The pupils were round, isochoric, and normoreactive to light and accommodation, and there was no sign of a relative afferent pupillary defect. Ophthalmoscopy showed a papilledema in both eyes. In order to rule out the intracranial pressure and their causes, neuroimaging was requested. An emergent noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) image of the head revealed a hyperdense mass in midfrontal convexity. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with and without intravenous gadolinium enhancement further delineated the CT findings and highlighted a large avidly enhancing midline mass within the frontal region measuring approximately 48×50×42 mm in axial dimension, consistent with a meningioma. The patient discharged from psychiatric ward with necessary advices and was admitted to the neurosurgery ward for further evaluation. A first psychosis episode is a clinical condition with principal indication for cerebral CT-scan. Discussion: Meningioma is a common intracranial tumor with a variety of histomorphologic growth patterns, which are usually easily recognized. The three most common symptoms are headaches, mental status changes, and paresis. Aggression and hallucination are seen in association with a basal frontal lesion and may mimic psychotic syndromes like hypomania and schizophrenia. A first psychosis episode is a clinical condition with principal indication for cerebral CT-scan.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Ayurveda says Nidra yuktam Sukham Dukkham, In fact, it says that sleep is one of the three pillars of health. Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Treatment of Insomnia:- Panchakarma â€“ Taila dhara a type of Shirodhara is very much useful in combacting the Insomnia caused due to various above said disorders. So its a demand of time to know about the real sleep and the disturbed sleep according to Ayurveda and Mordern medicines also and effect of Taila Dhara Brahmi,Jatamamsi siddha) in treating Insomnia.",

      "title": "DREAMING AND PARASOMNIAS FROM A CEREBRAL STRUCTURAL VIEW",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Parasomnias are disorders that may appear during sleep with and/or without dreams. To describe them we must take in account a subjective description by the patient and his relatives. Objective measurement of this phenomenology is made with Polysomnography, Electromyography and Holter EKG. Material and Methods: We searched the recent data about parasomnia in the Medline, Pubmed, Google academic databases as also in classic books and reviews. Results: The clinical picture is various from motor and neurological signs to autonomic signs as also sleep related hallucinations. There are more rare presentations with associated disorders due to excretion and involuntary urinary emission during sleep disorders. Parasomnias are often preceded by a traumatic event for the patient and his family members which can be a head trauma or an infection or an intoxication which can be accompanied by psycho vulnerable events. On the other part parasomnias can be themselves a preamble announcing neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson disease, Lewy Body Dementia or some synucleopathies. Conclusions: The fluctuations of neurotransmitters (Dopamine, Serotonine or Acetylcholine) due to specific neurologic pathology can lead to particular parasomnias, their evolution corresponding to each impairment. The knowledge of accompanying parasomnias of neurologic disorders like those from Parkinson disease helps manage diseases of neurological patients already known with Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases, leading to increased quality of life for these patients as a result of specialized intervention.",

      "abstract": "In 10 subjects with Ramsay-Hunt (RH) syndrome and epilepsy, and in one case of Lance-Adams (LA) syndrome, 21 polygraphic sleep records were made. In the cases of RH syndrome the main findings were as follows: (a) Cyclic organization of sleep. The cyclic organization of sleep was quite well preserved in all cases and all the sleep stages were represented with percentages within normal ranges. Sleep pattern. In the majority of the cases the identification of the different sleep stages was particularly difficult, often because of the rarity of the spindles, K-complexes and vertex sharp waves. Modifications of the epileptic discharges during sleep. During wakefulness the abnormalities were characterized by brief (0.5–2 sec) bursts of generalized spike and wave discharges at 4–5 cps, usually of low voltage. During sleep two types of epileptic discharges were observed: the first consisted of generalized bursts of spike and wave discharges similar to those observed during wakefulness; these discharges were always present during slow sleep but less frequent than during wakefulness; in three cases they persisted during REM sleep. The second type of abnormality consisted of spikes or multiple spikes, isolated or in long-lasting discharges up to 20 sec of duration, focalized or maximal over the vertex and central regions. These spikes observed in 7 patients, occurred in all stages of sleep and were particularly evident during REM sleep. Ictal electroclinical seizures of a clonic type, sometimes of long duration (up to 20 min) occurred during slow sleep awakening the subjects. In the LA syndrome the most important finding was the apparition during sleep, and particularly during REM sleep, of focal spikes over the central and midline regions, similar to those observed in RH syndrome.",

For instance, it is not known why various subjective disorders, such as eyestrain and headache, may result from comparatively slight degrees of heterophoria or astigmatism, whereas the majority of patients, even those with a high degree of the same anomalies, do not complain of any discomfort. That there is, indeed, a causal connection between the subjective disorders and the anomalies under discussion is evidenced by the frequent disappearance of the symptoms after a proper correction of the anomalies. One of the characteristics is the similarity of the subjective symptoms of which patients with different anomalies complain. Eyestrain,",

Deux grands types de plainte peuvent être opposés. La plainte suspecte de révéler une ma traduit un trouble de la mémorisation : les difficultés ne portent que sur le passé récent, elles retentissent rapidement sur la vie quotidienne et s’accompagnent de modifications du comportement qui amènent l’entourage à demander la consultation. Un examen rapide de la mémoire met en évidence un trouble du rappel qui n’est pas amélioré par les procédures de facilitation (indiçage). La plainte « bénigne » témoigne d’un trouble du rappel : elle porte aussi bien sur le passé ancien que récent, ne s’accompagne pas de modifications du comportement ou de diminution des activités de la vie quotidienne. La gêne est essentiellement subjective et le sujet vient seul consulter. L’examen montre une disparition des difficultés de rappel par l’indiçage. Cette plainte, essentiellement corrélée à des phénomènes psychoaffectifs dominés par l’anxiété, une baisse de l’estime de soi et un trouble de l’identité ne constitue pas un risque particulier d’évolution vers la démence.",

Nystagmus, by definition, is involuntary eye movements off of fixation that are initiated by a slow phase. By contrast, nystagmoid movements are often saccades that interrupt fixation or have a fast phase followed by a slow phase. Types of nystagmoid eye movements include saccadic intrusions, such as square wave jerks and ocular flutter/opsoclonus, voluntary nystagmus, superior oblique myokymia, as well as the Heimann-Bielschowsky phenomenon. In addition, sensory intermittent exotropia is a clinical entity that should be on the differential when considering patients with involuntary eye movements, many of whom will also have a history of decreased visual acuity. Other ocular comorbidities in these patients include optic nerve and retinal pathology, as well possible neurological findings such as head trauma or demyelinating disease.",

      "title": "The positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia reflect impairments in the perception and initiation of action",
      "abstract": "Synopsis The CNS maintains a fundamental distinction between actions elicited by external stimuli and actions elicited by internal goals (acts of will). As a result the intact organism can monitor centrally three aspects of its own actions: (1) the action appropriate to current external stimulation (stimulus intention or meaning); (2) the action appropriate to current goals (willed intention); and (3) the action which was actually selected (corollary discharge). In Type I (acute) schizophrenic patients, intentions of will lead to actions, but these willed intentions are not monitored correctly. This apparent discrepancy between will and action gives rise to experiential (1st rank) positive symptoms (e.g. delusions of control and passivity). In Type II (chronic) patients, intentions of will are no longer properly formed and so actions are rarely elicited via this route. This gives rise to behavioural negative signs (e.g. poverty of speech). The behaviour of Type II schizophrenics has surface similarities to that shown by patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with frontal lobe lesions in that all three types of patient show a relative deficit of actions elicited by willed intentions. Dopamine blocking drugs reduce positive symptoms in Type I patients precisely because they induce Parkinsonism, i.e. reduce the likelihood of actions being initiated by willed intentions. This in turn reduces the likelihood that actions will occur for which the patient had no awareness of his intention to act.",

      "abstract": "The impression made on the psychoanalyst by the fits is of a regression to an extremely primitive level of organization in which all inner excitations are discharged by the shortest motor path and all susceptibility to external stimuli is lost. This chapter suggests that an epileptic fit signified a regression to extremely primitive level of infantile ego-organization in which wishes were still expressed by uncoordinated movements. In sleep all interest is withdrawn from the outside world and sensibility to external stimuli is noticeably diminished. Epilepsy, must be regarded as a state of exceptionally deep sleep, from which the sleeper is not to be awakened even by the strongest external stimulus. The 'post-epileptic' stage, and the transition stage which normally intervenes before the patient comes round, is much more like ordinary sleep. The patient makes defence movements, his pupils react again, and only an inclination to 'ambulatory automatism', a kind of sleep-walking, provides evidence of a remaining pathological, generally violent, hypermotility.",

      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "title": "1699 – Long lasting personality changes after the onset of dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Across various cultures, dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage (as detected by conventional structural brain imaging). In a substantial number of cases, the memory impairment follows a chronic course. Sometimes dissociative amnesia occurs on a background of a personality disorder (narcissistic or borderline). Other times, amnesia itself triggers long lasting personality changes. This work's objectives are establishing greater recognition among health care providers of the spectrum of the personality changes that may accompany chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. We review data from own patients with chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically, neuropsychologically and and neuroradiologically. Changes in personality dimensions occur after the onset of amnesia. These may involve affectivity, perception (e.g. impaired self face or face-emotion processing), cognition (e.g. social cognition) and behaviour (e.g. changing in eating, smoking, drinking or working habits). The observed personality changes may represent a consequence of amnesia. Functional imaging studies show metabolic changes in dissociative amnesia in brain areas involved in conscious mnemonic processing. Several structures engaged in processing within episodic-autobiographical memory system were also implicated in self and reward-related processing. Alternatively, the personality changes may be viewed as being pivotal in the development and maintenance of dissociative amnesia; this personality shift may subsequently lead to enduring changes in ways of cognitive processing, self-processing, perception and affect.",

      "title": "Bundling sleep promotion with delirium prevention: ready for prime time?",
      "abstract": "A night in a typical intensive care unit (ICU) is punctuated by a chorus of alarms, voices, and telephone rings, direct and indirect light pollution, and interruptions from unfamiliar care providers. Poor-quality sleep often results, characterised by frequent disruptions, fragmentation, perturbed circadian rhythms, and a loss of restorative deep stages of sleep 1. As a consequence, critically ill patients report poor sleep as an important source of ICU-related anxiety and stress 2 and list sleep disturbance among the worst memories of their ICU experience 3. Despite this knowledge about poor sleep in the ICU, a large gap exists in our understanding of its effects on patient outcomes. It is widely hypothesised that poor quality of sleep is associated with delirium in the ICU and therefore with the negative consequences of delirium, including prolonged length of stay and long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological sequelae 4. However, previous investigations on this topic were limited in size, enrolled heterogeneous patient populations, and/or were limited by non-validated measures of sleep or delirium 5-9. Recently, promotion of sleep in the ICU has gained increased attention due, in part, to new efforts to minimise the use of sedative medications 10, 11, prevent delirium 12, promote early mobilisation 13 and improve post-ICU neuropsychological outcomes 14. As such, in its recently published Pain, Agitation, and Delirium guidelines, the American College of Critical Care Medicine recommended \"promoting sleep in adult ICU patients by optimizing patients' environments, using strategies to control light and noise, clustering patient care activities, and decreasing stimuli at night to protect patient's sleep cycles\", but acknowledged the low quality of evidence supporting this recommendation 15. In this issue of Anaesthesia, Patel and colleagues contribute to the growing literature in this field by evaluating a sleep-promotion and delirium-prevention intervention in a 24-bed mixed medical/surgical ICU in the UK 16. This multi-disciplinary, multi-faceted effort involved both ICU-wide and patient-specific interventions to promote sleep, including minimisation of environmental night-time noise and light, provision of eye masks and earplugs, and clustering of patient care activities, and a delirium-prevention intervention involving daily medication review, pain control, minimisation of sedation, and early mobilisation. Compliance with interventions was optimised using daily prompts and frequent reminders. To implement this intervention, the authors employed a pre/post design, with a 24-day pre-intervention baseline period with data collection on noise, light, sleep and delirium, followed by a 21-day 'break' period to allow for adoption of the intervention, and then a 26-day post-intervention period that replicated the baseline data collection. All patients underwent thrice-daily evaluations for sedation and delirium using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) 17 and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) 18, respectively. Additionally, a subset of patients without pre-existing sleep or cognitive disorders, neurosurgical admission diagnosis, sedation during the previous 24 hours or delirium during the ICU stay was enrolled consecutively for the sleep assessment, which included a daily Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) 19 and a one-time Sleep in the ICU Questionnaire (SICUQ) 20. The authors evaluated 167 and 171 patients for delirium assessment during the pre- and post-intervention periods, respectively, and 30 and 29 for the sleep assessment. Of the 338 patients who underwent delirium assessment, 288 (85%) were elective, postoperative admissions to the ICU. The authors reported statistically significant pre- versus post-intervention improvements in the incidence (33% versus 14%, respectively; p < 0.001) and mean duration (3.4 versus 1.2 days, respectively; p = 0.02) of delirium, in the perceived quality of sleep (RCSQ mean score 60.8 versus 75.9, respectively; p < 0.001; SICUQ median ratings 4 versus 7, respectively, p < 0.001), and in the mean night-time noise and light levels, sleep duration, and number of nightly awakenings. Moreover, unadjusted statistical analyses demonstrated that improved sleep efficiency was associated with a reduction in the odds of developing delirium. While this low-cost, multi-faceted intervention demonstrated important potential benefits, the authors appropriately noted several limitations, including a single-centre design, uncertainty of sustainability of the intervention or benefits beyond the 26-day intervention period, and potential bias due to unblinded data collection by staff members who were aware of the intervention. Additionally, the authors highlighted the limitation of using the RCSQ 19, SICUQ 20, and bedside observation to measure sleep, since these instruments have not been validated in heterogeneous ICU populations. Given that polysomnography, the gold standard for sleep measurement, is not feasible for widespread use in the ICU setting, subjective instruments pose a financially and logistically practical alternative for this study design. Further validation of these instruments is warranted, as research on sleep in the ICU continues to grow. In addition, other issues should be considered in reviewing Patel et al.'s study's results. First, there was limited reporting of missing data and no adjustment for potential confounders that differed between the pre- and post-intervention groups. Second, patients were excluded from performing sleep quality assessments if they had known pre-ICU sleep pathology, delirium in the ICU, or had received sedation 24 hours before enrolment. This exclusion helped to support more accurate assessment of patient-perceived quality of sleep in the ICU, but also markedly reduced the sample size and generalisability of the findings. Third, in the statistical analysis, only a single 'randomly-selected' sleep assessment was used for each patient, potentially limiting the study's findings. Patel et al. have made an important contribution in building upon previous studies of multi-component interventions to demonstrate further the feasibility and potential benefits of interventions, such as ICU-wide noise and light reduction protocols (e.g. 'quiet time' interventions 9, 21-28), earplugs and eye masks 28-31, and relaxation techniques including tranquil music, back massage, and guided imagery 9, 28, 32, 33 (Table1). Notably, the effort by Patel et al. closely paralleled a recent publication by Kamdar et al. 28, which reported on a 145-day, multi-faceted sleep promotion intervention that enrolled 300 patients from a single medical ICU and involved sequential additive interventions involving environmental noise and light reduction, non-pharmacologic interventions (eye masks, earplugs and tranquil music), but also – unlike Patel et al. – included a pharmacologic sleep aid guideline. Both Patel et al. and Kamdar et al. demonstrated significant pre/post improvements in cognitive impairment and perceived noise ratings, and provide evidence of the feasibility and safety of multi-faceted interventions to improve sleep and delirium in the ICU, adding to a growing research foundation to support the design of more rigorous future studies. In summary, Patel et al. should be commended for evaluating a novel multi-faceted intervention to improve sleep and delirium in the ICU, and adding to a growing body of literature on ICU-wide, multi-disciplinary sleep promotion and delirium prevention efforts. Additional studies are needed to advance our understanding of the relationship of ICU-related sleep disruption and delirium. Such efforts are important to evaluate new ideas for improving critically ill patients' short- and long-term physical, cognitive, and mental health outcomes.

      "abstract": "Falls are a major health problem among the elderly and an estimated 6% of falls by elderly result in fractures. Early identification of fall risk is likely to result in earlier implementation of intervention and to minimise development of secondary problems such as reduced confidence and activity levels. A comprehensive falls risk factor assessment should be performed for older people who present for medical attention after a fall, those who had more than one fall in the preceding year or those who have abnormalities of gait or balance. Falls are as a result of extrinsic risk factors, intrinsic risk factor or a combination of both. Syncope is defined as a transient, self limited loss of consciousness usually leading to a fall. Syncope and falls are often considered two separate entities with different aetiologies. Disorders affecting balance in the elderly are cerebral, cerebellar, spinal cord disorders; dementia; arrhythmias; postural hypotension; cerebrovascular disease; musculoskeletal/orthopaedic disorders; intervertebral disc disorders; psychological factors; visual impairment. Effective interventions include: (1) Health promotion and falls prevention. (2) Single interventions. (3) Medication review. (4) Exercise. (5) Home modifications. (6) To improve safety in the home. (7) To improve safety outside the home. Effective preventive strategies require better understanding of the causes of and risk factors for falling among elderly.",

      "title": "PROGNOSIS IN MANIC-DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSES",
      "abstract": "A follow-up study of 208 manic-depressive conditions is reported. Analysis of such conditions permits the following summary. Positive heredity is common—chiefly depressions, and more commonly in the direct line of heredity. This shows more consistently in the manic cases. Characteristic personality type is outgoing. Unexplainable psychosis is rare (20 per cent). Most have disturbing circumstances at the time of onset. Oldest and youngest siblings may more frequently develop psychoses. Somatic handicaps frequently contribute to or help to precipitate the illness. Abrupt onset is rare except in manics. The condition usually requires one to six months to develop. Suicidal risk or attempt occurred in 30 per cent of all cases. The affective picture is often mixed, not purely as sadness or elation. Psychoneurotic (not often as anxiety), schizophrenic, and arteriosclerotic components are frequent (79 cases). (33.1 per cent). Thinking disturbances are present in one-fourth of the cases (manic and depressive phases). Capacity for rapport is fair or good in 41 per cent of the manics and in 70 per cent of the depressions. Some insight is present in 47 per cent of the manics and in 54 per cent of the depressions. Remissions of 10-20 years are common (67 cases, 32.2 per cent). Depression may begin early, but rarely (3.8 per cent, 8 cases), or late (65+, 11 cases, 5.2 per cent). The largest incidence occurs in the decade 45-55. Course is a matter of months; on the average 2½ months in the hospital. Three-fourths of the cases are well or improved at the time of discharge; 93 per cent recover from the first attack. Chronic cases are rare (16, 7.7 per cent). Cyclothymic cases tend oftener to chronicity. Single attacks are rare (21 per cent). Recurrence is likely. Long-term follow-up convinces us that caution is necessary in pronouncing recovery for the future. Seventy-nine per cent had recurrences. This is particularly true for cyclothymic cases. Many variations in course and phases occur. Depression following elation is more common than vice versa. Depression almost always lurks behind elation. Manic patients may suicide. Depressive or paranoid content occurred in 14 of the manic cases (77.7 per cent). Depressive cases may show definite manic features (spurts of elation in the morning, rhyming and flight with sadness). Single attacks of manic psychosis are very rare. Single attacks of depression occurred in 40 cases (19.2 per cent). Fourteen of these became chronic (35 per cent of 40 and 6.8 per cent of 208). The unfavorable depressions may develop a schizophrenic picture. Deterioration may occur in depression. Stupor in depression occurs—catatonic in appearance. First attacks on the average last 6½ months. Recovery from first attack is almost invariable (93 per cent). Twenty-one per cent had single attacks; 79 per cent had recurrent illnesses; 63.5 per cent had third attacks, and 45.1 per cent had fourth attacks. Attacks tend to become prolonged as they recur, especially after 45. Best prospect for recovery for patients having first attack is between 21 and 30, poorer after 40, worst after 50. Recovered patients show small number of attacks (2.7) and shortening of the course in subsequent attacks. The more frequent the attacks, the less chance for ultimate recovery. Depth of psychosis is not significantly important. Negative heredity is not an outstanding factor in recovery. Out-going make-up is a factor in recovered cases.",

Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

      "abstract": "<h3>To the Editor:—</h3> The apparent sensitivity of some cranial nerves to ingested or injected substances is a unique vulnerability, not generally appreciated. A careful study might reveal the cause of some cranial nerve syndromes of unknown etiology such as tic douloureux, Bell's palsy, facial hemispasm, certain types of deafness, tinnitus, vertigo, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and spasmodic torticollis. The first (olfactory) nerve is susceptible to nasal or viral infections which can cause transitory and occasionally permanent loss of smell. The second nerve (optic) is sensitive to methanol, optochin, cortisone and cortisone-like substances, tobacco (nicotine), quinine, ethylene glycol (Prestone), aspidium, and other substances. The third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves (oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens) are often involved in diabetes and syphilis. They are occasionally affected following spinal anesthesia. The trigeminal nerve (fifth) is involved in tic douloureux, a syndrome of unknown etiology. This nerve is affected by stilbamidine, diphenylhydantoin sodium, trichloroethylene, and carbamazepine",

      "abstract": "Motor neglect is characterized by underutilization of one side of the body when this failure cannot be attributed to primary sensory and motor defects. Impaired motor activity manifests itself in disturbance of using spontaneously contralesional limbs in the absence of severe hemiplegia (motor neglect) or in reduced readiness to initiate and carry out intact ipsilesional arm movements within or towards the contralesional hemispace (pre-motor neglect). These specific higher-order motor deficits may occur in isolation (pure motor neglect) or as part of a more pervasive neglect syndrome involving disturbances in visual, auditory, and tactile modalities or even in mental images. The lesions underlying the motor variant of hemi-neglect are ascribed to various topographic sites of the brain involving cortical and subcortical structures of the right or, rarely, the left hemisphere. Motor features of neglect are more frequent, more severe and long-lasting in right--as compared with left--brain-damaged patients. This deficit additionally makes improvement and neurorehabilitation of patients with focal brain damage difficult.",

      "abstract": "Juvenile general paralysis is of interest as illustrating one of the many ways in which syphilis may produce its detrimental effect on the human race. The disease may commence at a very early age; according to Thomson, progressive symptoms may be evident in children as young as three years. Males and females are victims in practically equal proportions. The symptoms are very similar to those of the adult form, progressive dementia being very marked; such variations as are present are due to the more undeveloped mental state of youth, and on the whole it corresponds to the demented or confused type of the adult. Periods of acute excitement, or of mental depression, are met with, and epileptiform seizures, which may be present at any stage, are often observed. Delusions of persecution are not uncommon, and grandiose delusions occur; hallucinations are also evident occasionally at some time during the course. In the younger patients a type of advancing spastic diplegia is most common, and even in older cases spastic symptoms are more prominent than in the adult form. The pathological appearances in the nervous system have the same characteristics as those seen in cases of mature age. The duration is usually from two to four years, although sometimes it may be more protracted.",

      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

      "abstract": "Despite much recent research, there is still little systematic information about the phenomenology of panic attacks, and their possible causes remain obscure. We investigated panic attacks in the natural environment using an event sampling approach. Twenty-seven panic attack patients and 19 matched normal conrols kept panic attack and self-exposure diaries for 6 days and wore an ambulatory heart rate/physical activity recorder for 3 days. Patients reported 175 attacks, generally of moderate severity. The most frequent symptoms were palpitations, dizziness/lightheadedness, dyspnea, nausea, sweating, and chest pain/ discomfort. The results did not support the classification of panic attacks recently proposed by Sheehan and Sheehan, which requires three symptoms as a cutoff for panic attacks. Panic attacks classified by the patients as situational (i.e., occurring in feared situations) were more severe and occurred in situational contexts different from spontaneous attacks, but were otherwise phenomenologically similar. Heart rates did not change during spontaneous attacks and were only mildly elevated during situational attacks or during the 15 minutes preceding these attacks. These heart rate changes were interpretable as effects of anxiety, although physical activity showed a similar pattern of changes. Some normal control subjects reported on the panic diary primarily situational anxiety episodes that were phenomenologically similar to, albeit less severe than, the patients' episodes. Panic patients may sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many attacks classified as spontaneous occurred in classical \"phobic\" situations. Furthermore, the comparison of concurrent diary and retrospective interview and questionnaire descriptions showed that panic patients have a tendency toward retrospective exaggeration. Implications for the assessment, definition, and classification of panic attacks are discussed.",

Sexual patterns and positions used prior to the heart attack should be continued. Symptoms that occur during sexual intercourse or any other exercise should be reported to a doctor. Taking more than two alcoholic drinks or eating a large meal may hinder sexual activity. Psychological problems that interfere with sexual function can develop in patients or their partners. Anxiety and depression are the most common causes of reduced libido, impotence and frigidity. Some people abandon sex after a heart attack because they feel they have aged significantly as a result of their illness. Doctors should ask post-myocardial infarction patients about sexual activity when inquiring about other symptoms and well-being.

      "title": "Hypsarrhythmia: Variations on the Theme",
      "abstract": "Summary: Prolonged monitoring studies of patients with infantile spasms have shown that hypsarrhythmia is a highly variable and dynamic electroencephalographic pattern. Variations of the prototypic pattern (modified hypsarrhythmia) include hypsarrhythmia with increased in‐terhemispheric synchronization, asymmetrical hypsarrhythmia, hypsarrhythmia with a consistent focus of abnormal discharge, hypsarrhythmia with episodes of attenuation, and hypsarrhythmia comprising primarily high‐voltage slow activity with little sharp‐wave or spike activity. Marked changes in the hypsarrhythmic pattern usually occur during sleep, chiefly during rapid eye movement sleep, when there is a marked reduction in, or total disappearance of, the hypsarrhythmic pattern. Relative normalization of the hypsarrhythmic pattern can also be seen immediately on arousal and during clusters of infantile spasms. Thus, the specific EEG features seen in a given patient depend on multiple factors, including the duration of the EEG recording, the clinical state of the patient, and the presence of various structural abnormalities of the brain. RÉSUMÉ Un “monitoring” prolongé de malades ayant des spasmes infancies a montré que Ľhypsarythmie était un pattern électroen‐céphalographique dynamique et hautement variable. Les variations du pattern typique (hypsarythmie modifyée) comprennent Ľhypsarythmie avec hypersynchronisation entre les deux hémisphères, Ľhypsarythmie asymétrique, Ľhypsarythmie avec fo‐calisation nette, Ľhypsarythmie avec épisodes ďatté‐nuation et Ľhypsarythmie constituée surtout ďactivités lentes de haut voltage avec peu de pointes et ďondes aiguës. Des modifications notables surviennent habituellement pendant le som‐meil, surtout pendant al phase REM, pendant laquelle le pattern hypsarythmique diminue ou disparaît complètement. Un retour à la normale peut aussi s'observer immédiatement après le réveil et pendant les séries de spasmes. Ainsi les caractéristiques EEG spécifiques que Ton voit chez un patient donné dépendent de facteurs multiples parmi lesquels la durée de Ľenregistrement EEG, Ľétat clinique du patient et la présence ďanomalies cé‐rébrales structurales variées. RESUMEN Estudios monitorizados prolongados de pacientes con es‐pasmos infantiles han demostrado que la hipsarritmia es un patron electroencefalográfico altamente variable y dimámico. Las variaciones del partón prototipo (hipsarritmia modificada) in‐cluyen hipsarritmia con sincronización interhemisférica aumen‐tada, hipsarritmia asimétrica, hipsarritmia con un foco de des‐cargas anormales persistente, hipsarritmia con episodios de atenuación e hipsarritmia constituida primariamente de actividad lenta de alto voltaje con escasa actividad de puntas u ondas agudas. Los cambios intensos en el partón hipsarrítmico ocurren generalmente durante el sueño, y fundamentalmente en la fase REM, cuando se observa una reducción muy clara, o una de‐saparicion total, del partón. También puede verse una relativa recuperatión del partón inmediatamente después del despertar y durante grupos de espasmos infantiles. Así pues, los hallazgos especificos del EEG observados en un paciente concreto de‐penden de multiples factores, incluyendo la duración del EEG, el estado clínico del enfermo y la presencia de varias anomalías estructurales del cerebro. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Langzeitbeobachtung von Patienten mit BNS‐Krämpfen hat gezeigt, daß die Hypsarrhythmie ein hochgradig variables und dynamisches EEG‐Muster darstellt. Variationen des Proto‐typs (modifizierte Hypsarrhythmie) umfasst: Hypsarrhythmie mit vermehrter interhemisphärischer Synchronisation, asym‐metrische Hypsarrhythmie, Hypsarrhythmie mit konstantem Fokus abnormer Entladungen, Hypsarrhythmie mit Amplituden‐abflachung und Hypsarrhythmie mit primärer amplitudenhoher langsamer Aktivität und nur geringer sharp wave oder spike Ak‐tivität. Deutliche Veränderungen des Hypsarrhythmiemusters ereignen sich gewöhnlich während des Schlafens, besonders während des REM Schlafes. Hierbei kann es zu einer deutlichen Reduktion oder einem völligen Verschwinden des Hypsarrhythmiemusters kommen. Relative Normalisierung der Hypsarrhythmie kann auch unmittelbar beim Arousal und während Serien von BNS‐Krämpfen gefunden werden. Damit ist das spe‐zifische EEG‐Muster, das bei einem Patienten zur Beobachtung kommt, von multiplen Faktoren abhängig, die die Dauer der EEG‐Ableitung, den klinischen Zustand des Patienten und das Vorhandensein verschiedener struktureller Abnormitäten des Gehirns einschließen.",

      "abstract": "An increase in the number of victims of psycho-violence, which has a traumatic effect on the personality, causing emotional stress, stress, discomfort, and depression, necessitates studying the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

      "title": "Vulnerability to addictive behaviors: the Associational Memory‐Appetitive Systems Relations Model",
      "abstract": "The concept of behavioral addictions invites controversy, but is slowly penetrating psychiatric consensus. Any addiction involves five components1: a) existence of appetitive needs and b) repeated attempts at satiation of these needs through ingestion of a substance or engagement in a behavior (appetitive effects), followed at some point by c) preoccupation with obtaining appetitive effects (e.g., craving, tolerance), d) loss of control over time spent engaged in appetitive effect-related behavior (e.g., duration, relapse), and e) undesired or negative consequences (such as failure to meet work, familial and social obligations; suffering physical injury; emotional turmoil) resulting from continued engagement in the behavior2. The fundamental underlying perspective is that addiction involves disruption of appetitive functioning; that is, of behavior directed towards fulfilling specific human psycho-socio-biological needs3. It has been theorized that addictive phenomena operate through appetitive mechanisms involving, in part, a misleading, temporary subjective sense of neurobiological fitness4, 5. This experience may be identified through subjective changes in a) affect (e.g., feelings of joy, or merely improvement of affect), b) level of arousal (e.g., alertness or sedation/calm), or c) cognition (e.g., clarity, enlightenment, or decrease in tempo of stream of thought). One may learn to associate in memory the appetitive need (internal cue) with the contexts (location, time of day, situation) and behavior (e.g., sex, work) that led to its temporary subjective satiation, even though the result may not actually be biologically adaptive. The Associational Memory-Appetitive Systems Relations Model of addiction describes how appetitive motives may become excessive, atypically elicited, or misdirected5. There are four main components of this model. First, it is acknowledged that addictions (e.g., alcohol use) have a substantial genetic component (e.g., between 10 and 50% is accounted for by genetics). The model theorizes that one's appetitive needs are impacted by one's genetics. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to substance or behavioral addictions may have a different physiological reaction when engaging in certain behaviors (e.g., involving valence of subjective reward, dissociation of wanting and liking, or involvement of counteradaptation processes). The neurochemistry of an individual can potentially create an inclination toward maladaptive appetitive functioning. DNA epigenetic processes such as cytosine methylation may impact gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (part of an appetitive motivation pathway) subsequent to initial recreational drug intake and possibly involvement in other addictive behaviors. Prolonged periods of stress, particularly at a young age (adverse childhood experiences), may lead to disruption in brain reward cascade functioning. Such disruption, in turn, may increase one's vulnerability to addictive behavioral rewards. Second, the social and physical environmental settings that one traverses will impact what information one learns and how one thinks, and may facilitate which behaviors one may select to perform. Daily life social \"pushes\" (stresses, social influence) and \"pulls\" (seductions) provide possible avenues of addiction. For example, encouragement by peers to engage in drug use or marketing the \"excitement\" of local casinos may push or pull one to explore an addictive substance or behavior. Production and distribution routes of various addictive behaviors will impact what is available to the potential \"consumer\". Accessibility and awareness of nearby addictive behavior will impact which behaviors one will initiate. Third, one's lifestyle inputs also impact what behaviors may \"pop\" to mind in daily life. A child who grows up with parents who were engaged in addictive behaviors may be relatively likely to tie appetitive needs fulfillment to an addiction-related lifestyle through vicarious learning3, or else be quite wary to fall victim to such a behavior pattern. In addition, through vicarious experiences, one may learn the vocabulary associated with an addictive behavior (e.g., cannabis \"head high\" versus a \"body high\"). That is, one may be socialized and prepared at a young age for entrée into involvement with an addictive behavior later on. When one contemplates trial of an addictive behavior, it should be mentioned that acquisition skills are needed to be able to engage in the behavior with minimal conflict. This includes behavior-specific conversation initiation skills (i.e., knowing how to meet a \"supplier\" and acquire the addictive behavior; for example, arranging a purchase of cocaine, or time with a sex worker) and a means of exchange (e.g., money or favors for drugs). Involvement in different addictions may vary over the course of human development. For example, persons as young as three years of age may suffer from television addiction. Persons as young as eight years of age may become addicted to caffeine. There are many behaviors that could be experienced as appetitive and become addictive (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and other drug misuse; binge overeating/food addiction; shopping; electronic media-related; love and sex; workaholism; exercise; and gambling)3. A large minority or a majority of people have tried at least once engaging in various addictive behaviors (e.g., overeating, alcohol use, overspending). More-than-initial trial of an addictive behavior is partly a function of attraction to that behavior. Attraction-related variables include the social image associated with the behavior (e.g., mentioned in the recovery movement, of being \"hip, slick and cool\"), what one's peers are engaged in (peer social influence), as well neurobiological effects of engaging in the behavior. Fourth, it is through the process of associative learning that appetitive needs come to be subjectively satiated through adaptive or maladaptive behaviors. Associative learning and memory have been considered in several recent models of addictive behaviors. Cues in an environment that otherwise would be considered innocuous can stand out to be emotionally salient when influenced by motivational states6. These cues can range from eating behavior being triggered when seeing fast food sign cues or eating locations, or a drug user becoming excited or agitated when in sight of his/her drug of choice. Some individuals may not, through deliberate cognition, recognize that their decisional processes are being influenced by maladaptive or extreme reward cues. It has been proposed7 that appetitive motivation is controlled through a dual process of deliberate, conscious, executive, regulatory cognition interacting with relatively automatic, implicit processes, in response to addiction-related cues. Over time, in part due to relatively automatic prompting by multiple cues, one may experience excessive thoughts about and desire to perform a behavior. In turn, excessive time may be spent to plan and engage in the behavior, and possibly recover from its effects (e.g., from \"hangovers\"), and less time may be spent on other activities, despite diminishing appetitive effects1, 8. One is most vulnerable to initial and continued trial of an addictive behavior if the initial consequences are experienced as \"filling the gap\" in one's sense of well-being (i.e., of being satiated, fulfilled). A widely used saying within the recovery movement is that at first the addiction \"does something for the person\" and then it \"does something to the person\". In conclusion, appetitive needs are instinctually embodied in every human being from birth. For at least the past one hundred years, researchers have been exploring the parameters of appetitive needs in human beings9. The interface between one's genetics, social and physical environmental cues, lifestyle situations, development and adaptation (epigenetics and associative learning), and associative memory, may underlie addictive behavior. There is a lot to be learned from an appetitive needs perspective on what is at the root of an addictive process. Appetitive needs which might be explored include those of dominance/leadership, respect, being part of a herd, providing nurturance or being nurtured, and obtaining pleasure3, 5. More research is needed to explore a taxonomy of appetitive needs, and how different appetitive needs act as sources of vulnerability factors and may transform into specific addictive behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is defined as difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, early awakening and poor subjective sleep quality despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep with impairment of daytime performance. These components of insomnia – namely persistent sleep difficulties despite of adequate sleep opportunity resulting in daytime dysfunction - appear secondary or co-morbid to neurological diseases. Comorbid insomnia originates from neurodegenerative, inflammatory, traumatic or ischemic changes in sleep regulating brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei with consecutive changes of neurotransmitters. Symptoms of neurological disorders (i.e motor deficits), co-morbidities (i.e. pain, depression, anxiety) and some disease-specific pharmaceuticals may cause insomnia and/or other sleep problems. This guideline focuses on insomnias in headaches, neurodegenerative movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, epilepsies, stroke, neuromuscular disease and dementia. The most important new recommendations are: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBTi) is recommended to treat acute and chronic insomnia in headache patients. Insomnia is one of the most frequent sleep complaints in neurodegenerative movement disorders. Patients may benefit from CBTi, antidepressants (trazodone, doxepin), melatonin and gaba-agonists. Insomnia is a frequent precursor of MS symptoms by up to 10 years. CBTi is recommended in patients with MS, traumatic brain injury and. Melatonin may improve insomnia symptoms in children with epilepsies. Patients with insomnia after stroke can be treated with benzodiazepine receptor agonists and sedating antidepressants. For patients with dementia suffering from insomnia trazodone, light therapy and physical exercise are recommended.",

      "title": "Parental alienation: the impact on men’s mental health",
      "abstract": "Parental alienation is defined as a mental state in which a child, usually one whose parents are engaged in a high-conflict separation or divorce, allies himself strongly with one parent (the preferred parent) and rejects a relationship with the other parent (the alienated parent) without legitimate justification. Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

      "title": "A possible link between circadian rhythm disorders and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm disorders are problems with your circadian rhythm, the internal body that keeps your biological processes in step. This cycle lasts about 24 hours. The term circadian comes from Latin words that mean “around the day.” Patterns of brain waves, hormone production, cell regrowth, and other activities are linked to this cycle. Your circadian rhythm plays a key role in things like when you sleep and when you wake. Your normal circadian clock is set by the cycle of light and dark over 24 hours. People with circadian rhythm disorders may have problems: Falling asleep, Staying asleep, Waking up too early and not being able to go back to sleep, Getting sleep but not feeling refreshed by it. Things that can cause circadian rhythm disorders include Shift work, Pregnancy, Time zone changes, Medications, Changes in routine, such as staying up late or sleeping in, Medical problems including Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, Mental health problems, Menopause. Various Circadian Rhythm Disorders include Jet lag, or rapid time zone change syndrome: This involves symptoms like too much sleepiness and a lack of daytime alertness in people who travel across time zones. It gets worse with each time zone crossed, especially when traveling toward the east. Shift work sleep disorder: This sleep disorder affects people who frequently rotate shifts or work at night. A conflict between someone’s circadian rhythm and the time of their shift can mean they get up to 4 hours less sleep than the average person. Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS): This is a disorder of sleep timing. People with DSPS tend to fall asleep very late at night and have a hard time waking up in time for work, school, or social activities. It’s especially common in teens and young adults. Advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS): This is a disorder in which a person goes to sleep earlier and wakes earlier than they wanted. For example, they might fall asleep between 6 and 9 p.m. and wake up between 1 and 5 a.m. Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder: This disorder often affects people who are blind because the circadian clock is set by the light-dark cycle. With this condition, that cycle is disturbed. It can cause a serious lack of sleep time and quality at night and sleepiness during daylight hours. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder: With this disorder, people’s circadian rhythms are jumbled. They may sleep in a series of naps over 24 hours. Seasonal affective disorder and all the circadian rhythm disorders are related to a discrepancy between the duration of the solar day and the circadian cycle. The circadian cycle of humans and other mammals is close to one hour longer than the 24 hours period from sunrise to sunrise. Interestingly, birds show a circadian cycle of less than 24 hours and close to 23 hours. Terrestrial invertebrates, the insects provide the key to understanding this discrepancy. The earliest identifiably mammalian fossils are from the Permian era strata. Insect orders that first appeared in the Permian era include the Hemiptera (bugs), Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), Coleoptera (beetles) and the Neuroptera (lacewings). All of whose modern survivors show a circadian cycle longer than 24 hours in at least some stage of the life cycle. The insects whose ancestors first appeared in Mesozoic strata with the birds include Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Their modern survivors, like the birds, demonstrate a circadian rhythm shorter than 24 hours. It is proposed here that the duration of these animal classes circadian day may reflect the duration of the solar day at the time of their origin. There is now evidence for three large meteorite impacts on Pangea near the end of the Permian era, one in Wilkes Land of Antarctica, one near the Falkland Islands, and one just west of Australia. The eastward movement of the Australian, African, and Eurasian continent/plate and the southeastward movement of the Antarctic continents/plates suggest that those meteorites were moving eastwards and struck the planet obliquely. Having done so, they might have imparted momentum to the planet’s rotation and so accelerated it. This may mean that circadian rhythm disorders are the consequence of a change in the duration of the solar day due to a disaster and that daytime lethargy and depression may have had adaptive value to the mammals who survived that disaster. If this is true, it adds context to our treatment of these disorders with bright light and melatonin",

      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided.Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination.Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is characterized by a sudden development of a focal neurologic deficit, and the symptoms correlate with the size and size of brain damage, but also over time, from the stroke to the moment of assessment. Rehabilitation of stroke patients should begin immediately during the first phase of acute treatment in stroke units. Upon completion of acute treatment, initial hospital rehabilitation should be initiated, outpatient, in-patient or at home. Cerebral vascular diseases are still the first day as the cause of validity and in the third place due to the mortality in the world. Patients with cerebrovascular diseases take care of the illness of their illness in the immediate vicinity, while also developing fear of helplessness, solitude, addiction. Indications for neurological rehabilitation are: impairing activity in mobility, reduced self-refractory, communication, chair control and urination, control of chewing and swallowing. All indications are comprehensively incorporated into a functional self-destruction test - the Barthell index. Rehabilitation intervention involving diagnostics, medication therapy, physical therapy, orthopedic and other medical aids as well as work therapy, speech therapy, cognitive training, medical care, nutrition and accommodation are expected to improve the patient's functionality and its better inclusion in the family, working and wider social community. This work will provide an insight into the functional outcome and quality of rehabilitation treatment with the help of the Barthell index in relation to the beginning of rehabilitation of patients with ischemic stroke, which will be indicators of their recovery and ability to function on a private and business life.",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

The clinician's first task is to separate sleep problems originating in the physiologic changes of aging from those originating in pathological processes. Normal elderly persons have greater difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, compared with younger persons, and sleep is qualitatively more shallow with more involuntary movements and abnormal breathing. Sleep complaints reach a pathological level as elders begin to experience deterioration of function during their period of normal wakefulness, manifested as excessive sleepiness, concentration deficits, and mood changes, or the emergence of bizarre or dangerous behavior during sleep. Sleep disorders are associated with excess physical and psychiatric morbidity and are treatable. An approach focused on sleep-related syndromes is a useful basis for rational treatment, and the treatment of many sleep disorders can be provided without expensive sleep laboratory testing.",

      "abstract": "Sleep deprivation severely compromises the ability of human beings to respond to stimuli in a timely fashion. These deficits have been attributed in large part to failures of vigilant attention, which many theorists believe forms the bedrock of the other more complex components of cognition. One of the leading paradigms used as an assay of vigilant attention is the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), a high signal‐load reaction‐time test that is extremely sensitive to sleep deprivation. Over the last twenty years, four dominant findings have emerged from the use of this paradigm. First, sleep deprivation results in an overall slowing of responses. Second, sleep deprivation increases the propensity of individuals to lapse for lengthy periods (&gt;500 ms), as well as make errors of commission. Third, sleep deprivation enhances the time‐on‐task effect within each test bout. Finally, PVT results during extended periods of wakefulness reveal the presence of interacting circadian and homeostatic sleep drives. A theme that links these findings is the interplay of “top‐down” and “bottom‐up” attention in producing the unstable and unpredictable patterns of behavior that are the hallmark of the sleep‐deprived state.",

      "abstract": "An episode of transient global amnesia is characterized by a sudden loss of the ability to retain new information. Transient global amnesia is sometimes precipitated by a psychological or physiological stress. Transient global amnesia also must be distinguished from psychogenic amnesia and from factitious amnesia. Usually no physical symptoms are associated with transient global amnesia. Any physical symptoms should raise the possibility of an alternative etiology for the patient's amnesia. The characteristic presentation of transient global amnesia is a sudden loss of ability to form new memories. Patients who develop transient global amnesia generally are taken by companions to an emergency room. Neuropsychological testing after multiple attacks may reveal more memory impairment as well as visuoperceptual deficits. Transient global amnesia is rare in young or middle-age adults. It is relatively common in individuals who are over 50 years old.",

      "title": "Depression and Mania in Patients with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary: Depression has a major impact on quality of life in patients with epilepsy and is also the main risk factor for the increased suicide rate in epilepsy. The frequency of depressive disorders depends on the severity of epilepsy and the localization of the epileptogenic focus, with a prevalence of ≤50% in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The diagnosis of depression in epilepsy may be difficult because symptoms of depression may be fluctuating, and some symptoms, such as memory complaints, may be misinterpreted as being a consequence of drug treatment or the epilepsy per se. Affective disorders in epilepsy may differ from those seen in patients without epilepsy. A possibility exists that patients with epilepsy will develop a specific interictal dysphoric syndrome related to limbic system dysfunction. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest a bidirectional relation between depression and epilepsy. Depression does not necessarily occur after the onset of epilepsy; the sequence may as well be the other way round, suggesting a common underlying mechanism for both disorders. Classic bipolar disorder type I is rarely seen in epilepsy, and manic episodes occur almost exclusively in the setting of postictal psychosis or after epilepsy surgery. This article explores the clinical manifestations of depressive and manic disorders in epilepsy and the differences from bipolar disorder.",

Conversely, REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is usually a secondary disorder, often due to degenerative brain stem disorders or narcolepsy. The case of a hitherto healthy man is presented, who simultaneously developed narcolepsy and RBD as the result of an acute focal inflammatory lesion in the dorsomedial pontine tegmentum in the presence of normal cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels and in the absence of human lymphocyte antigen haplotypes typically associated with narcolepsy and RBD (DQB1*0602, DQB1*05). This first observation of symptomatic narcolepsy with RBD underlines the importance of the mediotegmental pontine area in the pathophysiology of both disorders, even in the absence of a detectable hypocretin deficiency and a genetic predisposition.",

Cluster headache consists of attacks of severe unilateral pain located in the orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal region that occur from every other day up to eight times per day and last from 15 to 180 minutes. The pain is associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (most commonly lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, ptosis, edema of the eyelid, sweating of the forehead or face, and miosis) and a sense of agitation or restlessness. Attacks occur in clusters, called bouts, and are episodic or chronic. Common triggers include alcohol, nitroglycerin, food containing nitrates, and strong odors. Abortive treatments include triptans and oxygen; transitional treatments include steroids and suboccipital steroid injections; and prophylactic treatments include verapamil, lithium, melatonin, and topiramate. Newer treatments for cluster headache include galcanezumab, neurostimulation, and somatostatin receptor agonists.",

The duration of the central events and oxyhemoglobin desaturation were both maximum at the beginning of each run and became progressively less prominent with the development of the sequences. Night episodes disappeared with bedtime clonazepam but behavioral problems occurred as a paradoxical response; thus, clonazepam was stopped. Sleep extension and melatonin were then started, which were followed by a reduction of night episode frequency and intensity. This observation appears to be the first report of central sleep apnea sequences triggered by parasomnia and, if confirmed by additional reports, it might be considered to be a possible new classification of \"complex parasomnia.\"",

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "abstract": "Jet lag, also known as circadian desynchrony, is a sleep disorder in which there is a mismatch with the body’s natural circadian rhythm and the external environment as a result of rapid travel across multiple time zones. This common problem affects all age groups but may have more pronounced effects on the elderly, whose recovery rate is more prolonged than that in young adults.1\r\n\r\nA multitude of factors, such as the number of time zones crossed and the direction and timing of flights, play a role in the severity of symptoms experienced by travelers. Individual variability accounts for the ability to adapt to a new time zone and the duration of the symptomatic period. Travelers usually experience symptoms after air travel across at least two time zones. Symptoms may include disturbed sleep, daytime fatigue, decreased ability to perform mental and physical tasks, reduced alertness, and headaches. Sleep disturbances typically last for a few days, but they can persist for as long as one week if the change in time zones is greater than eight hours. Eastward travel is associated with a longer duration of jet lag than westward travel. Although frequent desynchrony is a transient disorder, it carries the potential to lead to long-term consequences, as evidenced by epidemiological and animal studies.2,3 Sequelae have included cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, and an increased risk of cancer, infertility, and heart disease. As the body’s internal circadian “clock” adapts to the new time zone, jet lag diminishes.\r\n\r\nStrategies to minimize the effects of jet lag include adjusting the sleep schedule according to the new location during the days preceding the trip. This approach may be helpful for travel that lasts for more than a week, but it does not appear useful for short-term trips. Both alcohol and caffeine can adversely affect quality of sleep when they are consumed a few hours before bedtime; caffeine intake should be planned to enhance daytime alertness. When passengers are traveling, they are advised to avoid alcohol, especially while they are being treated for jet lag.\r\n\r\nTreatment may include non-pharmacological therapy alone or non-pharmacological therapy combined with nutraceuticals or pharmacological therapy. A non-pharmacological approach, including adequate exercise, hydration, and appropriate timing of exposure to bright light, can aid in the adjustment to a new time zone. Nutraceuticals and pharmacological therapies include melatonin, melatonin receptor analogues (agonists), non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents, caffeine, diphenhydramine (e.g., Benadryl, McNeil; Aler-Dryl, Reese), and armodafinil (Nuvigil, Cephalon).\r\n\r\nA review of treatments and potential strategies follows.",

      "title": "Chronic insomnia remitting after maxillomandibular advancement for mild obstructive sleep apnea: a case series",
      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea are both common sleep disorders. Chronic insomnia is thought to result from stress-related physiologic hyperarousal (somatic arousal) that makes it difficult for an individual to fall or stay asleep. Obstructive sleep apnea is thought to result from obstructive respiratory events causing arousals, sleep fragmentation, and recurrent oxygen desaturation. Although the two disorders seem different, they predispose to the same long-term, stress-related illnesses, and when they occur in the same individual, each affects the other's response to treatment; they interact. This report of three cases describes patients with both chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea in whom the chronic insomnia remitted with no specific treatment following treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with maxillomandibular advancement.Our three Caucasians patients each presented with severe, chronic insomnia associated with somatic arousal and fatigue occurring either alone, in association with bipolar disorder, or with temporomandibular joint syndrome. Polysomnography revealed that each patient also had mild obstructive sleep apnea, despite only one snoring audibly. One patient experienced a modest improvement in her somatic arousal, insomnia severity, and fatigue with autotitrating nasal continuous positive airway pressure, but the other two did not tolerate nasal continuous positive airway pressure. None of the patients received treatment for insomnia. All three patients subsequently underwent maxillomandibular advancement to treat mild obstructive sleep apnea and experienced prolonged, complete resolution of somatic arousal, chronic insomnia, and fatigue. The patient with bipolar disorder also experienced complete remission of his symptoms of depression during the 1 year he was followed postoperatively.These three cases lend support to the hypothesis that chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea share a pathophysiology of chronic stress. Among patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the stress response is directed at inspiratory airflow limitation during sleep (hypopnea, snoring, and inaudible fluttering of the throat). Therefore, when chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea occur in one individual, aggressive treatment of obstructive sleep apnea may lead to a reduction in chronic stress that causes the patient's chronic insomnia to remit.",

Assessment of these case are often not straightforward, and their certification can be some of the most difficult cases that a forensic pathologist can be faced with in respect to the determination of both cause manner of death. Perceived unfair and/or unpopular certifications of these cases can result in professional criticism, allegations of bias, complicity or bias by certifying pathologist, social dissatisfaction/unrest and violent public protests.

Concomitant treatment with medications and post-sleep deprivation chronotherapies such as bright light therapy and sleep phase advance can lengthen the maintenance of improvement from weeks to months. Accumulating data support depression as a circadian-related illness, as evidenced by abnormalities in sleep, mood, hormonal secretions, and/or temperature in a subgroup of depressed patients. An estimated 70%–80% of depressed patients complain of sleep disturbances, including insomnia, -morning awakening, and difficulty in initiating sleep. Studies of the mechanisms of action of sleep deprivation may provide potentially important clues as to the switch process. Sleep deprivation in animals has a wide range of physiological and cognitive effects. Relatively little is understood about the interaction between sleep and depression and why sleep patterns frequently normalize with improvement in symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

Dyspnea is comparable to pain because both caution the organism that will activate protective mechanisms to avoid further damage. Dyspnea results from central nervous processing of respiratory feed back signals. Feed back from respiratory muscles, the chest wall, the airways and the lung reach the brain while partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide is continuously monitored and arterial blood gases are permanently stabilized. Sensation of breathlessness depends on its origin. Main qualities of dyspnea include air hunger during hypercapnia, laboured breathing during increased minute ventilation and chest tightness in asthma. During chronic dyspnea, respiratory control aims for a new breathing pattern that will ease breathlessness. Since respiratory control includes both autonomic regulation and cortical modulation of breathing, voluntarily guided respiration can be employed to influence other autonomic regulated systems and pain perception.",

Subjective sleepiness has little been used for the clinical evaluation of sleepiness. Objective sleepiness is defined as a consequence of the homeostatic need for sleep. In the absence of a measurable marker of the fulfillment of the function of sleep, the evaluation of objective sleepiness has to rely on a behavioral approach based on the postulate that the more you need sleep (i.e., the sleepier you are), the more likely you are to fall asleep. However, as for many other fundamental human behaviors (drinking, eating, sexual behavior), it is likely that the sleeping behavior serves other purposes than its primary objective, which distorts the relationship between the observed sleeping behavior and the actual need for sleep. The likelihood to fall asleep can be measured by the speed with which a sleep episode occurs under standardized laboratory conditions (multiple sleep latency test, maintenance of wakefulness test, OSLER test), or by the frequency of unwanted sleep episodes under the more naturalistic conditions of daily life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale). These various approaches have advantages and drawbacks, but none of them can be considered the \"gold standard\".",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent at menopausal transition and substantially affect the quality of life in midlife women. Diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances are essential parts of the management of menopausal symptoms. Persistent insomnia in midlife is not a single entity, and is not always linked with menopause per se. Detailed patient history supplemented with appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests is the basis for correct diagnosis. Insomnia in midlife women can be divided into four major categories: (1) menopausal insomnia (often related to climacteric vasomotor symptoms); (2) primary (psychophysiologic) insomnia; (3) secondary insomnia (associated with other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing), mental (e.g., anxiety or depression) or medical (e.g., fibromyalgia) disorders or aging; and (4) insomnia induced by behavioral, environmental, or psychosocial factors. Careful evaluation of the nature of the menopausal insomnia will help choosing the best therapy for each individual. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy, behavioral interventions as well as medication targeting the specific underlying medical condition (such as pain, anxiety, or depression). Conventional hypnotic agents rarely provide long-term benefit in chronic forms of insomnia. This chapter provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of menopausal insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep-related hallucinations, encompassing visual and auditory experiences pose a complex clinical challenge. Here, we illustrate 2 cases with diverse underlying etiologies. Report of case(s) Case 1: 76-year-old male with 3 months of nocturnal visual hallucinations, occurring 3-5 nights per week. These ranged from familiar and unfamiliar faces and characters reminiscent of movies. Symptoms occurred when waking up in the middle of the night, with difficulty returning to sleep. Polysomnography (PSG) unveiled moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) without findings indicative of parasomnias and no symptoms on the night of PSG. Brain MRI revealed chronic infarcts involving right basal ganglia and bilateral optic radiations. Lesions of structures that commonly cause visual hallucinations (optic lens, retina, thalamus, midbrain) were absent. The frequency of episodes decreased to 1-2 per month after initiating CPAP therapy. Potential mechanism of improvement could be PAP mediated optimization of perfusion to the ischemic penumbra. Case 2: 93-year-old male with an eight-year history of insomnia due to musical hallucinations (MH). Auditory experiences included church and semi-classical music, with 80% being familiar tunes. The patient, a former church choir member, has a history of progressive hearing loss and tinnitus. Brain MRI/MRA revealed chronic periventricular microvascular ischemic changes. Extended EEG showed no evidence of seizures. Audiometry confirmed moderate-severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. No response was seen to Levetiracetam, Gabapentin, Donepezil and behavioral therapy. Home sleep study revealed severe OSA. CPAP therapy did not result in improvement of MH. MH improved significantly with Lorazepam. Hypoacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy and intoxication are common etiologies for MH. The etiology in this case is very likely due to hypoacusis. The hypothesis is deafferentation resulting in release phenomenon or spontaneous activity in the auditory pathway, manifesting as MH. Conclusion Sleep-related and nocturnal hallucinations warrant a comprehensive evaluation. Differential diagnoses include neurological causes, including stroke, seizure, Multiple Sclerosis, tumor, vascular lesions, and neurodegenerative disorders. Other etiologies include psychiatric disorders, medications, alcohol, otologic and ophthalmic pathologies. It is also reasonable to evaluate for comorbid OSA as appropriate treatment may decrease the frequency of episodes and improve overall sleep in some patients. Support (if any)",

Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause.

Later, all spontaneous eye movements cease but nystagmus can be still elicited by stimulation. Finally, a depth is reached where no eye reaction can be elicited and this is shortly followed by signs of respiratory depression. The course, in general, seems to be one of stimulation of eye movements initially, followed by gradual depression. While the exact sequence of events is somewhat variable, successive observations afford a useful and delicate check on the progress of therapeutic coma if they are used in conjunction with other findings.

      "abstract": "Encephalopathy with continuous spike-waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS) evolves over time, and three stages can be recognized: before the onset of CSWS, during CSWS, and after the CSWS period. Clinical seizures tend to remit spontaneously around puberty. This pattern is independent of the etiological lesion. The CSWS also disappears in all cases. Focal abnormalities instead, may persist for some time after the disappearance of CSWS. The disappearance of the clinical seizures and CSWS may be simultaneous or seizures may disappear before or after disappearance of the CSWS pattern on the EEG. Electroclinical parameters in the pre-CSWS period that have been proposed to predict a poor outcome are early-onset seizures, appearance of new seizures, and a significant increase in seizure frequency. From the electrical point of view, an increase in the frequency of the interictal EEG paroxysms while awake and during sleep and bilateral spike-and-wave paroxysms may also be predictive of a poor evolution in CSWS. When CSWS disappears, neurocognitive and behavioral status improve, but in most patients, residual moderate to severe neurocognitive impairments remain. In non-lesional epilepsy, cognitive recovery after cessation of the CSWS depends on the severity and duration of the initial regression. The duration of the CSWS seems to be the most important predictor of cognitive outcome. Early recognition and effective therapy to reduce the seizures and resolve the CSWS may be crucial to improve long-term prognosis. Cognitive recovery is observed in patients who respond well to AED treatment and outcome depends on the etiology.",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) develops after exposure to an extremely traumatic event such as death, injury, or physical threat to self, family member, or other significant person. Admission to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with acute disease carries a high level of stress for families, as the disease is of sudden onset and is life-threatening. The incidence of PTSD (21%) was significant among parents well after their child was discharged from the PICU. Symptoms of PTSD include reexperiencing the traumatic event through recurrent, intrusive recollections, repetitive play, or distressing dreams; avoidance of associations with the event through restricted affect and feelings of detachment; and hyperarousal symptoms such as sleep difficulties, poor concentration, irritability, aggression, and physiological reactivity to trauma-related events. In addition to general hyperarousal symptoms, children may complain of stomachaches and headaches. There have been many summaries and reviews of research published regarding the effects of hospitalization with these children. Findings indicate that the experience is, indeed, stressful and that children may experience fear phenomena, regression, sadness, separation anxiety, withdrawal, sleep disturbances, and aggressive behaviors. There was a positive correlation between PTSD symptoms in parents and PTSD symptoms in the child, length of admission and perceived threat of illness to the child’s life. In PICU admissions cause greater disruption to a child’s life, with longer admissions, greater time off school and more paediatric out-patient contacts and hospital re-admissions in the 6–12 months after discharge.",

      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis is classified as a parasomnia associated with rapid-eye-movement periods (REMPs). The paralysis is consistent with atonia observed during normal REMPs produced by hyperpolarization of the spinal motoneurons originating in cholinoceptive neurons in dorsolateral regions of the pontine reticular formation. Estimates of RISP prevalence vary dramatically, yielding estimates between 6% and 40%. Sleep paralysis is often considered as a sleep-onset problem under the assumption that episodes occur at the beginning of the sleep period during Sleep Onset REM Period (SOREMP). Multiphase sleep-wake schedule (MPS) regimes likely produce high level of cognitive arousal precipitating episodes by increasing potential for waking during immediate post-interruption REMPs. Vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations likely arise via interactions between subcortical and cortical vestibular centers.

      "title": "Spinal cerebrospinal fluid leakage: clinical features, diagnostic procedures, and treatment",
      "abstract": "The most prominent symptom of spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is an orthostatic, tension-type headache. Other well-known symptoms include nausea, vomiting, photophobia, diplopia, depression, and amnesia. The authors address other commonly encountered symptoms such as dizziness, hearing disturbances, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, and gustatory and olfactory disturbances.The dizziness experienced in this disorder is essentially characterized as a kind of “floating sensation” or “walking on the clouds” and is associated with a high degree of unsteadiness. A considerable percentage of patients cannot remain standing even when their eyes are open; to-and-fro perturbations are particularly prominent in these patients. Rotatory vertigo attacks can occur in a small portion of patients, but usually only during the early stages of the disease. As with the headache, dizziness is aggravated by an upright or standing position. The weather also influences the intensity of both the headaches and dizziness: both are exacerbated when the atmospheric pressure is low or is falling rapidly. Water intake and/or the drip infusion of a physiological salt solution may temporarily improve dizziness and other symptoms.The usefulness of MRI for diagnosing spinal cerebrospinal fluid leakage is limited. MRI findings are equivocal in most cases; therefore, the authors perform 111In-DTPA scintigraphy for each patient in whom this disorder is suspected.The first choice of treatment for this disorder is bed rest and water intake and/or drip infusion. When these treatments are ineffective, an epidural autologous blood patch is attempted. However, not all patients are cured by this procedure, and dizziness, hearing, and/or tinnitus may worsen after treatment. In some patients, an exploratory tympanotomy is required to rule out associated or treatment-induced perilymphatic fistula.In conclusion, spinal CSF leakage is not a rare disorder, and because this disorder presents with an extremely wide spectrum of symptoms, all physicians in any field of specialization may encounter a patient with this disorder. All physicians should keep this disorder in mind.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders have reached epidemic rates in the modern world. It is important to note that they can affect children as well as adults. Sleep is of the utmost importance for the maintenance of body homeostasis. Many disease processes affecting sleep have been associated with numerous symptoms, including cognitive impairment, fatigue as well as a wide range of behavioral, hormonal and metabolic derangements. Sleep disorders in childhood can be classified by age of incidence (in infants, toddlers, school-age children or adolescents) and by the exact nature of the symptoms. They are classified in insomnias, hypersomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm disorders and respiratory disorders which affect sleep. Parasomnias are the most common sleep disorders in toddlers, with night terrors, nightmares and sleepwalking being the most common. Respiratory disorders are the most important in older children, especially obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. All sleep disorders are clinically manifested with symptoms of sleep deprivation. Their management always involves improvement of sleep hygiene, though in some cases (such as obstructive sleep apnea) specific medical treatment is also available and warranted. A three-way relationship of trust, compassion and cooperation between child, family and healthcare professional is a prerequisite for the effective management of childhood sleep disorders. Nursing staff are the main factor cultivating that relationship in the context of inpatient care.",

      "title": "Dead in the Night: Sleep-Wake and Time-Of-Day Influences on Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related death in patients with refractory epilepsy. Convergent lines of evidence suggest that SUDEP occurs due to seizure induced perturbation of respiratory, cardiac, and electrocerebral function as well as potential predisposing factors. It has been consistently observed that SUDEP happens more during the night and the early hours of the morning. The aim of this review is to discuss evidence from patient cases, clinical studies, and animal research which is pertinent to the nocturnality of SUDEP. There are a number of factors which might contribute to the nighttime predilection of SUDEP. These factors fall into four categories: influences of (1) being unwitnessed, (2) lying prone in bed, (3) sleep-wake state, and (4) circadian rhythms. During the night, seizures are more likely to be unwitnessed; therefore, it is less likely that another person would be able to administer a lifesaving intervention. Patients are more likely to be prone on a bed following a nocturnal seizure. Being prone in the accoutrements of a bed during the postictal period might impair breathing and increase SUDEP risk. Sleep typically happens at night and seizures which emerge from sleep might be more dangerous. Lastly, there are circadian changes to physiology during the night which might facilitate SUDEP. These possible explanations for the nocturnality of SUDEP are not mutually exclusive. The increased rate of SUDEP during the night is likely multifactorial involving both situational factors, such as being without a witness and prone, and physiological changes due to the influence of sleep and circadian rhythms. Understanding the causal elements in the nocturnality of SUDEP may be critical to the development of effective preventive countermeasures.",

      "title": "Insomnia disorder: State of the science and challenges for the future",
      "abstract": "Summary Insomnia disorder comprises symptoms during night and day that strongly affect quality of life and wellbeing. Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low mood are key daytime impairments. Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnostic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self‐report. Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive‐behavioural models to (epi‐) genetics and psychoneurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep–wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive‐behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first‐line treatment for insomnia worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to therapy, cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive‐behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines. However, given the still considerable proportion of patients responding insufficiently to cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying insomnia. Mediators and moderators of treatment response/non‐response and the associated development of tailored and novel interventions also require investigation. Recent studies suggest that treatment of insomnia may prove to add significantly as a preventive strategy to combat the global burden of mental disorders.",

In one-third of patients the headache is preceded by transient neurological symptoms that are most frequently visual but may involve other senses and speech [migraine with aura (MA)]. Migraine is extremely prevalent [affecting 17% of females and 8% of men], very expensive ($18.5 billion Euros per year in Europe], and disabling [one of the World Health Organization's top 20 most disabling disorders]. It is consequently a public fitness hassle of exceptional effect on each the man or woman and society. Most migraine assaults begin with inside the mind, as advised through (a) the premonitory signs (e.g., issue with speech and reading, expanded emotionality, sensory hypersensitive reaction) that during many sufferers are exceptionally predictive of the attack, even though such signs arise as much as 12 h earlier than the attack, and through (b) the character of a few usual migraine triggers which includes stress, sleep deprivation, oversleeping, hunger, and extended sensory stimulation. Psychophysical and neurophysiological research have supplied clean proof that with inside the duration among assaults migraines display hypersensitive reaction to sensory stimuli and odd processing of sensory information, characterized through expanded amplitudes and decreased habituation of evoked and event-associated potentials.

      "title": "Fatigue et qualité de vie chez les patients cancéreux.",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

Su evolucion natural sin tratamiento puede derivar en serias repercusiones negativas en el funcionamiento academico, social y familiar de los ninos, interfiriendo de forma importante en el desarrollo. Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

      "title": "Mechanisms of Raynaud’s disease",
      "abstract": "Raynaud's phenomenon is due to transient cessation of blood flow to the digits of the hands or feet. An attack of Raynaud’s phenomenon is classically manifested as triphasic color changes. The white phase is due to excessive vasoconstriction and cessation of regional blood flow. This phase is followed by a cyanotic phase, as the residual blood in the finger desaturates. The red phase is due to hyperemia as the attack subsides and blood flow is restored. An attack is frequently associated with pain and/or paresthesia due to sensory nerve ischemia. Variants of Raynaud’s phenomenon include acrocyanosis and primary livedo reticularis, each of which is associated with reduced skin blood flow, exacerbated by cold or emotional upset. Raynaud’s phenomenon in the absence of other disorders is primary Raynaud’s phenomenon, or Raynaud’s disease. The mechanisms of Raynaud’s disease include increased activation of the sympathetic nerves, in response to cold or emotion; an impaired habituation of the cardiovascular response to stress may contribute. In addition, there appears to be a local fault, which is likely multifactorial. This local fault is due to an alteration in vascular function rather than vascular structure. The alteration in vascular function may be related to increased sensitivity to cold of the adrenergic receptors on the digital artery vascular smooth muscle. In some cases, locally released or systemically circulating vasoconstrictors may participate, including endothelin, 5-hydroxytryptamine and thromboxane. A deficiency or increased degradation of nitric oxide, possibly due to increased oxidative stress, may be involved in some cases. These recent pathophysiological insights may lead to new therapeutic options.",

      "abstract": "Many witnesses attest that victims of a disaster often perish because they 'freeze' in the face of danger. It has been proposed that this cognitive paralysis occurs due to temporal and cognitive constraints on survival response times while leaving open the question of which cognitive component is implicated in this behavior. This paper proposes, firstly, that the temporal constraints which occur during an emergency inhibit the functioning of the supervisory attentional system (SAS), which leads to the victim showing: (1) an appropriate response, if trained; (2) stereotypical or otherwise irrational behavior, if untrained; or (3) cognitive paralysis. Secondly, that the main role of the SAS is to operate as a temporal buffer, enabling a survival response to be prepared prior to facing a life-threatening event and not as a real-time immediate responder. It is argued that the initial cognitive paralysis differs at the cognitive and neurological levels from the more prolonged hypoactive behavior commonly seen in victims rescued from disasters and which is considered to be a form of disassociative reaction.",

      "abstract": "While insomnia is the second most common mental disorder, progress in our understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms has been limited. The present review addresses the definition and prevalence of insomnia and explores its subjective and objective characteristics across the 24-hour day. Subsequently, the review extensively addresses how the vulnerability to develop insomnia is affected by genetic variants, early life stress, major life events, and brain structure and function. Further supported by the clear mental health risks conveyed by insomnia, the integrated findings suggest that the vulnerability to develop insomnia could rather be found in brain circuits regulating emotion and arousal than in circuits involved in circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation. Finally, a testable model is presented. The model proposes that in people with a vulnerability to develop insomnia, the locus coeruleus is more sensitive to-or receives more input from-the salience network and related circuits, even during rapid eye movement sleep, when it should normally be sound asleep. This vulnerability may ignite a downward spiral of insufficient overnight adaptation to distress, resulting in accumulating hyperarousal, which, in turn, impedes restful sleep and moreover increases the risk of other mental health adversity. Sensitized brain circuits are likely to be subjectively experienced as \"sleeping with one eye open\". The proposed model opens up the possibility for novel intervention studies and animal studies, thus accelerating the ignition of a neuroscience of insomnia, which is direly needed for better treatment.",

      "abstract": "The article discusses the work of a psychologist with personality’s crises. Among them are personal crises, professional crises, and family crises. The author emphasizes that there are different crises. For example, a developmental crisis is a change that is a normal part of a person’s life and can be successfully experienced only when a person learns to cope with his or her situation. At the same time, a situational crisis is the result of an unexpected trauma. Sometimes these developmental crises or situational crises can occur simultaneously, and when this happens, the crisis is usually more devastating for the individual. The understanding of psychological trauma is also revealed and its peculiarities are indicated. It is determined that the consequences of trauma may include: changes in sleep patterns, panic attacks, withdrawal, obsessive thoughts, rather easy personality scaring, increased vigilance, etc. Some of the ways in which trauma can manifest itself in the body include: chronic illness or pain, sleep problems, frequent headaches or chest pain, etc. The author suggests ways of psychological assistance in case of crises and mental trauma, with an emphasis on the work of a psychologist in the method of art therapy, a form of psychological assistance based on safe and natural for a person fine arts, fairy tale therapy, phototherapy, sand therapy etc. It is emphasized that due to the creative process, art therapy can be a valuable therapeutic approach in dealing with trauma and personal crises. It is substantiated that the use of art to express emotions opens up access to both visual memory and bodily memory, as it not only allows people to create images. The use of art materials such as clay and paint can reconnect with physical sensations that may be cut off from their bodily sensations. Since researchers suggest that touch and sight are directly linked to the fear center in the human brain, art therapy is suitable for working with traumatic memory.",

      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of corresponding external sound(s). Tinnitus can be perceived in one or both ears or in the head. It is usually described as an unpleasant noise, but in some patients it takes the form of a ringing, buzzing, hissing, humming, or whistling sound, or as ticking, clicking, roaring, tunes, songs, or beeping. It is estimated that 1 out of every 5 people experience some degree of tinnitus. Tinnitus is not itself a disease but an unwelcome symptom. It can be accompanied by audiometric evidence of deafness which occurs in association with both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss resulting from a range of underlying causes, including ear infections, foreign objects orwax in the ear, and injury from loud noises. Tinnitus is also a side-effect of some metabolic disorders, medications, and may also result from an abnormally low level of serotonin or high level of insulin. As mentioned above, some foods are found by some people to make their tinnitus worse. The inner ear, like the brain, is totally lacking in energy reserves. Its metabolism depends directly on the supply of oxygen and glucose from the blood supply. Alterations in glucose metabolism therefore have great potential for disturbing the workings of the inner ear. Because tinnitus is often defined as a subjective phenomenon, it is difficult to measure using objective tests. Although there is no specific cure for tinnitus, those affected can learn techniques to successfully manage their tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a problem for them.",

      "abstract": "Olfactory impairment is a well‐established sequela of head injury. The presence and degree of olfactory dysfunction is dependent on severity of head trauma, duration of posttraumatic amnesia, injuries obtained, and as more recently established, age. Deficits in smell can be conductive or neurosensory, contingent on location of injury. The former may be amenable to medical or surgical treatment, whereas the majority of patients with neurosensory deficits will not recover. Many patients will not seek treatment for such deficits until days, weeks, or even months after the traumatic event due to focus on more pressing injuries. Evaluation should start with a comprehensive history and physical exam. Determination of the site of injury can be aided by CT and MRI scanning. Verification of the presence of olfactory deficit, and assessment of its severity requires objective olfactory testing, which can be accomplished with a number of methods. The prognosis of posttraumatic olfactory dysfunction is unfortunate, with approximately only one third improving. Emphasis must be placed on identification of reversible causes, such as nasal bone fractures, septal deviation, or mucosal edema/hematoma. Olfactory loss is often discounted as an annoyance, rather than a major health concern by both patients and many healthcare providers. Patients with olfactory impairment have diminished quality of life, decreased satisfaction with life, and increased risk for personal injury. Paramount to the management of these patients is counseling with regard to adoption of compensatory strategies to avoid safety risks and maximize quality of life. Practicing otolaryngologists should have a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of traumatic olfactory dysfunction in order to effectively diagnose, manage, and counsel affected patients.",

      "title": "A CASE OF SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITOR‐INDUCED RAPID EYE MOVEMENT BEHAVIOR DISORDER",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is often seen in older patients and is characterized by a loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep.1,2 As a result, the disease manifests as nocturnal motor activity consistent with the enactment of dream content, for example grabbing the bed partner in response to a dream about falling from a cliff. RBD often results in injury to the patient, bed partner, or both.1,2 In perhaps up to two-thirds of cases, RBD is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, most notably the alpha-synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease, multiple systems atrophy), often antedating other manifestations of these disorders by many years.1–4 Other cases seem to be idiopathic, although it has been suggested that various medications, notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and other antidepressants, may commonly induce RBD.1,4,5 In spite of this assertion, there have been few supporting case reports.5,6 The authors recently cared for a man who clearly developed RBD as a result of SSRI treatment; the use of the SSRI for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) complicated the clinical picture. An 87-year-old male World War II veteran had been treated for PTSD with associated nightmares but no nocturnal motor activity with bupropion and lorazepam. Past medical history was significant only for essential hypertension. In 1998, after many years of treatment, sertraline was added because of increasing symptoms. Within 6 months of adding sertraline, the patient developed frequent nocturnal motor behavior consistent with the content of his dreams and nightmares, for example punching and choking his wife in the context of a dream about being in a fight. As a result, he and his wife had suffered lacerations and contusions. Other behaviors included running out of his bedroom or running into a window. Upon awakening, he was able to recall portions of the dreams but was unaware of the motor behaviors. Trials of temazepam, zolpidem, and trazodone were ineffective in improving these behaviors. Ultimately, a diagnosis of RBD was made based on the clinical presentation. Clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime was added, which resulted in a moderate decrease in the frequency of the nocturnal motor activity, from nightly to two or three times per week. After 3 months, sertraline was slowly tapered and discontinued, which resulted in a complete cessation of all nocturnal motor behavior. He remained free of nocturnal motor activity for 5 months, until sertraline was inadvertently restarted after the loss of his wife. Within 1 month of restarting sertraline, the nocturnal motor behavior returned. There has thus far been no evidence of dementia or of parkinsonism. This patient's clinical presentation was typical of RBD; unfortunately, his and his wife's injuries were also typical. It seems clear that his RBD was SSRI induced; it developed after sertraline was started, did not definitively improve until it was stopped, and recurred after it was inadvertently restarted, and there was no evidence of parkinsonism or dementia over the previous 12 years. Although there are few published cases of SSRI-induced overt RBD, increased electromyography activity during REM sleep has been demonstrated in patients taking SSRIs. (None of the patients were being treated for PTSD.)7 The relationship between RBD and PTSD is complex and not fully investigated. There is clinical and polysomnographic evidence of greater motor activity during REM sleep in patients with PTSD,8 and greater prevalence of RBD was noted in a cohort of patients with PTSD.9 SSRIs are effective for PTSD-related nightmares10 but may cause RBD, clonazepam is effective for RBD1,2,4 but not for PTSD-related nightmares,10 and RBD is not associated with the typical diurnal symptoms of PTSD. In spite of his long history of PTSD and related nightmares, this patient had never exhibited any significant motor activity during sleep until the SSRI was started. RBD is relatively common in geriatric practice and should be explored in any patient with nocturnal injuries or motor activity. RBD responds well to treatment, generally with clonazepam. Discontinuation of SSRIs or changing to a different class of antidepressant (if feasible) may also be a viable option for some patients.

      "title": "Indicators used in livestock to assess unconsciousness after stunning: a review",
      "abstract": "Assessing unconsciousness is important to safeguard animal welfare shortly after stunning at the slaughter plant. Indicators that can be visually evaluated are most often used when assessing unconsciousness, as they can be easily applied in slaughter plants. These indicators include reflexes originating from the brain stem (e.g. eye reflexes) or from the spinal cord (e.g. pedal reflex) and behavioural indicators such as loss of posture, vocalisations and rhythmic breathing. When physically stunning an animal, for example, captive bolt, most important indicators looked at are posture, righting reflex, rhythmic breathing and the corneal or palpebral reflex that should all be absent if the animal is unconscious. Spinal reflexes are difficult as a measure of unconsciousness with this type of stunning, as they may occur more vigorous. For stunning methods that do not physically destroy the brain, for example, electrical and gas stunning, most important indicators looked at are posture, righting reflex, natural blinking response, rhythmic breathing, vocalisations and focused eye movement that should all be absent if the animal is unconscious. Brain stem reflexes such as the cornea reflex are difficult as measures of unconsciousness in electrically stunned animals, as they may reflect residual brain stem activity and not necessarily consciousness. Under commercial conditions, none of the indicators mentioned above should be used as a single indicator to determine unconsciousness after stunning. Multiple indicators should be used to determine unconsciousness and sufficient time should be left for the animal to die following exsanguination before starting invasive dressing procedures such as scalding or skinning. The recording and subsequent assessment of brain activity, as presented in an electroencephalogram (EEG), is considered the most objective way to assess unconsciousness compared with reflexes and behavioural indicators, but is only applied in experimental set-ups. Studies performed in an experimental set-up have often looked at either the EEG or reflexes and behavioural indicators and there is a scarcity of studies that correlate these different readout parameters. It is recommended to study these correlations in more detail to investigate the validity of reflexes and behavioural indicators and to accurately determine the point in time at which the animal loses consciousness.",

      "abstract": "DIABETES INSIPIDUS is generally considered to be the result of a disturbance in the production or release of an antidiuretic hormone by the pars nervosa of the pituitary gland. The condition may be produced experimentally in the following ways: (1) destruction of the supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus by electrolytic lesions, (2) transection of the pituitary stalk, which interrupts the nerve supply to the posterior lobe, and (3) removal of the pars nervosa. The polyuria begins immediately after this last procedure and usually continues throughout the life of the subject. The onset of the permanent polyuria after the first and second procedure is more complex. The normal course of events following interruption of the supraoptico hypophysial tract may be divided into three characteristic phases (Fisher, Ingram and Ranson, 1938): (1) Transient phase which begins soon after the operation and lasts 1 to 7 days.",

      "abstract": "Sleep in depressed patients resembles sleep in normal subjects whose circadian rhythms of temperature and rapid-eye-movement sleep are phase-advanced (shifted earlier) relative to their sleep schedules. If this analogy is relevant to the pathophysiology of depressive illness, advancing the time of sleep and awakening should temporarily compensate for the abnormal timing of depressed patients' circadian rhythms. Four of seven manic-depressive patients studied longitudinally spontaneously advanced their times of awakening (activity onset) as they emerged from the depressive phase of their illness. In a phase-shift experiment, a depressed manic-depressive woman was twice brought out of depression for 2 weeks by advancing her sleep period so that she went to sleep and arose 6 hours earlier than usual. The antidepressant effect of the procedure was temporary and similar in duration to circadian desynchronization induced by jet lag in healthy subjects. This result supports the hypothesis that abnormalities of sleep patterns in some types of depression are due to abnormal internal phase relationships of circadian rhythms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

The types and frequency of sleep disturbance tend to vary with age and, although some remit spontaneously, a substantial proportion of them persist. Particularly high rates of sleep disturbance occur in children who have learning disabilities, are physically ill, or psychologically disturbed. The immediate effects of sleep problems are important but so, also, are the longer-term effects which may influence the child's physical, psychological, and social development. Persistent sleep disturbance is associated with behavioural disturbance in children and may affect performance in school. Raised levels of maternal stress and impairment of parenting skills have also been reported as a consequence.",

      "abstract": "Nystagmus can have either a jerk (slow and quick phase) or a pendular waveform. Saccadic oscillations can either be back-to-back saccades or have an interval between two saccades. Both nystagmus and oscillations can decrease visual acuity and cause oscillopsia. Each type of nystagmus is attributable to instability or an inadequacy of specific ocular motor systems, including vestibular, optokinetic, smooth pursuit, fixation and the neural integrator. Saccadic oscillations are attributable to instability of the saccadic system. Nystagmus that develops during infancy will not decrease visual acuity if the foveation time within each slow phase is adequate (>60 msec). Infantile nystagmus also does not cause oscillopsia, possibly because the internal spatial visual map is reupdated before each phase of this type of nystagmus (efference copy). There is no foveation period or adequate efference copy reupdate in acquired nystagmus. Consequently, acquired nystagmus usually results in decreased visual acuity and oscillopsia. For most forms of treatment, the goal is directed toward stopping the oscillations or their visual consequences rather than towards the underlying mechanism. Several treatment modalities have been suggested. The most success has been found with gabapentin in the treatment of acquired pendular nystagmus and baclofen in the treatment for acquired periodic alternating nystagmus. There is a need for multicenter trials to evaluate systematically potential treatments of the other types nystagmus and oscillations.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a human prion disease that is characterized by sleep-wake cycle deterioration, loss of slow-wave sleep, and motor overactivation over the daily 24-hour period. Patient concerns: Here, we report the case of a 57-year-old man who had an irregular sleep-wake cycle and exhibited frequent movements and vocalizations during sleep. Diagnoses: Video-polysomnography showed disrupted sleep structure, rapid alternation between sleep stages, and an absence of sleep spindles and slow-wave sleep. Moreover, body movements persisted throughout the entire sleep period, including rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The atonia index was very low (<0.025) during REM sleep. Genetic testing revealed a prion protein gene mutation at codon 178, and the patient was diagnosed with FFI. Interventions: We tried to treat with amantadine, doxycycline, and immunotherapies, but the disease progressed. Outcomes: Sleep disturbance is the most frequent and essential symptom of FFI. Lessons: FFI is difficult to diagnose due to the low sensitivity of diagnostic tools. Diagnoses can be further supported by better knowledge of typical polysomnographic findings.",

This unease is compounded by the confrontation with the life histories that dissociative patients report. Responses to such histories not infrequently range from an uncritical acceptance of the historical accuracy of everything that such a patient reports, allied with an expectation that many as yet uncovered traumas will in time emerge, through to an extreme scepticism that destroys empathy. This scepticism may, at an unconscious level, also be self-serving: the more sceptical or dismissive one is, the less the likelihood of being referred such patients and, if referred, the less likely such patients are going to feel comfortable about revealing what is so obviously displeasing.

Very often and most heavy are pharmacogenic depressions following recovery from schizophrenic symptoms (under fluphenazine-decanoate up to about three quarters of the patients).

They have greater potential for neural plasticity and language recovery, although they often have persisting difficulties in oral and written language. Alternatively, there may be a presentation with a paroxysmal event such as a seizure or a period of depressed consciousness, and the unusual behaviour that may accompany dysphasia and dysarthria may be misinterpreted in the child, whereas for the adult with the more common ‘stroke-like’ presentation, it would be immediately considered.

The most common symptoms include: difficulty with concentration and attention, slowed speed of mental processing, anxiety, emotional lability, sensitivity to noise, fatigue, dizziness, and/or headache. The statistics regarding postconcussion syndrome vary considerably with the population studied. Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period. These biological changes interact with the numerous psychological factors that come into play during the same time.",

      "abstract": "Tics are abnormal, repetitive movements or sounds that are under only limited voluntary control. Tics are commonly classified as either motor (able to be seen but not heard) or vocal (producing an audible sound). Both types of tics are caused by sudden muscle contractions and share a similar pathophysiology. The most common presenting tic of childhood is probably eye blinking. Other simple motor tics include eye movements, mouth opening, facial grimacing, and neck jerking. More complex motor tics include slow and sustained (dystonic) movements such as brief torticollis, shoulder shrugs/rolls, and blepharospasm (forced eye closure). Simple vocal tics include sniffing, coughing, clearing the throat, and humming. More complex vocal tics include echolalia (repeating others' words), palilalia (repeating one's own words), and abnormal breathing patterns. Fortunately the most obtrusive tics such as coprolalia (obscene words) and copropraxia (obscene gestures) are not common, especially in childhood.",

Typical dream reports include such psychological features as hallucinations, delusions, cognitive abnormalities, emotional intensification, and amnesia. These five remarkable features of dreaming have invited its comparison to abnormal states of mind occurring during waking in certain clinical conditions, especially schizophrenia and organic syndromes. The exploration of the neurobiological basis of dreaming therefore constitutes not only an aspect of mind-body interaction but also a model approach to the study of mental illness. An obvious problem is that the unconfirmable nature of all subjective experience is compounded by difficult access to the mind in sleep. The recent development of sleep laboratory techniques has given the study of dreaming a more instrumental and systematic character, and the emerging picture encourages psychophysiological integration.",

Systemic speech underdevelopment in alalia is characterized by violations in the phonetic, phonemic, lexical, and grammatical structure. Patients with alalia can also have non-speech related impairments, including motor (impaired movement and coordination), sensory (impaired sensitivity and perception), and psychopathological disorders. There are three types of alalia: motor, sensory, and mixed. Children with motor alalia have expressive language disorders, speech praxis, poor speech fluency, impaired articulation, and other focal neurological symptoms; however, they understand speech directed to them. Patients with motor alalia are often left-handed. Regional slowing and epileptiform activity are often detected on their electroencephalogram. Children with sensory alalia are characterized by poor speech understanding (despite normal hearing) resulting in secondary underdevelopment of their own speech. These patients have problems with the analysis of sounds, including speech sounds (impaired speech gnosis), which prevents the development of association between the sound image and the object. Therefore, the child hears, but does not understand the speech directed at him/her (auditory agnosia). Differential diagnosis of alalia is challenging and may require several months of observation. It also implies the exclusion of hearing loss and mental disorders.",

      "title": "Mental pain and suicide risk: implications for neuroimaging",
      "abstract": "Abstract Campaigns have been launched to make sense of what makes a specific individual suicidal. We know that suicidal individuals give definite warning signs, mainly from their ambivalence about ending their own lives. Classical suicidology posited that the suicidal individual experiences unbearable psychological pain ( psychache ) or suffering and that suicide might be, at least in part, an attempt to escape from this suffering, emphasizing that suicide is not a movement toward death but rather an escape from unbearable emotion and unendurable or unacceptable anguish. Suicide occurs when that individual deems the psychache to be unbearable. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated that such emotional pain shares the same neuroanatomical circuit of somatic pain. Furthermore, concepts related to death, failure, or other unfortunate circumstances activate specific cerebral areas in a suicidal individual compared to a non-suicidal subject. The author conducted a sizeable clinical investigation on mental pain related to psychiatric disorders and suicide risk. Implications for further research are discussed during the presentation.

Generally, people suffering from this condition complain bitterly, and sincerely, of not being able to sleep at all, yet when studied show sleep of normal duration and quality. Pathophysiology of paradoxical insomnia remains largely poorly understood.

      "abstract": "In noise effect research often the awakening reaction is maintained to be the only important health related reaction. The main argument is that sleep represents a trophotropic phase (\"energy storing\"). In contrast to this awakening reactions or lying awake belong to the ergotropic phase (\"energy consuming\"). Frequent or long awakening reactions endanger therefore the necessary recovery in sleep and, in the long-run, health. Findings derived from arousal and stress hormone research make possible a new access to the noise induced nightly health risk. An arousal is a short change in sleeping condition, raising the organism from a lower level of excitation to a higher one. Arousals have the function to prevent life-threatening influences or events through activation of compensation mechanisms. Frequent occurrences of arousal triggered by nocturnal noise leads to a deformation of the circadian rhythm. Additionally, the deep sleep phases in the first part of the night are normally associated with a minimum of cortisol and a maximum of growth hormone concentrations. These circadian rhythms of sleep and neuroendocrine regulation are necessary for the physical as well as for the psychic recovery of the sleeper. Noise exposure during sleep which causes frequent arousal leads to decreased performance capacity, drowsiness and tiredness during the day. Long-term disturbances of the described circadian rhythms have a deteriorating effect on health, even when noise induced awakenings are avoided.",

Yet, nocturnal events may provide important clues to sleep and neurological function. The diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal events can be difficult because of the frequent overlap of clinical descriptions and lack of diurnal findings. Patients may not follow the ''classical'' patterns of parasomnia or epilepsy, and some patients may have parasomnias provoked by other sleep disturbances or seizures. Thus, the diagnosis of these patients often requires intensive investigation and extensive neurophysiological monitoring.",

Rhythm disturbances occur more frequently among older people, who may lack many ordinary protections against accidents because of failing eyesight and hearing, an impaired sense of smell, forgetfulness, a slow reaction time, weakness, or painful and damaged joints. Such persons may be deprived by a momentary cardiac disturbance of the ability to respond quickly. Thus they may release control of a motor car so that it careens across a busy highway, or they may fall from a height or into moving machinery from a precarious footing. If the cardiac disturbance can be detected early enough, the potential accident victim can be withdrawn from peril; however, if the cardiac disturbance can be prevented, the old person may retain the personal ability to deal with hazards. Six illustrative cases, with electrocardiograms, are presented.",

      "title": "A contribution to the study of vasomotor reflexes",
      "abstract": "Abstract In dogs under ether or chloroform, stimulation of sensory nerves (saphenous, tibial, peroneal, sciatic, ulnar, and median) causes usually increased respiratory movements when narcosis is not profound or curare is not employed. These increased movements produce a fall of blood‐pressure, and when they are very violent, one cannot obtain any pressor reflex even with a strong stimulation. When much increased respiratory movements are prevented by very deep narcosis or brain compression, fall of blood‐pressure due to this cause does not occur. Mechanical interference with the circulation as a result of the increased movements of the thoracic walls seems to be the main cause of this fall, since it can be eliminated by opening the thorax. When this complication is not taken into careful consideration the results of vasomotor experiments are liable to be misinterpreted.",

      "abstract": "Hypnotherapy is a method that engages a person in relaxation and leads them into a trance-like condition. There are many benefits that can be obtained by doing hypnotherapy, one of which is to overcome sleep disorders or insomnia. Insomnia refers to a disruption or irregularity in sleep manifested as ongoing challenges in falling asleep or staying asleep and/or waking up too early. Anxiety is often linked to difficulties with sleep. Increased anxiety and fear can hinder the ability to both initially fall asleep and remain asleep throughout the night. In this case report, we report a female patient who complained of insomnia for 2 years. Patients complain that it is very difficult to start sleeping. In addition, patients also experience various symptoms such as fatigue, lack of focus and muscle tension in the neck and several places. This patient underwent hypnotherapy and found that the root of the problem was an anxiety disorder that she had not been aware of. This anxiety disorder is also confirmed by anamnesis and symptoms experienced by the patient and assessment using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). After the hypnotherapy session, we followed up with the patient for one week after the therapy session. Patients show significant changes with better sleep quality and reduced patient anxiety symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Sleep problems with behavioral origins occur in 20 to 30 percent of children and are especially common in children with medical, neurodevelopmental, or psychiatric disorders. Insomnia related to learned sleep onset associations is most common in infants and toddlers and is characterized by prolonged night waking, requiring parental intervention to restore sleep. It occurs when the child learns to associate falling asleep with specific experiences, such as being rocked or fed. Insomnia related to inadequate limit-setting is a disorder most common in children who are preschool-aged and older and is characterized by active resistance, verbal protests, and repeated demands at bedtime. Guidance to parents about healthy sleep practices helps to prevent sleep problems and is also an important first step in treatment. An integral part of the bedtime routine is the institution of a bedtime and sleep schedule that ensures a developmentally appropriate amount of sleep. A consistent nightly bedtime will help to set the circadian clock and enable the child to fall asleep more easily. Treatment of primary insomnia in older children and adolescents usually involves behavioral interventions that resemble those used in adults. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule is also important for older children and adolescents for whom poor sleep hygiene is a common cause of sleep problems. Pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of childhood insomnia is not a first-line treatment and should always be combined with behavioral therapy.",

      "abstract": "Two situations, which may of course interfere, are described in the field of psychological and psychiatric emergencies in child and adolescent: 1) therapeutic emergencies, true emergencies, linked to acute mental suffering or even distress in the child which it is important to relieve quickly. They are not always the object of an acute request for medical care, and when such a request is made, it is rarely based on what the child feels, but much more on noisy or troublesome behaviour or somatic manifestations of the latter, this last possibility producing a masked psychiatric emergency very characteristic of this age; 2) environmental emergencies represent a second form of emergency, defined by a situation which appears when the child's family or tutors suddenly decide that they can no longer face such a behaviour or such symptoms in the child. Intolerance then appears, or even rejection of the child from his home. The authors were led to determine this double dimension, concentrating their attention on the first few years of life, childhood from 4 to 5 years to 11 or 12 years and adolescence. Insisting on the dual necessity, even in emergency cases, of sufficient reflexion and necessary concentration of interest on problems as they are presented by the family, the authors describe the various stages of an emergency: entering into contact, evaluation of the situation, choice of the emergency procedure: gaining time or admission to hospital in a specialized unit. They end by taking into consideration the fact that one is never sufficiently attentive to the child himself and to his own way of dealing with the situation.",

      "title": "Retinal haemorrhages in shaken baby syndrome",
      "abstract": "Editor, Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) results from the injuries inflicted when an adult vigorously shakes an infant, usually < 1 year old (Johnson et al. 1995). The damage is even more serious when the shaking ends with impact (shaken impact syndrome) (Duhaime et al. 1998). The battered baby may not exhibit any external signs of abuse, which often makes diagnosis difficult. This is especially likely if the method of child abuse has been shaking. The shaking induces a whiplash-type motion in which acceleration−deceleration forces can cause retinal and brain injury which are not apparent to the naked eye. Shaken baby syndrome is defined by swelling of the brain, subdural haematomas and retinal haemorrhages, but some infants also show external signs of injury to the head, ranging from subtle soft tissue damage to skull fractures (Hanigan et al. 1986; Gilliland & Folberg 1996). The major risk factors for child abuse include poverty, lack of education, being a single parent, and alcoholism or other drug abuse. Furthermore, premature children with developmental delay in association with prolonged crying are more prone to becoming objects of violence (Starling et al. 1995; Lazoritz et al. 1997; Lancon et al. 1998). Unfortunately, many children are abused repeatedly (Alexander et al. 1990). One third of identified patients die shortly after being abused acutely and SBS is the most common cause of death in child abuse cases (Kivlin et al. 2000). Many survivors develop significant neurological handicaps (Lancon et al. 1998). Hypoxia and ischaemia rather than impact may be major causes of brain injuries that involve subdural haemorrhages (Johnson et al. 1995; Blumenthal 2002). The most common ophthalmic finding in inflicted head injury is bilateral retinal haemorrhage, occurring in 50–100% of cases (Kivlin et al. 2000; Kivlin 2001). Retinal haemorrhages are believed to be consequences of venous obstruction in the retina caused by increased intracranial pressure following cerebral oedema and subdural haemorrhage (Kivlin et al. 2000; Kivlin 2001). In addition, traction of the vitreous on the retina during the attack may evoke circular retinal folds, lacunar haemorrhages and haemorrhagic retinoschisis cavities (Mills 1998). In November 2003, a 4-month-old boy was brought to the emergency unit with extensive vomiting, unconsciousness and brief cessation of breathing. Skin haemorrhagic lesions around the left eye, cheek and occipital area were observed. On the following day, an ophthalmologist observed haemorrhages in the left lid and the child showed a very weak and slow pupil response to light exposure. The conjunctiva, cornea, lens and vitreous body were healthy and showed normal morphology in both eyes. Extensive pre-, intra- and subretinal haemorrhages were seen bilaterally (Fig. 1A). Computed tomography (CT) examination revealed frontal subacute and chronic subdural effusions in both sides of the brain, but no bone fractures were found, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive contusion-type trauma in the brain cortex in the occipital area demanding acute bilateral neurosurgical trepanation of the skull to relieve intracranial pressure. The retinal haemorrhages disappeared during the subsequent months and the appearance of the optic disc and retina were normal some months after the incident. Nonetheless, because of the serious brain damage, the boy developed severe mental retardation, epilepsy and blindness. This child was taken into care after the incident. (A) Fundus photograph in a 4-month-old boy with shaken baby syndrome (SBS), displaying pre-, intra- and subretinal haemorrhages with grave subdural effusion, which resulted in bilateral blindness. (B) Fundus photograph in a 6-month-old girl with SBS with pre-, intra- and subretinal haemorrhages with minor subdural effusion that resolved to result in normal visual acuity. In July 2006, a 6-month-old girl was examined in the emergency unit for unclear unconsciousness, vomiting and faintness. Two small skin haemorrhagic lesions in the forehead and mixed colour in the face were observed. On the following day, an ophthalmologist was asked to examine the infant’s eyes. Eyelid function was normal, as was the pupillary response to light. The cornea, lens and vitreous body were clear and showed normal morphology in both eyes. Large pre-, intra- and subretinal haemorrhages with central white spots were seen in both eyes, most prominently in the macular and peripapillar areas (Fig. 1B). However, CT and MRI pictures revealed only minimal subdural haemorrhage and otherwise normal brain morphology, and no bone fractures were found. During the 3 months of follow-up, all the retinal haemorrhages disappeared, pigmentation became normal, macular reflections were normalized and no retinal folds were seen. Furthermore, no posterior vitreous detachment could be observed. The child’s visual acuity and mental development appear to be normal and she still lives with her parents. Both our cases showed massive pre-, intra- and subretinal haemorrhages which spontaneously absorbed after some months. Thereafter the retinas and optic discs appeared to be normal. Despite the apparently similar appearance of the retinas in the acute phase of SBS, the boy remained blind, whereas the girl’s eyesight has completely recovered. However, immediately after the incidents there was a difference between the infants in pupil reactions to light and also in the extent of subdural effusions. The blinded boy displayed weak light reactions and abundant subdural effusion, whereas the findings in the girl were nearly normal, indicating that a poor light reaction and the presence of massive subdural effusion may predict a poor prognosis. Retinal haemorrhages are important clinical signs of SBS, but brain damage seems to be the primary reason for visual loss, as has been described previously (Kivlin 2001). Our SBS cases confirm earlier observations that it is difficult to estimate visual acuity development based purely on retinal haemorrhage assessment. Retinal haemorrhages without subdural effusion in SBS have not been documented (Green et al. 1996; Blumenthal 2002). However, the girl, who made a recovery, suffered retinal haemorrhages with minimal subdural effusion, indicating that minor brain injury predicts good visual prognosis even though there may be abundant retinal haemorrhaging during the acute phase. The mechanisms that cause retinal haemorrhages in SBS are unclear. It has been suggested that subdural haemorrhage precedes retinal haemorrhage because less force is required to induce tissue injury, and the severity of brain trauma correlates with the extent of retinal haemorrhaging (Green et al. 1996). The extent of retinal haemorrhaging in each of our cases was almost identical, but the course of the recovery was very different, which does not agree with the mechanism proposed by Green et al. (1996). Intraretinal and subhyaloid haemorrhages are often followed by retinal detachment and choroidal and vitreous haemorrhaging (Green et al. 1996; Blumenthal 2002), but neither of our patients developed retinal detachment. Surprisingly, no vitreous detachment could be detected during follow-up. Our female infant, who recovered with minimal brain damage, but with massive retinal bleeding, is perhaps evidence that vigorous vitreous movements may also be an essential factor in evoking retinal haemorrhages. Retinal photographs of SBS children are not seen very often, although it is quite possible to take photographs of usable quality. We would like to encourage medical personnel to photograph the retinas of SBS cases for follow-up and for use by advocacy experts who take these cases to court. The babies in our cases showed only minor signs of external injuries. Their eyeballs appeared to be externally intact and they had no bone fractures. Nonetheless, major pathological retinal changes were observed during the acute phase. Therefore, general practitioners, paediatricians and ophthalmologists should be aware of the seriousness of SBS, even with minimal or no external signs of child abuse. Thus, consulting with an ophthalmologist is always advisable when SBS is suspected.",

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose of Review: The endogenous circadian rhythms are one of the cardinal processes that control sleep. They are self-sustaining biological rhythms with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours that may be entrained by external zeitgebers (German for time givers), such as light, exercise, and meal times. This article discusses the physiology of the circadian rhythms, their relationship to neurologic disease, and the presentation and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. Recent Findings: Classic examples of circadian rhythms include cortisol and melatonin secretion, body temperature, and urine volume. More recently, the impact of circadian rhythm on several neurologic disorders has been investigated, such as the timing of occurrence of epileptic seizures as well as neurobehavioral functioning in dementia. Further updates include a more in-depth understanding of the symptoms, consequences, and treatment of circadian sleep-wake disorders, which may occur because of extrinsic misalignment with clock time or because of intrinsic dysfunction of the brain. An example of extrinsic misalignment occurs with jet lag during transmeridian travel or with intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders such as advanced or delayed sleep-wake phase disorders. In advanced sleep-wake phase disorder, which is most common in elderly individuals, sleep onset and morning arousal are undesirably early, leading to impaired evening function with excessive sleepiness and sleep-maintenance insomnia with early morning awakening. By contrast, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder is characterized by an inability to initiate sleep before the early morning hours, with subsequent delayed rise time, leading to clinical symptoms of severe sleep-onset insomnia coupled with excessive daytime sleepiness in the morning hours, as patients are unable to “sleep in” to attain sufficient sleep quantity. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder is misentrainment with patches of brief sleep and wakefulness spread throughout the day, leading to unstable sleep and waking behavioral patterns and an entirely idiosyncratic sleep-wake schedule. Summary: Familiarity with these major circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder phenotypes and their overlap with other neurologic disorders is essential for the neurologist so that clinicians may intervene and improve patient functioning and quality of life.",

Most frequently patients remember an auditory perception, the feeling of motor function lost, pain, helplessness, anxiety, panic, impending death. The prevalence of awareness in nonobstetric and noncardiac surgical cases is 0.1%-0.2%. The prevalence is higher in cardiac surgery, obstetric and major trauma cases. According to the results of many studies light anaesthesia is the most common cause of the AA. Posttraumatic stress disorder appears in 33%-56% of patients who experienced awareness during general anaesthesia. Extreme awareness experiences are very uncommon, but traumatic and can have lasting effects on patients. Several brain-function monitors based on the processed electroencephalogram or evoked potentials have been developed to assess anaesthetic depth. Measures to prevent awareness include avoidance of light anesthesia, gaining more knowledge about patient anaesthetic requirements and development of methods to detect consciousness during anesthesia.",

      "title": "Concussion in Sport",
      "abstract": "Concussions affect millions of athletes of all ages each year in a variety of sports. Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

Deterioration may also be due to an adverse effect of the radiation on nervous tissue or vessels within the beam, to alteration in the blood-brain barrier, thus influencing the effects of drug therapy, or to a superimposed catastrophe unrelated to the treatment. Transient effects, which occur within the first 3 months of radiotherapy, include increase in symptoms suggesting enlargement of the tumor and the somnolence syndrome that occurs in children. Classical permanent radiation effects include necrosis, atrophy, calcification, necrotizing leukoencephalopathy, mineralizing microangiopathy, aneurysm formation, tumor induction, and cerebrospinal fluid fistulae. Rarely, demyelination occurs with higher doses than are currently used. The permanent effects tend to occur later than the transient ones; some are progressive and many have serious consequences. The appearances of mineralizing microangiopathy are specific; but the nature of the other complications is only evident in the clinical context, although there may be difficulty distinguishing between radiation necrosis and further growth of an intracerebral tumor. Selected cases illustrate the computed tomographic features of these entities.",

The prevalence of MND is approximately five per 100 000 and approximately 30% of patients have primary bulbar symptoms.1 Half of the patients die within 36 months of experiencing the first symptom.\n\nPresentation with ventilatory failure is recognised but uncommon,2 occurring in less than 5% of cases3; however, abnormalities of respiratory muscle function are frequently detectable.4 5 As the condition progresses respiratory muscle strength diminishes4 6; indeed, the rate of change in respiratory function is the only measurable parameter which predicts survival.1 When the load placed on the respiratory muscle pump exceeds the capacity of the respiratory muscles, then the patient is at risk of ventilatory failure. Initially abnormalities may be present only in sleep7 or on exercise8 but, frequently, established ventilatory failure ensues. Ventilatory failure is usually manifest by dyspnoea which may be worse on lying flat (if diaphragm weakness is prominent) or sitting upright (if expiratory muscle weakness predominates). More commonly there is generalised weakness and then there are no clear cut postural symptoms. Direct questioning may elicit symptoms suggestive of disordered sleep architecture—for example, daytime somnolence, difficulty concentrating, or “respiratory” nightmares—or carbon dioxide retention—for example, morning headache. Examination may show paradoxical abdominal motion during respiration. This indicates substantial diaphragm weakness9 combined with preservation of enough upper thoracic musculature to generate sufficient negative intrathoracic pressure to cause inward abdominal motion. In more advanced disease paradoxical motion may be difficult to elicit and the patient may simply appear tachypnoeic without useful rib cage movement. In established MND patients may also complain of choking symptoms; most commonly this represents swallowing difficulties. However, if unrelated …",

      "abstract": "Whereas affective disturbances may accompany almost any organic cerebral disorder, the occurrence of \"ictal emotions\" (suddenly occurring and again disappearing emotional reactions) are frequently associated with disorders of the temporal lobe. We noted a distinct relationship between paroxysmal, depressive reactions and uncinate attacks. Ictal depressions lasting from hours to weeks occurred in 7 subjects whose principal seizure manifestations consisted of uncinate attacks and temporal lobe automatisms. Depressive episodes preceded or followed temporal lobe seizures or occurred paroxysmally in the \"free interval\" between seizures. Serial EEG's demonstrate that this particular type of depressive reaction may be due to subclinica 'hippocampal-amygdaloid-temporal lobe epilepsy\" and/or due to afterdischarges from the same structures following manifest seizure activation. The occurrence of paroxysmal fear, or \"isolated anxiety\" has been sporadically mentioned in the literature as a correlate of temporal lobe seizures, particularly as expression of a temporal lobe aura. We noted \"paroxysmal anxiety\" in 4 subjects, not only immediately preceding temporal lobe seizures, but also as an \"isolated,\" affective phenomenon in the so-called \"free interval.\" These anxiety attacks seem to bear a relationship to \"firing\" of the temporal lobe cortex, as demonstrated by our serial EEG observations and as evidenced by Penfield and co-workers during electrical stimulation.

The typical course of a psychogenic epidemic at a workplace progresses from sudden onset, often with dramatic symptoms, to a rapidly attained peak that draws much publicity and is followed by quick disappearance of the symptoms. Over 90% of the affected persons are women, and the symptoms range from dizziness, vomiting, nausea, and fainting to epileptic-type seizures, hyperventilation, and skin disorders. The background mechanisms are thought to be generalized beliefs and triggering events which create a sense of threat that leads to a physiological state of arousal. This state, in turn, creates new beliefs which give meaning to the sense of arousal. The new belief spreads through sociometric channels. Predisposing factors include boredom, pressure to produce, physical stressors, poor labor-management relations, and impaired interpersonal communications, and lack of social support. It is important that a thorough investigation be carried out in all instances. Investigation is not only necessary for diagnosis, but it also reassures the management, the employees, and the press that physical factors are unlikely to be responsible for the disease.",

      "title": "AGMATINE AMELIORATES SOCIAL ISOLATION INDUCED OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR IN MICE",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is defined as recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses (obsession) and/or repetitive purposeful behaviors (compulsions). 13% of children and adults are suffering from this condition. There are evidences that increased OCD symptom severity has been linked with diminished quality of life [3] and also increased functional impairment. Social isolation is defined as a state in which the individual lacks a sense of belonging socially, lacks engagement with others, has a minimal number of social contacts and they are deficient in fulfilling and quality relationships.Social isolation (SI) causes a variety of behavioral changes like hyper-locomotion, anxiety, impulsivity, aggression. These behavioral abnormalities in rodents may be related to the symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia, depression. In addition, Social isolation and OCD are associated with similar neurochemical changes like hypofunction of serotonin, dopamine and glutamate hyperfunction.These changes might be one of the causes for exacerbation of OCB in social isolation. Agmatine [4(amino butyl) guanidine] is an endogenous amine, widely present in mammalian brain and proposed as a novel neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.It is a metabolite of L-arginine via arginine decarboxylase and hydrolyzed to putrescine and urea by agmatinase. Recently, Agmatine is evidenced for anti-compulsive like effect . It has also been reported for its effectiveness in schizophrenia , addictive behavior , stress,anxiety [11] and depression . Besides this, Agmatine is evidenced for modulating levels of serotonin [13] as well as dopamine and glutamate levels .Incidentally, these neurotransmitters levels are altered in social isolation and OCD. [14] Hence, in the present study, the effect of agmatine was investigated in social isolation induced OCD in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Animals Adult male albino Swiss mice (22–25 g) were group housed (n=6) under a standard 12 h light/dark cycle and controlled conditions of temperature (23 ± 2C) and humidity (55 ± 10%). Mice were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 7 days before carrying out the experiments. The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) (SCOP/IAEC/2013/14/151). Drugs Agmatine sulfate was purchased from SigmaAldrich Ltd., USA. Drug solutions were prepared fresh and doses are expressed in terms of their free bases. Isolation condition Mice were housed singly in cages (21 x 38 x 14 cm) under a controlled 12-hour/12-hour light-dark cycle, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions), repetitive ritualistic behaviors (compulsions) and excessive anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is classified as an anxiety disorder under DSM-IV-TR guidelines. In OCD, the levels of serotonin and nitric oxide decreased; whereas levels of dopamine and glutamate increased in brain. Environmental conditions such as isolation from social surroundings lead to anxiety and increased level of aggression. The present study was designed to examine the effect of agmatine in social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior on marble burying behavior and locomotor activity. Agmatine (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in different groups of mice; activity was observed 30 min after dosing. Acute treatment of agmatine (40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced marble burying behavior. Moreover, hyperlocomotion was observed in socially isolated animals and agmatine was found to attenuate the same without affecting basal locomotions. In conclusion, agmatine effectively decreases social isolation induced obsessive-compulsive behavior in mice.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Psychological reactions to negative life events have been among the most interesting subjects to researchers for a long time. In recent years post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies. This disorder is defined as a reaction to an event that is accepted as traumatic by almost everyone, to an extraordinary life-threatening event, or to a disaster. Psychological reaction to events, which are not directly life threatening, is classified as adjustment disorder and is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice. As a result of experiencing such non-life threatening events, PTSD is claimed to be an adjustment disorder as well. Immigrants frequently report a depressive state in which physical symptoms are in the foreground accompanied by social withdrawal and diminished energy. Negative life events, which are not life threatening and are not experienced everyday, can impair mental health so that the above state may worsen and an immigrant may have a reduction in his performance at work. This state, which is accompanied by such symptoms as embitterment, feelings of injustice, repeated intrusive memories of critical events (injustice at work place, loss of a job, discrimination in a public office, etc.), phobic symptoms, and avoidance behavior towards the place or persons related to the event, might best be described by the term, posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED). This disorder, which was initially described in immigrants from East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and which does not exactly match the diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder or PTSD, is presented in a case vignette and its differential diagnosis is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Prolonged mourning has been recorded as a precipitant life event in RA and other autoimmune disorders, but other events such as retirement, redundancy and injury have also been identified. The author's submission is that pathological mourning is present in all patients with AI disease, and that other events such as those mentioned are only precipitant because they uncover mourning until then kept in check by occupation and use of work as a drug. When time for reflection and loneliness allows long suppressed ambivalent feelings, guilt and bitterness to surface, remorse over 'unfinished business' increasingly dominates the patient's thoughts. Children and young people rarely have the opportunity to mourn, thus early loss is often paramount and is awakened from the unconscious years later when further losses of key figures or surrogates, including pets, occur or are anticipated. Psychotherapy involves helping patients resolve their pathological mourning.",

      "abstract": "We investigated the influence of partial sleep deprivation on depressive symptoms in 30 patients with endogenous depression. The patients were awakened during the second half of the night and remained awake until the following evening. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy was not interrupted. Partial sleep deprivation significantly reduced the depression symptoms (mean value, 30.1%). The interindividual variations were considerable; deterioration was rare, and in 75% of the cases improvement occurred. Execution is simple, less stressful for the patient than total sleep deprivation, and can be carried out at home. Partial sleep deprivation has no contraindications except in the case of severe physical illness. The duration of the therapeutic effect is varied; repetition is possible. We discuss chronobiological hypothesis to explain the effect of sleep deprivation.",

      "title": "Arousal in Nocturnal Consciousness: How Dream- and Sleep-Experiences May Inform Us of Poor Sleep Quality, Stress, and Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "The term \"sleep experiences\", coined by Watson (2001), denotes an array of unusual nocturnal consciousness phenomena; for example, nightmares, vivid or recurrent dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations, dreams of falling or flying, confusional arousals, and lucid dreams. Excluding the latter, these experiences reflect a single factor of atypical oneiric cognitions (\"general sleep experiences\"). The current study is an opinionated mini-review on the associations of this factor—measured with the Iowa sleep experiences survey (ISES, Watson, 2001)—with psychopathological symptoms and stress. Findings support a strong relation between psychological distress and general sleep experiences. It is suggested that that they should be viewed as a sleep disturbance; they seem to represent involuntary intrusions of wakefulness into sleep, resulting in aroused sleep. These intrusions may stem from excessively thin boundaries between consciousness states (e.g., \"transliminality\"), or, conversely, they may follow an attempt at disconnecting mental elements (e.g., dissociation), which paradoxically results in a \"rebound effect\". The extent to which unusual dreaming is experienced as intrusive, rather than controlled, may explain why general sleep experiences are related to psychopathology, whereas lucid dreams are related to psychological resilience. In conclusion, the exploration of the interplay between psychopathology and sleep should be expanded from focusing almost exclusively on quantitative aspects (e.g., sleep efficiency, latency) to including qualitative conscious experiences which may reflect poor sleep quality. Taking into account nocturnal consciousness—including unusual dreaming and permeable sleep-wake boundaries—may unveil rich information on night-time emotional states and broaden our definition of poor sleep quality.",

      "title": "Bruxism physiology and pathology: an overview for clinicians*",
      "abstract": "Summary Awake bruxism is defined as the awareness of jaw clenching. Its prevalence is reported to be 20% among the adult population. Awake bruxism is mainly associated with nervous tic and reactions to stress. The physiology and pathology of awake bruxism is unknown, although stress and anxiety are considered to be risk factors. During sleep, awareness of tooth grinding (as noted by sleep partner or family members) is reported by 8% of the population. Sleep bruxism is a behaviour that was recently classified as a ‘sleep‐related movement disorder’. There is limited evidence to support the role of occlusal factors in the aetiology of sleep bruxism. Recent publications suggest that sleep bruxism is secondary to sleep‐related micro‐arousals (defined by a rise in autonomic cardiac and respiratory activity that tends to be repeated 8–14 times per hour of sleep). The putative roles of hereditary (genetic) factors and of upper airway resistance in the genesis of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity and of sleep bruxism are under investigation. Moreover, rhythmic masticatory muscle activity in sleep bruxism peaks in the minutes before rapid eye movement sleep, which suggests that some mechanism related to sleep stage transitions exerts an influence on the motor neurons that facilitate the onset of sleep bruxism. Finally, it remains to be clarified when bruxism, as a behaviour found in an otherwise healthy population, becomes a disorder, i.e. associated with consequences (e.g. tooth damage, pain and social/marital conflict) requires intervention by a clinician.",

Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated.

      "title": "Neonatal Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Neonates often exhibit paroxysmal behaviors that are nonepileptic in nature, such as oral-buccal-lingual movements, pedaling, stepping, and rotatory arm movements. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is of particular value for distinguishing these nonepileptic behaviors from subtle seizures. EEG and video-EEG studies in such movement disorders do not exhibit seizure discharges during the events. This distinction is important because nonepileptic events do not require treatment with anticonvulsants. Although the absence of surface ictal activity does not exclude entirely the possibility of seizures arising from deeper structures, it generally is accepted that these disorders are not epileptic.For the purposes of this review, we include common nonepileptic paroxysmal (episodic) movements that occur from birth to early infancy (onset between birth and 3 months of age). Many of these movement disorders may persist during infancy or early childhood. We do not discuss more persistent motor problems, such as spasticity, hypotonia, or myotonia. Also, disorders that occur after 3 months of age are not included.We have classified the movement disorders into two major categories: 1) hyperkinetic movements and 2) dystonic or extrapyramidal type of movements. Because the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying neonatal movement disorders often are unknown, they are categorized on the basis of phenomenology, rather than presumed cause. Some of these disorders may have overlapping symptomatology. A third category encompasses “ocular movement disorders.”Jitteriness may be due to many factors, including metabolic disturbance, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, drug withdrawal, hypoglycemia, and hypocalcemia. Although jitteriness may be mistaken for neonatal seizures, a distinguishing feature of jitteriness is that the movements can be suppressed easily by gentle restraint (Video 1). These movements are not accompanied by EEG changes and require no specific treatments. Reversing any transient metabolic disturbances may reduce the jitteriness.Neonatal sleep myoclonus is a self-limited movement disorder that develops in the neonatal period. (1) Myoclonic jerks occur during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and may be focal or bilateral in the limbs (Video 2). There is abrupt and consistent cessation of the movements with arousal. The EEG readings are normal during the episodes, and the children have a good outcome. The movements may be induced by rocking the baby during sleep. (2) The myoclonus resolves by 3 to 4 months of age. (1) These movements may mimic neonatal seizures and even neonatal status epilepticus. (3)Benign myoclonus of early infancy is a rare condition characterized by muscle spasms that may resemble the epileptic spasms seen in West syndrome (infantile spasms). Benign myoclonus of early infancy occurs before 12 months of age and resolves spontaneously. The EEG patterns during the spells are normal, and the child’s neurologic development is normal. The movements may include clusters of spasms of the head, trunk, or extremities. (4)(5) Eye blinking, brief jerking of the upper extremities or trunk, and head nodding episodes also may occur. The diagnosis is usually based on negative findings on EEG or video-EEG. Antiepileptic drug treatment is not warranted. Complete resolution of the episodes may take 2 weeks to 8 months. (4) The primary differential diagnosis is infantile spasms (West syndrome) in which the EEG almost invariably shows a very abnormal pattern of hypsarrhythmia. A proper diagnosis is important in this rare entity to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful antiepileptic therapy.REM sleep constitutes approximately 50% of the sleeping time in term infants and a slightly higher proportion in preterm infants. (6) During REM sleep, neonates have bursts of rapid horizontal and vertical eye movements. Unlike older children and adults, neonates also exhibit frequent limb and body movements during REM sleep. These may range from brief twitches of a limb to gross movements of one limb or the entire body, grimacing, smiling, frowning, and bursts of sucking. These movements may be mistaken for neonatal seizures. The EEG shows normal active sleep (REM) patterns.Hiccups usually are benign in newborns. However, excessive hiccups can be seen in nonketotic hyperglycinemia (glycine encephalopathy), a metabolic disorder due to a defect in cleavage of the amino acid glycine. This disease manifests with apnea, neonatal seizures, and early myoclonic encephalopathy (see article on etiology of neonatal seizures in this issue). Frequent hiccups also may be present during fetal life.Hyperekplexia (startle disease) is a rare nonepileptic disorder characterized by an exaggerated startle response to unexpected auditory, somatosensory, and visual stimuli, followed by momentary generalized muscular rigidity. It can present at any time from the neonatal period to adulthood and even during fetal life as abnormal intrauterine movements. In older patients, these attacks may cause the patients to fall rigidly while remaining fully conscious. Neonates and infants usually manifest marked rigidity (hence the name stiff-baby syndrome) that gradually becomes less severe in infancy. Exaggerated startle also starts during the first year after birth. The infants also exhibit sleep myoclonus, motor delay, feeding intolerance, and apneic spells, which may cause sudden death. (7) The rigid spasms may mimic generalized tonic seizures and can lead to severe apnea and death.Hyperekplexia is usually familial, most often autosomal dominant with complete penetrance and variable expression. Mutations in the glycine receptor have been identified in familial cases, which leads to neuronal hyperexcitability. (8) Electromyography shows a characteristic almost continuous muscular activity with brief periods of electrical silence. Clonazepam, a gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist, is the treatment of choice for hypertonia and apneic episodes. (8) However, clonazepam may not reduce the degree of stiffness significantly. During prolonged stiffness episodes with apnea, a simple maneuver of forced flexion of the head and legs toward the trunk may be lifesaving, (8) although intravenous benzodiazepines may be required if the maneuver is not successful.Shuddering attacks are benign phenomena that occur during infancy or early childhood. Rarely, the onset may be at 3 to 4 months of age. The attacks involve shuddering or shivering movements that last for several seconds without impairment of consciousness. The movements often are associated with excitement, fear, or anger. Video-EEG and polygraphic studies have revealed that the movements consist of bilateral fine tremors, sometimes associated with stiffening of the upper extremities. (9) The frequency of the movements is similar to that of essential tremors. (10) With time, the attacks decrease in frequency or disappear in all patients. Some authors regard shuddering attacks and benign myoclonus of early infancy to be the same nosologic entity. (10)Head tremors consist of slow oscillatory movements of the head that usually begin between 5 and 10 months of age, (11) although rarely they may occur at younger age. The head tremor may be characterized by a predominant “yes-yes” or “no-no” movement of the head and may be accompanied by a slight head tilt. Oscillations have a frequency of about 1 to 2 Hz. They are accentuated when sitting upright without head support, increased at times of movement, and dissipated while lying flat or sleeping. (11) The episodes may be accompanied by mild leg dystonia. Shuddering spells often precede the onset of head tremor. Results of the neurologic examination and neuroimaging studies are normal in affected children. A family history of tremor or infantile shuddering attacks often is present. Although medical therapy (eg, beta-adrenergic blockers, anticholinergics, and primidone) have been used, the condition appears to be benign and remits spontaneously. (11)Many types of movements that previously were considered to be neonatal epileptic phenomena now are considered to be nonepileptic motor behavior. Video-EEG monitoring studies have shown that movements such as bicycling, pedaling, swimming, and other motor automatisms are not associated with ictal EEG patterns (Video 3). (12)(13) These behaviors may represent “brainstem release” or other nonepileptic phenomena. Anticonvulsant medications are not indicated for these events and may exacerbate some movements.Intermittent oral-buccal-lingual movements are fairly common in newborns and consist of lip smacking or tongue thrusting (Video 4). Video-EEG and prolonged EEG studies have shown that these types of movements are associated inconsistently with ictal EEG activity. (14)(15) When they are associated with ictal EEG activity, they are likely to be associated with other types of seizure behaviors and unlikely to be the sole clinical manifestation. (15) Darting tongue movements or oral-buccal-lingual movements similar to those seen in dyskinesia of older patients have been observed in preterm infants who have severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. (16)Fasciculations are spontaneous contractions of the group of muscle fibers that are innervated by a single motor neuron and are seen best in the tongues of newborns. They are a cardinal feature of lower motor neuron disease, such as spinal muscular atrophy, congenital hypomyelination neuropathy, and other denervation processes of the anterior horn cells. In severe cases, the tongue may have the appearance of a “bag of worms.” It is important to look for fasciculations with the tongue at rest (if possible) because voluntary tongue movements may confound its appearance.We limit this discussion of torticollis or head tilt to paroxysmal or intermittent forms. Fixed torticollis, which usually is due to structural abnormalities (eg, sternocleidomastoid contusion or hemorrhage, Klippel-Feil syndrome, cervical anomalies, and posterior fossa masses), is not considered here.Benign paroxysmal torticollis usually presents during the first year after birth (usually around 3 mo) and is characterized by episodes of head tilting to one side with slight rotation. The attacks may be accompanied by irritability, malaise, vomiting, or pallor. The spells last minutes to hours, sometimes days, and occur once or twice a month. The disorder remits spontaneously by 5 years of age. (17) EEG and neuroimaging study results are normal. This disorder is believed to be a migraine variant because the children may develop more typical migraine symptoms later in life, and a family history of migraine often is present. A recent study found affected infants who came from a kindred that had familial hemiplegic migraine linked to CACNA1A mutation, (17) thus raising a question that this disorder may be a phenotypic variant of a calcium channelopathy.Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) has been associated with a variety of movement disorders, including torticollis and dystonic posturing. (18)(19) This association is termed Sandifer syndrome. It is hypothesized that these maneuvers may be a response to discomfort caused by GER or an attempt to increase lower esophageal sphincter tone, thereby reducing reflux. It mimics dystonia and generally is not believed to be due to a neurologic dysfunction. Evaluations, including 24-hour pH metering, barium swallow, manometry, and endoscopy, usually are diagnostic for GER. (20) Medications (eg, antacids and promotility agents) or surgical treatment (fundoplication) lead to symptomatic improvement. (20) If the GER evaluation is negative or symptoms persist despite treatments, the clinician should consider prolonged video-EEG monitoring to record the spells. We have seen several children who had partial epilepsy of infancy and initially were diagnosed as having GER. (21) The epileptic episodes in these infants differed in that the spells were accompanied by subtle mental status changes, eye deviations, and postictal depression.Perlman and Volpe have described an extrapyramidal movement disorder in preterm infants who have severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia that usually begins in the third postnatal month. (16) The limb movements are distal and jerky (similar to chorea) or appear restless. Similar movements involve the neck, trunk, and face. Oral-buccal-lingual movements may manifest as darting tongue movements and dyskinesias. The cause of the disorder is believed to be injury to the basal ganglia due to chronic hypoxemia. Neuropathologic study in one infant showed neuronal loss and gliosis in the basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei. (16) The movements may respond to benzodiazepines or resolve spontaneously. With improvements in neonatal intensive care, the incidence of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia has declined markedly, and the associated movement disorders have virtually disappeared from neonatal intensive care units.In the neonatal period, typical dystonic movements are rather uncommon but may manifest as arching, fisting, and tongue thrusting. Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has been known to be a cause of dystonic movements later in life, manifesting as athetoid cerebral palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging has shown that discrete basal ganglia lesions were associated with athetoid cerebral palsy and normal cognitive development or minor neuromotor abnormalities. (22) However, the neonatal neurologic correlates of the basal ganglia injury are not well characterized, possibly because when the basal ganglia are injured, there often is concomitant injury to the white matter, cortex, and brainstem, which leads to a wide variety of neurologic symptoms in the newborn period.Dystonia and choreoathetosis also have been described in early infancy with metabolic diseases (such as glutaric aciduria type 1) (23) and intrauterine drug exposure. (24)Newborns who have acute bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus) display opisthotonus, retrocollis, and hypertonia as well as mental status changes. The hyperbilirubinemia results in bilirubin staining and neuronal injury to the basal ganglia, oculomotor nuclei complex, and cochlear nuclei. During the first postnatal year, the disorder evolves into chronic bilirubin encephalopathy that is characterized by athetoid movements, impaired vertical gaze, and hearing loss.Paroxysmal tonic upgaze is characterized by episodes of sustained upward deviation of the eyes, often with incomplete downward eye movements on attempted downgaze. (25) The upgaze may be sustained for several hours, and the infant’s eyes may be in that position for most of the waking hours. Video-EEG studies have shown these movements to be nonepileptic. (26)(27) The onset is usually from 4 to 10 months, although rarely onset as early as 1 week of age has been reported. (25) This is a heterogeneous disorder of unknown cause, but the basic defect is believed to be in the corticomesencephalic control of vertical eye movement. Generally considered a benign disorder, the condition improves or resolves by 2.5 years. However, most affected children appear to have a wide variety of neurologic and oculomotor problems on long-term follow-up. (25)We have noted a few normal young infants who have had upgaze movements that were much briefer than those seen in paroxysmal tonic upgaze (lasting only a few seconds). These movements appear to represent an uncoupling of the normal upgaze response (Bell phenomenon) and eyelid closure that occur when the infants try to close the eyes. In one infant, they occurred when a visual stimulus was suddenly brought into his visual field. In another, they occurred during baths, while water was flowing over his upper face.Opsoclonus is a disturbance of ocular motility characterized by irregular, chaotic, semiconjugate, rapid to-and-fro oscillations of the eyes in any direction. In older children, it is associated with neuroblastomas and infectious encephalopathies. A few neonates have been described as having opsoclonus. It may occur as an isolated transient phenomenon in otherwise normal, healthy neonates. (28) However, it also has been associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, visual loss, and herpes simplex encephalitis. (29)(30)Congenital nystagmus consists of rhythmic, conjugate, horizontal oscillations of the eyes that persist in the vertical gaze. The eye movements begin at birth or during the first few days and persist throughout life. They may be associated with visual sensory abnormalities. Both familial and sporadic cases have been described. Most have a null and neutral position. (31) Transient forms of nystagmus, beginning in early infancy and regressing at 8 to 9 months of age, also have been described. (32) Infants who develop nystagmus during infancy should receive a careful ophthalmologic examination for visual and ocular abnormalities. If there is evidence of visual impairment, neuroimaging also should be considered because congenital nystagmus rarely has been associated with visual pathway defects or tumors. (33) Spasmus nutans manifests in older infants (6 to 12 mo) with nystagmus and head nodding; it also may be associated with visual pathway disturbances.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

      "title": "Autonomic symptoms during epileptic seizures",
      "abstract": "Autonomic symptoms frequently occur during epileptic seizures either as an accompaniment to other seizure symptoms or as the predominant seizure manifestation. They do not represent simple reactions to motor manifestations of seizures, but are mediated by an activation of the central autonomic network. Autonomic symptoms can be divided into cardiovascular changes, respiratory manifestations, gastrointestinal symptoms, cutaneous manifestations, pupillary symptoms, genital and sexual manifestations as well as urinary symptoms. Due to a hemispheric-specific representation of the central autonomic network, certain autonomic symptoms may provide lateralizing and sometimes localizing information on the seizure onset zone, although some of these signs may appear as a result of discharge spreading. Autonomic symptoms indicating a seizure onset in the non-dominant hemisphere include ictal vomiting and retching, spitting automatisms and ictal urinary urge. Autonomic symptoms range from subtle seizure manifestations which become apparent only during meticulous seizure analysis, to severe, sometimes life-threatening events. Cardiovascular and respiratory autonomic symptoms are discussed as the mechanisms underlying sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. When autonomic symptoms represent the sole seizure manifestation, they can pose problems for differential diagnosis of various non-epileptic conditions. Finally, autonomic seizure symptoms open a unique window on the functional organization of the central autonomic network and on brain function in general. (Published with videosequences.)",

      "title": "Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Position Paper on Patient Sleep During Hospitalization",
      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal. Percebe-se que o fonoaudiólogo pode contribuir para amenizar os sintomas encontrados nestas patologias, proporcionando uma qualidade de vida melhor aos seus portadores.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The olfactory system is unique as a special sensory system in its developmental neuroanatomy and function. Neonatal olfactory reflexes can be detected in the fetus from 30 weeks gestation and can be tested in term and preterm neonates and older children. Most efferent axons from the olfactory bulb terminate in the anterior olfactory nucleus within the olfactory tract, with secondary projections to the amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex (parahippocampal gyrus), with tertiary projections also to the insula and other cortical regions. The olfactory bulb and tract incorporate an intrinsic thalamic equivalent. The olfactory bulb may be primary in generating olfactory auras in some cases of temporal lobe epilepsy. Developmental malformations may involve the olfactory bulb and tract, isolated or as part of complex cerebral malformations and genetic syndromes. Primary neural tumors may arise in the olfactory bulb or nerve. Impaired olfaction occurs in neonatal hypoxic/ischemic and some metabolic encephalopathies. Loss of sense of smell are early symptoms in some neurodegenerative diseases and in some viral respiratory diseases including coronavirus disease 2019. Testing cranial nerve I is easy and reliable at all ages, and is recommended in selected neonates with suspected brain malformations or encephalopathy.",

      "abstract": "As Far As We Can Tell, Two Powerful Brain Events Always Occur with Sexual Experience:* Attachment (bonding) to the sexual partner* Desire for repetition of sex acts (addiction)Sex may not always lead to permanent attachment or uncontrolled addictive behavior because of multiple other influences (family, faith, control of actions by higher brain centers, etc.) But observations of brains with new imaging techniques and of behavior suggest that sexual experience can have a powerful brain impact.1 PET scans can identify specific areas of the brain involved when a person is interested in another person, but cannot distinguish between lust and Only time and other behaviors can reveal the difference.2* Lust is a powerful emotional state and can cause people to do things that they would not ordinarily do, often for self-gratification.* Early is a powerful emotional state, which can last several months and cause people to think of doing things they would not ordinarily do.* Mature love is the deep, abiding love of a couple that stays together and follows the healthy evolution of early love. It is the stability of this mature love on which marriage, home, & family depend.3A separate brain area for pain has also been identified. The brain lights in the same area if it's physical pain, like a broken bone, or emotional pain, like a broken relationship.4 Emotional Consequences of Sexual Activity with broken relationships:* Pain and suffering from broken relationships* Fear, confusion about romantic feelings* Altered self-esteem* Sense of betrayal and abandonment* Guilt, depression and emotional rollercoaster* Impaired ability to form healthy long-term relationshipsBroken bonding may explain a large percentage of adolescent depression. According to a national survey of teen health, girls who were sexually active were three times more likely to be depressed than those who were abstinent. Suicide is attempted more often by sexually active teens than those who have not had sex: three times more often by girls and eight times more often by boys.5Sex & Depression - College Students* 30% of students reported they felt so depressed that it was sometimes hard for them to function.* 6% of students reported seriously considering attempting suicide at least once during the past year and 1.3% had actually attempted suicide.6Damage to the Human Bonding Ability* Individuals who have had multiple sexual partners prior to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than individuals who did not have multiple partners prior to marriage.* Couples who cohabit before committing to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than couples who did not cohabit.'Young Women Are More Vulnerable to premature sexual activity. They are much more likely to be pressured for sex8 and their behavior decisions can be influenced unconsciously.9* By pheromones. Young women are sensitive to pheromonal concentrations as little as l/100th of a drop. These powerful chemicals influence desire for sex, and cause the young womans mood to brighten and mental focus to sharpen, increasing propensity to sexual behavior.* By release of oxytocin with sexual activity. Oxytocin not only makes them bond it can also make them trust. More women than men say their beloved's faults don't matter much to them and women score higher on the test of passionate love.The Emotional TruthsFifty percent of teen relationships break within six months of beginning a sexual relationship. Many teens report two weeks is common length of relationships. This has spawned the concept of up = sex without relationship. Hooking results in unhealthy molding of the brain. More sex partners may lead to attachment difficulty. Brain molding that result from incomplete or unhealthy attachments is a threat to one's emotional and physical health. …",

      "title": "Memory of Traumatic Stress",
      "abstract": "Extreme stress alters the coding of events in memory and may lead to disorders of the trauma spectrum, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In order to understand the physiological basis and the common thread underlying PTSD, the concept of memory as it is related to trauma must be understood. Autobiographic memory can be divided into cold memories, including knowledge about life-time periods and specific events and hot memories, comprising emotional and sensory memories. Cold memories (On September 18 at 20:30 I was still working in my office) are usually connected with hot sensory memories, (black-masked, dark night, shooting) as well as with cognitive (I can't do anything), emotional (fear, sadness) and physiological elements (heart racing, fast breathing, sweating). Through this string of hot memories a fear network is built. Physiological changes in the brain and body of the survivor of a life-threatening experience, such as a response of the stress-related messengers (e.g., of the HPA axis) or the functioning and even structure of the medial temporal lobe and connected limbic networks in the brain, have been shown to be affected by traumatic stressors and are linked to the organization of memory. When we drive the organism down the defense cascade, when flight is not possible, fight futile and only a startling freeze is left in our evolutionary repertoire, functioning of the structures in the medial temporal lobe that are the portal for autobiographic memory is altered such that hot and cold memories lose their interconnectivity. Our data from survivors of severe violence and torture demonstrate functional alteration of fronto-temporal regions. In over 100 victims of severe and repeated torture, we observed a 94% prevalence of PTSD. In these patients, generators of abnormal slow waves indicated dysfunctional networks in the frontal lobe. Abnormalities in left fronto-temporal regions were connected with dissociative states. In addition a hyper-responsive fear-network can be demonstrated by rapid visual presentation of emotional material. In torture victims but not in controls, rapid presentation of affective pictorial stimuli activates frontal cortex. We hypothesize that it is this disconnection between hot and cold memories, indicated by abnormal brain waves, that leaves those experiencing flashbacks entangled in fear and anxiety. The victim is unable to place the flashback in time and space because the hot memory is not connected to the autobiographical cold memory. If this connection can be restored, the horror of the memory might be alleviated.",

      "title": "Disorders of head-eye coordination.",
      "abstract": "Head-eye coordination subserves the rapid transference of gaze and between gaze shifts stabilizes fixation on stationary or smoothly moving targets. The coordination involves various combinations of the components of head movement, saccadic eye movements and visual and vestibular slow phase eye movement whose fine tuning may be adjusted, to an extent currently debated, by higher order mechanisms. Disorders of head-eye coordination may result in loss of acuity when slow phases are impaired or difficulty with reorientation if there is difficulty with saccades or head movement. Pathophysiology in the brain stem affecting individual components of eye movement may often be identified with success, particularly for the horizontal system, but the organization of other functions, notably pursuit suppression and vertical movements, are little understood. Similarly little is known about the disorders of the overall pattern of coordination--'gaze types'--including the apraxias, which have been attributed to cortical, basal ganglia or even cerebellar dysfunction and are reported in an almost bewildering variety of diseases. The development of coordination in infancy is a rich field in which there have been few studies with adequate observational techniques. The differentiation between congenital disorders whose severity may subsequently wax or wane, variants on normal development and acquired disorders poses a clinical problem which could largely be resolved with adequate recording techniques. For the future there is the tantalizing promise that once the principles of coordination are understood, we can move on to the more intriguing questions of how a certain 'toss of the head' and 'look in the eye' not only transfer gaze but can also be so meaningful.",

      "abstract": "Hallucinations are misperceptions of things or events with one or more senses when an internal or external trigger doesn’t exist. They can be divided into visual, audioverbal, olfactorical, tactile and gustatory. Hallucinations develop due to 3 main pathophysiologicalmechanisms: psychophysiological, psychobiochemical (neurohormone dependent) and psychodynamic. Etiology of these perceptions consists of many things and is not always binned to psychiatric illnesses. These are some of the etiological factors which will be mentioned further bellow: psychosis, delirium, dementia, Charles Bonnet syndrome, Anton syndrome, seizures, migraine, Lhermitte syndrome, sleep disorders and “Alice in Wonderland” syndrome. Audioverbal hallucinations are thought to be a misperceptionof one’s own thoughts which are understood as the speech of someone else. This happens because of distorted function of frontotemporal efferents. These parts of brain are known for their sensorial region activation in the brain and also for the identification and perception of triggers that arise in a person. Furthermore, and increased activity of Wernicke’s region, right putamen, thalamus, and nucleus caudatus was also noticed. During the events of audioverbalhallucinations increased activity of Broca’s region and dorsal cortex of gyrus cinguli were noticed. Subcortical structures might also be the reason or the regulating part of the brain responsiblefor the manifestation of hallucinations which originate in the cortex. Visual hallucinations appear after triggering the primary or associational visual cortex, deafferetion mechanism, when there is some sort of damage to the periferial or central parts of nervous system responsible for visual perceptions. In addition, sleep and wakefulness cycles might be unbalanced and there can be some cognitive disorders.",

Sleep abnormalities in depression are mainly characterized by increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduced slow wave sleep. Among the mechanisms of sleep disturbances in depression are hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, CLOCK gene polymorphism and primary sleep disorders. The habenula is a structure regulating the activities of monoaminergic neurons in the brain. The hyperactivation of the habenula has also been implicated, together with sleep disturbances, in depression. The presence of depression in primary sleep disorders is common.

Particularly, the sleep bruxism is a frequent phenomenon that causes cephalalgia and muscular/joint pains to the awakening, besides an increased dental abrasion and sensibility. The etiology of sleep bruxism is uncertain: while the occlusal discrepancies and the anatomy of the bony structures of the orofacial region play only a minor role, others factors, like smoking, alcohol, drugs, systemic diseases, stress, trauma and heredity, appear to have an important role in the sleep bruxism genesis. Recent polysomnographic studies, suggest that sleep bruxism episodes are part of an sleep arousal response. The sleep arousal response is a sudden change in the depth of sleep. Besides the sleep bruxism appears to be an disturbance in the dopaminergic system. Further psychological factors (like stress, anxiety) are implicated in the aetiology of sleep bruxism as well. The aim of this paper is to review the literature on the aetiology of bruxism.",

      "abstract": "One of the main advantages of long-term recording of epileptics is the possibility to monitor these patients during natural sleep. In this chapter, we first describe the reciprocal influence of sleep and epilepsy. On the one hand, sleep and circadian fluctuation of the state of vigilance have a marked influence on the occurrence of generalized and partial seizures as well as on the frequency, morphology and distribution of interictal epileptic discharges. On the other hand, a wide range of sleep disturbances has been documented in epileptics and there is some evidence that sleep disturbance and epilepsy may aggravate and perpetuate one another. Long-term EEG monitoring during sleep is of major importance when investigating epileptics with nocturnal attacks to determine whether these nocturnal episodes represent an ictal manifestation or an independent non-epileptic sleep disorder. In special forms of epilepsy, sleep recording is not only useful but necessary for the diagnosis. Various activation procedures are carried out on patients in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty regarding the presence or the type of epilepsy. Some of these procedures employ sleep: namely sedated sleep, sleep after sleep deprivation and all-night sleep recording. The diagnostic value and the indications of these activation studies are reviewed.",

The hyper-arousal theory of insomnia postulates that sleep disturbances are caused by an increase in physiological arousal based on the discovery of high physiological arousal, which may be connected to these people's active stress system. Sometimes, sleep issues including difficulties getting asleep, difficulty remaining asleep, or having poor-quality sleep are referred to as insomnia. Insomnia can be brought on by a variety of things, including the use of psychoactive drugs, caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, and cocaine; hormonal changes, such as menstruation and menopause; stressful life events, like the birth of a child and bereavement; disruptions of the circadian rhythm, like shift work and jet lag; some neurological disorders; and medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis. Everything in the universe vibrates at a specific frequency, and when we are in a state of natural resonance, we are in perfect health. But if a bodily component begins to vibrate at the incorrect frequency, the energy becomes trapped, and illness appears.

(6) Therapeutic application of these inhibitors is based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression. Unfortunately, over half of MDD patients do not achieve remission after a 12-week treatment with SSRIs. Studies have also shown that one-third of patients treated with successive antidepressant therapies do not achieve remission even after a 1-year intervention.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias include complex behaviors such as sleepwalking, sleep-related eating disorder and confusional arousals that emerge mainly during deep sleep. Adult lifetime prevalence varies widely (4–67%). Management typically focuses on education, safety measures, and addressing underlying triggers. When standard therapies prove insufficient, adjunctive techniques like hypnosis may offer additional benefit. Report of case A 59-year-old female with a long-standing history of intermittent sleepwalking and sleep-related eating sought care following a near-fatal sleep-driving incident. Her background included generalized anxiety, depression, PTSD, anorexia, and restless legs syndrome. Comprehensive evaluation ruled out nocturnal epileptiform activity, periodic limb movements, and obstructive sleep apnea. Polysomnography demonstrated confusional arousals from N2 sleep and increased phasic muscle tone in REM, without witnessed abnormal movements. Reduced arousals in the first half of the night suggested sedation from multiple psychotropic medications concerning for polypharmacy. Initial management involved psychiatry consultation to streamline her psychotropic regimen, alongside behavioral and environmental interventions to ensure safety. After excluding active organic or psychological factors perpetuating the episodes, one session of clinical hypnosis was performed and recorded. The patient listened to the recording daily, gradually reducing its use as episodes improved. Clonazepam was introduced and up titrated when potentially harmful episodes persisted. At follow-up, both the patient and her bed partner reported a notable reduction in frequency and severity of the episodes, with no further injurious events. Conclusion In a case of refractory NREM parasomnia, hypnosis—implemented after careful evaluation, medication adjustment, and safety measures—resulted in meaningful clinical improvement. This brief, time-efficient intervention may serve as a valuable adjunct to established therapies when conventional measures alone do not achieve adequate control. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Migraine is a chronic, neurological disorder generally manifesting itself in attacks with severe headache, nausea and an increased reactivity to sensory stimuli. A low migraine threshold is set by genetic factors, although the phenotype also modulates the manifestations. The 1-year prevalence is approximately 13% and is higher among women. Patients usually experience neuropsychological dysfunction, and sometimes also reversible focal neurological symptoms. The trajectories of the characteristic symptoms of acute migraine usually follow a similar time course, indicating a reciprocal underlying mechanism. A central nervous system hyperexcitability has been demonstrated in neurophysiological studies. The dibilitating effects of migraine are not confined to the attacks per se. Many individuals do not recover completely between the attacks and most report a negative impact on the most important life domains, and an interest in testing other treatments. Young persons have a higher frequency of attacks. Acute treatment should routinely be initiated with an analgesic plus a prokinetic anti-emetic. Triptans must not be provided early during the attack to ensure their efficacy. The natural course of attacks is commonly only temporarily altered by acute treatment. Non-pharmacological treatment and drugs may be equally viable in prophylaxis for migraine. In more complicated cases, conjoint therapy should be considered. New strategies to improve adherence with existing therapeutic regimens might yield greater benefits than will new pharmacological agents.",

      "title": "EDITORIAL:: Painful Posttraumatic Trigeminal Neuropathy: A Recently Recognized Entity",
      "abstract": "An unusual event recently occurred in the field of chronic orofacial pain. A new entity has been established through a few research papers and meetings of experts. Different specialists have known for some time that surgery and other traumatic events may injure the trigeminal nerve and provoke symptoms. Nerve damage may occur during Caldwell-Luc intervention, orthognathic mandibular advancement surgery, extrusion of root canal filling materials, implant surgery, and various traumatic events such as facial fractures and therapeutic radiation; third molar removal is the most frequent cause.1 Several branches of the mandibular or maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve could be involved, such as the infraorbital nerve, the superior alveolar nerves, and most frequently the lingual and inferior alveolar nerves. The signs and symptoms are similar to those in neuropathic pain conditions elsewhere in the body, with either negative signs and symptoms such as anesthesia or hypoalgesia and/or signs and positive symptoms such as hyperalgesia, dysesthesia, allodynia, and continuous burning sensations. There is also a chronologic relation between the beginning of these signs and symptoms and the actual traumatic event (see reviews).2,3 Because it has been poorly documented, both the incidence and the gravity of the patients’ problems have often been underestimated. Not surprisingly, many different names have been used, including chronic injury–induced orofacial pain, anesthesia dolorosa, posttraumatic neuralgia or neuropathy, secondary trigeminal neuralgia from facial trauma, neuropathic orofacial pain, numb chin syndrome, and peripheral painful traumatic trigeminal neuropathy. Until recently, these clinical cases were not identified as belonging to a single entity, as can be inferred from the insufficient description2 given by the two main classification systems.4,5 Recently, the entity has gained recognition after the recent publication of some well-documented papers and the most recent proposal of the classification committee of the International Headache Society (IHS), which proposed the term “painful posttaumatic trigeminal neuropathy” (PPTTN).6\r\n\r\nThe recognition of this entity can be described as a three-phased approach, as outlined in the following:\r\n\r\n1. Identification of PPTTN as an independent entity: This was suggested by a multicenter study which indicated that the 20 cases of PPTTN found among 245 cases of chronic orofacial pain tended to cluster. 7 This was in line with a recent study performed on 328 patients with chronic orofacial pain that indicated that over 12% of the cases were PPTTN.8 These two studies pointed to a much larger prevalence than what was previously suspected, even if these samples were far from being representative of the general population since they came from tertiary care centers. The contribution of the different specialties to the incidence of PPTTN has been recently detailed.2,9,10\r\n\r\n2. Description of diagnostic criteria for PPTTN: This has much improved due to recently performed studies. Quantitative sensory testing associated with electrophysiological exploration have better delineated the disease characteristics.1,11,12 In a recent paper, diagnostic criteria, first proposed at the start of the work to select subjects with PPTTN, have been redefined at the end of the work and after having tested these criteria.3\r\n\r\n3. Inclusion of PPTTN in the IHS classification system:This was done by a group of experts with either dental or medical backgrounds. Now, PPTTN is included under the main heading “chronic painful cranial neuropathies and other facial pains,” in which one subheading is devoted to “painful trigeminal neuropathies.” In this latter subheading, PPTTN is listed with painful trigeminal neuropathy attributed to acute herpes zoster, postherpetic trigeminal neuropathy, painful trigeminal neuropathy attributed to multiple sclerosis plaque, painful trigeminal neuropathy attributed to a space-occupying lesion, or to other diseases.\r\n\r\nFinally, the IHS committee formulated the following diagnostic criteria for PPTTN6:\r\n\r\nA. Facial or oral pain fulfilling items C and D below\r\n\r\nB. History of traumatic event to the trigeminal nerve\r\n\r\nC. Evidence of causation shown by the following:\r\n\r\n1. Pain develops within 3 to 6 months of an identifiable traumatic event to the trigeminal nerve\r\n\r\n2. Clinically evident positive (hyperalgesia, allodynia) and/or negative (hypoesthesia, hypoalgesia) signs of trigeminalnerve dysfunction\r\n\r\nD. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-III diagnosis\r\n\r\nThree points were added to complete this concise description:\r\n\r\n• Pain duration ranges widely from paroxysmal to constant or mixed.\r\n\r\n• Specifically following radiation-injury pain, neuropathy may appear later than 3 months.\r\n\r\n• The term “painful” was included in PPTTN because most trigeminal nerve injuries do not result in pain.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be noted that PPTTN, as defined by the IHS, excludes the so-called “persistent idiopathic facial pain” and its dental form “atypical odontalgia,” which probably pertain to the continuum of neuropathic mechanisms but frequently lack many features of PPTTN.11 The fact that persistent idiopathic facial pain and some other dysfunctional conditions can be considered as possible or probable neuropathic entities3 is suggested by the frequent occurrence of a small nerve injury at the beginning of the symptoms. A continuum of neuropathic mechanisms probably occurs across PPTTN and at least some of the dysfunctional orofacial pain conditions. In view of the clinical presentation, the neuropathic outcome may depend on the balance between the extent of the nerve injury and the influence of genetic and hormonal factors reflecting the psychosocial impact of chronic or/and intense acute stress.13",

      "abstract": "Inborn errors of organic acid metabolism are relatively recently recognized diseases with a wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms: ranging from asymptomatic, normal appearing children to death during first few days of life.In my presentation I will try to explain some of the most common clinical presentation of these disorder with stress on neurologic findings. Organic acidemia usually have three clinical manifestations Severe neonatal form, Intermittent late-onset form and chronic progressive form. Recurrent coma, The main feature of these disorders is due to accumulation of toxic metabolites in Central Nervous system with direct effect on the function, while chronic accumulation of these materials may interfere with CNS development or cerebral metabolism leading to developmental delay.Severe neonatal formsFollowing a symptom free interval of a few days from birth, poor sucking and difficult feeding appears in the newborn, followed by unexplained and progressive coma. Seizures may appear during the course of the disease and EEG may show a burst-suppression pattern. During this stage most infants have axial hypotonia with peripheral dystonia, choreoathetosis, episodic opisthotonus and some repetitive bicycling and boxing movements.Associated biochemical abnormalities including metabolic acidosis, ketonuria and hyperammonemia also is usually present. The overall short-term prognosis with recent advances in medical care is improving. But later in life acute intercurrent episodes triggered by a stress often occur, which can be occasionally fatal.bulging fontanelle and cerebral edema may mimic CNS infection in these babies.Intermittent late-onset formsRecurrent attacks of coma or lethargy with ataxia can occur in childhood or even in adolescence or adulthood. These episodes may be frequent, though in between these the child is entirely normal. These attacks are precipitated by conditions that enhance protein catabolism (trauma, infection etc).Sometimes these episodes can lead to death or severe sequel. Seizure disorder is one of these sequels which is generalized in type with myoclonic seizure in infancy and childhood and later tonic-clonic and atypical absence seizures predominate. Also many of the survivors have acute or progressive extra pyramidal syndrome due to bilateral necrosis of basal ganglia.Chronic progressive formsNon specific Developmental delay, hypotonia, muscular weakness, microcephaly and seizures are rarely the only revealing signs in organic acidemia without any acute presentation.Seizures may become refractory to Anti Epileptic Drugs. In addition many asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infants have been identified during tandem mass spectrometry newborn screening program. Cognitive deterioration associated with movement disorder such as dystonia or chorea may be caused by any form of organic aciduria.",

      "abstract": "Unilateral neglect can be defined as an impairment to detect, refer, orient or respond to stimuli presented contralaterally to a cerebral lesion, without any impairments in sensory-motor elementary functions. Development. The first descriptions were those of Hughlings Jackson (1876) and Anton (1893). The most important feature of the syndrome is a lateralization bias, which is directional in nature independently of the visual fields. It can be classified in: 1. Attentional (sensory neglect). 2. Intentional (motor neglect). The lesions that may be responsible for the neglect syndromes are usually found in the inferior parietal cortex of the right cerebral hemisphere (superior parietal when optic ataxia is prominent), and the right frontal lobe. Extinction is more frequently related to subcortical lesions (right lenticular nucleus, anterior aspects of peri-ventricular white matter). Unilateral neglect comprises a set of features that may coexist or be isolated traits: 1. Attentional neglect: hemi-inattention, allesthesia, allochiria, anosognosia (with/without somato-paraphrenia or misoplegia), and anoso-diaphoria, sensory extinction. 2. Intentional neglect: hemi-akinesia, directional hypokinesia, motor impersistence, motor extinction. Different theories try to explain the patho-physiology of these phenomena: the attentional-intentional model, the neural network model, the vectorial model, the representational model, and the premotor model, among others.",

Sleep disorders during the prodromal synucleinopathy period, primarily isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and daytime hypersomnolence correlate best with the recently proposed “body-first” Lewy body disease progression. iRBD is the most widely recognized form of prodromal α-synucleinopathy, and patients with iRBD show abnormal α-synuclein in tissues and biofluids even in the absence of cognitive or motor symptoms. More importantly, individuals with iRBD have an elevated risk for near-term development of a clinically diagnosable symptomatic synucleinopathy. Other sleep disorders such as hypersomnia and circadian rhythm dysfunction also occur across the synucleinopathy spectrum, although their prognostic significance is less well understood than iRBD. Finally, isolated REM sleep without atonia may represent an even earlier stage of prodromal synucleinopathy, but further studies are needed.",

They can be all named posttraumatic neuropathies: painless sensations in phantom limb ,painful phantom limb and painful posttraumatic stump. Painless sensations in phantom limb can be seen in 90% of cases in resected body parts as soon as first postoperative day, less often during the first week, and its clinical characteristics are usually stabilized during the first year. Painful posttraumatic stump appears because of pain neuroma existing, that forms at the proximal end of amputational stump as a consequence of physiological nerve regeneration attempt. Frequency of pain significantly varies considering authors from 5 - 90%, depending on definition of this phenomena and criteria used. It is considered that 5- 10% mast be under permanent medicament treatment. Phantom pain appears more often in elderly and people with specific affective personality construction. It can bee permanent, burning, nettling, tearing (25%), or intermittent, lancerating, in the shape of electrical discharging (32%), but it can also have bizarre attributes. Phantom pain appearance usually announces its duration in the longer period. After two years it is present at 59% of patients, with decreasing intensity, and only 5- 10% suffer severe pain. In our Institute in the period from 1980-2003, 48 patients have been treated, 36 patients with medicamentous treatment, local blockades and chronic stimulations, and 12 patients, who did not react at conservative treatment were operated. In operated group in 10 patients pain disappeared, one patient it was with decreasing intensity, and one patient was without change.",

      "title": "Dissociation, Trauma, Altered Existence",
      "abstract": "When a child experiences a traumatic event, a very common result is either partial or complete repression of the traumatic event from their memory. This is possible because the brain forces an overwhelming amount of dissocation to occur, so much so that in some cases, the child may not even be aware of the fact that they went through the traumatic event in the first place. The brain keeps these memories buried until the child grows to be an adult, when they can better process and recover from what they went through. This is natural, an instinctive mechanism meant to help the child survive and have the ability to continue developing. However, the utilization of such a vast amount of dissociation at such a young age is not without consequence. Multiple traumatic responses connect back to memory repression. A child with a significant amount of trauma may see the world through a very different lens when they reach adulthood, and yet they may not even realize that they have trauma in the first place. In fact, one of the more interesting theories may be the connection between traumatic dissociation and the development of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder later on in life. Understanding this connection, along with the many other ways that trauma manifests in adulthood, is what leads to more people feeling as though they have the right to ask for help in a world that largely discredits the validity of what they remember.",

      "abstract": "At the onset, differentiation between abnormal non-epileptic movements, and epileptic seizures presenting in early life is difficult as is clinical diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of the various seizure disorders presenting at this age. Seizures starting in the first year of life including the neonatal period might have a favorable course, such as in infants presenting with benign familial neonatal epilepsy, febrile seizures simplex or acute symptomatic seizures. However, in some cases, the onset of seizures at birth or in the first months of life have a dramatic evolution with severe cerebral impairment. Seizure disorders starting in early life include the \"epileptic encephalopathies\", a group of conditions characterized by drug resistant seizures, delayed developmental skills, and intellective disability. This group of disorders includes early infantile epileptic encephalopathy also known as Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, infantile spasms syndrome (also known as West syndrome), severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (also known as Dravet syndrome) and, myoclonic encephalopathies in non-progressive disorder. Here we report on seizures manifesting in the first year of life including the neonatal period. Conditions with a benign course, and those with severe evolution are presented. At this early age, clinical identification of seizures, distinction of each of these disorders, type of treatment and prognosis is particularly challenging. The aim of this report is to present the clinical manifestations of each of these disorders and provide an updated review of the conditions associated with seizures in the first year of life.",

The most common sleep disorders in schizophrenia are insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm disorders. The relevance of insomnia should be emphasized, as it can be a prodromal signof schizophrenia, as well as an alarm sign of an incipient psychotic decompensation. Additionally, the clinical recovery of a psychotic process is usually correlated with sleep normalization. Multiple polysomnographic disturbances on sleep architecture have been found in patients with schizophrenia, including increased sleep latency, awakenings during sleep, sleep-wake cycle inversion, as well as poor sleep efficiency. These objective disturbances have been correlated to subjective poor sleep quality and other main clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Nonrapid eye movement (NREM) or arousal parasomnias are prevalent conditions in children and young adults, apparently provoked by any medical, physical, mental, or pharmacologic/toxic agent disturbing normal biorhythm and causing sleep fragmentation or abundant amount of slow wave sleep. The nadir and the ascending slope of the first sleep cycle of night sleep are the typical periods when NREM parasomnias, especially sleepwalking may occur on sleep-microstructural level; microarousals are the typical moments allowing NREM parasomnias. While sleep-disturbing factors have a clear precipitating effect, a genetic predisposition appears necessary in most cases. A candidate gene for sleepwalking has been identified on chromosome 20q12-q13.12 in one sleepwalking family. NREM parasomnias have a genetic and clinical link with nocturnal-frontal lobe epilepsies; possibly through an abnormality of the acetylcholine-related sleep-control system. The association of NREM parasomnias with the human leukocyte antigen system might be the sign of an autoimmune background to be further clarified. In the treatment of arousal parasomnias, the main tools are adequate sleep hygiene and the management of underlying conditions. Their pharmacotherapy has remained unresolved; the best options are clonazepam and some of the antidepressants, while a psychotherapy approach is also justified.

      "abstract": "Bizarre repetitive behaviour may be quite common, with estimates in people and dogs of a prevalence of up to 8%. Whereas these are often considered important indicators of mental health problems in people, in companion animals, many owners view these behaviours as quirky or even amusing features of their pet. However, the absence of self-report also means that the array of repetitive behaviour conditions in companion animals is also much more diverse than in humans and there is a danger of drawing simple analogies between human and non-human animals based on very superficial phenotypic features. For example, the following differentials might be considered for a dog who chases its tail:\r\n •Seizure possibly a primary partial seizure or secondary to a lesion in the brain such as damage to the vestibular system \r\n•Inner ear infection \r\n•Play \r\n•Pain in the tail or lower back due to damage to the nerves (neuralgia), bones or soft tissues \r\n•Pain around the region of the tail including skin inflammation and infections, impacted or infected anal sacs or trauma \r\n•A learned response aimed at attracting owner attention. \r\n•Acute conflict\r\n•Compulsive Disorder \r\n•Stereotypy \r\n\r\nThese explanations are not independent and a dog who starts chasing his tail for one reason may subsequently learn to do it at other times in order to gain attention, or the frequent repetition of the behaviour may potentially result in neurological sensitization and the expression of the behaviour becoming emancipated from its original triggering stimuli. From the simple (and by no means definitive) list of differentials for tail chasing given above it should be obvious that underlying cognition can vary enormously with a given presenting stereotypic behaviour. This presentation considers the value but also limitations of using companion animals as models of human conditions and especially the value of using real world rather than laboratory models.",

      "title": "A Case of “Telogen Effluvium” Cured by Individualized Medicine",
      "abstract": "Acute telogen effluvium refers to sudden onset of scalp hair loss occurring 2 to 3 months after a triggering event such as a high fever, surgical trauma, sudden starvation, or hemorrhage. While emotional stress is often linked to this condition, evidence supporting this connection is weak, and there is no indication that the stress of daily life alone can cause widespread hair loss. The primary mechanism behind hair loss is the immediate release of anagen hairs. Patients may notice increased hair loss during brushing, combing, or shampooing, with daily losses ranging from under 100 to over 1,000 strands. If shedding occurs at lower rates and for a short duration, baldness may not be apparent, but higher rates can lead to a diffuse reduction in hair density. Spontaneous and complete regrowth typically occurs within 3 to 6 months unless the triggering event is repeated. Abrupt-onset telogen effluvium is often linked to a specific event or trigger 6 to 16 weeks earlier. In acute telogen effluvium, the hair pull test is positive, with normal club hairs, and there is usually a strong positive presence of telogen hairs at the vertex and the scalp margins.[1]",

      "title": "Testing cognition may contribute to the diagnosis of movement disorders",
      "abstract": "Diseases with movement disorders may be difficult to diagnose, both at the onset, when motor symptoms are mild and not sufficiently specific (e.g., difficulty in manipulating objects), or at end stage when distinctive motor signs are diluted in a severe and polymorphous clinical picture (eg, gait disorder with postural instability and cognitive decline in aged patients). Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep is a complex behavioural state, the ultimate functions of which remain poorly understood. It becomes more fragmented as we age, with more night‐time awakenings and greater tendency for daytime sleep. The magnitude of disordered sleep among individuals affected by dementia has been clearly demonstrated, and disturbed sleep is a major clinical problem in dementia. Comorbid insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such A lzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders. How and when sleep problems manifest themselves can depend on the type of dementia involved as well as the stage of the dementia. However, differences in sleep pattern presentation show more variation during the initial stages of dementias than they do during the later stages. Effective, pragmatic interventions are largely anecdotal and untested.",

      "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are negative emotional states familiar to us all through personal experience. Less familiar are severe states of depression, in particular, which can actually shorten the lives of sufferers by over a decade. The relationship of these very severe states of illness to the milder cases more common earlier in development is important. Most patients who have suffered from depression will suffer from further episodes during their lifetime, and an early onset may make recurrence more likely. A number of factors increase the risk for depression, including family history, stressful life events, early life experiences, personality (particularly the traits of neuroticism and perfectionism) and mood lability (marked ups and downs). Sleep disturbance may both provoke and/or signal the onset of mood disorder. Sleep is therefore doubly important as a gateway to treatment. Understanding more about how sleep interacts with the established risk factors would allow vulnerable young people to be identified earlier for more effective intervention. Early identification of sleep disorder and depression allows psychological treatments to be used, which are less effective once a full depressive episode and a cascade of neurobiological and psychological effects have occurred.",

      "title": "Mechanism of emergence agitation induced by sevoflurane anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Sevoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic used widely as a pediatric or outpatient anesthesia due to its excellent hemodynamic stability and low blood solubility, which allows rapid induction and emergence from general anesthesia, as well as control of the depth of anesthesia. However, when sevoflurane is used alone it is associated with a higher incidence of emergence agitation in children. The rapid removal of residual anesthetics due to low blood solubility of sevoflurane has been suggested to cause emergence agitation in some patients [1,2]. In addition, a variety of other explanations have been proposed for the etiology of emergence agitation. These include the lack of a young child's ability to adapt to sudden changes due to an unfamiliar environment after awakening, immature neurological development, anxiety from being separated from their parents, increased pain sensation and sympathetic hyperactivation [2,3].\r\n\r\nEmergence agitation is characterized by self-limiting aggressive agitation that develops in the early phase of awakening from anesthesia at the end of surgery. Emergence agitation can be dangerous to patients, particularly to young children. Patients suffering from emergence agitation may harm themselves and dislodge drains or catheters, which affects the results of surgery. They may inflict a bodily injury on their care-givers or cause a paranoiac accident, which makes the management and monitoring of patients at the post anesthesia care unit difficult [4]. There have been many attempts to reduce the incidence of emergence agitation but the etiology and preventive treatments of emergence agitation are still unclear.\r\n\r\nSome studies have reported that midazolam which acts on its target effect site GABAA, reduces emergence agitation [5,6], and its antagonist, flumazenil reverses this effect [7]. However, the mechanism is still not clear, and it is not known whether sevoflurane and midazolam interact at the GABAA receptor level. Most GABAA receptors consist of two α subunits, two β subunits and a γ subunit. The γ2 subunits of GABAA receptor exist as a long type (γ2L) and a short type (γ2S), generated by alternative splicing of RNA. The most common pattern for GABAA receptor is α1β2γ2 type, which accounts for 43% of all GABAA receptors [8]. This implies that the diversity of the subtype variants and the distribution of GABAA receptors may affect the anesthetics from subject to subject.\r\n\r\nIn this edition of the Korean journal of anesthesiology, Eom et al. [9] postulated that alternative splicing of the γ2 subunit is related to emergence agitation on the basis of characteristics of midazolam, sevoflurane and γ2 subunit. Sevoflurane binds to GABAA receptor, benzodiazepine-like midazolam prevents emergence agitation and also binds to α and γ subunit of GABAA receptor, and alternative splicing of γ2 subunit is different based on the age of the patient. Whole-cell patch clamp to the α1β2γ2L and α1β2γ2S GABAA receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells with midazolam and/or sevoflurane was performed. The concentration-response relationships were recorded for midazolam and sevoflurane. They showed that the concentration-response relationships for midazolam and sevoflurane were dose-dependent with no differences between the α1β2γ2L and α1β2γ2S subtypes. It was concluded that the difference in the γ2 subunit cannot explain the emergence agitation of sevoflurane in children in vitro.\r\n\r\nThese finding suggests that co-application of sevoflurane and midazolam enhances the GABA current according to the alternative splicing of the γ2 subunit and concentration of both drugs. Their effort to reveal the mechanism of emergence agitation induced by sevoflurane anesthesia could be a major step towards studying the basic mechanisms of the anesthetic agent. Further study to reveal the mechanism of emergence agitation is expected.",

      "title": "Paradigm shift in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy during later stages of recovery",
      "abstract": "Bell’s palsy (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy of the facial nerve) is an acute, usually unilateral paralysis of facial muscles. This disorder had been described and studied by Sir Charles Bell in 1836. In majority of Bell’s palsy cases the patient achieves full spontaneous recovery within 3-5 weeks even without treatment. In about 15-30% of cases the recovery takes considerably longer time (3 to 6 months, sometimes longer) and is usually incomplete. After the incomplete recovery of Bell’s palsy some residuals and complications usually develop. Those can include weakness of facial muscles, facial asymmetry in both neutral expression and with facial movements, pathological synkinesis, contractures of facial muscles, crocodile tears, facial pains etc.\r\n The above-mentioned complications may result in disfigured face with various degrees of severity, involuntary facial movements during speech and emotions, facial pains that are difficult to relieve with pain-killers, inability to adequately express emotions. All the named manifestations can have a dramatic impact on individual’s self-esteem, social contacts and general quality of life. They may lead to stress, depression, self-isolation and in some extreme cases – to suicidal behavior.\r\nCustomary treatment for acute Bell’s palsy include prednisone, antiviral medications, eye care to prevent drying of the cornea, mime-therapy (neuromuscular retraining). Sometimes acupuncture, chiropractors, laser therapy or high doses of B-vitamins are used. In some countries such controversial interventions as electrical stimulation (shocks) and massage with ice-cubes are being used as treatment modalities for acute Bell’s palsy. If the facial condition does not considerably improve within the first year, then the choice of treatments for residuals and complications of long-standing Bell’s palsy is rather limited. It includes continuation of mime-therapy, periodic injections of botulinum toxin, and in some exceptional cases surgical interventions (nerve graft, muscle transposition etc.) Facial nerve decompression has not been proven to be effective as Bell’s palsy treatment and therefore is nowadays seldom used. Long-standing Bell’s palsy patients are left with very limited choice of treatments for their residuals and complications. In the medical world and among rehabilitation specialists it is considered that if Bell’s palsy had not recovered within first 1-2 years and if complications had formed, then the patient will retain the developed synkinesis, contractures, related facial pains and other manifestations for the rest of his or her life.\r\nIn the recent years there has not been much research done of the underlying causes for the complications of long-standing Bell’s palsy. Without thorough understanding of such causes it is rather challenging to compose proper rehabilitation programs that deliver the desired improvements in facial symmetry and respectively, in patient’s quality of life.\r\nIn this article we discuss the traditional approach to possible causes, available treatments of Bell’s palsy complications and share our concept of a new paradigm in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy during later stages of the recovery (2 years and more). According to this new paradigm, synkinesis, contractures and mass movements of facial muscles, as well as related chronic facial pains are the result of newly-formed, pathological mimetic patterns in the CNS, which can be reduced and then reversed by applying the new approach to rehabilitation, based on other than traditional principles. The results achieved by our patients can serve as an evidence that this new approach may indicate a beginning of a paradigm shift in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

Its physiological correlate is an unusual occurrence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, i.e., sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs). Various symptoms of the phenomenon are explained by the mechanisms of REM sleep. SOREMPs can be observed in various situations, which indicate a lower amplitude of circadian rhythms, such as during interupted sleep, acute reversal of sleep and wakefulness cycle, and disrupted sleep of depressive patients and in newborn babies. The lifetime prevalence of the phenomenon in the general population is as high about 40%. The phenomenon can be a mysterious and frightening experience far affected people and called as various names according to the folklore beliefs of local communities, e.g., nightmare in Europe, hexendrücken in Germany, cauchemar in France, and old hag in Newfoundland. Japanese college students are known for their very short sleep length and disturbed sleep wake rhythms. Many students claim to have experienced daytime sleepiness. Some of them meet the criterion concerning sleep latencies and frequency of SOREMPs for multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) as narcolepsy. SOREMPs are frequently seen in healthy college students with certain lifestyles. Practitioners should be cautious to diagnose narcolepsy if the student shows disturbed sleep wake schedules.",

This article summarizes a century of sleep research to examine the maladies of dreaming, their pathophysiologic significance, and management.Under healthy physiologic conditions, REM sleep is characterized by vivid mentation combined with skeletal muscle paralysis. The loss of REM sleep atonia in RBD results in vivid, potentially injurious dream enactment to patients and bed partners. RBD is common, affecting at least 1% of the population and is primarily caused by α-synuclein pathology of REM sleep-related brainstem neurons. The majority of patients with RBD ultimately develop a neurodegenerative syndrome such as Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. Among patients with Parkinson disease, RBD predicts an aggressive disease course with rapid cognitive, motor, and autonomic decline. RBD is diagnosed by the presence of dream enactment episodes (either recorded or clinically recalled) and physiologic evidence of REM sleep without atonia demonstrated on polysomnography. Bedroom safety is of paramount importance in the management of RBD while pharmacokinetic options include melatonin or clonazepam.The injurious dream enactment of RBD is common and treatable. It is a syndrome of α-synuclein pathology with most patients ultimately developing Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or a related disorder.",

Due to relatedness to each other, these conditions are often found to co-occur. Among these conditions, trichotillomania or hair-pulling disorder is characterised by the tendency to pull one’s own hair recurrently and the pulling occur from any region of the body where hair grows. It may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or for more sustained periods that can continue for hours (APA, 2013).",

      "abstract": "Lightning injuries generally can be grouped into three classes of severity: mild, moderate, and severe. The prognosis and treatment depend on the severity of injury and the presenting signs that the patient exhibits. The mildly injured patient is often just stunned by the stroke. They usually are awake and able to respond to questions, although they may be confused and amnesic for the event, and continue to have difficulty with short-term memory assimilation for a few hours or days after the incident. The moderately injured patient may be disoriented, combative, or comatose. They often have keraunoparalysis, with paralysis of the lower and sometimes upper extremities that lasts for several hours. Severely injured victims often present in cardiac arrest with either ventricular standstill or fibrillation. Cardiac resuscitation may, on occasion, be successful. The victim of lightning stroke may suffer a range of injuries, from being temporarily stunned to full cardiac arrest.",

      "title": "Pathways to Motivational Impairments in Psychopathology: Common Versus Unique Elements Across Domains",
      "abstract": "Our ability as humans to engage in goal-directed actions that allow us to obtain outcomes that we desire is a core component of life satisfaction and achievement. Sadly, many forms of mental illness involve impairments in varying facets of motivation that are important contributors to the all too frequent impaired life function and reduced quality of life experienced by such individuals. As such, both the field of psychopathology research broadly and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative have recognized the centrality of examining motivation and incentive processing in psychopathology. This review will focus on the types of motivational impairments seen in disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Some individuals with depression do not engage in occupational, educational, or social behaviors that they might participate in when not depressed and may spend much of their time alone and engaged in very passive activities (sleeping, watching TV, etc.). Similarly, in schizophrenia, motivational impairments can also take the form of reduced efforts to engage in occupational, educational, or social experiences. In this review, we argue that elements of the final common pathway to impairments in motivation in depression and schizophrenia may be shared and are likely to involve deficits in what can be referred to as effort-cost decision-making (ECDM). This hypothesis suggests that a proximal cause of reduced engagement in occupational, educational, and social pursuits in both depression and schizophrenia is a reduced willingness to exert effort to obtain potentially rewarding or positive outcomes. However, we also argue that these ECDM deficits in depression and schizophrenia reflect differing distal mechanisms. More specifically, we argue that ECDM impairments in depression may be strongly related to reductions in hedonic experience of reward and pleasure, while ECDM deficits in schizophrenia may more strongly reflect difficulties with cognitive control and internal representation of future or past events and use of incentive information that is not currently available in the environment.",

      "title": "The Effects of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on the Cochlear Structure in Human Temporal Bones",
      "abstract": "Peripheral deafness may be inherited or acquired, congenital or later-onset, and sensorineural or conductive. The most commonly observed forms are inherited congenital sensorineural, acquired later-onset sensorineural (ototoxicity, presbycusis) and acquired later-onset conductive (chronic otitis externa/media). In most dog and cat breeds inherited congenital sensorineural deafness results from perinatal degeneration of the stria vascularis, the vascular bed of the outer wall of the cochlear duct, which leads to hair cell degeneration. The strial degeneration appears to result from the absence of melanocytes, but their function in this structure is unknown. Ototoxicity may result from any of a large number of drugs and chemicals that directly or indirectly destroy cochlear hair cells. The effects are dose-dependent and in rare cases reversible. The most commonly recognized ototoxic drugs are the aminoglycoside antibiotics. Presbycusis, the ageing-related progressive hearing loss unattributable to other causes, is sensorineural but may also include mechanical changes in the tympanum and ossicles. Hearing aids may be accepted by some dogs as long as some residual function remains. Breeds reported to have been affected by congenital sensorineural deafness are listed and those with the highest prevalence are noted. Methods for diagnosis of deafness are described.",

      "title": "REM sleep behavior disorder",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is associated with neurodegenerative disease and is responsive to clonazepam. RBD typically manifests as complex dream-enacting behaviors that are often vivid, unpleasant, or violent. The episodes typically occur approximately 90 minutes after sleep onset, coinciding with the timing of the first REM cycle, and may recur with subsequent REM sleep cycles. The diagnosis of RBD is based on a clinical history of injurious or potentially injurious dream-enacting behavior that disrupts REM sleep. Diagnosis requires a polysomnography (PSG). PSG shows REM sleep without atonia, excessive tonic and phasic electromyogram (EMG) activity recorded from the chin, excessive phasic EMG activity in the limbs, and abnormal REM sleep behaviors. Differential diagnoses encompass other causes of abnormal behavior in sleep, such as NREM parasomnias, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which may mimic RBD. Clonazepam is very effective in treating RBD and is considered first-line treatment.",

      "abstract": "Findings and recommendations on the assessment and treatment of adults with acute low back problems — activity limitations due to symptoms in the low back and/ or back-related leg symptoms of less than 3 months’ duration — are presented in this clinical practice guideline. The following are the principal conclusions of this guideline: • The initial assessment of patients with acute low back problems focuses on the detection of “red flags” (indicators of potentially serious spinal pathology or other nonspinal pathology). • In the absence of red flags, imaging studies and further testing of patients are not usually helpful during the first 4 weeks of low back symptoms. • Relief of discomfort can be accomplished most safely with nonprescription medication and/or spinal manipulation. • While some activity modification may be necessary during the acute phase, bed rest &gt;4 days is not helpful and may further debilitate the patient. • Low-stress aerobic activities can be safely started in the first 2 weeks of symptoms to help avoid debilitation: exercises to condition trunk muscles are commonly delayed at least 2 weeks. • Patients recovering from acute low back problems are encouraged to return to work or their normal daily activities as soon as possible. • If low back symptoms persist, further evaluation may be indicated. • Patients with sciatica may recover more slowly, but further evaluation can also be safely delayed. • Within the first 3 months of low back symptoms, only patients with evidence of serious spinal pathology or severe, debilitating symptoms of sciatica, and physiologic evidence of specific nerve root compromise corroborated on imaging studies can be expected to benefit from surgery. • With or without surgery, 80 percent of patients with sciatica recover eventually. • Nonphysical factors (such as psychological or socio-economic problems) may be addressed in the context of discussing reasonable expectations for recovery.",

Sleep efficiency and the amount of time spent in deep sleep appear to be reduced in many Sjögren’s patients. The causes of sleep problems in Sjögren’s are unknown, but autonomic nervous system involvement is suspected of playing a role. Major factors associated with Sjögren’s and sleep disturbances were dry eye, sleep apnea, and nocturnal pain. While few studies have been done, medications under investigation for use in Sjögren’s and other autoimmune disorders or already on the market for sleep problems might prove useful.",

      "title": "Sleep-disordered breathing in children",
      "abstract": "The first series of children with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome was reported in 1976. Later it became apparent that children may have breathing disorders during sleep without frank apnoea or 'hypopnoeas'. This pattern could be detected by measuring the oesophageal pressure. This led to the concept of sleep-disordered breathing as a spectrum that combines obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and the upper airway resistance syndrome. Studies that do not take into account this spectrum may misclassify symptomatic patients as 'primary snorers'. The exact prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in children is unknown but may be as high as 11%. There is a familial predisposition to sleep-disordered breathing. Nasal obstruction and mouth breathing influence facial growth, which may further lead to difficulty in breathing while asleep. Symptoms include an increase in total sleep time, nonspecific behavioural difficulties, hyperactivity, irritability, bed-wetting and morning headaches. Clinical signs include failure to thrive, increased respiratory effort with nasal flaring and suprasternal or intercostal retractions. Also, abnormal paradoxical inward motion of the chest may occur during sleep. Excessive daytime sleepiness and obesity are not always present. Untreated children may develop cardiovascular complications. The condition is treatable with continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure, and may be cured with surgery.",
