      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical phenomena or behavior that develop during the sleep period. These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2. Parasomnias usually associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including REM sleep behavior disorder (including parasomnia overlap disorder and status dissociatus), recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorder 3. Other parasomnias, including sleep-related dissociative disorder, sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning (catathrenia), exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder.",

      "title": "Parasomnias and Movement Disorders of Sleep",
      "abstract": "Neurologists are often enlisted to help diagnose, evaluate, and manage a spectrum of abnormal spells during the night ranging from parasomnias to motor disturbance that span the sleep-wake cycle. Parasomnias are undesirable emotional or physical events that accompany sleep. These events typically occur during entry into sleep from wakefulness, or during arousals from sleep, and are often augmented by the sleep state. Some parasomnias, such as the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder may be extremely undesirable, while others such as somniloquy are often of little concern. The parasomnias include a spectrum of abnormal emotions, movements, behaviors, sensory perceptions, dream mentation, and autonomic activity. Basic physiologic drives, such as sex, hunger, and aggression, may manifest as sleep-related eating, sleep-related sexual behaviors, and sleep-related violence. Parasomnias have a very bizarre nature, but are readily explainable, diagnosable, and treatable. They are hypothesized to be due to changes in brain organization across multiple states of being, and are particularly apt to occur during the incomplete transition or oscillation from one sleep state to another. Parasomnias are often explained on the basis that wakefulness and sleep are not mutually exclusive states, and abnormal intrusion of wakefulness into non-REM (NREM) sleep produces arousal disorders, and intrusion of wakefulness into REM sleep produces REM sleep parasomnias and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), two closely related conditions that often result in disturbed sleep onset and sleep maintenance, are also reviewed in this article. Although the mechanisms that underlie idiopathic RLS or PLMD are not fully understood, there is currently substantial evidence that dopaminergic dysfunction is likely involved in both conditions. The discussion will conclude with the \"other parasomnias\" and sleep-related movement disorders of clinical interest to the neurologist.",

These are rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders (RBD); restless legs syndrome; periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS); cataplexy, which manifests itself as sudden falling, head dropping, or jaw dropping due to sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions (laughing in particular); hypnic jerks or hypnagogic myoclonus; fragmentary myoclonus in children; autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy; sleep walking and sleep terrors; head banging, and bruxism (grinding of the teeth). Careful history taking or reviewing a home video provides valuable clues, but the gold standard remains video polysomnography (PSG).

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is associated with neurodegenerative disease and is responsive to clonazepam. RBD typically manifests as complex dream-enacting behaviors that are often vivid, unpleasant, or violent. The episodes typically occur approximately 90 minutes after sleep onset, coinciding with the timing of the first REM cycle, and may recur with subsequent REM sleep cycles. The diagnosis of RBD is based on a clinical history of injurious or potentially injurious dream-enacting behavior that disrupts REM sleep. Diagnosis requires a polysomnography (PSG). PSG shows REM sleep without atonia, excessive tonic and phasic electromyogram (EMG) activity recorded from the chin, excessive phasic EMG activity in the limbs, and abnormal REM sleep behaviors. Differential diagnoses encompass other causes of abnormal behavior in sleep, such as NREM parasomnias, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which may mimic RBD. Clonazepam is very effective in treating RBD and is considered first-line treatment.",

Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder may kick and flail, scream, fall out of bed, or engage in complex behavior that emerges from the content of their vivid, fearful dreams. Patients usually seek help only after they have injured themselves or their bed partners during sleep. Serious physical injury is possible. Often REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with the use of psychotropic medication or with a definable underlying neurological disorder.

Parasomnias are classified according to the type of sleep in which they occur, namely non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep parasomnias (1). The first includes disorders of arousals, namely confusional arousals (and their recently identified variants of sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviors), sleep terrors, and sleepwalking. REM sleep parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorders. Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are unexpected and undesirable motor activities during sleep. Parasomnias may occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nightmare disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM behavior disorder (RBD), and status dissociatus (agrypnia excitata) are some of the REM parasomnias. Parasomnia overlap syndrome is a term used for parasomnias that occur in both REM and NREM sleep stages, such as catathrenia. RBD is a parasomnia that occurs during REM sleep stage and is characterized by acting out dreams (oneirism), leading to unwanted motor actions such as kicking, punching, or slapping, or sudden abrupt movements that can cause unexplained injuries to self or bedpartner. Memory of the associated dream is usually preserved. Diagnosis is obtained via video polysomnography with findings of REM activity without atonia and video recording of the oneirism. Treatment starts with developing a safety plan, improving sleep hygiene, and identifying any medications or other triggers such as snoring or leg movements. Melatonin, benzodiazepines, and a few other medications are used for treatment of RBD and other REM parasomnias. [ Psychiatr Ann . 2021;51(12):560–565.]",

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Abnormal Movements at Night?",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

Accurate diagnosis of RBD requires a history of abnormal sleep behaviours and nocturnal video-polysomnographic (VPSG) demonstration of prominent tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity associated with abnormal vocal and motor manifestations in REM sleep. VPSG is required because dream-enacting behaviours resembling those typically seen in RBD may occur in people affected by obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder, visual hallucinations, isolated nightmares, confusional awakenings in demented subjects and more rarely by somnambulism and nocturnal epilepsy. Patients with Parkinson’s disease, particularly when associated with dementia, had non-RBD episodes of sleep-enactment behaviours occurring upon arousals from either REM or non-REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Die REM-Schlafverhaltensstörung (RBD) ist häufig das erste für den Betroffenen lebensbeeinträchtigende Symptom einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass 81%–90% der Patienten mit einer RBD innerhalb von zehn Jahren eine Alpha-Synukleopathie (Morbus Parkinson, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz, Multisystematrophie) entwickeln. Durch das Fehlen der normalerweise auftretenden Suppression der motorischen Aktivität während des REM-Schlafes, kommt es zum Ausagieren von Träumen. Die Diagnosesicherung erfolgt mittels Polysomnografie. Meist tritt die RBD zwischen dem 50. und 60. Lebensjahr erstmals auf. Männer sind wahrscheinlich häufiger betroffen als Frauen. Bei Patienten mit RBD fallen oft schon früh subtile Veränderungen wie Hyposmie, Obstipation oder Veränderungen der Motorik oder Kognition auf, die weitere Zeichen einer beginnenden neurodegenerativen Erkrankung sein können. Das gleichzeitige Auftreten der RBD bei bekannter, neurodegenerativer Erkrankung, ist häufig mit einem schwereren Verlauf verbunden. Neben Bettsicherungsmaßnahmen kommen zur medikamentösen Behandlung am häufigsten Clonazepam oder hochdosiertes Melatonin zum Einsatz. Die RBD stellt als Prodomalstadium einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung einen zentralen Ansatzpunkt für die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuroprotektiven, krankheitsmodulierenden Therapie dar.",

      "title": "Parasomnias",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as unpleasant or undesirable behavioral or experiential phenomena that occur predominately or exclusively during the sleep period. Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Millions of patients are afflicted by a variety of sleep disorders. Sleep can be measured electrophysiologically and described in terms of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with REM sleep being dream sleep. Overall, sleep is a cyclic phenomenon, showing a 90-minute periodicity. Sleep disorders are divided into four groups: disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, disorders of excessive somnolence, disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and the parasomnias. The parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep terror, and nightmares. The classic disorders of excessive somnolence include obstructive sleep apnea (an impairment of respiratory function during sleep) and narcolepsy (a genetically transmitted dysregulation of REM sleep). Insomnia may be either transient (eg, associated with jet lag, work shift change, or a disturbing or exciting situation) or chronic (eg, associated with psychiatric disorders or periodic leg movements during sleep). Hypnotics are generally reserved for the treatment of transient or short-term insomnias. Although a number of hypnotics are available, the benzodiazepines are currently accepted as the drugs of choice; selection within the group is based primarily on differences in pharmacokinetic profiles. The practicing pharmacist has the opportunity to play an important role in assessing, recommending treatment, or recommending further evaluation for the many patients who present with insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness.",

Full blown REM sleep behaviour disorder can be diagnosed clinically, but REM sleep motor dysfunction, a pathophysiological basis of REM sleep behaviour disorder, is difficult to detect without all night polysomnography. Twenty one consecutive patients with multiple system atrophy with no complaints of nocturnal abnormal behaviours were clinically evaluated to determine the presence of sleep related symptoms. All night polysomnography with video monitoring was performed to investigate REM sleep characteristics and patients' behaviours. In 85.7% (18 of 21) of the patients' sleep talk started or increased around or after the clinical onset of the primary diseases. REM sleep without atonia occupied more than 15%(16.2%-100%) of the REM sleep time in all but one patient. In 90.5% (19 of 21) of patients, motor events such as sleep talk and various combinations of craniofacial, orofacial, or limb movements occurred at various frequencies mostly during REM sleep without atonia. In patients with multiple system atrophy, REM sleep motor dysfunction is a common polysomnographic finding which is otherwise overlooked, and sleep talk may be its early clinical manifestation.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

      "title": "[Disruptive nocturnal behavior in elderly subjects: could it be a parasomnia?].",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are sleep-related abnormal behaviors. They are frequent and overlooked causes of nocturnal disruptive behavior in the elderly, especially when patients are cognitively impaired. Confusion and violence can result in sleep disruption, injuries for the patients or their bed partners, caregivers distress, and they can be a motive for institutionalization. Parasomnias include the NonREM sleep disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleep-related eating disorder), the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and more rarely the parasomnia overlap syndrome, which associates both NREM and REM parasomnias. Patients with NREM sleep parasomnias are confused, eyes open, with a glazed look during their nocturnal behaviors, and they have a post-episode amnesia. They shout and bolt from the bed (night terrors), look about in a confused manner, walk and speak (sleepwalking), and eat peculiar or inedible food (sleep-related eating disorders). These behaviors, which are frequent in young adults, may be triggered by short-half live hypnotics in elderly. During the parasomnia, the brain is partially awake (enough to perform complex motor and verbal action), and partially asleep (without conscious awareness or responsibility). RBD is characterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia that accompanies REM sleep. Patients have excessive motor activity such as punching, kicking, or crying out in association with dream content. RBD are frequent in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and may precede the cognitive or motor symptoms of these diseases by 5 to 10 years. RBD can also be promoted by antidepressants. When combined with thorough clinical interviews, the video-polysomnography is a powerful tool, especially for discriminating the parasomnia from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, sleep apneas and periodic leg movements. Ensuring safety and withdrawing deleterious treatments are useful in patients with violent activities, potential injurious or bothersome to other household members. Clonazepam and melatonin (3-12 mg) are highly effective for treating RBD.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are abnormal behavioral or physiological events that intrude into the sleep process disrupting its continuity. Parasomnia associated to REM sleep include REM sleep behavior disorder, nightmare disorders, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (SP), and sleep-related painful erections. The quality of life of patients suffering from parasomnias may vary according to the disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder patients experience recurrent vivid and violent dreams and frequent sleep-related injuries for themselves or bed partners, with possible impacts on personal, couple, and social life. Despite the possible awakening from REM sleep, sleep architecture is usually preserved in RBD. Idiopathic RBD may often precede a neurodegenerative disease, and its diagnosis might imply a psychological burden for patients and their family. The increased risk for neurodegenerative illnesses poses the ethical dilemma whether the patient should or should not be told about, especially in view of the current lack of effective neuroprotective strategies and the lack of knowledge about the precise extent of this risk. Nightmares are intensely disturbing dreams involving a variety of dysphoric emotions, most often fear and anxiety. Nightmares have been correlated to various measures of psychopathology, namely neuroticism, anxiety, depression, but not all studies support this relationship. Personality factors, such as nightmare frequency, nightmare distress (ND), and coping style, appear to be important in modulating the clinical severity of nightmare disorder. Parasomnias, especially nightmare and SP, can lead to postawakening anxiety with difficulty returning to sleep, sleep avoidance, and sleep deprivation, with subsequent insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and intensification of the parasomnia REM-rebound related.",

They may be classified as dysfunctions associated with transitions into sleep, partial arousals during sleep, or following arousals from sleep (2,3). Parasomnias can be categorized either as primary or secondary. Transitional parasomnias typically occur during wake-to-sleep transitions and can persist into N1 (Stage 1) sleep. Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both. Secondary parasomnias are more commonly associated with other organ system dysfunction and manifest symptoms during the sleep period.",

With the aid of video-polysomnographic electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) monitoring, sleep-related movements can be directly observed. Movements can be described based on duration, amplitude, periodicity, and most importantly their predilection to disturb sleep or produce other undesirable consequences. Sleep-related movement disorders (SRMD) constitute a class of movements that are simple and usually stereotyped, and are associated with undesirable effects such as impaired sleep quantity or quality, and/or impairment in daytime functioning. Unlike parasomnias, they are not associated with sleep-related mentation and are not goaldirected. They may occur during the transition between sleep and waking, and vice versa, or during any sleep stages.",

Nightmares and night terrors are explained: night terrors are pure emotional experiences that occur on awakening from sleep and are typically associated with non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Nightmares are more likely to occur in REM sleep and, however unpleasant, are normal events suggesting that the maintenance of these emotional systems of the brain, which ensure our survival, may be one of the functions of brain activation in sleep.

Parasomnias often involve the abnormal release of instinctual drives, such as locomotion, aggression, feeding, and sex during sleep, and can manifest with dream-enacting behaviors. Parasomnias are relevant to psychiatrists in regards to their misdiagnosis as a psychiatric disorder; their nocturnal extension of a daytime psychiatric disorder; their stress-responsivity; their induction or aggravation by psychotropic drugs; their adverse psychologic con- sequences; their link to various neurologic and medical disorders; and their forensic implications. Parasomnias can be categorized as primary disorders of sleep, or as secondary organ system disorders emerging during the sleep period. The evaluation of parasomnias includes clinical interviews, review of medical records, screening psy- chologic tests, neurologic examination, and hospital-based polysomnographic moni- toring. This article discusses the six most prominent behavioral parasomnias: REM sleep behavior disorder, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals (including abnormal sleep related sexual behaviors and severe morning sleep inertia), sleep relat- ed eating disorder, and sleep related dissociative disorders. Parasomnias can appear at any time in the human life cycle, often demonstrate prominent gender discordances, and can usually be accurately diagnosed and effectively treated.",

NREM parasomnias include sleepwalking and night terrors. Examples of REM parasomnias are nightmares, hypnogogic hallucinations, and REM behavior disorder. Although many parasomnias in themselves are considered benign, they are clinically relevant as some have been shown to be associated with psychiatric illness (e.g., nightmare disorder) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., REM behavior disorder).",

REM sleep disturbances can manifest as cataplexy (in narcolepsy type 1), sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, abnormal dreams, polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep disruption with sleep-onset REM periods, and fragmented REM sleep. Characterization of REM sleep and related symptoms facilitates the differentiation of narcolepsy from other central hypersomnolence disorders and aids in distinguishing between narcolepsy types 1 and 2. A circuit comprising regions within the brainstem, forebrain, and hypothalamus is involved in generating and regulating REM sleep, which is influenced by changes in monoamines, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides. REM sleep is associated with brainstem functions, including autonomic control, and REM sleep disturbances may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Medications used to treat narcolepsy (and REM-related symptoms of narcolepsy) include stimulants/wake-promoting agents, pitolisant, oxybates, and antidepressants; hypocretin agonists are a potential new class of therapeutics. The role of REM sleep disturbances in narcolepsy remains an area of active research in pathophysiology, symptom management, and treatment. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of REM sleep and its dysfunction in narcolepsy.",

      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a fascinating experiment of nature predicted by animal experiments nearly 40 years ago. Active paralysis of somatic muscles is one of the defining features of REM sleep. In the catmodel of REM sleep behavior disorder, bilateral perilocus ceruleus lesions result in loss of the expected atonia of REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting (oneiric) behaviors. In humans, REM sleep behavior disorder presents as complex behaviors arising from REM sleep, as the persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep permits the acting out of dreams, often with violent or injurious consequences to the patient or bed partner. These behaviors include talking, yelling, swearing, grabbing, punching, kicking, jumping, or running out of the bed and may result in lacerations, ecchymoses, or fractures. The acute, or transient, form is usually drug-induced (most commonly tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). REM sleep behavior disorder may also be a manifestation of narcolepsy. The chronic form is seen predominantly in men (80-90%) over 50 years of age. Initially felt to be idiopathic, it is now becoming apparent that spontaneous REM sleep behavior disorder is often a harbinger of degenerative neurological conditions, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or dementia with Lewy body disease). Interestingly, the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder precede any other manifestations of the underlying neurodegenerative disorders by an average of over 10 years. It is readily diagnosed by formal sleep studies which reveal persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep. Most cases of REM sleep behavior disorder respond dramatically to clonazepam administered at bedtime.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within rapid-eye-movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Also, instinctual behaviors can be involuntarily and pathologically released with the parasomnias, including sexual behaviors (sexsomnia), aggression, locomotion, and eating. The clinical consequences of a parasomnia can affect the patient, the bed partner, and any nearby individual. Sexsomnia is classified as a variant of confusional arousals (and sleepwalking), an NREM parasomnia, with amnesia for the sexual behaviors virtually always reported. The cumulative world published literature on sexsomnia consists of 220 cases, 84% males and predominant age in the 30s and 40s. Most cases were identified as NREM parasomnias, although obstructive sleep apnea was the identified trigger in 10.4% of cases. Various other triggers were identified. Forensic consequences were reported in 15 of the reported clinical cases. Sleep medicine physicians can expect inquiries from attorneys to solicit their involvement in criminal trials as forensic implications of parasomnias become increasingly more apparent. As courts generally have an implicit bias that is not favorable to the “sleepwalking defense,” sleep medicine physicians who take on the mantle of an expert medical witness should define their role and understand that supporting justice in the courtroom can only be optimally done through a strong collaborative effort with the attorney throughout the legal process.",

REM sleep also is referred to as paradoxical sleep, because the brain paradoxically seems to be in an activated state that is similar to, but not identical to, the waking state. REM sleep is characterized by an activated electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (low‐voltage, fast‐frequency brain waves), muscular paralysis (with the exception of diaphragmatic and ocular muscles), periodic bursts of rapid eye movements, and autonomic nervous system instability (e.g., variable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration). Brain metabolism is normal or slightly increased during REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors are disorders involving partial arousal from deep, non–rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in which individuals simultaneously display characteristics of both sleep and wakefulness. Sleepwalking represents the milder form of arousal, while night terrors are distinguished by the intense physiological experiences associated with alarm: screaming, pounding heart, rapid breathing, sweating, extreme terror or panic, and possibly frenzied motor activity. Both sleepwalking and night terrors usually occur during the first 3 hours after falling asleep but may occur at any time of night. They arise from non-REM sleep, generally sleep stages 3 or 4. There may be physical signs of traumatic injuries sustained during episodes of sleepwalking or night terrors. Most patients with sleepwalking/night terrors have a childhood history and/or a family history of these behaviors. There may also be a history of bedwetting.",

They may also characterize some frontal or temporal nocturnal seizures of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, or be considered as part of NREM parasomnias, especially sleepwalking, sexsomnia or sleep-related eating disorder, or REM-related behaviors such as REM behavior disorder or complex movements associated with pediatric narcolepsy type I. In most cases rhythmic movements, especially when complex and long in duration, are related to different levels of arousal from sleep with recurrence of ancestral motor sequences promoted by central pattern generators in the brainstem, generally activated by the arousal process. A differential diagnosis between physiological events and pathological movement disorders, and between the latter and sleep-related epilepsy is critical to provide optimal treatment and an accurate prognosis. Specific treatment options for the aforementioned disorders are beyond the scope of this article.",

Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

This article summarizes a century of sleep research to examine the maladies of dreaming, their pathophysiologic significance, and management.Under healthy physiologic conditions, REM sleep is characterized by vivid mentation combined with skeletal muscle paralysis. The loss of REM sleep atonia in RBD results in vivid, potentially injurious dream enactment to patients and bed partners. RBD is common, affecting at least 1% of the population and is primarily caused by α-synuclein pathology of REM sleep-related brainstem neurons. The majority of patients with RBD ultimately develop a neurodegenerative syndrome such as Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. Among patients with Parkinson disease, RBD predicts an aggressive disease course with rapid cognitive, motor, and autonomic decline. RBD is diagnosed by the presence of dream enactment episodes (either recorded or clinically recalled) and physiologic evidence of REM sleep without atonia demonstrated on polysomnography. Bedroom safety is of paramount importance in the management of RBD while pharmacokinetic options include melatonin or clonazepam.The injurious dream enactment of RBD is common and treatable. It is a syndrome of α-synuclein pathology with most patients ultimately developing Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or a related disorder.",

Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep.

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal “soft” signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long‐term prognosis of community‐dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep‐related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3‐12 mg or clonazepam 0.5‐2.0 mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence‐based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder as a prodromal synucleinopathy represents a defined time point at which neuroprotective therapies could potentially be applied for the prevention of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Sleep medicine is relevant in both neurology and general medicine. A disordered sleep–wake cycle can have major effects on many common neurological complaints such as headache and epilepsy, and it may also directly affect important general health issues, such as blood pressure. Furthermore, sleep related disorders such as parasomnias, particularly with agitation, can be hazardous to patients and bed partners while also being diagnostic clues in some neurodegenerative diseases. The traditional view that sleep is simply the absence of wakefulness has been increasingly refined over the past 50 years or so. Rather, it is a precisely orchestrated and complex state with distinct and mutually exclusive phases: non-rapid eye movement (stages 1–4) and rapid eye movement sleep (non-REM and REM sleep, respectively), defined largely by the surface EEG. In a typical night, there are 4–5 cycles of non-REM and REM sleep (figure 1). In REM sleep, the cortical EEG is highly activated in common with wakefulness, usually corresponding to the vivid dreaming that accompanies REM sleep. REM sleep periods predominate towards the end of the nocturnal sleep period whereas the deepest stages of non-REM sleep (stages 3 and 4) tend to occur within an hour of sleep onset. Figure 1 (A) EEG waveforms that define wake and non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep stages. (B) An idealised hypnogram summarising the distribution of the sleep stages through a typical night. Black bars refer to REM sleep during which the EEG pattern returns to that seen in wakefulness.

Niniejsza praca, poza opisem podstawowych informacji na temat PD, skupia się na zaburzeniach snu, wśród których najważniejszym jest zaburzenie zachowania w czasie snu REM, które może stanowić wczesny marker diagnostyczny rozwijającej się choroby, a tym samym pomóc w poszukiwaniu nowych terapii neuroprotekcyjnych już na wczesnym, prodromalnym etapie.",

Periodic limb movements of sleep was initially called “nocturnal myoclonus.” This diagnosis cannot be made in the presence of another sleep disorder. Individuals with this disorder tend to seek help for insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness. Period limb movements of sleep also may be associated with kidney failure, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, medical conditions that cause peripheral nerve and muscle pathology, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, and withdrawal from a variety of medications. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements of sleep may not be made if another sleep disorder is present, and frequently periodic limb movements during sleep do occur with other sleep disorders, especially narcolepsy, REM sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea.",

The frequency of arousals from slow-wave sleep with delta or mixed-frequency activity has a high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for the diagnosis of arousal parasomnias.Disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) are characterized by incomplete awakenings from slow-wave sleep, limited recall of imagery, and partial or complete amnesia. They occur most frequently in childhood. Management includes correction of precipitating factors, attention to safety, behavioral techniques, and medications. Sleep-related eating disorder is a variant of arousal disorders and may be associated with the use of short-acting hypnotics and restless legs syndrome. Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations can occur with visual loss, dementia with Lewy bodies, use of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and anxiety. Exploding head syndrome occurs at wake-sleep transition or on waking during the night, is usually benign, and requires treatment only if significant sleep disruption occurs.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

Parasomnias encompass abnormal movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning that can emerge in relation to any sleep stage at any time of the night. Parasomnias can affect people of any age-infants, newborns, and even fetuses (as described in the documentary Sleep Runners: The Stories Behind Everyday Parasomnias []). It is believed that the kicking of a fetus in utero is a manifestation of \"spontaneous motility patterns,\" that is, the most primitive form of motor activation-without concurrent inhibition-during primordial sleep (). This developmentally normal motor activity, when exaggerated in intensity and duration, could alter or disrupt the sleep of the \"bed partner\" (the mother), causing an insomnia in the mother induced by parasomnia behavior in her fetus ().",

      "abstract": "Le sommeil est un état physiologique et comportemental caractérisé par une isolation partielle de l'environnement. Lors du sommeil, un événement perturbateur comme la douleur peut provoquer une réaction de microéveil brève et inconsciente vers un réveil comportemental caractérisé par une réactivation thalamocorticale complète et un niveau plus élevé de conscience. Le sommeil devient alors fragmenté et les plaintes de douleur se trouvent souvent exacerbées. La continuité oscillatoire de 90–110 minutes, rythme ultradien du sommeil léger et profond (non-REM: rapid eye movement) vers le sommeil paradoxal (REM), est alors rompue. Chez un patient souffrant de céphalée, on observe trois périodes durant lesquelles surviennent les crises en relation avec le sommeil: 1) dans les heures avant l'initiation du sommeil, 2) durant et, 3) après le sommeil. La céphalée de tension et la migraine, la céphalée de type hypnique, l'algie vasculaire de la face (cluster headache) et l'hémicrânie paroxystique chronique peuvent survenir en relation avec le sommeil. Soulignons que la céphalée du réveil est parfois associée à du bruxisme (serrement et grincement des dents), à un abus de médications antalgiques, à de l'hypertension, à un trouble de l'humeur ou à des réductions du flux respiratoire lors du sommeil. Les céphalées suite à un traumatisme crânien sont fréquentes et causent de l'insomnie, des réveils subits et prématurés et surtout des matins pénibles avec délai de phase circadienne. Dans le contexte d'une céphalée survenant en relation avec l'insomnie ou la somnolence diurne, la recherche de troubles respiratoires du sommeil, d'intrusions sous forme de mouvements périodiques des membres ou de bruxisme est indiquée. La polygraphie peut être effectuée en laboratoire ou en ambulatoire. La gestion de ces céphalées suit les grands principes de la médecine contemporaine tout en visant une hygiène du sommeil maximale par thérapie cognitive et comportementale, le maintien d'un rythme circadien idéal, la prise de mélatonine, la correction du phénomène respiratoire. La prise d'hypnotique ne semble pas un traitement de choix à long terme.",

The rest of REM parasomnias (sleep related painful erection, catathrenia) may have other still unclear mechanisms. REM parasomnias deserve attention, because in addition to disturbing sleep and causing injuries, they may shed light on REM sleep functions as well as the heterogeneous etiologies of parasomnias. One of them, REM sleep behavior disorder has special importance as a warning sign of evolving neurodegenerative conditions mainly synucleinopathies (some cases synucleinopathies themselves) and it is a model parasomnia revealing that parasomnias may have by autoimmune, iatrogenic and even psychosomatic etiologies.",

The lack of muscle tone prevents the sleeper from performing the activities reflected in the alert EEG pattern.

      "title": "Stay Awake! Understanding, Diagnosing, and Successfully Managing Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. (1) When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. (2) Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. (3,4) In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. (5) The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; TABLE 1). (6,7) Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness (FIGURE 1). This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed. Overview of narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a chronic, neurologic sleep disorder that results from the dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles. (8,9) Its 4 classic symptoms are EDS, cataplexy (a sudden drop in muscle tone that is triggered by emotional factors), sleep paralysis (a generalized flaccid paralysis that happens slightly before or at the time of falling asleep or on awakening), and hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur while falling asleep). (8,10,11) EDS is the symptom that is experienced by almost all patients with narcolepsy. (10) Cataplexy is present in about 70% of patients with narcolepsy, whereas sleep paralysis (30% to 50%) and hypnagogic hallucinations (20% to 40%) are experienced less often; all 4 symptoms are present in an estimated 11% to 14% of patients with narcolepsy. (11) Although the origins of narcolepsy are still not well known, clinical understanding of the neurologic dysfunction that underlies narcolepsy as well as treatment options have increased markedly in the last decade. Prevalence and risk factors According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, narcolepsy is the third most frequently diagnosed primary sleep disorder found in patients who seek treatment at sleep clinics, after obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. (8) Narcolepsy appears throughout the world in every racial and ethnic group, but prevalence rates vary. (8,12) Reports in the United States estimate a prevalence of 1 per 2000 population, whereas the prevalence in Japan is considerably higher (about 1 per 600 population) and in Israel it is much lower (about 1 per 500,000 population). (8,9,11,12) Its incidence has been estimated to be about 0.74 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with cataplexy, and 1.37 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. (13) Although narcolepsy is about as common as multiple sclerosis, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated (8,12); the delay between the emergence of the initial symptoms and diagnosis is usually more than 10 years. (14) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The initiating event for narcolepsy is not well understood, but infection, immune system dysfunction, trauma, hormonal changes, or stress may be present before narcoleptic symptoms become manifest. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep that allows motor responses to dream content. Patients display patterns of unusual, complex, and even violent motor activities. There is a high risk for harm to the patients or their bedpartners. REM sleep behavior disorder is more likely to occur in synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy and may precede clinical manifestations by decades. In secondary RBD, brainstem centers involved in muscle atonia during REM are disrupted. These conditions include multiple sclerosis, cerebral vascular accidents, and brainstem tumors. The acute onset of RBD may associate with the use of antidepressants and acute withdrawal from alcohol. The diagnosis of RBD should be confirmed by polysomnography utilizing multiple-limb electromyography and synchronized digital video monitoring and demonstrate elevation of muscle tone during REM sleep along with dream enactment behavior. The differential diagnosis includes sleepwalking, nocturnal seizures, sleep apnea, and periodic limb movement disorder. Management focuses on maximizing safety, use of clonazepam/melatonin, and discussion of prognosis with patients.",

The diagnosis is usually straight-forward on clinical grounds, but whereas sleep paralysis is non-specific, it is difficult to sustain a diagnosis without cataplexy (Parkes et al., 1995). ‘Jelly attacks’ with laughter, or in the anticipation of laughter, is how it is often described, and the muscles around the face might jerk.",

      "abstract": "Dreaming is the mental activity of REM (and less commonly NREM) sleep.It is characterised by a perception of self, inner and outer world that is distinct from that of wakefulness.Neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies suggest that dreaming arises from activation of brainstem, thalamo-limbic and medial temporo-occipital areas and inactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal areas.Dream abnormalities in neurological disorders have poorly been studied.They include a reduction/cessation of dreaming (Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome), an increase in dream frequency, changes in dream contents and accompaniments (including REM sleep behaviour disorder) and the occurrence of dream-like experiences (hallucinations) during wakefulness and wake-sleep/sleep-wake transitions.Dream changes in association with neurological conditions including primary sleep disorders (e.g.narcolepsy, REM sleep behaviour disorder [RBD], nightmares), stroke and Parkinson's syndrome are reviewed.Assessment of altered dreaming and dreamlike experiences can be of clinical significance because of their diagnostic and therapeutic implications (RBD, hallucinations), prognostic significance (hallucinations) and distress that they can have for patients and their bed partners (e.g.nightmares, hallucinations, RBD).In addition, systematic studies of dream and dream-like experiences are expected to offer unique insights into the brain, mind and emotions of neurological patients.",

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

      "title": "Sleep Disturbances in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the commonest movement disorder. Though it is classified as a movement disorder and is diagnosed based on motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremors, it is associated with several other non-motor symptoms such as cognitive, sleep, autonomic, and olfactory dysfunction. The authors have taken up the challenge of studying sleep disorders during the pandemic in patients with PD. Sleep-related disorders are difficult to study given the subjective nature of symptoms and the need for detailed history from a reliable bed partner or objective studies such as polysomnography which are time-consuming and cumbersome. These aspects limit the external validity of the data collected in the study. Using questionnaires, though may make the study more generalizable, would lead to inaccuracies in assessing the various sleep disorders. Sleep disorders in PD can present as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, and (REM) Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). These can occur due to co-existing depression, motor fluctuations, off periods, and stiffness during sleep, nocturia, RBD, or anxiety. Sleep disorders can also be related to the underlying disease per se. Sleep is a relatively overlooked symptom of PD as the other symptoms often overshadow the sleep disorders. Sleep disorders occur in more than 60% of patients with PD.[1] A good night's sleep is essential to ensure productivity during the day. Disturbed or fragmented sleep leads to excessive daytime sleepiness and thus hampers the personal and professional life of the individual. Sleep is also important in the consolidation of memory, and sleep dysfunction antedates the development of various neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.[23] Desai et al. (AIAN 255.22) have reported a case-control study comparing 50 patients with PD and 50 age, gender, and BMI-matched controls. This was a cross-sectional study in which they compared the sleep parameters between the patients and controls using validated questionnaires. They found that 88% of patients had one or more sleep disorders as compared to 28% of controls. This study was done during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, none of the patients or their home members have been reported to have had COVID-19. The controls have been selected from hospital staff, friends, and relatives of patients. It is unknown if the selected hospital staff had shift work, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when they were short-staffed due to various health-care workers getting infected. Other confounding factors such as nocturia, associated obstructive sleep apnea, motor fluctuations during sleep and anxiety due to disease status, COVID-19 pandemic per se, and health of other family members have not been considered. It is also unclear if the examiner assessing the participant was blinded to the disease status. The various associated symptoms such as RLS and RBD have been assessed using validated questionnaires. However, they could have over or underestimated these in comparison to polysomnography, and the authors have pointed out these limitations. Future studies may be designed to overcome these limitations. This paper has compared patients with PD with healthy controls. A study by Kumar et al.,[4] which included a multicenter cohort of 832 patients with PD, reported only 35% of patients with PD reporting sleep disturbances. This study did not have controls. In a study from Wuhan, the authors reported a 69% prevalence of sleep disorders in Chinese patients with PD in comparison to 44% of controls. They also found a significantly higher prevalence of poor sleep quality and depression in PD patients as compared to controls.[5] The authors of this paper have concluded that sleep disturbances have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In summary, this is a study comparing PD patients with controls done during the pandemic period. The setting in which the historical studies were done might have been different from the current study. In addition, several other confounding factors such as disease stage, associated comorbidities, medication status, and cognitive status might have been different from the older studies, which have not been considered or compared in this study. Thus, it may be difficult to conclude that the sleep disturbances had indeed increased during the pandemic in patients with PD. It would be interesting to know if this same cohort of patients would have a change in sleep-related parameters after the pandemic. A study by Saluja et al.[6] reported an increase in insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic in 31% of patients with PD as assessed by caregivers using a structured questionnaire. However, this study could be subject to recall bias. In a study during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with baseline, a study from Sweden found reduced sleep-related disturbances during the pandemic in patients with PD. This study had collected baseline ratings before the pandemic as a part of their registry, thus removing an element of recall bias.[7] The subject of sleep in patients with PD has been a neglected field. It is essential to follow up patients evaluated during the pandemic to study their long-term follow-up status. In addition, it would be interesting to know the long-term neurologic outcomes of the participants in the control group who had RBD, which is known to be a premotor symptom of PD.",

Additionally, most patients with PD experience sleep-related symptoms, including difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and parasomnias such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (Kumar et al. 2002; Brotini and Gigli 2004; Postuma et al. 2009). Most studies point out that the prevalence of sleep disturbance in PD is nearly 100% (Lees et al. 1988; Kumar et al. 2002; Poryazova and Zacchariev 2005). These sleep disorders are classified as primary sleep disorders that are intrinsic to PD and secondary sleep disorders due to either medications or motor impairment (Friedman and Chou 2004). Most studies have shown that the use of dopamine (DA) agonists cause somnolence with a reversal of the sleep–wake cycle (Ondo et al. 2001; Sanjiv et al. 2001). CONTENTS",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal and sleep-related motor disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a wide spectrum of manifestations and present a complex clinical picture. Problems can arise due to impaired movement ability (hypokinesias), e.g. nocturnal hypokinesia or early-morning akinesia, or to excessive movement (hyperkinesias), e.g. end-of-the-day dyskinesia, parasomnias, periodic limb movement during sleep and restless legs syndrome. These disorders can have a significant negative impact on the sleep, daytime functional ability, and overall quality of life of individuals with PD and their carers. The debilitating motor issues are often accompanied by a combination of non-motor symptoms, including pain and cramping, which add to the overall burden. Importantly, nocturnal motor disorders encompass a broader timeline than just the period of sleep, often starting in the evening, as well as occurring throughout the night and on awakening, and are not just limited to problems of insomnia or sleep fragmentation. Diagnosis can be challenging as, in many cases, the 'gold standard' assessment method is video polysomnography, which may not be available in all settings. Various validated questionnaires are available to support evaluation, and alternative approaches, using wearable sensors and digital technology, are now being developed to facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring. This review sets out the parameters of what can be considered normal nocturnal movement and describes the clinical manifestations, usual clinical or objective assessment methods, and evidence for optimal management strategies for the common nocturnal motor disorders that neurologists will encounter in people with PD in their clinical practice.",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

      "title": "Human consciousness and sleep/waking rhythms: A review and some neuropsychological considerations",
      "abstract": "Abstract The relevance of sleep/waking rhythms to issues of human consciousness is reviewed from data in the literature and from personal studies. Consciousness is often considered to be markedly attenuated or absent in sleep. There is, however, much evidence for a rich subjective experience during sleep, much of which is not recalled later. This implies that William James' \"stream of consciousness\" persists continuously throughout sleep as well as wakefulness, but that problems of memory recall interfere with its being reported as such. Sleeping subjects show selective awareness of external stimuli, with significant stimuli generally leading to awakening and relatively nonsignificant stimuli, at least at times, being incorporated into the ongoing mental activity of REM or NREM sleep. Mentation throughout sleep is characterized by a high degree of autonomy and little willful control. Creative insight and problem solving of a very high order may occur in sleep and involve either dreaming or thought-like mentation. Parameters of waking consciousness show possibly sleep-related rhythmic fluctuations at both circadian (24 hr sleep/ waking) and ultradian (90–120 min, NREM/REM sleep) rates. Moreover, waking consciousness is markedly influenced by the quality of temporal stability of preceding sleep. A substantial number of so-called \"altered states of consciousness\" is found to involve primarily or exclusively dysfunction of sleep/waking mechanisms. Cerebral lesions can produce selective impairment of aspects of sleep mentation. It is concluded that further analysis of subjective awareness in sleep or in partial sleep states is very relevant and indeed vital to a more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness.",

      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is the parasomnia most commonly associated with an underlying neurological condition (the so-called symptomatic RBD). RBD usually occurs in setting of neurodegenerative diseases such as Lewy body dementia (LBD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), and it may precede the development of Parkinsonism by many years. The disorders of arousal are the most frequent of the NREM sleep parasomnias. They may be triggered by prior sleep deprivation, alcohol, emotional stress and febrile illness. Different medications have been associated with RBD or REM sleep without atonia (RSWA), particularly psychotrophic and antihypertensive drugs. In the last two decades, some studies have demonstrated that arousals secondary to apneas, hypopneas and irregular breathing can be the trigger for sleepwalking and related disorders in children and adults. Hallucinations, both diurnal and nocturnal, have been described in PD associated with cognitive decline and RBD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are two distinct types of sleep—non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—a balance of which is needed to function well during the day. During the night, these two types of sleep alternate with each other. Probably everyone dreams but the purpose of dreaming is generally unclear. The pattern of wakefulness and sleep is controlled by an internal clock in the brain (the body clock). Your level of alertness varies within each 24 hours. The tendency to sleep is greatest in the early hours of the morning (corresponding to deep NREM sleep) and (although less so) in the early afternoon. People vary in the time of day when they are most alert: ‘larks’ in the morning and ‘owls’ in the evening. Most people show neither of these patterns. Daytime naps can make it difficult to get to sleep at bedtime if they are too long or too late in the day. Long naps can make you feel groggy afterwards. Sleep has some features in common with other states of relative inactivity, such as coma or, in some species, hibernation. All of these states usually occur while lying down with little movement and reduced awareness of the environment to varying degrees. However, sleep is very different from the rest.",

      "abstract": "Non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) parasomnias are common across the lifespan. This article describes the manifestations, diagnosis, and management of non-REM parasomnias in adults and discusses the social implications of these conditions.Non-REM parasomnias represent a hybrid state of wakefulness and sleep, often triggered by events that increase the frequency of arousals or make it more difficult to fully arouse from sleep. Sleep deprivation, certain medications, and untreated obstructive sleep apnea are known to provoke parasomnias, particularly in those who are genetically predisposed. Non-REM parasomnias include disorders of arousal (ie, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals), sleep-related eating disorder, and exploding head syndrome. Clinical overlap exists between sleep-related eating disorder and disorders of arousal, suggesting that sleep-related eating disorder may be a fourth disorder of arousal or a manifestation of sleepwalking. Exploding head syndrome is a unique parasomnia of uncertain etiology.Non-REM parasomnias can range from minor nuisances to severe, life-altering events. While some patients with non-REM parasomnia experience significant consequences during sleep, wakefulness, or both, non-REM parasomnias do not pose a major risk to most patients. For all patients with non-REM parasomnias, safety should be explicitly discussed and addressed. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be prioritized, as increasing total sleep time, avoiding triggering substances, and treating comorbid sleep disorders is often sufficient for the management of non-REM parasomnias. If symptoms persist despite these interventions, treatment with clonazepam or other medications can be considered.",

These movements need to be distinguished from more complex motor activities which are called parasomnias, such as REM sleep behavior disorder or sleepwalking. This distinction can typically be accomplished by taking a detailed history and physical, but may require the use of in-laboratory, attended polysomnography. Commonly included in the classification of sleep-related movement disorders is restless legs syndrome, which, though a complex activity, is frequently associated with periodic limb movements of sleep which more clearly fit the description of a sleep-related movement disorder.

The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) dominate the clinical picture, the nonmotor complaints are often more disabling for the Parkinson patient. REVIEW SUMMARY Behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive changes occur commonly and are frequent causes for concern. Depression affects up to half of Parkinson patients and can worsen their motor function. Drug-induced psychoses can range from benign visual hallucinations to paranoid delusions. Dementia, classically described as subcortical, usually occurs in the elderly PD patient and is often clinically distinct from the cortical dementia of Alzheimer's disease although pathological descriptions overlap. A parkinsonian personality has been noted by psychoanalysts and movement disorder experts characterized as rigid and compulsive yet cautious and apprehensive with a subordinate behavior. Sleep disturbances associated with PD include insomnia, sleep fragmentation, daytime somnolence, vivid dreams, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Sensory symptoms, including pain, may occur, as do symptoms of autonomic dysfunction including postural syncope. Problems with bladder and bowel control and sexual dysfunction are common and often distressing to both the patients and their partners. Fatigue, akathisia, seborrheic dermatitis, and scoliosis are conditions intrinsic to or aggravated by PD. Most of these problems are amenable to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. CONCLUSION Helping patients with PD cope with these difficulties is just as important as manipulating therapy to provide control of their motor symptoms. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:18-27, 2000)",

Secondary RBD may be related to neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. Recent long-term prospective studies have shown that 30% to 65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disorder with the rate of emergence depending on the length of the follow-up period. RBD may therefore be one of the earliest signs of and/or a long-term predictor for neurodegenerative disorders.

      "abstract": "In the vast majority of patients with parasomnias, the evaluation can be accomplished in the office setting, based on information from the patients themselves and family members or other observers of the nocturnal events. Parasomnias are episodic sleep disorders that include sleepwalking, night terrors, and nightmares. All three conditions are more prevalent in childhood, when developmental factors appear to be responsible for their occurrence; in the much less frequent cases of a delayed onset or persistence in adulthood, psychopathologic states are often primary in their cause. Based on a number of clinical, physiologic, and etiopathogenetic similarities between sleepwalking and night terrors, these two conditions appear to fall along the same pathophysiologic and therefore nosologic continuum. They are both disorders of impaired arousal, characterized by various degrees of confusion, and they occur early in the night when slow-wave sleep predominates, whereas nightmares may occur at any time of the night, because they are closely associated with REM sleep. Another important issue relating to the assessment of parasomnias is to differentiate between nightmares and night terrors: in addition to the different time of night for their occurrence, nightmares are accompanied by much less anxiety, vocalization, motility, and autonomic discharge. Also, nightmare patients usually have vivid and elaborate recall for the event, whereas patients with night terrors are typically amnesic for their episodes, as are patients who sleepwalk. A mainstay in the management of sleepwalking and night terrors is instructing the patients and their family members to provide for adequate safety measures to prevent accidents that may occur during these events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness. This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are an integral feature of depressive disorders. Like the disorders themselves, the sleep disturbances associated with depression are heterogeneous, ranging from hypersomnia to marked difficulties maintaining sleep. These difficulties are to some extent age dependent and reflect abnormalities of central nervous system arousal. Moreover, the sleep disturbances associated with depression have both reversible, or state-dependent, and more persistent trait-like characteristics. Polysomnographic recordings can be used to document sleep maintenance difficulties, and they often also reveal reduced slow wave sleep, an early onset of the first episode of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased phasic REM sleep. A deficit of serotonergic neurotransmission, a relative increase in pontine cholinergic activity, and, perhaps, an excess of noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing hormone activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the sleep disturbances of more severe depressive disorders. Antidepressant medications have class- and compound-specific effects on polysomnographic profiles. Unlike other antidepressants, bupropion may increase or intensify REM sleep. While no single effect of antidepressants on sleep neurophysiology is necessary or sufficient for treatment efficacy, differences in drug effects may provide important clues to selection of specific medications for particular patients.",

      "abstract": "Summary The world‐wide prevalence of insomnia disorder reaches up to 10% of the adult population. Women are more often afflicted than men, and insomnia disorder is a risk factor for somatic and mental illness, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Persistent hyperarousals at the cognitive, emotional, cortical and/or physiological levels are central to most theories regarding the pathophysiology of insomnia. Of the defining features of insomnia disorder, the discrepancy between minor objective polysomnographic alterations of sleep continuity and substantive subjective impairment in insomnia disorder remains enigmatic. Microstructural alterations, especially in rapid eye movement sleep (“rapid eye movement sleep instability”), might explain this mismatch between subjective and objective findings. As rapid eye movement sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep, it might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. In consequence, mentation during rapid eye movement sleep may be toned more as conscious‐like wake experience, reflecting pre‐sleep concerns. It is suggested that this instability of rapid eye movement sleep is involved in the mismatch between subjective and objective measures of sleep in insomnia disorder. Furthermore, as rapid eye movement sleep has been linked in previous works to emotional processing, rapid eye movement sleep instability could play a central role in the close association between insomnia and depressive and anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important topic of clinical neurology because they are much more common than thought, and they may be the result of functional or organic brain disorders. Based on the electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioral characteristics, as studied by polysomnography, sleep is divided into two stages: rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep) and non-REM sleep (NREM sleep, slow-wave sleep). NREM sleep is further divided into three stages: N1, N2, and N3, corresponding to NREM stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 plus 4 of the Rechtschaffen and Kales classification, respectively. In the REM stage, the EEG is similar to the waking EEG, but it is characterized by the occurrence of rapid eye movements and a decrease or loss of muscle discharge in the jaw muscles. The subject usually dreams during REM sleep. The mechanism of sleep stages has been extensively investigated physiologically as well as pharmacologically.",

      "abstract": "A non-reversible obstructive inflammatory process of the small airways and destruction of the alveolar walls characterizes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

A video-polysomnography revealed periodic leg movements (figure) and arousal followed by sleep episodes while standing, rhythmic marching, and falling (videos 1 and 2 on the Neurology ® Web site at [Neurology.org][1]). A reevaluation of his history revealed symptoms compatible with restless legs syndrome (RLS). Rotigotine1 proved very effective, supporting the diagnosis of RLS. Periodic leg movement disorder leading to sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder could also be considered. Automatic behavior denotes severe sleep deprivation2 and may represent a non-REM parasomnia. Severe RLS may present with automatic behavior complicating its diagnosis.

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

We report a case of recurrent falls in an elderly woman, occurring exclusively at night and caused by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. In this condition there is a loss of the normal atonia of postural muscles that usually occurs in REM sleep [2]. It results in complex, vigorous, dream-enacting behaviours during REM sleep [3]. These typical behaviours have the potential to cause serious injury at night, particularly from falls. This disorder appears to have been overlooked in the geriatric literature as a potential source of falls and injury at night.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

All-night polysomnographic recordings with video monitoring showed episodes of teeth grinding or clenching occurring exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which were often associated with movements of the hands and fingers and/or brief vocalization. Throughout REM sleep, there was excessive phasic chin electromyographic twitching, without increased tone, and also excessive phasic electromyographic twitching in multiple muscle sites. The patient maintained a normal nonrapid eye movement-REM cycle, but showed increased REM density. Polysomnographic characteristics suggested that there may be a common pathophysiology in a certain type of sleep bruxism and the REM sleep behavior disorder. Sleep bruxism seen in this case is concluded to be a manifestation of subclinical REM sleep behavior disorder.",

It can be primary or secondary, signs and symptoms of which include exorbitant daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep and difficulty falling asleep. A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

It is important to distinguish excessive daytime sleepiness from alterations in the level of consciousness, such as lethargy. During the night, a sleeper cycles through a series of sleep stages; this is called “sleep architecture.” Rapid-eye-movement sleep is the state in which most, but not all, dreaming experiences occur.

Though it is often associated with narcolepsy, sleep paralysis can be seen in any condition where there is sleep disruption and is most commonly seen in younger patients who have significant sleep deprivation or insufficient sleep. It is also associated with other common sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, and can be part of the differential diagnosis for numerous other related conditions such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and nocturnal panic attacks. Obtaining a comprehensive sleep history is essential in accurately characterizing episodes, and for determining the underlying etiology. Treatment of sleep paralysis is largely focused on preventing sleep disruption, and with reassurance and education.

This disturbance of circadian rhythm is associated with degeneration of responsible area for sleep-wake regulation (i.e. suprachiasmatic nucleus: SCN, tuberomammillary nucleus: TMN etc.) and decreased melatonin secretion. To prevent or treat sleep disturbance in dementia, mixed modality approach with pharmacological, physical and social intervention and sleep-wake scheduling is needed. Management of the symptom is important for maintaining QOL of not only patients themselves but alsotheir caregivers.",

Visit to a somnologist at the University Clinic. Complaints were mainly made by the patient’s wife, since the patient himself does not remember these episodes. According to the wife, sudden sweeping movements of the arms and legs, incoherent speech are noted during sleep, then the patient gets up, can grab his hands, behaves aggressively, shifts things. These complaints have been noted for more than 10 years, with a gradual worsening of symptoms. A neurologist at the place of residence suggested a possible epileptic nature of these episodes,but no further examination was carried out. Results. From a semiological point of view, motor phenomena during sleep can imitate epileptic seizures, parasomnias, rapid eye movement behavior disorders, and normal sleep motor phenomena such as fragmentary sleep myoclonus, periodic limb movements, bruxism, etc. A differential diagnostic search is provided, a comparative characteristic of motor phenomena during sleep and wakefulness is given, as well as a scale of frontal epilepsy and parasomnia, which can help the doctor in making the correct diagnosis. Conclusion. Conducting a comprehensive examination of the patient and clarifying the clinical diagnosis made it possible to choose the correct management tactics, avoid unjustified prescription of antiepileptic drugs, and reduce emotional stress in the family due to the ambiguity of the manifestations of night motor phenomena. The established clinical diagnosis allows monitoring the patient in terms of the possible debut of a neurodegenerative disease.",

      "abstract": "While REM sleep is the phase of sleep from which dream reports are most reliably elicited, dream reports can also be elicited from any other stage of sleep, including sleep onset and N3 SWS. Reports after awakenings from NREM stages of sleep tend to be shorter, less emotional, and less visually vivid than reports obtained from REM – but we do get reports of “dreams” from NREM sleep states. Indeed, you can get dream reports without REM when REM is chemically suppressed via antidepressant medications. Just as dreams can occur without REM, REM sleep can occur without dream reports. About 20 percent of awakenings after a REM episode results in no dream report. Activation of REM, therefore, does not necessarily eventuate in a dream or at least a dream report. In addition, children who have abundant REM do not consistently report dreams until visuo-spatial and cognitive skills have matured enough to support reporting of visual narratives (Foulkes, 1982). Similarly, patients with lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex, basal forebrain, and near the occipitotemporoparietal junction sometimes report complete cessation of dreaming (Solms, 1997). In addition, Solms emphasized that disconnection of the ascending meso-limbic-cortical dopaminergic tracts from their termination sites in ventromedial frontal lobes could also lead to the loss of dreaming. Given that this tract is associated with instinctual appetitive drive and motivational states, it seems reasonable to conclude that this dopaminergic system may participate in the generation of some dreams. The loss of dreaming in these patients is not due simply to an inability to recall dreams, as their basic memory and recall abilities are largely intact. REM physiology as measured by sleep EEG is normal in these individuals, thus REM is still operating.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival).

The differential diagnosis of sleep related injury and violence includes: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD); NREM sleep parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep terrors); parasomnia overlap disorder (RBD + NREM sleep parasomnias); obstructive sleep apnea; sexsomnia (sleep related abnormal sexual behaviors); sleep related dissociative disorder; trauma-associated sleep disorder/post-traumatic stress disorder; periodic limb movement disorder; rhythmic movement disorder; nocturnal scratching disorder; nocturnal seizures; and miscellaneous/mixed conditions. Careful clinical interviews, preferably with bed partners participating, and extensive, hospital-based, technologist-attended, overnight video-polysomnography (for one or more nights), is crucial for determining the accurate diagnosis that will guide proper therapy. Most of the disorders mentioned above are classified as parasomnias in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, with parasomnias defined as abnormal behavioral, experiential and/or autonomic nervous system activity during entry into sleep, during any stage of sleep, and during emergence from any stage of sleep. Parasomnias are often manifestations of \"state dissociation\" in which components of one state of being (wake, REM sleep, NREM sleep) intrude into, and become admixed, with other states of being, with clinical consequences. There are forensic implications related to the parasomnias, with inadvertent and unintentional assaults, murder, and \"pseudo-suicide\" resulting from aggressive and violent behaviors arising from sleep with suspended awareness and judgement.",

The notion of confusional arousals in children has received less attention overall compared with that concerning adults. The impression gained in adults is that, especially in response to forced awakenings, the behavioral disturbance in adult episodes is more forceful, vigorous and resistive, sometimes leading to violent behavior. Childhood confusional arousals do not usually require treatment, only advice to parents that they can be considered to be a passing phase.

      "title": "Sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders",
      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness of sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders. Most of the sleep disturbances in neuromuscular disorders are secondary to sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is commonly associated with a slowly developing chronic respiratory failure, particularly in the advanced stages, but the condition often remains unrecognized and untreated. The most common sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is sleep-related hypoventilation which initially manifests during REM sleep and later as the disease advances, it is also noted during non-REM sleep and even during daytime. In addition to the hypoventilation, central and upper airway obstructive apneas as well as hypopneas occur. Hypoventilation during sleep gives rise to hypoxemia and hypercapnea causing chronic respiratory failure. The abnormal blood gases may later persist during the daytime. Some patients may, however, have sleep onset or maintenance insomnia as a result of associated pain, muscle immobility, contractures, joint pains and muscle cramps as well as anxiety and depression.The commonest complaint in patients with neuromuscular disorders associated with sleep-disordered breathing is excessive daytime somnolence as a result of repeated arousals and sleep fragmentation due to sleep hypoventilation and transient nocturnal hypoxemia. Sleep-disordered breathing causing sleep disturbance is well known in patients with poliomyelitis, postpolio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, primary muscle disorders including muscular dystrophies and myotonic dystrophy, congenital or acquired myopathies, neuromuscular junctional disorders and polyneuropathies. All of these conditions may cause weakness of the diaphragm, the intercostal and accessory muscles of respiration causing breathlessness and other respiratory dysrhythmias. As a result of the respiratory and upper airway muscle weakness, the normal sleep-related respiratory physiologic vulnerability becomes pathological in these patients with neuro-muscular disorders causing hypoventilation or central and upper airway obstructive apneas during sleep. Multiple factors are responsible for sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders causing sleep hypoventilation and other respiratory dysrhythmias, and these include: impaired chest bellows, increased work of breathing, hypo-responsive respiratory chemoreceptors, increased upper airway resistance, decreased minute and alveolar ventilation, REM-related marked hypotonia or atonia of the respiratory muscles except the diaphragm, respiratory muscle fatigue and kyphoscoliosis secondary to neuromuscular disorders causing extrapulmonary restriction of the lungs. Nocturnal hypoventilation and chronic respiratory failure in neuromuscular disorders may present insidiously and initially may remain asymptomatic. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed. Clinical clues suggesting sleep-disordered breathing include daytime hypersomnolence, breathlessness, disturbed nocturnal sleep and unexplained leg edema. If the clinical clues strongly suggest sleep-disordered breathing, a physical examination must be directed to uncover bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness. Patients with neuromuscular disorders showing these clinical features must be investigated to uncover nocturnal hypoventilation to prevent serious consequences of chronic.",

      "title": "Significance of REM Sleep in Depression: Effects on Neurogenesis",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of sleep are typical of depression and are observed in between 50% and 90% of depressed subjects [1]. Most patients with depression complain of insomnia and have well-described sleep disruptions, which belong to the core symptoms of the disorder [2]. Sleep disorders in depression have stimulated many sleep studies and for many decades sleep research has been a major pillar of neurobiological investigations into depression’s cause, onset and course. Since 1960s polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that besides disturbances of sleep continuity a constellation of sleep EEG changes is present in depression [3,4]. Especially Rapid Eye Movement activity has been the favorite focus of sleep EEG studies in depression and studies on its significance indicate that a strong link exists between dysregulation of REM sleep, REM latency, REM density, and the cause, onset and course of major depressive disorders. These alterations might act as trait dependent marker of depression and have been considered biological marker for depression. Especially shortened REM sleep Latency might be both a prodrome of major depressive episodes [2] and a consequence or complication of depression [2,5]. In fact REM alterations often persist beyond the clinical episode indicating heightened vulnerability to depressive relapse or recurrence, negative affecting treatment response independent of treatment method [2,6]. Moreover because the majority of antidepressant irrespective of their chemical class suppress REM sleep, it has been hypothesized that REM sleep suppression might be considered a key mechanism underlying treatment response and might be considered necessary if an antidepressant effect is obtained. Recently REM deregulations have been described to have a role in the production of the core symptoms of mood disorder contributing to the core features of cognitive distortion including self-worth [7] and to negative emotional memories consolidation. Studies have in fact demonstrated that there is a failure of sleep dependent emotional brain processing in REM sleep in depression which seems to support the development of clinical depression [8]. In addition, REM sleep is physiologically abnormal in persons at risk for depression. In fact several high risk studies including healthy relatives of patients with depression have demonstrated that REM sleep, particularly REM density changes, are present before the disorder’s onset and predict its development.Several theoretical models have been developed to explain REM sleep abnormalities in depression and they might be implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. Indeed Circardian Rhytm abnormalities have been hypothesized to explain REM sleep abnormalities in depression i.e. the Two Process Model, “S-deficiency” [9] the “Phase-advance” hypothesis [10], genetically driven [11] and the “hypocretine deficit hypothesis” [12], REM sleep dysregualtion have been historically posed as a causal process of depression [13]. In fact the “Monoamine Hypothesis,”ACh-hypersensitivity” in depression indicate a key role of REM sleep dysregualtions as specific features of this disorder due to cholinergic hyperactivity [14] which might be under genetic control. More recently REM sleep dysregulation have been hypothesized to contribute to neurometabolic alterations in depression. Recently McNamara et al. [7] suggest that one proximate mechanism that does directly yield the pathophysiologic pattern of hyperactive paralimbic/ ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC) and hypoactive dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dPFC) in mood disorders might be “REM hyperactivation or dis-inhibition” driven. A key role of REM sleep alterations in the pathogenesis of depression have been also indicated within the defect of brain maturation hypothesis. A novel concept for the etiology of depression proposes that a dysfunction of neural plasticity might represent a final common pathway underlying the biological and clinical characteristics of the disorder. Changes in neurogenesis might be linked to the pathophysiology of depression. In fact a decrease in neurogenesis has been shown in animal models of depression, and shift in brain plasticity might be stress related [15]. Recently it has been hypothesized that one mechanism that does directly yield the pathophysiologic pattern in mood disorders affecting neurogenesis is stress-related REM hyperactivation or dis-inhibition [16,17]. Moreover available data favor the hypothesis that the increase of stress hormones, due to sleep loss of depression and REM-stress related affects adult neurogenesis and it may endanger hippocampal integrity [18], thereby leading to cognitive dysfunction and contributing to the development of mood disorders (allostatic load) [16,17]. REM sleep changes in depression might be under a genetic control and are mediated by complex neurobiological modifications that involves noradrenergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic systems and the stress system which might affect adult neurogenesis and brain plasticity. Recently REM sleep alterations have been considered not only biological scars but true endophenotypes for depression [4,19]. In fact in the search of new “vulnerability markers” or “endophenotypes” for depression changes during the REM sleep period have been reconsidered of potential interest.Concluding form historical studies to more recent ones we might hypothesized that REM sleep might play an important key role in depression onset, course, cognitive emotional symptoms, expression and treatment response. Moreover REM sleep dysregulation might contribute to neurometabolic alterations in depression and are involved in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders. Especially it seems that REM sleep changes in depression might be under a genetic control and are mediated by host of genetic, neurochemical and neurobiological factors which might affect neurogenesis and brain plasticity of depressed patients. For all these evidences in the search of new “endophenotypes” changes during the REM sleep period have been reconsidered of potential interest. Clearly REM sleep dramatically modulates physiological, emotional and cognitive states of the human",

However, not infrequently, the presence of non-quiet sleep leads patients or their families to consult their family physician, since movements during sleep may be associated with several somatic or mental disorders, and may result in decreased quality of life. There are several clinical syndromes of pathological movements during sleep, which are usually classified according to the sleep stage at which they tend to occur. While the restless leg syndrome is one of the most common movement disorders, it usually occurs during wakefulness but commonly results in insomnia and is frequently associated with the periodic leg movement disorder of sleep. The movement disorders under parasomnias consists predominantly of disorders of arousal, sleep-wake transition disorders (rhythmic movement disorders), and rapid eye movement (REM) related disorders. This review briefly describes these movement disorders in sleep, and highlights their diagnosis and treatment. It emphasizes the recent development and novel knowledge in this field in recent years.",

The occurrence of RBD is in the last third part of the night. In this part, the REM sleep is much more common. The dreams during RBD would be vivid and patient's violent and aggressive behavior and movements can be dangerous for the patient and his/her bed partner. RBD is most common in older men. Its etiology is not clear but RBD is associated with some neurodegenerative diseases like multiple system atrophy, parkinson's disease and lewy body dementia. This association specifically with parkinson's disease is high, since about 50 percent of the patients with RBD develop parkinson's disease during years. In the association between RBD and neurodegenerative diseases, RBD's occurrence would usually be preceded such neurodegenerative diseases by several years.",

      "title": "1255 An Unusual Clinical Presentation of a Parasomnia",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry to sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from sleep. The non REM (NREM) parasomnias include confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. In children, NREM parasomnias occur out of stage N3 (first part of the night) but in adults can occur out of stages N1 or N2 during any part of the night. We describe a case of NREM parasomnia with atypical clinical presentation. A 21-year-old female with history of depression and anxiety was evaluated for sleep terrors, sleep walking and sleep eating since age 5. Over the period of past 4 years, her sleepwalking subsided, and was substituted with hallucinations. Patient woke up with loud screams and hallucinations, “living the dream” and was able to explain it to her parents with her eyes open, who eventually “woke her up out of the episode”. Dreams were violent with “death” as the usual theme, approximately 2 hours after sleep onset with complete recollection after waking up. She also endorsed excessive daytime sleepiness with adequate sleep time on actigraphy. Patient denied history of head trauma, encephalitis, epilepsy or family history of sleep disorders. She was treated with Alprazolam and Sertraline in the past 3 years without improvement. She underwent a carefully conducted PSG and MSLT, which was negative for sleep disordered breathing or hypersomnia disorders. Extended Video EEG monitoring captured multiple stage 2 screaming and looking under the bed episodes with patient describing, “dead dogs around and under her bed”. No epileptiform activity was seen. Patient was started on Protriptyline HCL 10 MG twice daily, which resolved her symptoms. Sleep hallucinations are relatively common in teens and young adults, usually visual and reduce with aging. This case highlights an unusual presentation of hypnopompic hallucinations in stage 2, patient opening her eyes and being able to describe her hallucinations before she is “woken out of her sleep”. Differential diagnosis includes disorders of NREM sleep arousals vs. epileptiform activity. Latter was ruled out with an extended video EEG monitoring. It’s also interesting to note that her symptoms resolved with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which was used due to failure of SSRI and benzodiazepine therapy in the past. TCA use has been described to control sleep hallucinations in narcolepsy, our case delineates their possible use in NREM hallucinations.",

Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью.

      "title": "An Overview of Sleep Physiology and Sleep Regulation",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a complex behavior that cyclically alternates with wakefulness and is fundamental for both mental and physical wellness. During normal sleep the body acquires a specific posture; any active behavior is absent and mental activity typically oscillates between a state of \"loss of consciousness\" and the experience of dreaming. Sleep is, by itself, a cyclical process characterized by the alternation of two phases, non-REM (NREM) sleep and \"rapid eye movement\" (REM) sleep, during which the typical synchronized electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern of NREM sleep is substituted by a \"paradoxical\" EEG desynchronization. NREM sleep is a state of minimal energy expenditure and motor activity, during which cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory variables are driven by the autonomic nervous system at a lower and more stable level compared to wakefulness. During REM sleep, beyond the occurrence of REMs, posture control is lost and dreams become more vivid. Furthermore, autonomic activity is highly unstable leading to centrally driven surges in heart rate and blood pressure, breathing becomes irregular, and thermoregulation is suspended or depressed, suggesting a derangement of the integrative regulation of physiological functions. Overall sleep quality is one of the most important parameters considered for the subjective assessment of quality of life and general health status. However, although sleep function(s) is intuitively associated with some kind of rest that seems to be mostly required by the central nervous system, and many theories on sleep function have been proposed, a full comprehension of sleep function has not yet been achieved and is probably not imminent.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders: Disorders of Arousal?",
      "abstract": "In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism, the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues, overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date, it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.",

      "title": "Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

The selective disruption of slow wave sleep has shown this effect more consistently, while results after selective REM sleep deprivation remain unclear. Patients with chronic pain have a marked alteration of sleep structure and continuity, such as frequent sleep-stage shifts, increased nocturnal awakenings, decreased slow wave sleep (SWS), decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and alpha-delta sleep.

Unfortunately, many people assume that insomnia is normal and do not report it to the nurse or seek treatment. Sleep deprivation impairs the person's physical, mental, and cardiac functioning. Often insomnia is treated with medications which may have side effectives or be habit forming. Individuals with insomnia need evaluation of the precipitants of insomnia, education about sleep hygiene, and information about non-pharmacological treatments. In clinic and hospital settings, nurses are in a pivotal position to identify sleep problems, educate patients, and refer them for follow up.",

      "title": "REM sleep and emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is one of the most significant of human behaviors, occupying roughly one-third of human life. Sleep disorders are one of the most common clinical problems encountered in outpatient settings and inpatient settings. Lack of sleep can lead to the inability to concentrate, memory complaints, and deficits in neuropsychological testing. Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients. Patients with delayed and advanced sleep phase insomnia can be treated with proper timing of bright light and behavioral changes. Hypersomnia related to a mental disorder is usually found in a variety of conditions such as the early stages of mild depressive disorder, grief, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

The boundaries between waking and REM sleep become blurred resulting in REM phenomena in wakefulness and features of wakefulness during sleep. Narcolepsy is not rare, with a prevalence of 25–50/100,000 in Western Europe, however many individuals remain undiagnosed for many years after the onset of symptoms [1]. One third of adults with narcolepsy describe their first symptoms appearing before the age of 15 and there is a clear peak of onset in the teenage years [2]. The classic narcolepsy tetrad comprised excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotion, most frequently laughter), sleep paralysis and hypnagogic (on falling asleep) and hypnopompic (on waking) hallucinations. Disturbed nighttime sleep was often added to make up a pentad. These symptoms apart from excessive daytime sleep and cataplexy are not uncommon in unaffected individuals and other sleep disorders. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders defines narcolepsy without cataplexy as excessive daytime sleepiness and multiple sleep onset REM periods on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) [3].

However, other abnormal movements can emerge during sleep, either as a primary phenomenon or in association with another underlying movement disorder, such as Parkinson's disease. In addition, some movement disorders are associated with excessive daytime sleepiness or insomnia. A history from the patient's bed-partner is very helpful in the assessment of movement disorders during sleep. The patient themself may not be aware of the problem, and may simply report excessive daytime sleepiness because of poor quality of sleep. Movement disorders during sleep are often a very early symptom of another underlying movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy, but may be overlooked unless specific enquiry is made during history taking.

      "abstract": "REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) occurs in up to 90% of narcolepsy patients. REM behavior disorder (RBD), however, is reported to occur in only 12% to 36% of patients with narcolepsy. Use of RSWA has been proposed as an additional marker for narcolepsy diagnosis and as a tool to differentiate between narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. We describe a case of narcolepsy without cataplexy (N-C) with RSWA on polysomnogram (PSG), but no RBD on PSG or by history. A 26 year old female with history of depression, anxiety, and migraine headaches presented with excessive daytime sleepiness requiring daytime naps since childhood. She endorsed sleep paralysis but not hypnagogic hallucinations, dream enactment or cataplexy. Sleep disordered breathing or other abnormalities were absent on overnight PSG. RSWA was seen, however, video recording did not reveal dream enactment behavior. The subsequent multiple sleep latency test showed a mean sleep latency of 3 minutes over 5 naps and 2 sleep onset REM periods. REM related motor findings occur at a higher frequency in patients with narcolepsy than in the general population. Hypocretin deficiency is believed to be the major determinant of REM sleep motor dysregulation observed in narcolepsy. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C) are more frequently involved than patients with N-C. RBD associated with narcolepsy differs from idiopathic RBD in that it has equal gender predominance, earlier age at onset, and is associated with less violent and less complex behaviors. Interestingly, RSWA may be absent in RBD with narcolepsy. In addition, RSWA in narcolepsy is frequent even in the absence of RBD. This highlights the need to develop diagnostic criteria for RBD specific to the context of narcolepsy. RSWA is seen in high frequency in narcolepsy and should be strongly considered as a secondary diagnostic criteria.",

Normally, REM sleep is characterized by vivid mentation combined with skeletal muscle paralysis. This REM atonia is diminished or absent in RBD, which enables patients to act out their dreams with violent, injurious nocturnal behaviors. Consistent with an impending neurodegenerative disorder, patients with RBD demonstrate subtle motor, autonomic, and cognitive changes frequently seen in synucleinopathies. These disorders include PD as well as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In PD, RBD is linked with the akinetic–rigid predominant subtype, gait freezing, and predicts aggressive cognitive impairment. Clinical management is focused upon decreasing the potential for sleep-related injuries (SRIs), treating comorbid sleep disorders, and eliminating exacerbating agents. High-dose melatonin, low-dose clonazepam, and combined melatonin–clonazepam appear to be effective therapies.",

When the electroencephalogram changes from a high voltage slow to a low voltage rapid pattern the eyes begin to move in bursts of rapid movement and the dream period begins. The dream periods (stage REM) may be considered as a distinct physiologic state from the rest of the night (non-REM sleep). In patients with paralysis of upward eye movement during waking, during non-REM sleep the eyes moved upward as if no paralysis were present. However, during REM sleep upward eye movement was severely restricted. The results suggest that the functional organization for eye movements during REM sleep is similar to that of waking whereas this organization is dissolved during the remainder of sleep.",

Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia defined by intermittent loss of electromyographic atonia during REM sleep with emergence of complex and vigorous behaviors. Punching, kicking, and leaping from bed during attempted dream enactment caused repeated injury in nine of our first ten adult patients. Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are a group of sleep disorders that are characterized by the presence of undesirable behavioral, experiential, or autonomic nervous system events during sleep initiation, within sleep, or during arousals from any stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During wakefulness and NREM sleep, the hypothalamus plays a central role in thermoregulation. REM sleep has a very distinct thermoregulatory response that is characterized by an inhibition of hypothalamic control over body temperature, with resulting poikilothermia. The role of the thermoregulatory features of REM sleep is currently unknown. Drawing conclusions from other parasomnias one can assume that a disorder could exist in which the thermoregulatory features of REM sleep are impaired. The existence of this condition may have eluded current research because most of the research on thermoregulation has been completed using animal models or healthy volunteers. If this disorder were to exist, it could be associated with metabolic disorders, or with neurodegenerative conditions, and perhaps it could be an early biomarker for alpha-synucleinopathies in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. New and evolving wearable technologies offer the promise of facilitating the monitoring of core body temperature and the testing of this hypothesized thermoregulatory autonomic disorder and its clinical correlates.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

The muscle jerks are not associated with arousals or awakenings. Prevalence is unknown but is believed to be rare. There is no difference between genders. It has a self-limited course, with resolution by 6 months of age in most infants. No specific therapy is necessary. Pathogenesis has been postulated to involve a possible developmental abnormality of the reticular activating system. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) monitoring during polysomnography demonstrate muscle activity with a frequency of four to five jerks per second, occurring in clusters lasting 3 to 15 minutes. It is generally observed during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but can sometimes occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. No seizure activity is present on EEG tracings.",

      "abstract": "Sleep in dementias has been mainly studied in Alzheimer disease (AD). Sleep disturbances are found in 25 to 35% of subjects with AD. Subjective and objective disturbances are described. Long nocturnal awakenings disrupt sleep; total sleep time and sleep efficiency are reduced. Slow wave sleep is decreased and sometimes disappears. REM sleep percentage is also reduced and at a later stage of the disease, REM latency is increased. Sleep fragmentation can be associated with excessive daytime napping and sleepiness, and with other behavioral symptoms such as the sundowning syndrome and nocturnal agitation. Sleep abnormalities closely parallel the level of severity of dementia. The rest/activity ratio and the sleep-wake rhythms are more and more disturbed; the phase delay of the temperature rhythm is associated with the severity of the sundowning syndrome. Sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms are the main reasons to institutionalize the patient. Sleep disturbances are related to multiple factors. Pathophysiological changes resulting of the disease itself, such as damage to the cholinergic pathways and to the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contribute to sleep changes in AD. Associated medical and psychiatric illness and their different treatments as well as environmental factors also induced sleep disturbances. Sleep-disordered breathing is a highly prevalent condition in AD patients and restless leg syndrome may account for nocturnal agitation. In Parkinson and in Lewy body dementias, sleep disturbances are more severe than in DA and REM sleep behavior disorder can precede by several years these diseases. Sleep attacks and sleepiness are very frequent in Parkinson disease. Specific etiologies should drive specific treatment. Several non pharmacologic treatments are usually associated to treat sleep disturbances in AD: information, increased daytime physical, social activities to minimize daytime naps and exposure to bright light. Some studies found advantages to associate melatonin in the evening.",

Parasomnias are generally characterized by abrupt talking, screaming, walking, confusional arousals, bruxism (ie, teeth grinding), or other complex activity arising from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages, rapid eye movement (REM) stages, or transitions between sleep stages and sleep-wake states. Parasomnias are associated with a poor recall of events by the patient, making information from a bed partner valuable. The use of attended polysomnography (PSG) with continuous audio and video recording and the inclusion of extended electro-encephalographic (EEG) montage is required to diagnose REM parasomnias. PSG is not required for the diagnosis of NREM parasomnias, as these are diagnosed by clinical history. Nonpharmacologic interventions that are effective for NREM parasomnias include relaxation, hypnosis, anticipatory awakenings, and ensuring environmental safety to reduce the risk of injury to the patient, bed partners, and family members. Pharmaceuticals shown to have significant effectiveness in NREM parasomnias include melatonin, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and medications that reduce arousals.

      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia symptoms are the most common medical complaints, affecting up to a third of the general population. Insomnia symptoms include sleep problems (initiating or maintaining sleep) as well their repercussions on wake-time functioning. Insomnia Disorder can be diagnosed when insomnia symptoms are recurrent (>3 times a week), persistent (> 3 months), cannot be attributed to sleep-disrupting circumstances, and impair daytime functioning. Insomnia Disorder affects approximately 10% of the population and tends to persist over months or years. Insomnia Disorder severely reduces the quality of life and carries an increased risk of severe, long-lasting health problems, including cardiovascular and mood disorders. Given its high prevalence, persistence and impact on health, it is highly important to study the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder during wakefulness and sleep. Overall, the study of the endogenous EEG dynamics in Insomnia Disorder revealed that hyperarousal of the central nervous system occurs not only during sleep but also during wakefulness. During wakefulness, Insomnia Disorder is characterized by stronger cortical oscillations in a broad beta band and by increased cortical sensitivity to cardiac activity. Furthermore, people with more severe insomnia complaints show stronger Long-Range Temporal Correlations of the amplitude fluctuations of cortical oscillations; which is consistent with a weaker inhibitory bias in the cortical balance between excitation and inhibition. During sleep, the shallow and more fragmented sleep that characterizes Insomnia Disorder may particularly involve N2 instability. Resolving the causal relationship between sleep fragmentation and excitation/inhibition balance is the next key-step in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder.",

      "title": "Combinations of Markers Provide Clues to the Underlying Neurodegenerative Disorder in REM Sleep Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by dream-enacting behaviors and unpleasant dreams, and presents a risk for self-injury and harm to others due to abnormal REM sleep during which control of muscle tonus is lacking (REM sleep without atonia) (Schenck et al., 1986; Schenck et al., 2002; American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2005). RBD is a heterogeneous disease entity consisting of a variety of manifestations (Schenck et al., 2002; Gagnon et al. 2006; Postuma et al., 2006, 2009; Maetzler et al., 2009). Idiopathic RBD (iRBD), which develops in middle age or later and progresses chronically, in particular is a common clinical manifestation of Lewy body-related syndrome and is regarded as a clinical entity from pathological aspects. For example (Table 1), it has been elucidated that iRBD is often accompanied by soft motor signs, olfactory and color identification deficits, decreased cardiovascular and respiratory changes between REM and Non-REM sleep, reduced cardiac 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) uptake, impairment of visual memory and visuo-spatial construction revealed by neuropsychological testing, EEG slowing during wakefulness or sleep, and decreased strial dopaminergic innervation and reduced pre-synaptic strial dopamine transporter binding on SPECT or positron emission topography (PET) scans, which are considered as non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Becker et al., 2002; Gagnon et al., 2006; Miyamoto et al., 2006; Miyamoto et al., 2008). Furthermore, despite the limited number of pathological reports on iRBD, the characteristics of iRBD have been supported to have a close relationship with Lewy body pathology (Boeve et al., 2007). Therefore, additional clinical features that could distinguish iRBD with Lewy body-related alpha-synucleinopathies from iRBD due to other causes would be helpful in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "In the International Classification of Sleep Disorders(ICSD), REM sleep behavior disorder(RBD) and nightmares are classified as 'parasomnias usually associated with REM sleep'. RBD can be defined as the intermittent absence of REM sleep EMG atonia and the appearance of the elaborate motor activity associated with dream mentation. Bilateral pontine tegmental lesions in cats induce RBD-like behavior, but in human cases, more than 60% are idiopathic. Polysomnograpy shows characteristic findings in REM sleep and treatment with clonazepam is highly effective. With nightmares as long, frightening dream decreasing with age, their persistence or apperance in adults is related with certain drugs, trauma, personality and psychotic episode. Psychotherapy, behavior techniques or medication is used for treatment, but all of nightmares do not require treatment.",

      "title": "Consciousness in non‐<scp>REM</scp>‐parasomnia episodes",
      "abstract": "Summary Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of non‐rapid eye movement (non‐REM) sleep. Non‐REM parasomnia behaviours have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream‐like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterise the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental (dis)connection associated with behavioural episodes, 35 adult patients with non‐REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in‐depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviours (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterised by delusional thinking to varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni‐ or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%), and variable, but often pronounced, amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (“awake dreaming”). The surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people), or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness, amnesia and sensory disconnection during non‐REM parasomnia episodes is variable and graded. In their full‐fledged expression, non‐REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep‐related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

Insufficient sleep can have important effects on daytime function by increasing the need to nap, reducing cognitive ability including attention and memory, slowing response time, adversely affecting relationships with friends and family, and contributing to a general sense of being unwell. However, rather than aging per se, circadian rhythm shifts, primary sleep disorders, comorbid medical/psychiatric illnesses, and medication use cause sleep difficulties in older people, which psychosocial factors may also affect. Clinicians should ask elderly patients about satisfaction with sleep. Any sleep complaints warrant careful evaluation of contributing factors and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia manifested by vivid, often frightening dreams associated with simple or complex motor behavior during REM sleep. Patients appear to “act out their dreams,” in which the exhibited behaviors mirror the content of the dreams. Management of RBD involves counseling about safety measures in the sleep environment; in those at risk for injury, clonazepam and/or melatonin is usually effective. In this article, the authors present a detailed review of the clinical and polysomnographic features, differential diagnosis, diagnostic criteria, management strategies, and pathophysiologic mechanisms of RBD. They then review the literature and their institutional experience of RBD associated with neurodegenerative disease, particularly Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The evolving data suggests that RBD may have clinical diagnostic and pathophysiologic significance in isolation and when associated with neurodegenerative disease.

The arousal disorders, common in children, are usually benign and disappear by puberty. Sleep-wake transition disorders such as sleep starts are benign as well, and may occur at any age. The parasomnias comprise different entities such as nightmares, REM-sleep behavior disorder, sleep enuresis, and bruxism. Diagnosis and treatment often require a multidisciplinary approach. Virtually every psychiatric, neurologic, or medical disease, when of sufficient severity, leaves its specific fingerprint on sleep; some disorders, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, or epilepsy, tend to be exacerbated during sleep. Fortunately, most sleep disorders are amenable to therapy, which can include counseling, sleep hygiene, withholding of an offending agent, behavioral therapy, light therapy, or cautious drug therapy.",

Recent insights into the pathophysiology of sleep disorders in PD points to a complex interaction between movement disorders, side-effects of dopamine agents and lesions in sleep-wake regulating systems. Treatment with dopamine agonists provides a twice higher risk of daytime sudden sleep episodes than levodopa, with no difference between ergotic and non ergotic compounds. Insomnia can be improved by a better control of night-time disability, restless legs syndrome and dystonia using subthalamic nucleus stimulation or night-time levodopa. A specific REM sleep disorder contributes to REM sleep behavior disorder and also to hallucinations (suggesting they could be awake dreams) and excessive daytime sleepiness. The management of sleep and alertness problems requires to analyze their potential causes, to monitor night-time and daytime sleep, and to subtly adjust psychotropic and dopaminergic treatment.",

The lack of muscle atonia may lead to motor activation and the appearance of dream-related behaviors. Dream content during RBD is vivid and often has aggressive themes, such as being threatened, chased, or attacked. During an episode, both the patient with RBD and their bed partner are at risk for serious injuries (e.g., bruises, lacerations, and bone fractures). Diagnosis of RBD currently requires the presence of established clinical criteria, but polysomnography is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate it from other sleep disorders, including sleep apnea. Controlled trials are lacking; yet, clonazepam has been effective in treating symptoms in up to 90% of patients with RBD. Other treatment approaches are dopaminergic agonists, antiepileptic agents, α-adrenergic agonists, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and melatonin. RBD is frequently associated with synucleinopathies, such as multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson's disease. In these patients, RBD symptoms may precede motor symptoms by months to years. Abnormalities in central dopaminergic mechanisms have been postulated.",

Three patients developed RBD after acute inflammatory encephalitis, which lasted for 3 months to 1 year. They talked, moved and walked nightly while asleep. During night polysomnography, there were REM sleep without atonia and abnormally increased REM sleep as 37â87% of total sleep.

Dream abnormalities in neurological disorders include a reduction / cessation of dreaming, an increase in dream frequency, changes in dream contents and accompaniments, and the occurrence of dreamlike experiences (hallucinations) mainly during the wake- -sleep/sleep-wake transitions. Dream changes can be associated with several neurological conditions, and the unfolding of biological knowledge about dream experiences can also have significance in clinical practice.

Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

Confusion, agitation, and wandering can occur at night (“sun downing”), further contributing to sleep disruption (Box 10–1). Sleep complaints may be due primarily to the underlying dementia or to related sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements of sleep, or secondary depression. Reversal of the sleep-wake rhythms can be seen with patients complaining of nocturnal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance. Short-term use of hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone, may be tried for insomnia.",

      "abstract": "El trastorno de conducta durante el sueño REM (TCSR) se caracteriza por conductas motoras vigorosas, pesadillas y ausencia de atonía muscular durante el sueño REM. Se debe a la disfunción directa o indirecta de las estructuras del tronco cerebral que regulan el sueño REM, especialmente el núcleo subceruleus. El TCSR puede ser idiopático o asociado a enfermedades neurológicas como la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP), la demencia con cuerpos de Lewy (DCL), la atrofia multisistémica (AMS) y la narcolepsia. Los pacientes con la forma idiopática, especialmente los que tienen alterados el SPECT del transportador de la dopamina, la sonografía de la sustancia negra, los test de olfato y de la visión de colores, tienen un elevado riesgo de desarrollar la E P, DCL y AMS. El TCSR no debe considerarse como un simple trastorno del sueño, sino como una manifestación de una enfermedad neurológica. El clonazepam (0.25-4 mg) y la melatonina (3-12 mg) a la hora de acostarse mejoran los síntomas del TCSR pero no evitan, en la forma idiopática, la conversión a una enfermedad neurodegenerativa. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by dreamenacting behaviors, nightmares and lack of atonia during REM sleep. It is caused by indirect or direct impairment of those structures that regulate REM sleep atonia, particularly the locus subceruleus. RBD may be idiopathic or linked to Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and narcolepsy. Idiopathic RBD patients, especially those with abnormal dopamine transporter uptake imaging, hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra, hyposmia and color vision damage are those with high risk to develop PD, DLB and MSA. RBD may not be considered as a parasomnia but rather as an integral part of a neurodegenerative disease. Clonazepam (0.5-4 mg) and melatonin (3-12 mg) at bed time improve the symptoms of RBD but does not prevent the conversion to a neurodegenerative disease.",

      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "abstract": "Daytime breathing problems caused by neurologic lesions always worsen during sleep, and in certain cases abnormal breathing patterns are only seen during sleep or specific sleep states. The first clinical manifestation of maltase deficiency, myopathy, or myotonic dystrophy is often a sleep-related complaint, such as unexplained waking from sleep (insomnia) or daytime somnolence. Thus, systematic investigation during sleep of disorders impairing the loop involved in breathing is strongly encouraged. Lesions may involve sensory receptors, sensory pathways, brainstem-controlling neurons, upper motor neurons, descending motor pathways, lower motor neurons, motor nerves, neuromuscular junctions, or respiratory muscles. Most of these lesions lead to a decrease in or absence of inspiratory efforts (diaphragmatic apnea or hypopnea) during sleep. These events differ from the classic obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the recently described upper airway resistance syndrome, which usually involve mild or significant anatomic abnormalities of the upper airway and craniofacial region. The treatment of abnormal breathing during sleep has been improved by the development of nasal ventilation methods: continuous positive airway pressure, intermittent positive pressure, and volume ventilation. These therapeutic approaches can prevent tracheostomy and diaphragmatic pacing and are more efficacious than drug treatments. Long-term compliance is generally much better in breathing disorders secondary to neurologic impairments than in cases of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.",

Furthermore, the results of neurophysiological studies in animals suggest that CNS processes generating REM sleep may participate in the control of the classical startle response, which may be akin to the startle behavior commonly described in PTSD patients. Speculating that PTSD may be fundamentally a disorder of REM sleep mechanisms, the authors suggest several strategies for future research.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

However, research has shown that sleep is also required for other vital processes such as memory consolidation and normal physiological functioning. Extensive research has shown that the areas that control our sleeping behaviour are the hypothalamus, brain stem, midbrain, and amygdala. These areas coordinate events during the non-REM and REM phases of sleep-wake cycles. GABA and adenosine, two chemical neurotransmitters, are also involved and play an important role in our sleep cycle. Insomnia has caused a slew of psychological and physiological issues such as fatigue, decreased mental concentration, irritable nature and a higher risk of heart attacks and stroke. It has reduced the patient's quality of life of the patient and have a social impact on them. Primary insomnia is defined as the inability/absence of proper sleep and impaired daily life functioning. Secondary insomnia, on the other hand, is believed to result from pre-existing medical conditions, substance abuse, or as a side effect of certain drug therapy. Insomnia is diagnosed through physical examination and the use of electrical devices to monitor sleep behavior.",

Because these pathologic behaviors are unaccounted for by contemporary models, this review summarizes the complex effects of dopamine (DA) on normal and pathological waking–sleeping. Maintenance of wakefulness is probably promoted by mesocorticolimbic DA circuits, and suppression of nocturnal movement appears to be influenced by indirect pathways linking midbrain DA neurons with pre-motor structures in the mesopontine tegmentum and ventromedial medulla. A diencephalospinal DA system may have an additional important role in mediating state-specific sensorimotor activity that is relevant to periodic limb movements and restless legs syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a brain disorder, characterized by the dream enactment during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep due to a lack of physiologic muscle atonia and increased muscle twitching. Schenk was the first to describe this disorder in 1986; however, few authors reported in the 1970-1980s loss of physiological muscle atonia combined with dream enactment in the course of brainstem disorders and as a consequence of alcoholism and antidepressant treatment. RBD affects less than 1% of the adult population, but can be found in up to 25-50% of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, multisystem atrophy, and dementia with Lewy body. In the last decade, many studies provided evidence that RBD precedes parkinsonian motor signs by several years, suggesting that RBD should no longer be considered a complication but a part of the prodromal phase of these diseases. Etiologically, primary (idiopathic RBD) and several secondary forms in addition to neurodegeneration (related to focal brainstem damage, narcolepsy, autoimmune disorders, and drugs) are known. Pathophysiologically, brainstem and supratentorial mechanisms involving glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABA-ergic neurotransmission have been implicated. Recently, an animal model of RBD has been described. Clinical features consist of characteristic nocturnal behaviors, but also daytime symptoms including excessive sleepiness and cognitive alterations. The diagnosis of RBD is made according to international diagnostic criteria, based on medical history, and video-polysomnographic features. Current treatment strategies include actions which ensure a safe sleep environment, the avoidance of triggering/exacerbating factors and if necessary pharmacological (mainly clonazepam and melatonin) and non-pharmacological (e.g., behavioral measures) interventions. Future research should clarify the exact sleep-wake characteristics of RBD (also beyond REM sleep) and their evolution over time, the contribution of brainstem but also supratentorial mechanisms to its pathophysiology, and the (early?) diagnostic and (causative?) treatment consequences of RBD in the context of neurodegeneration.",

The causes of sleep disturbances are multifactorial and include nocturnal motor disturbances, nocturia, depressive symptoms, and medication use. Comorbidity of PD with sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, or circadian cycle disruption also results in impaired sleep. In addition, the involvement of serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons in the brainstem as a disease-related change contributes to impaired sleep structures. Excessive daytime sleepiness is not only secondary to nocturnal disturbances or dopaminergic medication but may also be due to independent mechanisms related to impairments in ascending arousal system and the orexin system. Notably, several recent lines of evidence suggest a strong link between rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. In the present paper, we review the current literature concerning sleep disorders in PD.",

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be “things that go bump in the night”, or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

Sleep disturbances related to Parkinson's disease itselfImpaired sleep architecture and sleep-wakefulness systems are observed in PD as disease related changes.Insomnia in patients with the early stage of disease or in untreated patients may be associated with disease-related sleep disturbances rather than sleep disturbances caused by other factors including motor dysfunction, medication use, neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive dysfunction, though non-motor symptoms can occur in the early phase of the disease.Polysomnography (PSG) recordings yield altered sleep structure that is characterized by a reduction in The percentage of slow wave sleep and a decrease in the amount of REM sleep (Petit et al., 2004) caused by the degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, noradrenergic neurons in the locus ceruleus and serotoninergic neurons in the raphe nucleus (N.J. Diederich & Comella, 2003).Serotonin, acetylcholine and noradrenalin play a role in maintaining wakefulness, and thus, disturbances lead to excessive daytime sleepiness.In some patients with PD, excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden onset of sleep episodes have been associated with a short sleep latency and sleep onset REM period recorded by the multiple sleep latency test (Arnulf et al., 2002).Similar features are observed in narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by severe daytime sleepiness caused by loss of orexin neurons.Loss of orexinergic neurons in the www.intechopen.comSymptoms of Parkinson's Disease 52 posterior portion of the lateral hypothalamus (Fronczek et al., 2007) and the reduction of the A10 dopaminergic group in the ventral tegmental area (Rye, 2004) have also been implicated in impaired wakefulness in PD.Further study is required to examine whether impairment of the orexin system accounts for excessive daytime sleepiness in PD and whether decreased orexin levels reflect disease-related changes or secondary compensatory changes resulting from dopaminergic dysfunctions (Baumann et al.,",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal sleep disturbances, excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep-related breathing disorders, and sleep-related movement disorders are major non-motor key features of many movement disorders. Most research has focussed on Parkinson’s disease, but there is also a substantial knowledge that has been generated for other movement disorders such as atypical Parkinson syndromes, dystonias, heredoataxias, and choreatic disorders. In addition to providing an understanding of the sleep disturbances associated with these disorders, there is increasing evidence that studies of sleep may provide a unique early window into neurodegenerative disorders. For example, research over the last decade demonstrated that REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) – a complex parasomnia characterized by dream enactment and loss of physiological REM atonia – is often the first non-motor symptom of a neurodegenerative disease. Up to 80 percent of patients initially diagnosed as idiopathic RBD will develop parkinsonism within a twenty-year observational period.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for various cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes, including attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and interpersonal interactions. Sleep disruptions undermine these functions, resulting in measurable impairments in daily activities, occupational performance, and public safety. Adequate sleep supports sustained vigilance and concentration, whereas sleep deprivation is associated with attentional lapses, diminished cognitive control, and impaired sensory processing. Memory consolidation, which depends on both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, is particularly susceptible to disruption by sleep loss. Executive functions, such as working memory, impulse control, and decision-making, are notably impaired due to the prefrontal cortex's heightened sensitivity to insufficient sleep. Sleep deprivation increases amygdala reactivity, weakens prefrontal-amygdala connectivity, and contributes to emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors. Chronic sleep deprivation exacerbates cognitive deficits, emotional instability, and motor performance decline, leading to higher error rates and reduced workplace productivity. Given its widespread consequences, chronic sleep deprivation constitutes a significant public health concern. This narrative review synthesizes contemporary research on the effects of sleep and sleep loss on waking behavior, with a focus on attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and daytime performance.",

      "abstract": "Occlusal overload during sleep is a significant clinical issue that has negative impacts on the maintenance of teeth and the longevity of dental prostheses. Sleep is usually viewed as an 'out-of-functional' mode for masticatory muscles. However, orodental structures and prostheses are not free from occlusal loads during sleep since masticatory muscles can be activated at a low level within normal sleep continuity. Thus, an increase in masticatory muscle contractions, by whatever the cause, can be associated with a risk of increased occlusal loads during sleep. Among such conditions, sleep bruxism (SB) is a type of sleep-related movement disorders with potential load challenge to the tooth and orofacial structures. Patients with SB usually report frequent tooth grinding noises during sleep and there is a consecutive increase in number and strength of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA). Other types of masticatory muscle contractions can be non-specifically activated during sleep, such as brief contractions with tooth tapping, sleep talking, non-rhythmic contractions related to non-specific body movements, etc.; these occur more frequently in sleep disorders. Studies have shown that clinical signs and symptoms of SB can be found in patients with sleep disorders. In addition, sleep becomes compromised with aging process, and a prevalence of most sleep disorders is high in the elderly populations, in which prosthodontic rehabilitations are more required. Therefore, the recognition and understanding of the role of sleep disorders can provide a comprehensive vision for prosthodontic rehabilitations when prosthodontists manage complex orodental cases needing interdisciplinary collaborations between dentistry and sleep medicine.",

      "title": "Reconsidering sleep perception in insomnia: from misperception to mismeasurement",
      "abstract": "Summary So‐called ‘sleep misperception’ refers to a phenomenon in which individuals have the impression of sleeping little or not at all despite normal objective measures of sleep. It is unknown whether this subjective–objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture ‘wake‐like’ brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro‐ and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non‐rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought‐like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake. We discuss the significance of these correlates and conclude with open questions and possible ways to address them.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sleep disturbances, including nightmares and insomnia, are prominent following trauma and with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and likely contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder. Findings from laboratory studies of PTSD have been inconsistent in terms of documenting objective impaired sleep maintenance but have been somewhat more consistent in indicating alterations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Studies of the early aftermath of trauma can reduce the complexity associated with chronicity and comorbidity, and may have implications for early diagnosis and prevention. Multiple studies indicate that dream content is affected by recent threatening experiences. The development of PTSD is associated with a more replicative type of nightmare content. Sleep is reported to be generally disrupted following trauma especially among those developing PTSD. The limited number of studies that provide objective recorded indices during the early aftermath of trauma also provide a mixed picture regarding overall sleep maintenance. Recent data suggest that a more specific disruption of REM sleep may be associated with the development of PTSD and that this disruption is associated with an increased signal of sympathetic nervous system activation during REM sleep. Disrupted REM sleep and increased sympathetic/noradrenergic activity may have implications for understanding recent promising interventions for PTSD sleep disturbance that can be applied to early intervention.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD) are both widespread and wide-ranging. Emerging early in the disease process, sometimes prior to the onset of motor symptoms, sleep disruption results from the degeneration of the basal ganglia that is the hallmark of the disease, as well as changes in brain stem sleep centres. Accordingly, sleep problems consist of motor symptoms such as stiffness, difficulty turning and dystonia as well as disruption to the normal sleep–wake cycle, arousal and alertness. Sleep disruption has been associated with reduced quality of life (QOL) and increased depression and anxiety in PD patients and their caregivers alike, and may be severe enough to impair everyday functioning. It is also likely that presence of certain sleep symptoms such as REM behaviour disorder (RBD) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are the harbingers of a poor prognosis. Although no studies have yet investigated the effect of sleep problems on institutionalization in PD, chronic disruption to the sleep of caregivers may well lead to a breakdown in the caregiving relationship and care arrangements. The following article reviews the prevalence, phenomenology, pathophysiology and impact of sleep disturbances on QOL for individuals with PD and their caregivers. Clinical management strategies are discussed.",

      "abstract": "During healthy rapid eye movement sleep, skeletal muscles are actively forced into a state of motor paralysis. However, in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder-a relatively common neurological disorder-this natural process is lost. A lack of motor paralysis (atonia) in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder allows individuals to actively move, which at times can be excessive and violent. At first glance this may sound harmless, but it is not because rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients frequently injure themselves or the person they sleep with. It is hypothesized that the degeneration or dysfunction of the brain stem circuits that control rapid eye movement sleep paralysis is an underlying cause of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. The link between brain stem degeneration and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder stems from the fact that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder precedes, in the majority (∼80%) of cases, the development of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, which are known to initially cause degeneration in the caudal brain stem structures where rapid eye movement sleep circuits are located. Furthermore, basic science and clinical evidence demonstrate that lesions within the rapid eye movement sleep circuits can induce rapid eye movement sleep-specific motor deficits that are virtually identical to those observed in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. This review examines the evidence that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is caused by synucleinopathic neurodegeneration of the core brain stem circuits that control healthy rapid eye movement sleep and concludes that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is not a separate clinical entity from synucleinopathies but, rather, it is the earliest symptom of these disorders. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

The SCN aligns whole-body cellular, behavioral and phenomenological processes with the Earth’s 24-hour day/night rhythm. When disruptions to the SCN’s perceptual system occur (e.g., “jet-lag,” prolonged waking, chronic exposure to light at night or habit change as the result of becoming a parent), disrupted melatonin and glucocorticoid secretion can lead to widespread dysregulation of sleep and circadian cycling. The effects of circadian disruptions are often compounded by the homeostatic sleep drive, wherein sleep pressure accumulates with protracted wakefulness to affect mood, cognition, health and well-being.",

      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children's sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child's period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

It should be distinguished from movements during REM sleep, mainly REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). A 25-year-old male complained of daytime sleepiness with snoring and dream enactment behavior (DEB). Video polysomnography (PSG) excluded RBD and obstructive sleep apnea; frequent SRHJs during REM sleep with or without respiratory effort-related arousals, and SRHJs followed by one episode of DEB was observed. On PSG with continuous positive airway pressure titration, SRHJ with arousal events still remained but DEB symptom was resolved. REM without atonia unrelated to head jerks was not observed on all PSG data. Excessive SRHJs with arousal related to a sleep disturbance could indicate an SRHJ disorder, which might be a novel sleep-related movement disorder. In addition, clinicians should be careful in diagnosing young patients with RBD.",

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia defined by intermittent loss of electromyographic atonia during REM sleep with emergence of complex and vigorous behaviors. Punching, kicking, and leaping from bed during attempted dream enactment caused repeated injury in nine of our first ten adult patients. Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient. (<i>JAMA</i>1987;257:1786-1789)",

Several other sleep-related abnormalities have recently been identified in patients with RBD/Parkinson's disease who experience abnormalities in sleep electroencephalographic frequencies, sleep-wake transitions, wake and sleep stability, occurrence and morphology of sleep spindles, and electrooculography measures. These findings suggest a gradual involvement of the brainstem and other structures, which is in line with the gradual involvement known in these disorders. We propose that these findings may help identify biomarkers of individuals at high risk of subsequent conversion to parkinsonism.",

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "The correlations between sleep and prolonged epileptic activity are discussed on the basis of the status classification of Gastaut (1983). Little information is available on the interrelation of sleep and the status of tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal status). Most important is the therapeutical management of these cases. Tonic seizures have been reported to occur in large numbers during NREM sleep in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A status-like increase is possible. Tonic seizures occur almost exclusively during sleep. Myoclonic status epilepticus arising (a) in the course of primary generalized epilepsy and (b) in the course of encephalopathies, are usually markedly attenuated during sleep. In absence status (petit mal status) synchronized sleep generally fragments the continuous discharge which is replaced by isolated bursts of polyspikes, or polyspike and wave complexes. The absence status can recur upon awaking during the night or in the morning. The abnormal EEG activity of a petit mal status can, however, occasionally persist during the whole night. Improvement as well as activation during sleep have been observed in elementary (= simple) partial status epilepticus; improvement seems to be more frequent. Epilepsia partialis continua may persist or decrease during sleep. An increase as well as decrease of motor phenomena has been observed during the REM stages. 'Epileptic aphasia' of childhood is associated with subclinical bioelectric status epilepticus during sleep. The electrical status epilepticus must be delineated as a separate group. The term encephalopathy related to electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep (ESES) has been proposed on the basis of associated psychic syndromes. This form of status epilepticus disappears during the waking state and during REM sleep. Cases with hypsarrhythmia without clinical signs may also be classified under the group of electrical or bioelectrical status. In some cases, a continuous hypsarrhythmia is observed only during sleep. In this context, one must also mention those patients who demonstrate continuous activation of spikes, or spike and wave potentials (without clinical seizures) during eye closure.",

Despite much investigation worldwide, it remains unknown whether these disorders are caused by dopaminergic (DArgic), non-DArgic neural lesions, nocturnal motor disability or deleterious effect of anti-PD drugs. Using multiple experimental approaches (EEG and sleep-wake recordings/pharmacological dosing / immunohistochemistry) in cats treated with MPTP, which causes DArgic neuronal loss, we have studied the possible correlation between the induced effects on the sleep-wake (S/W) cycle and those on DArgic neurons. MPTP (5mg/kg/day x 5, i.p.) caused, during the acute period, a slow wave sleep hypersomnia (SWS, up to 80% of recorded time) and a suppression of paradoxical sleep (PS), accompanied with pronounced behavioural somnolence, marked decrease in locomotion and difficulty to initiate movements. DArgic agonists L-dopa and ropinirole transiently prevented hypersomnia in SWS. During the chronic period, whereas the amount of W and SWS returned to control, PS transiently increased, associated with narcolepsy-like episodes. Ex-vivo analyses revealed marked decrease in TH labelling (cell bodies in the substantia nigra and terminal-like dots in the striatum) whereas cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and mesopontine-tegmentum seemed unchanged. Thus, MPTP treated cats showed major signs of motor and S/W disorders similar to those seen in PD patients and so could serve as useful animal model. Our results also suggest a possible correlation/causality between the MPTP-induced S/W disorders and DArgic cell loss.",

      "abstract": "Sleep quality is one of the major sources of dissatisfaction among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Insomnia, parasomnia and daytime sleep disorders are all common. The motor problems accompanying PD are well studied and documented, yet little is known about sleep and the other non-motor problems. Dopaminergic medications, the neurochemical and neurodegenerative changes may all contribute to the pathogenesis of sleep disorders in PD. Subjective or objective sleepiness assessment should routinely be performed by physicians looking after PD patients. Patients should be informed of the risks associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Management is difficult and should be targeted to the specific sleep disorder and its likely cause. Simple sleep measures such as sleep hygiene should be tried first before pharmacological treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "La douleur est une cause majeure de l'insomnie chez les malades et plus de 70% des patients en douleur se plaignent de troubles du sommeil. Des études polysomnographiques ont démontré que les patients éprouvant de la douleur chronique affichent une perturbation marquée de la structure et de la continuité du sommeil. Les constatations les plus courantes sont: changements fréquents de phases de sommeil, augmentation des réveils nocturnes, diminution du sommeil à ondes lentes et du sommeil à mouvements oculaires rapides, augmentation du sommeil superficiel et des mouvements du corps, intrusion électroencéphalographique (EEG) de sommeil alpha-delta, augmentation du nombre d'éveils et du taux de pattern d'activation cyclique (PAC). Le PAC est un marqueur physiologique du sommeil instable qui amplifie les réactions aux événements perturbateurs de la consolidation du sommeil. Ainsi, la qualité du sommeil dépend de mécanismes cérébraux qui évaluent les événements externes afin de protéger l'intégrité vitale. Ces mécanismes, situés au niveau thalamique, commande le maintien du sommeil, l'éveil bref ou le réveil comportemental, selon le risque que représente l'événement en cause. Pendant le sommeil, le système neurovégétatif demeure réceptif aux stimuli externes et opère en synchronie avec le processus PAC. Chez les sujets sains, la stimulation thermique nociceptive provoque une accélération du rythme cardiaque peu importe la phase du sommeil, avec un gradient décroissant de la phase 2 au sommeil à ondes lentes et au sommeil MOR. Les réponses autonomiques peuvent varier chez les patients fibromyalgiques n'affichant pas la diminution normale de l'activité sympathique pendant le sommeil et chez les patients éprouvant de la douleur chronique qui sont déjà aux prises avec la fragmentation du sommeil ou l'insomnie. Les modifications spécifiques du sommeil découlant d'un syndrome unique de douleur ou de parasomnies associées à la douleur pendant le sommeil (par ex. le bruxisme, les crampes nocturnes dans les jambes et le reflux gastro-œsophagien) sont également décrites.",

Disorders of wakefulness and delirium (acute confusional state), often in combination, are the most common disorders of consciousness in patients with acute stroke. In prospective studies, decreased levels of wakefulness – ranging from somnolence (hypersomnia) to coma – can be observed in 15–25% of patients (Bassetti, 2000; Bogousslavsky et al., 1988b; Melo et al., 1992), and acute confusional states are seen in up to 48% of patients (Gustafson et al., 1991).

      "abstract": "The unusual aspect of dream consciousness which has been called \"dream bizarreness\" may be defined as impossibility or improbability in the domains of dream plot, cognition and affect. The bizarre features of dreams may be divided into three broad categories: discontinuities, incongruities and uncertainties. Discontinuities are interruptions in orientational stability; incongruities are inappropriate syntheses of mismatching plot elements; uncertainties are confusions of distinct conceptions. Dream bizarreness appears to be the manifestation of some state-dependent cognitive process which is probably rooted in REM sleep neurophysiology. In the waking state, our brain/minds are capable of remaining focused on the normal flow of ongoing information, and such features of life as plot and time unfold in a linear sequence. In REM sleep/dreaming, this function appears to be interfered with, and disparate elements of consciousness are suddenly interjected as the brain/mind cannot maintain its orientational focus in the usual way.",

      "title": "Alterations of the circadian timing system in rodent and non human primate models of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Since the first description by James Parkinson in his essay on the shaking palsy, Parkinson’s disease (PD) was recognized as a motor disease identified by a tetrad of symptoms, namely; akinesia, muscular rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability. These symptoms are known to be related to loss of dopamine (DA) in the striatum following neural degeneration in the substantia nigra (SN). It is increasingly recognized that non-motor and perhaps non-dopaminergic related symptoms inevitably emerge and worsen during disease progression. Sleep disruption is one of the major non-motor symptoms and has been suggested as a preclinical marker of the disease. Models of sleep regulation have emphasized two distinct processes: a sleep-control mechanism, or sleep homeostat, and a circadian oscillator. The circadian oscillator, based in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is responsible for the tendency to sleep during certain phases of the 24-hour cycle and the consolidation of sleep and wake into distinct episodes. The sleep homeostat is responsible for monitoring and reacting to the need for sleep, causing the urge to sleep to depend on prior amounts of sleep or wakefulness. While disruptions in the circuitry and the homeostatic processes involved in the regulation of sleep-wake behaviour is will documented in PD, the potential involvement of alterations of the circadian system have not been studied in detail. The aim of my thesis is to investigate alterations in the circadian timing system using two animal models of PD: the mouse and the non-human primate. Taken together, the studies show that disturbances of circadian functions occur after MPTP treatment in the non-human primate but not in the mouse model of PD. These results emphasize the limitations of the MPTP-treated mouse model of PD for the study of non-motor symptoms, and reinforce previous studies that question the adequacy of this model to replicate cardinal motor features of the disease. In contrast, results in the non-human primate model stress the importance of dopaminergic degeneration in the circadian organisation of behavioral sleep wake cycle in PD",

When amputated patients dream, however, the phantom limb may be present all the time, part of the time, intermittently or not at all. Such dreaming experiences in amputees have usually been obtained only retrospectively in the morning and, moreover, dreaming is normally associated with muscular atonia so the motor counterpart of the phantom limb experience cannot be observed directly. REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), in which muscle atonia is absent during REM sleep and patients act out their dreams, allows a more direct analysis of the \"phantom limb\" phenomena and their modifications during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Various research studies show that the amalgam of disordered sleep physiology, chronic fatigue, diffuse myalgia, and cognitive and behavioural symptoms constitutes a non-restorative sleep syndrome that may follow a febrile illness, as in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Where rheumatic complaints are prominent such a constellation of disturbed sleep physiology and symptoms also characterizes the fibromyalgia disorder. In contrast to the chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia is associated with a variety of initiating or perpetuating factors such as psychologically distressing events, primary sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder) and inflammatory rheumatic disease, as well as an acute febrile illness. The chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia have similar disordered sleep physiology, namely an alpha rhythm disturbance (7.5–11 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that accompanies increased nocturnal vigilance and light, unrefreshing sleep. Aspects of cytokine and cellular immune functions are shown to be related to the sleep-wake system. The evidence suggests a reciprocal relationship of the immune and sleep-wake systems. Interference either with the immune system (e.g. by a viral agent or by cytokines such as α-interferon or interleukin 2) or with the sleeping-waking brain system (e.g. by sleep deprivation) has effects on the other system and will be accompanied by the symptoms of the chronic fatigue syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias have significant quality-of-life, prognostic and potentially forensic implications for patients and their bed-partners. Identifying key clinical features will accelerate diagnosis and appropriate management for these patients. Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that arise out of, or during, sleep. They can include movements, behaviours, emotions, perceptions, dreams or autonomic nervous system activity. While more common during childhood, they can persist into, or present de novo, during adulthood. Parasomnias can arise out of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as in confusional arousals, sleepwalking, sleep terrors or sleep-related eating disorder, or out of REM sleep, as in REM behaviour disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis or nightmare disorder. Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy is an important differential diagnosis to consider in patients presenting with a parasomnia. A thorough clinical history, including a collateral history if available, is crucial to identify characteristic clinical features. Video polysomnography is useful to identify macro- and micro-sleep architectural features, characteristic behavioural events, and any concomitant sleep pathologies. Treatment of parasomnias involves a combined approach of pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention, including safety measures, sleep hygiene and medicines such as clonazepam or melatonin to improve sleep consolidation and reduce behavioural activity. As parasomnias can not only be disruptive for the patient and their bed-partner but have important prognostic or forensic consequences, an understanding of their pathophysiology, clinical features and management is valuable for any respiratory physician who may encounter them.To understand the common features of NREM and REM parasomnias.To differentiate between the causes of motor behaviours during sleep.To discuss the treatment approach for NREM and REM parasomnias.",

      "abstract": "We reviewed sleep and dream-related clinical symptoms in a set of four neurologic disorders (Parkinson’s Disease, REM Behavior Disorder, Narcolepsy and Depression) characterized by severe reductions in dopaminergic function. Sleep findings included excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), increased rapid eye movement sleep times (REM%), increased REM density or bursts of REMs, reduced REM latency periods, and sleep onset REM (SOREM). Clinical symptoms included perseverative or rigid thinking and personality styles, frontal lobe impairment, increased complaints of, or vulnerability to negative affect, and increased vivid and unpleasant dreams. The increased vulnerability to unpleasant dreams was particularly interesting as descriptions of dream content were strikingly similar across all 4 disorders. Dreams of feeling threatened or being attacked by animals or dangerous creatures were very frequent. We hypothesize that the cluster of sleep, dream and cognitive changes associated with these four disorders can be explained by assuming that lowered dopaminergic tone leads to a disinhibition of REM physiology and amygdalar activity and that this disinhibition of REM and amygdalar function yields unpleasant dreams, negative affect, and frontal lobe impairment. Careful study of the cluster of co-occurring symptoms identified here may illuminate 1) the ways in which dopamine might function in regulation of sleep states, and 2) aspects of the neurology of dream content.

      "title": "The Effects of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders on Waking Performance",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "Snoring usually is trivial and unimportant, but it can turn into a social or medical problem. Obesity, hypertension and heart disease are more frequent among snorers than among nonsnorers, and especially snorers with hypersomnia during the day are at risk. Hypersomnia in association with snoring usually signifies obstructive sleep apnea. Increased resistance in the upper airways, together with negative inspiratory pharyngeal pressure and muscular hypotonia during deep non-REM and REM sleep, lead to collapse of the pharynx, hypoxia and hypercapnia. Only after arousal from sleep does muscle tone return, pharyngeal obstruction reopen and airflow resume. Since this process can occur 300 or 400 times a night, repetitive alveolar hypoventilation leads to pulmonary-arterial hypertension and cor pulmonale, and the repetitive sympathetic activations can cause systemic hypertension or serious cardiac arrhythmias. The countless arousals deprive the sufferer of deep non-REM and REM sleep and their consequence is sleep fragmentation. The symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, intellectual deterioration and personality and behavioral changes. Oronasomaxillofacial, endocrine and neuromuscular anomalies and diseases predispose to sleep apnea, and alcohol or CNS-depressant drugs can favour its occurrence. Diagnosis is made by nighttime oxymetry, and if this is abnormal, by polysomnography. After polysomnography it is possible to distinguish between obstructive and nonobstructive sleep apnea, and the decisions for an adequate treatment can be made.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbance affects 50% to 80% of all patients with psychiatric disorders. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep have been of significant interest to neurologists, psychiatrists and psychologists; SWS because of its putative role in brain repair, detoxification, homeostatic maintenance and in cognitive function, and REM sleep because of its suggested involvement in memory, neurodevelopment and emotional regulation. To date, little is known about the consequences of disrupted sleep and sleep deprivation in psychiatric disorders. Moreover, in clinical practice, sleep disturbance is still often regarded as an epiphenomenon of the primary psychiatric disorder. Sleep disorders increase the risk of developing episodes of psychiatric disorders. Also, insomnia, defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep resulting in daytime consequences, is common among psychiatric disorders. Several other potential comorbid sleep disorders, including OSA, restless leg syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and REM behaviour disorder (RBD) are known to modulate psychiatric symptom expression. It is increasingly recognised that sleep and psychiatric disorders may share a bidirectional relationship. Therefore, concurrent and aggressive management of sleep should be a pivotal part of the clinical management in all psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "1226 Shift Workers Acting Out? A Case of Shift Work Sleep Disorder Causing REM Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) is the manifestation of dream enactment with the failure of muscle atonia during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Shift work sleep disorder presents as sleep disruption and/or excessive sleepiness due to an atypical work schedule. Here we show a unique case of RBD provoked by a longstanding history of shift work sleep disorder. Report of case(s) 67-year-old male with shift work sleep disorder, hypertension, and depression who presented for evaluation of RBD. Patient recently retired as a night shift worker and was taking melatonin and citalopram for more than 20 years. For the past several months, the patient has been having episodes of acting out his dreams, such as punching his wife if he was dreaming about punching someone in his sleep. Patient’s polysomnography showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA) in the chin and limb leads with 30% of the 30-s epochs having chin EMG activity with bilateral flexor digitorum superficialis (FDA) phasic EMG activity. Patient’s melatonin dose was increased and he was also started on benzodiazepine with control of his symptoms. Conclusion The common risk factors of RBD include Parkinson’s Disease, occupational toxin exposure, antidepressants, psychological stress (PTSD), or compromised health conditions (such as smoking or cardiovascular diseases). The patient has a chronic use of citalopram but antidepressant-induced RBD usually presents in the fourth/fifth decade of life. A review of literature indicates no cases of shift work disorder causing RBD. However, disruptions in the circadian rhythm put shift workers at an increased risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and psychological disorders, all exposures for RBD. Patient developed shift work sleep disorder causing sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia with a disturbance in the circadian rhythm, ultimately leading to an increased risk for developing RBD. Treatment for RBD includes melatonin as the first-line treatment with addition of low-dose clonazepam or cholinergic agents. With the increasing prevalence of shift work, it is imperative to understand the risks of shift work and identify sleep disorders that may arise, such as RBD, through more research.

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

PLMS may be an incidental finding or cause sleep disruption with associated impairment in daytime functioning, which is the hallmark of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). PLMS may be associated with several medical conditions and provoked or exacerbated by various medications. Treatments for PLMS include dopamine agonists, benzodiazepines, and, in refractory cases, opioids. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia associated with dream enactment behaviors and a loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep. RBD has been increasingly associated with development of a neurodegenerative disorder such as Parkinson disease. Dream enactment of RBD may lead to significant injury.

Sleep-onset and maintenance insomnia is a characteristic feature of schizophrenic patients regardless of either their medication status (drug-naive or previously treated) or the phase of the clinical course (acute or chronic). Regarding sleep architecture, the majority of studies indicate that stage 4 sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) latency are reduced in schizophrenia, whereas REM sleep duration tends to remain unchanged. Insomnia in schizophrenic patients could be partly related to the presumed over-activity of the dopaminergic system. However, there is a possibility that the GABAergic system is also involved in sleep disturbance in schizophrenia. Since many signal transmission systems within the CNS can be implicated in the reduction of REM latency in schizophrenia, the characterization of the neurotransmitter systems involved remains a challenging dilemma.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "title": "Sleep, Depression and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle?",
      "abstract": "Sleep, depression and insomnia have manifold associations. Psychiatric sleep research in affective disorders has demonstrated that sleep in depression is characterized by an impairment of sleep continuity, deficits in slow wave sleep and a disinhibition of REM sleep (including shortened REM latency and increased REM density). Traditionally, insomnia, i.e. prolonged latency to fall asleep and increased frequency of nocturnal wake periods, was considered as an unspecific symptom of affective disorders. In the meantime, a shift in clinical and scientific focus has taken place viewing insomnia in addition as an independent diagnostic entity and as a clinical predictor of depression. Unfortunately, the neurobiological processes underlying the relationships between sleep, insomnia and depression have not been fully identified yet. It is clear that both insomnia and depression are characterized by alterations in the arousal system in the CNS presenting as hyperarousal. Moreover, insomniac patients display reduced and fragmented REM sleep periods, which might interfere negatively with basal processes of emotion regulation. The alterations in the arousal system and the interaction of it with the affect-regulatory system over the course of time might influence cognitive systems and hence lead to the clinical picture of depression. Given the suggestion of insomnia symptoms as possibly involved in the causation and the maintenance of psychopathology in general, this type of sequence might also be found in relation to other mental disorders. Keywords: Depression, Emotion regulation, Hyperarousal, Insomnia, REM sleep instability, Sleep Transdiagnostic hypothesis.",

Pathologically PD is characterized by neuronal inclusions of abnormally aggregated α-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies and neurites [2]. These target the nigro-striatal and meso-frontal dopaminergic projections impairing limb movement and executive functions, respectively. They also cause cholinergic neuronal loss from the nucleus basalis leading to attentional and memory deficits, serotonergic neuronal loss from the median raphe nuclei leading to affective and sleep disorders, and noradrenergic neuronal loss from the locus ceruleus resulting in REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), depression, and anxiety.",

Sie sind verbunden mit Verhaltensauffälligkeiten, die aus dem Tiefschlaf heraus auftreten. Das Verhalten variiert dabei zwischen einem kurzen plötzlichen Aufrichten bis hin zu komplexen Handlungen, z. B. Kochen, Autofahren. In EEG-Untersuchungen und bildgebenden Studien konnte gezeigt werden, dass es während solcher Episoden zu einer Dissoziation von Wach und Schlaf kommt. Meist treten NREM-Parasomnien in der Kindheit und frühen Jugend auf und verschwinden mit dem Erwachsenwerden. In bis zu 2 % bis 4 % spielen sie aber auch bei Erwachsenen eine Rolle und haben nicht selten relevante psychosoziale Konsequenzen für die Betroffenen. Für die Diagnostik ist in solchen Fällen auch zum Ausschluss von Differenzialdiagnosen eine Polysomnografie obligat, auch wenn diese durch die Diagnosekriterien bisher nicht gefordert wird. Meist ist eine Behandlung der NREM-Parasomnie nicht erforderlich, diese sollte jedoch eingesetzt werden, wenn psychosoziale Konsequenzen durch die nächtlichen Ereignisse bestehen. Da randomisierte Studien bisher fehlen, beruhen die Behandlungsempfehlungen auf Expertenmeinungen und Untersuchungen von Fallserien.",

      "title": "[Clinical practice guideline. Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014). While they may be dismissed as \"bad dreams,\" nightmares may be indicative of another disorder occurring in sleep. Nightmares are part of a category of sleep disorders referred to as parasomnias—\"undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousal from sleep\" (American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International classification of sleep disorders, 3rd ed. Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014). Parasomnias are categorized by the stage of sleep in which they occur: NREM sleep—typically observed in the first half of the night, versus REM sleep—associated with the latter half of the sleep period. NREM parasomnias are also referred to as \"disorders of arousal\" and include sleep terrors, sleepwalking, and confusional arousals. REM sleep parasomnias include REM behavior disorder (RBD) and nightmares (dreams with negative content that may cause awakening). It is important to identify what kind of parasomnia the \"nightmare\" represents, as there may be serious consequences such as injury to ones' self or others that can occur. Additionally, as in the case of RBD, it may be a potential sign of another neurodegenerative process, such as parkinsonism. Polysomnogram is often utilized in the evaluation of parasomnias and can also be helpful to exclude other disorders, which may mimic these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Il sonno copre circa un terzo del tempo totale della vita di ognuno. In questi ultimi anni e notevolmente aumentato l’interesse, sia a livello clinico che di ricerca, riguardo al sonno e alle patologie e ai disturbi ad esso correlati. In particolare, numerose ricerche dimostrano che la qualita del sonno ha un fortissimo impatto sulla qualita della vita e un sonno “disturbato” costituisce un fattore di rischio per numerose patologie. Quindi l’interesse e rivolto non solo a monitorare l’insorgere di patologie del sonno (quali apnee notturne, insonnia, ecc, ) ma anche insufficienza cardiaca, e patologie psichiatriche, quali i disturbi bipolari, sui quali la qualita’ del sonno ha un forte impatto e conseguenze a livello clinico. Il sonno inoltre e una condizione che consente il monitoraggio in modo continuativo in condizioni con elevato grado di ripetibilita, in quanto numerosi fattori esterni e non controllabili presenti durante il giorno, non sono presenti durante il periodo di sonno. Tutto questo giustifica la nascita di numerosi sensori e dispositivi per il monitoraggio domiciliare del sonno, in alternativa alla polisonnografia utilizzata invece a livello clinico e all’interno di specifici reparti ospedalieri. In questo lavoro di tesi vengono presi in considerazione due tipologie di sensori: una maglietta sensorizzata che permette di acquisire ECG, respiro e movimenti mediante un accelerometro triassiale, ed un materasso sensorizzato che registra il ballistocardiogramma (BCG) da cui si ottengono: serie RR (cioe le durate dei singoli cicli cardiaci, i movimenti respiratorio e i movimenti corporei. Lo scopo dello studio e creare un sistema che, a partire dai segnali registrati, possa fornire informazioni sulla qualita del sonno e riesca ad identificare ed a quantificare la presenza di alcuni eventi che possono verificarsi durante il periodo di sonno e sono correlabili alla presenza di patologie. La parte principale dello studio e rivolta alla validazione dei dispositivi utilizzati e allo sviluppo di metodologie specifiche di analisi e classificazione dei segnali, al fine di consentire una valutazione automatica delle registrazioni. In particolare, sono stati sviluppati metodi per la classificazione degli stadi del sonno, l’identificazione di eventi cardiovascolari e respiratori, la classificazione degli stati emotivi (con particolare riferimento al disordine bipolare). I metodi sviluppati sono stati validati su casistiche di soggetti di controllo e su soggetti patologici e hanno dimostrato l’efficacia delle metodiche implementate. Nuovi parametri verranno introdotti e testati e le procedure verranno rese completamente automatiche al fine di facilitare l’utilizza domiciliare da parte di utilizzatori che non abbiamo una specifica preparazione.",

Insomnia can be transient, short-term, or chronic in its presentation. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related personal discomfort. Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation. Agrypnia excitata (AE) is the term which aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome, whose pathogenetic mechanism consists in an intralimbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from corticolimbic control.",

      "title": "A CASE OF SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITOR‐INDUCED RAPID EYE MOVEMENT BEHAVIOR DISORDER",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is often seen in older patients and is characterized by a loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep.1,2 As a result, the disease manifests as nocturnal motor activity consistent with the enactment of dream content, for example grabbing the bed partner in response to a dream about falling from a cliff. RBD often results in injury to the patient, bed partner, or both.1,2 In perhaps up to two-thirds of cases, RBD is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, most notably the alpha-synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease, multiple systems atrophy), often antedating other manifestations of these disorders by many years.1–4 Other cases seem to be idiopathic, although it has been suggested that various medications, notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and other antidepressants, may commonly induce RBD.1,4,5 In spite of this assertion, there have been few supporting case reports.5,6 The authors recently cared for a man who clearly developed RBD as a result of SSRI treatment; the use of the SSRI for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) complicated the clinical picture. An 87-year-old male World War II veteran had been treated for PTSD with associated nightmares but no nocturnal motor activity with bupropion and lorazepam. Past medical history was significant only for essential hypertension. In 1998, after many years of treatment, sertraline was added because of increasing symptoms. Within 6 months of adding sertraline, the patient developed frequent nocturnal motor behavior consistent with the content of his dreams and nightmares, for example punching and choking his wife in the context of a dream about being in a fight. As a result, he and his wife had suffered lacerations and contusions. Other behaviors included running out of his bedroom or running into a window. Upon awakening, he was able to recall portions of the dreams but was unaware of the motor behaviors. Trials of temazepam, zolpidem, and trazodone were ineffective in improving these behaviors. Ultimately, a diagnosis of RBD was made based on the clinical presentation. Clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime was added, which resulted in a moderate decrease in the frequency of the nocturnal motor activity, from nightly to two or three times per week. After 3 months, sertraline was slowly tapered and discontinued, which resulted in a complete cessation of all nocturnal motor behavior. He remained free of nocturnal motor activity for 5 months, until sertraline was inadvertently restarted after the loss of his wife. Within 1 month of restarting sertraline, the nocturnal motor behavior returned. There has thus far been no evidence of dementia or of parkinsonism. This patient's clinical presentation was typical of RBD; unfortunately, his and his wife's injuries were also typical. It seems clear that his RBD was SSRI induced; it developed after sertraline was started, did not definitively improve until it was stopped, and recurred after it was inadvertently restarted, and there was no evidence of parkinsonism or dementia over the previous 12 years. Although there are few published cases of SSRI-induced overt RBD, increased electromyography activity during REM sleep has been demonstrated in patients taking SSRIs. (None of the patients were being treated for PTSD.)7 The relationship between RBD and PTSD is complex and not fully investigated. There is clinical and polysomnographic evidence of greater motor activity during REM sleep in patients with PTSD,8 and greater prevalence of RBD was noted in a cohort of patients with PTSD.9 SSRIs are effective for PTSD-related nightmares10 but may cause RBD, clonazepam is effective for RBD1,2,4 but not for PTSD-related nightmares,10 and RBD is not associated with the typical diurnal symptoms of PTSD. In spite of his long history of PTSD and related nightmares, this patient had never exhibited any significant motor activity during sleep until the SSRI was started. RBD is relatively common in geriatric practice and should be explored in any patient with nocturnal injuries or motor activity. RBD responds well to treatment, generally with clonazepam. Discontinuation of SSRIs or changing to a different class of antidepressant (if feasible) may also be a viable option for some patients.

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking — also known as somnambulism — involves getting up and walking around while in a state of sleep. More common in children than adults, sleepwalking is usually outgrown by the teen years. Isolated incidents of sleepwalking often don't signal any serious problems or require treatment. However, recurrent sleepwalking may suggest an underlying sleep disorder. Sleepwalking in adults features a higher probability of being incoherent with or coexistent with different sleep disorders similarly as medical conditions. If anyone in your social unit sleepwalks, it is vital to shield him or her from potential injuries associated with sleeping.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by abnormal behaviors emerging during REM sleep that may cause injury or sleep disruption. The diagnosis requires polysomnography (PSG) demonstrating a loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep. RBD results from dysfunction of the brain stem circuits responsible for maintaining normal REM sleep atonia and suppressing behaviors during REM sleep. The diagnosis of idiopathic RBD (IRBD), that is, RBD without an identifiable cause, is frequently followed years later by the development of a neurodegenerative disorder, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies. As such, RBD is often a step in the progression of a neurodegenerative disorder. In this circumstance, it is a manifestation of neurodegeneration occurring in the brain stem before spreading to adjacent and other CNS regions, resulting in the development of symptoms and signs that permit recognition of a specific neurodegenerative disorder. RBD has been linked with narcolepsy and has been associated with a variety of other disorders. The management of RBD focuses on preventive/safety measures, counseling, monitoring for the development of a neurodegenerative disorder, and pharmacotherapy, which is typically effective but not well understood. The purpose of this article is to review and update our current understanding of the clinical features, epidemiology, demographics, pathophysiology, evaluation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, causes, associations, and the clinical management of RBD.",

      "abstract": "Sleep structure is qualitatively and quantitatively changed by aging. The elderly usually go to bed in early evening and wake up in early morning, and they also take several naps in the day time. The polyphasic sleep is one of the typical sleep patterns found in the elderly. Comparing the sleep of the elderly with that of young adults by the method of polysomnography, the characteristics of the sleep of the elderly are in the prolongation of sleep latency, shortening of total sleep time, increase of Stage W and Stage 1, decrease of Stage 3 and 4, and also decrease of Stage REM and the advance of REM phase. Insomnia is a frequently observed symptom in the elderly. The so-called psychophysiological insomnia due to transient psychological or situational stress is common in the elderly. However, insomnia following the mental disturbance (depression), chronic use of drug or alcohol, dementia (vascular or Alzheimer type) are also important in the elderly. Sleep apnea syndrome is recently found as an important cause of insomnia. Concerning the treatment and prevention of insomnia, it is necessary to exclude the causes of insomnia, to improve the environmental conditions and to keep the regular rhythm of sleep-wake cycle. It is also important to carefully select and use the adequate hypnotics considering the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of the drugs in the elderly.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Ekbom's syndrome, is a fairly common complaint which is not widely recognised by medical professionals, although it seems to affect 1-10% of the population. Despite recent attempts to better characterize RLS, this neurologic disorder remains poorly understood. Idiopathic RLS frequently follows an autosomal dominant inheritance with a variable clinical expressivity of symptoms. Secondary RLS is usually associated with neuropathy of chronic disorders (uremia, cryoglobulinemia, diabetes mellitus, infections, etc). RLS gives the sufferer an unpleasant sensation in the legs at rest, causing an irresistible desire to move which alleviates the discomfort. Other features that characterize RLS include sleep disturbance, involuntary movements in sleep or wakefulness, a normal neurologic examination, a chronic clinical course (waxing and waning over the time), and, in some cases, a positive family history. Periodic limb movements during sleep, which also may occur as an isolated finding, may or may not cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Clinical diagnosis of idiopathic or symptomatic forms of RLS can be supported with polysomnography. Full understanding of the features of RLS will provide the clinician with the strongest tool for recognizing the disorder. Many different treatments have been tried for RLS. Since the cause is unclear, therapy of RLS and PLMS remains symptomatic except for some secondary forms. Treatment of first choice consists of dopaminergic drugs or dopamine agonist, opioids and benzodiazepines.",

      "title": "1000 Hypnagogic hallucinations as a manifestation of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Narcolepsy and Parkinson’s disease (PD) share many similar symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, with or without cataplexy. Hypnagogic hallucinations occur while falling asleep and the person experiencing them typically knows they are not real. Here, we present a case of hypnagogic hallucinations as a manifestation of PD in a patient without narcolepsy. Report of case(s) A 66-year-old female with a history of tremor was seen in the sleep disorders clinic with chief complaints of dream enactment and excessive daytime sleepiness. She described bruising after falling out of bed. On further questioning, she reported instances of seeing “death and a grim reaper as well as a dark figure”, usually upon falling asleep at night. She denied daytime hallucinations. She underwent diagnostic polysomnography (PSG), which showed mild obstructive sleep apnea and loss of rapid eye movement (REM) atonia during brief periods of REM sleep. Treatment for dream enactment was implemented by increasing her dose of melatonin (which she had been taking for insomnia) and initiation of clonazepam, which led to significant improvement in dream enactment. Over the next two years, she was diagnosed with PD and started on carbidopa-levodopa. She reported more frequent hypnagogic hallucinations during a follow-up visit, occurring 1-2 times weekly, which her neurologist attributed to being on higher dosages of dopaminergic therapy. During a recent visit, she reported no dream enactment and infrequent hypnagogic hallucinations. Conclusion Sleep disturbances in PD are common and include insomnia, hypersomnia, and REM behavioral disorder (RBD). A lesser appreciated association is that between hypnagogic hallucinations and PD, as depicted in this case. Partial hypocretin cell loss in PD has been postulated to result in disturbed hypocretin signaling, which probably explains the occurrence of narcolepsy-like symptoms (including hypnagogic hallucinations) in PD. Hypnagogic hallucinations are more common among patients with PD compared to the general population and tend to occur more as PD progresses, with longer duration of treatment with dopaminergic agents, with older age, and in patients with RBD. This case serves as an important reminder that hypnagogic hallucinations are not pathognomonic for narcolepsy and are likely underappreciated in PD. Support (if any)",

When standard societal timetables are superimposed upon this, major problems, such as insomnia, chronic sleep restriction, and excessive daytime sleepiness may arise. These enduring problems may often have profound impacts on performance, as well as mental and physical health. Numerous CRSWDs exist. Of these, a very small number are truly ‘intrinsic’ – that is due to inherited molecular dysfunction of the pacemaker. Ageing, behaviour, illness and the environment, may influence many of the disorders, and are likely to have a cumulative effect in any one individual. However, some disorders are more ‘extrinsic’ than others, such as shift work and jet lag disorder. The various types of CRSWDs are discussed within this chapter, as are the behavioural and pharmacological interventions that can be used in their management.",

      "abstract": "NON-RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (REM) SLEEPNon-REM sleep parasomnias are very common in childhood and are usually benign, rarely coming to medical attention.They typically arise from the first period of deepest non-REM (slow wave) sleep, around an hour after sleep onset.Over time, a spectrum of behaviours may be seen, even in the same subject, varying from brief confused arousals to frank sleepwalking.Agitated events may be seen, especially in younger age groups, leading to disturbing 'night terrors'.Despite apparent severe distress and intense autonomic activation, the child rarely recalls the nocturnal events.Because they are thought to reflect an incomplete transition from deep sleep to wakefulness, non-REM parasomnias are often termed 'arousal disorders'.Most non-REM sleep parasomnias improve through adolescence but may persist on a regular basis in at least 1% of adults.An enormous range of behaviours may be reported, some of which are complex and potentially hazardous.In adulthood, subjects appear to be more prone to exhibiting activities which may be considered 'goal-seeking' in nature, including eating or cooking.Males, in particular, while in a state of parasomnia, may engage in intimate relations with bed partners or display violence.Subsequent recall is invariably absent or severely diminished although some report dream-like or hallucinatory images, particularly if the parasomnia is associated with significant agitation.Common themes include spiders or other unpleasant visual imagery.Often, there is simply a sense of 'impending doom' causing the subject to rush from the bedroom, often vocalising and disturbing partners.It is usually possible to communicate at a limited level with subjects in this state although they typically display a degree of confusion and appear only partially awake.Typically, an adult with a significant non-REM sleep parasomnia will have events from deep slow wave sleep within an hour or two of sleep onset.Events rarely occur more than once a night but may cluster with several symptomatic nights in a week.Often, there are more prolonged spells free of disturbances.The behaviours across nights might be similar but are not precisely stereotyped.Triggers or precipitants are often identified and include internal factors that tend to deepen non-REM sleep (such as sleep deprivation) or external factors (such as an uncomfortable or noisy environment) which may partially arouse the deeply sleeping subject.Although controlled evidence is limited, short-acting hypnotics such as zolpidem may induce sleepwalking or similar behaviours in predisposed individuals.Similarly, alcohol in some may appear to trigger parasomnias, potentially through secondary factors such as sleep deprivation, increased snoring or a full bladder.By contrast, in clinical ABSTRACT It is common for general physicians to experience diagnostic doubt and trepidation whenever faced with patients who exhibit abnormal nocturnal behaviours or excessive movements at night.There is also a perception that expensive and often poorly available overnight tests are usually required for diagnostic precision.In fact, the majority of conditions, whether they be parasomnias or, more rarely, nocturnal seizures, can be reliably diagnosed from a directed history, if available.Although the evidence base for treating parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders remains minimal, accurate recognition is important for a variety of reasons.This review covers the diagnostic features of the full range of parasomnias and movement disorders that might present to a multidisciplinary adult sleep clinic.Throughout, it will be argued that the recognition of key or salient features obtained from a good history is the most important diagnostic tool.Indeed, when diagnostic doubt remains after a thorough sleep history, it is relatively rare for detailed tests to add much in the way of useful information.",

SW, CA and ST are different clinical manifestations of the same disorder being ST the most severe and SW the mildest manifestation. Disorders of arousal are typical parasomnias of NREM sleep, mainly slow wave sleep. Pathophysiological mechanism of these disorders is the state's dissociation of wakefulness and sleep. The conjunction of the constitutional factors (genetic, age, sleep privation, drugs, psychological, etc.), and precipitant factors (light, sound, temperature, touch, apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, seizure, fever, psychological, etc.) permit three possible arousal behavioral response: A full awakening, a shift stage of sleep or a partial arousal. Clinical significance of arousal parasomnias depend on the age. In children are caused by developmental and genetic factors and usually are autolimited. In adults usually are caused by psychopathology. In the elderly are often caused by organic brain syndromes. Parasomnias of sleep-wake transition are: Rhythmic movements of sleep, sleeptalking, starts and the nocturnal cramp. Most of them are mild disorders, almost physiological phenomena that usually don't need any treatment.",

Ils retentissent sur le comportement diurne des enfants et perturbent durablement le sommeil des parents. La clinique du trouble du sommeil eliminera une cause organique (reflux gastro-œsophagien, epilepsie, etc.). Les troubles du sommeil a proprement parler se traduisent par un trouble du rythme circadien, des difficultes d’endormissement et/ou des reveils nocturnes. La prise en charge doit avant tout prendre en compte le contexte environnemental afin d’ameliorer les habitudes et l’hygiene du sommeil et de renforcer les donneurs de temps (alternance lumiere obscurite, alimentation, horaires du coucher et du lever, rythmes sociaux). La severite des troubles et leur retentissement sur le sommeil de toute la famille justifient souvent d’associer un traitement medicamenteux aux mesures comportementales. La melatonine a transforme l’approche therapeutique des troubles du sommeil de l’enfant handicape. Elle peut etre proposee sous forme de melatonine a liberation immediate ou a liberation prolongee.

      "abstract": "Neurologic disorders can affect sleep on multiple levels, depending on the location of the lesion or dysfunction. Many classifications can be used, such as classifications related to the location of the lesion or classifications related to the clinical presentations. The latter have the advantage of enticing the practitioner to systematically evaluate specific sleep disorders. Such classifications include neurodegenerative disorders, neuromuscular disorders, movement disorders, autoimmune disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, seizures, and headaches. The manifestations in terms of their impact on sleep often depend, of course, on the location of the lesion. Some neurologic diseases involve the sleep-wake system. For example, dementing disorders may affect diffuse neural pathways that impact the strength of the circadian rhythm, but also instability of sleep and sleep states. In contrast, other disorders secondarily impact sleep and its quality. As an example, neuromuscular disorders can impact control of swallowing and the airway, which can increase susceptibility to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",

Maturity of superficial sleep terminates by the 10th-12th month of life. The sleep of average depth and deep sleep terminate maturity by the 2nd month of life. Duration of paradoxical sleep increases considerably by the age 12th month and is divided into 2 stages. By the age of 12 months paradoxical sleep remains immature.

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "abstract": "Medications with cognitive effects and/or side effects also affect sleep and dreaming. The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

It occurs before disease onset as a prodromal symptom, during and then throughout the disease course. Causes are multifactorial and can be multiple in the same patient. Specific sleep disorders that are known to occur in those with Parkinson's disease include REM sleep behavior disorder, sleep disordered breathing including obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs and periodic limb movements, nightmare disorder, insomnia alongside direct side-effects of the medication used for therapy. One key question is whether these sleep disorders impact upon the motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. There has been significant interest in recent years in using certain sleep disorders, in particular, REM sleep behavior disorder, as a biomarker both for those at risk of Parkinson's disease but also influencing the subsequent severity and speed of progression. However, other sleep disorders in the general population may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. It is important to understand whether the treatment of sleep disturbance and specific sleep disorders modifies the long-term risk of developing Parkinson's disease or its progression.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of Non rapid eye movement (Non-REM) sleep. Non-REM parasomnia behaviors have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream-like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterize the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental disconnection associated with behavioral episodes, 35 adult patients with Non-REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in-depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviors (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterized by delusional thinking of varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni- or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%) and variable, but often pronounced amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (‘awake dreaming’). Surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people) or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness and sensory disconnection in Non-REM parasomnias is variable and graded. In their full-fledged expression, Non-REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep-related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized as those who cannot sleep, those who will not sleep, those with excessive daytime sleepiness, and those with increased movements during sleep. Insomnia, defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that results in daytime impairment, is diagnosed using history findings and treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without sleep hypnotics. Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an urge to move the legs that worsens with rest, is relieved by movement, and often occurs in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome is treated based on the frequency of symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. It is diagnosed using a sleep log or actigraphy, followed by overnight polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test. Narcolepsy is treated with stimulants, such as modafinil; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; or gamma hydroxybutyric acid (sodium oxybate). Patients with snoring and witnessed apneas may have obstructive sleep apnea, which is diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Continuous positive airway pressure is the most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in the patient acting out dreams with possible harmful consequences. It is diagnosed based on history and polysomnography findings, and treated with environmental safety measures and melatonin or clonazepam.",

The disorders present with a broad array of symptoms but result in the individual not getting the health, cognitive, and restorative benefits of a good night’s sleep. The disorders have been categorized into the following categories: insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders. This chapter reviews each category and provides details on the symptoms, pathophysiology, and treatment of the most common disorder in each category, including insomnia, obstructive sleep apnoea, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, and REM sleep behaviour disorder. The presenting complaint is the key to diagnosis, directing subsequent evaluation.",

Sleep disorders are divided into primary sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, and secondary sleep disorders that may result from other conditions such as pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. The particular type of sleep disorder must be diagnosed, and will guide both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies, as warranted.",

Patients with severe sleep apnea and objective insomnia have fewer nightmares. Dreams from all sleep stages include negative content. Sleep-onset hallucinations and the deep-sleep parasomnias, especially night terrors, can be remarkably bizarre, including dream content that parodies that of the classic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-associated nightmare. Nightmares are often reported by individuals who score abnormally on psychological tests as well as on screening tests for the diagnoses of insomnia, depression, neuroticism, schizotypy, psychosis, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The theoretical perspective that nightmares reflect a functional failure in emotional processing also supports the pathological role for nightmares. The Sundance studies indicated that individual's success in their creative roles report a higher frequency of nightmares and are more likely to use them in their creative process.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores the causes, consequences, and countermeasures of jet lag, mistimed sleep, and sleep inertia. Jet lag can occur when rapidly crossing multiple time zones (e.g., trans-meridian travel for long-haul pilots). The desynchrony between the body's biological clock, or circadian rhythm, and the new day-night cycle can lead to indigestion, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive impairments. Mistimed sleep can also occur within a time zone. In the case of night shiftwork, sleep is displaced to the daytime which leads to poor sleep and increased fatigue at night due to the combination of pressures from the two-process model of sleep regulation: sleep loss (homeostatic pressure) and being awake when the body is promoting sleep (circadian pressure). There is also a third process of sleep regulation called sleep inertia, which refers to the brief period of fatigue and impaired cognitive performance experienced after waking. Sleep inertia can be a fatigue risk for transportation workers who work on-call (e.g., emergency services) or who nap on shift (e.g., long-haul truck drivers) and are required to perform a safety-critical task soon after waking. For each of these fatigue risks, strategic exposure to bright light can be used to help realign sleep timing and to promote alertness.",

      "abstract": "Veel mensen in onze samenleving leiden aan regelmatige slaapproblemen of hebben gewoonweg niet voldoende tijd voor slaap. Wanneer slaapgebrek een chronisch probleem wordt zouden er wel eens veranderingen in hersenen en lichaam kunnen optreden die ernstige gevolgen hebben voor de psychische en fysieke gezondheid. Zo is er vaak gesuggereerd dat verstoorde slaap kan bijdragen aan het ontstaan van stemmingsstoornissen als depressie. In dit proefschrift worden studies beschreven naar de neurobiologische gevolgen van chronische slaaptekort in ratten. De dagelijkse hoeveelheid slaap werd tot minder dan de helft gereduceerd en in de weken daarna werden de gevolgen bestudeerd voor hersensystemen en hormonale processen die mogelijk betrokken zijn bij depressie. Hoewel een enkele dag van slaaptekort nog geen effecten had op deze systemen, waren er na een week al duidelijk veranderingen meetbaar in de gevoeligheid voor de neurotransmitter serotonine en in de regulatie van de hypofyse-bijnier as, het hormonale systeem dat betrokken is bij de reactie op stress. Na een maand van slaaptekort traden er zelfs morfologische veranderingen op in het brein. Er was een duidelijke afname in de grootte van de hippocampus, een hersengebied dat een belangrijke rol speelt bij de regulatie van emoties en cognitieve processen. Veel van de waargenomen neurobiologische en hormonale veranderingen na chronisch slaaptekort in ratten komen sterk overeen met afwijkingen die zijn vastgesteld bij depressieve patienten. De resultaten van deze studies leveren dan ook een sterke ondersteuning van de hypothese dat verstoorde slaap niet enkel een symptoom is van depressie maar, bij een deel van de patienten, mogelijk een causale rol speelt bij het ontstaan van de stemmingsstoornis.",

An evaluation of respiratory function during wakefulness, a sleep questionnaire and an overnight polysomnography were performed in all patients. Recurrent hypoxaemia of variable degree was observed during sleep. In most cases, night-time hypoxaemia appears not to be predictable during wakefulness. Nocturnal hypoxaemia occurs in relation to apnoeas or hypopnoeas, mainly of central type, especially when these breathing irregularities occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Moreover, polygraphic sleep-apnoea patterns, as defined by international criteria, seem to be an infrequent condition, except for those neuromuscular diseases, characterized by an involvement of the central nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Sleep difficulties are often leading symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients. In my presentation I will cover the most important aspects of the complex relationship between sleep disorders, mental and physical health and quality of life.",

Clinically it is accompanied by abrupt, often violent movements, which may involve a limb or the trunk in relation to dreams typical of this phase of sleep, and which may interrupt sleep. Many pathological processes have been described, including: the Shy-Dragger syndrome, Parkinson's disease, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, multisystemic atrophy, in relation to certain antidepressant drugs, and most frequently the idiopathic form.We present two cases, one diagnosed as olivopontocerebellar atrophy and another in which there were no pathological findings. Both were referred to our department for the study of possible sleep disorders. In both cases neurophysiological studies, basically polysomnography with monitorization of various muscle groups and video, led to the diagnosis.We discuss the diagnostic and physiological criteria, and physiopathological explanations of each case, with special reference to N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) and non-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (non-NMDA) receptors.

The occurrence of partial or complete UA obstruction during sleep characterizes the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome. Breathing (respiration), which is mainly under a behavioral or voluntary control system during awakening, is essentially under a metabolic or automated control system during sleep. The contribution of the thoracic cage to the overall respiration remains the same during wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Considering the importance of the metabolic regulation in the control of respiration during sleep, one can easily speculate that any change in the ventilatory response to hypoxic or hypercapnic stimuli will increase the magnitude of nocturnal hypoventilation episodes. UA are usually patent throughout the respiratory cycle and they behave in a manner similar to that of a Starling resistance model where a collapsible segment (pharynx) is located between two noncollapsible segments.",

      "title": "Characteristics of Accidents Attributed to the Driver Having Fallen Asleep",
      "abstract": "Even in non-sleep-deprived persons, sleepiness occurs at two particular periods of the day, i.e., during the night at the time of normal sleep and in the early afternoon, at the time of the siesta in certain cultures. This can be shown by measuring the physiological tendency to sleep as the latency to sleep in brief naps (Richardson, et al, 1982). Increases in sleepiness can result from sleep deprivation (inadequate sleep) or from sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. Subjects who are excessively sleepy, from whatever cause, have performance lapses and slowed reaction times and an accelerated loss of attentional vigilance (Dinges, 1992). They, moreover will exhibit the phenomenon of microsleeps, i.e., sleepy subjects may fall asleep in an unpredictable fashion and be temporarily unaware of their surroundings. These behavioral changes that occur in sleepy individuals can have important consequences. The consequences will depend on the environment that the subject is in. Perhaps the most dangerous situation is while driving. Crashes occur in individuals who fall asleep at the wheel. Such crashes can be serious with resulting fatalities (Parsons, 1986). That this occurs has been known for some time (for review of earlier work in this area, see Shinar, 1978). The goal of the study described in this report was to investigate, in detail, the characteristics of accidents attributed on the police report to the driver having fallen asleep. The study was a retrospective analysis of data from the state of North Carolina. We analyzed data for the years 1990 to 1992, inclusive.

      "title": "From mechanisms to future therapy: a synopsis of isolated REM sleep behavior disorder as early synuclein-related disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy are synucleinopathies, characterized by neuronal loss, gliosis and the abnormal deposition of α-synuclein in vulnerable areas of the nervous system. Neurodegeneration begins however several years before clinical onset of motor, cognitive or autonomic symptoms. The isolated form of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a parasomnia with dream enactment behaviors and excessive muscle activity during REM sleep, is an early stage synucleinopathy. The neurophysiological hallmark of RBD is REM sleep without atonia (RWSA), i.e. the loss of physiological muscle atonia during REM sleep. RBD pathophysiology is not fully clarified yet, but clinical and basic science suggest that ɑ-syn pathology begins in the lower brainstem where REM atonia circuits are located, including the sublaterodorsal tegmental/subcoeruleus nucleus and the ventral medulla, then propagates rostrally to brain regions such as the substantia nigra, limbic system, cortex. Genetically, there is only a partial overlap between RBD, PD and DLB, and individuals with iRBD may represent a specific subpopulation. A genome-wide association study identified five loci, which all seem to revolve around the GBA1 pathway. iRBD patients often show subtle motor, cognitive, autonomic and/or sensory signs, neuroimaging alterations as well as biofluid and tissue markers of neurodegeneration (in particular pathologic α-synuclein aggregates), which can be useful for risk stratification. Patients with iRBD represent thus the ideal population for neuroprotective/neuromodulating trials. This review provides insights into these aspects, highlighting and substantiating the central role of iRBD in treatment development strategies for synucleinopathies.",

      "abstract": "A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases. Greatly increased daytime sleepiness or striking insomnia at the very beginning of suspected dementia should thus prompt the search for other, possibly treatable causes of dementia. Neuropathological and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis of a deteriorated hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (harbouring the biological clock) as a cause for the deranged circadian sleep-wake system in dementia. Management of sundowning behaviour includes restriction of daytime sleep, exposure to bright lights, and social interaction schedules during the day. The benzodiazepines and analogues usually not being sufficiently effectual, low doses of mild neuroleptics are often needed. Whether recent reports on efficacy of melatonin in elderly insomniacs also apply to demented patients is yet uncertain. The careful search and treatment of possible extracerebral physiologic factors causing reversible hypersomnia or insomnia is an important requisite. Polysomnographic studies are needed to recognise treatable sleep disturbance which could deteriorate or mimic dementia and sundowning. Particularly, a sleep-apnea-hypopnea syndrome must be searched for at the beginning of a suspected dementia, when successful treatment is still possible. Sleep studies should also identify periodic leg movements of sleep with restless legs and/or increased daytime sleepiness, and hyperkinetic parasomnias such as REM sleep behaviour disorder which may complicate or imitate sundowning.",

      "title": "[Sleep disorders in childhood].",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders in childhood are frequent and usually harmless. They rarely point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders, it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g. psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by loss of normal voluntary muscle atonia during REM sleep, and is associated with excessive motor activity related to dreaming. The movements are often potentially harmful and may lead to repeated injuries to the patients and/or their bedpartners. RBD is more common in the elderly and affects predominantly males. A recent survey reported an estimated prevalence of RBD of 0.38% in the elderly and 0.5% in the general population. Because the treatment of RBD is effective and safe in most cases, awareness and diagnosis of RBD is critical. Overnight polysomnography is required to differentiate accurately between RBD and other sleep disorders, even though the patients have been clinically diagnosed as RBD according to the minimal criteria of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Muscle tone persists during REM sleep in RBD patients, and may be frequently augmented for prolonged periods of time. The density of REMs or phasic muscle activity occurring during REM sleep significantly increases in these patients, although their overall sleep architecture is usually normal, with the expected cycles of non‐REM and REM sleep. RBD occurs in both acute and chronic form. Acute cases are associated with intoxication and withdrawal. Chronic cases are most often either idiopathic or associated with neurological disorders—especially neurodegenerative diseases. The etiology of idiopathic RBD is still unknown, but a recent study has shown an association between some cases of idiopathic RBD and neurodegenerative disorders with parkinsonism such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and diffuse Lewy body disease. RBD patients thus need to be carefully followed up in terms of neurological evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Les exigences operationnelles du metier de pilote sont susceptibles d'engendrer de la somnolence et des niveaux de charge mentale inadequats (i.e., trop faible ou trop eleve) au cours des vols. Les dettes de sommeil et les perturbations circadiennes liees a divers facteurs (e.g., longues periodes de services, horaires de travail irregulier, etc.) demandent aux pilotes de repousser sans cesse leurs limites biologiques. Par ailleurs, la charge de travail mental des pilotes presente de fortes variations au cours d'un vol : elevee au cours des phases critiques (i.e., decollage et atterrissage), elle devient tres reduite pendant les phases de croisiere. Lorsque la charge mentale devient trop elevee ou, a l'inverse, trop faible, les performances se degradent et des erreurs de pilotage peuvent apparaitre. La mise en oeuvre de methodes de detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale en temps quasi reel est un defi majeur pour le suivi et le controle de l'activite de pilotage. L'objectif de la these est de determiner si la voix humaine peut permettre de detecter d'une part, l'etat de somnolence et d'autre part, le niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Dans une premiere etude, la voix de participants a ete enregistree lors d'une tâche de lecture avant et apres une nuit de privation totale de sommeil (PTS). Les variations de l'etat de somnolence consecutives a la PTS ont ete evaluees au moyen de mesures auto-evaluatives et electrophysiologiques (ElectroEncephaloGraphie [EEG] et Potentiels Evoques [PEs]). Les resultats ont montre une variation significative apres la PTS de plusieurs parametres acoustiques lies : (a) a l'amplitude des impulsions glottiques (frequence de modulation d'amplitude), (b) a la forme du signal acoustique (longueur euclidienne du signal et ses caracteristiques associees) et (c) au spectre du signal des voyelles (rapport harmonique sur bruit, frequence du second formant, coefficient d'asymetrie, centre de gravite spectral, differences d'energie, pente spectrale et coefficients cepstraux a echelle Mel). La plupart des caracteristiques spectrales ont montre une sensibilite differente a la privation de sommeil en fonction du type de voyelles. Des correlations significatives ont ete mises en evidence entre plusieurs parametres acoustiques et plusieurs indicateurs objectifs (EEG et PEs) de l'etat de somnolence. Dans une seconde etude, le signal vocal a ete enregistre durant une tâche de rappel de listes de mots. La difficulte de la tâche etait manipulee en faisant varier le nombre de mots dans chaque liste (i.e., entre un et sept, correspondant a sept conditions de charge mentale). Le diametre pupillaire - qui est un indicateur objectif pertinent du niveau de charge mentale - a ete mesure simultanement avec l'enregistrement de la voix afin d'attester de la variation du niveau de charge mentale durant la tâche experimentale. Les resultats ont montre que des parametres acoustiques classiques (frequence fondamentale et son ecart type, shimmer, nombre de periodes et rapport harmonique sur bruit) et originaux (frequence de modulation d'amplitude et variations a court-terme de la longueur euclidienne du signal) ont ete particulierement sensibles aux variations de la charge mentale. Les variations de ces parametres acoustiques etaient correlees a celles du diametre pupillaire. L'ensemble des resultats suggere que les parametres acoustiques de la voix humaine identifies lors des experimentations pourraient representer des indicateurs pertinents pour la detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Les resultats ouvrent de nombreuses perspectives de recherche et d'applications dans le domaine de la securite des transports, notamment dans le secteur aeronautique.",

Normal sleep is characterized by behavioral and physiologic changes as well as 2 distinct sleep states, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM). Throughout the course of a night, people cycle between NREM and REM sleep via an ultradian rhythm, with most of sleep spent in NREM. Determinants involved in the regulation of sleep are the homeostatic and circadian processes. Despite being highly regulated, sleep is fragile, and its stages and duration may be affected by multiple factors, such as age, drugs, temperature, and medical and psychiatric disease.

The inability to focus or maintain concentration is the most disabling aspect of conditions causing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), described as 'brain fog' or even masquerading as dementia. The commonest causes of mild and severe EDS are probably insufficient sleep and poor quality overnight sleep, respectively. Sleep onset or sleep maintainance insomnia can reflect an idiopathic or primary phenomenon but is more often secondary to a variety of disorders, including other primary sleep disorders. In patients with underlying neuropathies, radiculopathies or demyelinating disease, restless legs syndrome (RLS) may be secondary to the primary diagnosis and should not be overlooked.

S disturbances have been shown to increase risk and/or exacerbate psychiatric and physical health problems in many different populations. However, few studies have examined the relationships among sleep, psychiatric, and cognitive functioning in Veterans with TBI.\r\nMethods: Retrospective chart reviews of 137 Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans with a history of mild to moderate TBI referred for cognitive rehabilitation at the Veteran Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.\r\nResults: 100% of Veterans reported clinically significant sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory [PSQI] global scores >5). Veterans also reported clinically relevant impairments in sleep latency (50 minutes), total sleep time (5.5 hours), and sleep efficiency (77%). More severe sleep problems were related to greater endorsement of depressive, post-concussive, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. Conversely, sleep disturbance showed limited associations with objective neuropsychological assessment. Overall measures of affective functioning were significantly associated with global measures of sleep quality, though such relationships were not observed for quantitative measures of sleep.\r\nConclusions: Veterans with mild to moderate TBI exhibit very high rates of sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance is associated with higher levels of comorbid psychiatric symptomatology, particularly affective complaints. The high prevalence of sleep problems in Veterans with a history of TBI underscores a need to develop both a better understanding of etiologic mechanisms relating brain injury and sleep and a better clinical appreciation of the ramifications of sleep disturbance on daily functioning and recovery in individuals who experience TBI.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "title": "REM-sleep regulation: circadian, homeostatic, and non-REM sleep-dependent determinants",
      "abstract": "The amount, timing, and structure of REM sleep are regulated. Three major determinants in REM sleep regulation have been identified: (1) the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which through its outputs generates daily cycles in REM sleep propensity; (2) a homeostatic (i.e., need-based) drive for REM sleep that increases in the absence of REM sleep and decreases during its presence; (3) the inhibition of REM sleep by non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans, the circadian modulation of REM sleep shows a maximum shortly after the nadir of the circadian rhythm of core body temperature. A sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep (i.e., a gradual increase of REM sleep in the course of a sleep episode that is distinct from a circadian influence) is also evident and attributed primarily to the decrease in NREM sleep intensity. The circadian rhythm and the sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep are the dominant factors influencing the distribution of REM sleep within a sleep episode. In humans that are normally entrained to the 24-hour day, the interaction of these two factors results in maximal REM sleep propensity in the morning, coinciding with habitual wake time. The homeostatic regulation counteracts deviations from a reference level of REM sleep need such that loss of REM sleep results in increased REM sleep propensity. However, rebounds in REM sleep following selective deprivation often remain partial suggesting that the homeostatic drive is relatively weak. On the other hand, recent studies have emphasized that REM sleep can undergo changes in its quality that may compensate for its loss in duration. In the present chapter, the evidence for circadian and homeostatic regulation of REM sleep will be reviewed, the physiological markers that are indicative of such regulation will be presented, and the interdependence of REM sleep and NREM sleep regulation will be examined.",

      "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by a lack of motor inhibition during REM sleep leading to potentially harmful dream-enacting behaviors. RBD affects mainly older men and its prevalence in the general population is estimated to be around 0.5%. RBD may be idiopathic or associated with other neurologic disorders. A strong association between RBD and alpha-synucleinopathies has been recently observed, with the parasomnia often heralding the clinical onset of the neurodegenerative disease. The idiopathic form accounts for up to 60% of the cases reported in the three largest series of patients with RBD. Small clinical follow-up studies revealed that a proportion of these patients will eventually develop a parkinsonian syndrome or a dementia of Lewy bodies type in the years following the RBD diagnosis, while some patients will never show other neurologic signs within several decades from the RBD onset. Recent studies have looked at neurophysiologic and neuropsychological functions in idiopathic RBD and have found evidences of CNS dysfunction during both wakefulness and sleep. An impairment of the cortical activity, specific neuropsychological deficits, and signs of autonomic dysfunction have been observed in a variable proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of idiopathic RBD. Identifying subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) enact violent dreams during REM sleep in the absence of normal muscle atonia. This disorder is highly frequent in patients with synucleinopathies (60%–100% of patients) and rare in patients with other neurodegenerative disorders. The disorder is detected by interview plus video and sleep monitoring. Abnormal movements expose the patients and bed partners to a high risk of injury and sleep disruption. The disorder is usually alleviated with melatonin and clonazepam. Limb movements are mainly minor, jerky, fast, pseudohallucinatory, and repeated, with a limp wrist during apparently grasping movements, although body jerks and complex violent (fights) and nonviolent culturally acquired behaviors are also observed. Notably, parkinsonism disappears during RBD‐associated complex behaviors in patients with Parkinson's disease and with multiple system atrophy, suggesting that the upper motor stream bypasses the basal ganglia during REM sleep. Longitudinal studies show that idiopathic RBD predisposes patients to later develop Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and, more rarely, multiple system atrophy, with a rate of conversion of 46% within 5 years. During this time window, patients concomitantly develop nonmotor signs (decreased olfaction and color vision, orthostatic hypotension, altered visuospatial abilities, increased harm avoidance) and have abnormal test results (decreased putamen dopamine uptake, slower EEG). Patients with idiopathic RBD have higher and faster risk for conversion to Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies if abnormalities in dopamine transporter imaging, transcranial sonography, olfaction, and color vision are found at baseline. They constitute a highly specific target for testing neuroprotective agents. © 2012 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a very important process, which helps to encode and store all the information and memories obtained during the day and to recover mental activity. Sleep function is closely related to the Sleep Cycle, containing two main parts: rapid eye movement (REM), which is also named active sleep; and no rapid eye movement (NREM), which is defined as deep sleep. The first REM period may be less than 10 minutes in duration, while the last one may exceed 60 minutes. Awakening after a full night’s sleep is usually from REM sleep. The sleep pattern changes as the child grows. Polycyclic sleep pattern of the newborn changes to a monocyclic adult pattern. In newborns, the total sleep duration can be 14 to 16 hours, in a day of 24 hours. According to the Cleveland Clinic, lack of sleep can result in short – term and long – term problems. Short – term problems include lack of alertness, excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired memory and stress, whereas longitude lack of sleep can result in high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke.",

      "abstract": "Introducción El sueño es un estado natural y fisiológico rítmico, aparece por la melatonina activada por la oscuridad, esto disminuye la conciencia, inmovilidad, relajación muscular. También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

Parasomnias need careful clinical history-taking often followed by a sleep lab study to rule out other sleep disorders.

Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

      "title": "Interactions Between Anesthesia and Sleep: Optimizing Perioperative Care to Improve Sleep Quality and Surgical Recovery Outcomes",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a fundamental physiological process that supports immunity, cognition, memory, and metabolism, making it essential for overall health and well-being. Poor-quality sleep is associated with the onset of many diseases, including cardiovascular and mental health disorders. When using anesthesia, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the metabolic dysfunction and immunosuppression linked to sleep loss to ensure appropriate perioperative management. Commonly used agents like propofol, sevoflurane, and ketamine affect consciousness, pain levels, and autonomic responses. Inhaled anesthetics (e.g., sevoflurane and isoflurane) and intravenous anesthetics (propofol) act on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and influence stages of sleep and circadian rhythms. Ketamine may uniquely preserve some aspects of restorative sleep, while most anesthetics affect rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep (SWS), altering cognitive and physical recovery. Modifying anesthetic regimes depending on the patient's sleep history and risk factors can maximize sleep health and postoperative patient outcomes. The physiological effects of anesthesia on the central nervous system persist beyond the perioperative period by influencing sleep quality, circadian regulation, and postoperative outcomes. Effective pain management is a significant component in addressing sleep quality. Opioids, while effective for pain relief, disrupt sleep architecture by reducing REM and SWS, increasing awakening frequency, and potentially causing respiratory depression. Multimodal pain therapy, including non-opioid analgesics, can reduce dependence, improve sleep quality, and lower adverse effects. Anesthetic agents can influence the body's internal clock, leading to mood changes, fatigue, and cognitive deficits. This review exploits the relationship between sleep and anesthesia, detailing the effect of anesthetic agents on the quality, architecture, and recovery of sleep patterns post-surgery. It also explores how these agents influence sleep stages, such as REM and non-REM sleep, and their implications for patient outcomes. Incorporating sleep optimization techniques can enhance recovery timelines and patient well-being. Researching anesthetic techniques that support postoperative sleep health is essential for further improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The paralysis that occurs when waking up causes fear and anxiety, called sleep paralysis (SP). SP occurs between the stages of sleep and wakefulness. When SP occurred, the subject felt fully awake but unable to move, perceived with sensations such as chest pressure, shortness of breath, and hallucination of images of scary figures. The muscle paralysis that occurs in REM functions to protect oneself from making dangerous movements while dreaming. Muscle atonia that continues into the next stage causes SP. SP is often identified with folklore related to supernatural phenomena. The hallucinations that arise in SP are associated with creepy creatures in certain cultural contexts. For example, in Indonesia, it is commonly referred to as trance due to the disturbance of spirits. Neurologically, SP can be explained scientifically where during sleep, the CNS remains active, but muscle movement is paralyzed. The shadows seen in SP are influenced by cognitive roles. Several factors are thought to cause SP, including sleep quality, psychological factors such as trauma and anxiety, and stressful environmental factors. AbstrakKelumpuhan yang terjadi ketika bangun tidur menimbulkan ketakutan dan kecemasan. Secara medis, kondisi ini disebut dengan sleep paralysis (SP) atau kelumpuhan tidur yang terjadi antara tahap tidur dan terjaga. Pada SP, subjek seolah-olah merasa terjaga sempurna, namun tidak mampu bergerak, disertai sensasi berupa dada terasa tertekan, sesak napas, dan muncul bayangan sosok menyeramkan. Kelumpuhan otot gerak yang terjadi REM berfungsi untuk melindungi diri agar tidak melakukan gerakan membahayakan ketika sedang bermimpi. Atonia otot yang berlanjut ke tahap berikutnya menimbulkan SP. SP kerap diidentikkan dengan folklore terkait fenomena supranatural. Halusinasi yang muncul pada SP dikaitkan dengan makhluk menyeramkan di konteks budaya tertentu, misalnya di Indonesia yang familiar disebut “ketindihan” akibat gangguan makhluk halus. Secara neurologis, SP dapat dijelaskan secara ilmiah dimana pada saat tidur CNS tetap aktif namun otot gerak mengalami kelumpuhan. Bayangan yang terlihat pada SP dipengaruhi oleh peran kognitif. Beberapa faktor diduga menjadi penyebab munculnya SP, diantaranya kualitas tidur, faktor psikologis berupa trauma dan kecemasan, serta faktor lingkungan yang penuh tekanan.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are due to a transient unstable state dissociation during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousal from sleep, and manifest with abnormal sleep related behaviors, perceptions, emotions, dreams, and autonomic nervous system activity Rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), isolated recurrent sleep paralysis and nightmare disorder. Neurophysiology is key for diagnosing these disorders and provides insights into their pathophysiology. RBD is very well characterized from a neurophysiological point of view, also thank to the fact that polysomnography is needed for the diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria are provided by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and video-polysomnography guidelines for the diagnosis by the International REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Study Group. Differences between the two sets of criteria are presented and discussed. Availability of polysomnography in RBD provides data on sleep electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG) and electromyography (EMG). Sleep EEG in RBD shows e.g. changes in delta and theta power, in sleep spindles and K complexes. EMG during REM sleep is essential for RBD diagnosis and is an important neurodegeneration biomarker. RBD patients present alterations also in wake EEG, autonomic function, evoked potentials, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Clinical neurophysiological data on recurrent isolated sleep paralysis and nightmare disorder are scant. The few available data provide insights into the pathophysiology of these disorders, demonstrating a state dissociation in recurrent isolated sleep paralysis and suggesting alterations in sleep macro- and microstructure as well as autonomic changes in nightmare disorder.",

      "abstract": "It is estimated that about 25% of children have sleep disorders, from short problems with falling asleep to severe including primary sleep disorders. Majority of these problems are transitory and self-limiting and usually are not recognized by first care physicians and need education.Analysis of sleep structure at the developmental age and of sleep disorders associated with different sleep phases on the basis of video/polysomnography results.Literature review and illustration of fundamental problems associated with sleep physiology and pathology, with special attention to paroxysmal disorders. Additionally 4 cases from our own experience were presented with neurophysiological and clinical aspects.Discussion on REM and NREM sleep, its phases and alternating share according to child's age was conducted. Sleep disorders were in accordance with their international classification. Parasomnias, occupying most of the space, were divided in two groups: primary and secondary. Among primary parasomnias disorders associated with falling asleep (sleep myoclonus, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rhythmic movement disorder, restless legs syndrome) are important. Another disorders are parasomians associated with light NREM sleep (bruxism, periodic limb movement disorder) and with deeper NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnabulism, night terrors), with REM sleep (nightmares, REM sleep behavior disorder) and associated with NREM and REM sleep (catathrenia, sleep enuresis, sleep talking). Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and epileptic seizures occurring during sleep also play an important role. Frontal lobe epilepsy and Panayiotopoulos syndrome should be considered in the first place in such cases. Our 4 cases document these diagnostic difficulties, requiring video/polysomnography examination 2 of them illustrate frontal lobe epilepsy and single ones myoclonic epilepsy graphy in children is a difficult technique and requires special device, local and trained personnel. It is crucial in gathering objective data about sleep disorders.Correct diagnosis of paroxysmal disorders during sleep in children is possible thanks to video/polysomnography, and enables proper management and pharmacotherpy. It enables improvement or cure disorders during the sleep and moreover enables the obtainment of positive changes in child's every day life.",

Sudden (lapses) and gradual changes in cognitive performance occur with sleep deprivation or with time of day. The time course of human cognitive processes throughout the day is relevant to the programming of different human activities. The lowest level of cognitive performance occurs during nighttime and early in the morning, a better level occurs around noon, and even higher levels occur during afternoon and evening hours.

The core clinical features of DLB are dementia plus rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, and/or transient fluctuations in awareness. Antipsychotics, especially typical antipsychotics, should be avoided given the increased risk of mortality when used in patients with dementia and the higher frequency of side effects in patients with DLB. Although there is no specific treatment for DLB itself, cognitive enhancing medications may provide some benefit.

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are among the most common disabling nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD). Recently, awareness of sleep disorders related to PD has increased, reflecting their significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient. However, sleep disturbances are still often under-recognized. In PD, multiple factors are associated with sleep disturbances; impaired arousal systems and sleep structure as disease-related changes, nocturnal motor symptoms, hallucinations and psychosis, pain, nocturia, depressive symptoms and dopaminergic medication can all cause insomnia. Further, these factors can coexist and influence each other during the course of the disease. In addition, sleep-related breathing disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) can also lead to impaired sleep. Some idiopathic RBD patients have been associated with a risk for developing neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. Therefore, early diagnosis of RBD may have significant clinical implications for neuroprotective strategies. Several studies have revealed an increased incidence of RLS in PD patients compared to the general population. The favorable responses to dopaminergic medications in treating both RLS and PD suggest shared pathophysiologies between the two diseases; however, neuroimaging studies of dopaminergic systems remain inconclusive. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of sleep disturbances in PD and the existing treatments.",

RBD can occur in the absence of other neurological conditions or in association with a neurodegenerative disorder. It is now we ll established that RBD is a strong predictor of neurodegeneration, in particular synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia (LBD), or multiple system atrophy. However, some longitudinal studies report that a minority of patients develop either overlapping form of dementia or Alzheimer disease's (AD). Although AD is reported as a possible development in patients with RBD, it is in a limited number of cases and there are concerns about the accuracy of the diagnostic criteria. Neuropsychological impairments identified in cross-sectional studies of RBD patients describe a profile similar to that observed in dementia related to synucleinopathies. However, only deficits in executive function predict the development of neurodegeneration. Longitudinal studies reported the development of AD in RBD patients in about 7% of cases with variability ranging from 3% and 11%. Since the majority of longitudinal investigations do not report AD as a possible development for RBD patients the proportion may be overestimated. The study of the relationship between RBD and AD may be confounded by two factors that lead to misdiagnosis: the use of clinical criteria alone and the overlap between the clinical features and neuropathology of AD and LBD. Future studies to investigate this association must use updated diagnostic criteria incorporating ancillary investigations.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a basic physiological need, and most of us spend about one third of our lives sleeping. Sleep architecture is composed of two basic types of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. NREM sleep can be further subdivided into stages , which make up different portions of the night that the individual spends sleeping. In contrast to children and adults, infants spend almost 50% of the time in REM sleep, and as much as 80% of sleep is spent in REM sleep in premature infants. Physiologically, humans are most vulnerable to changes in breathing during REM sleep, thus often classified as sleep related breathing disorders when there are associated disturbances in gas exchange. The primary sleep disorder associated with breathing abnormalities in REM sleep is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Different  names are used to describe the spectrum of this disorder and may include upper airway resistance syndrome, sleep apnea, obstructive apnea, sleep-disordered breathing, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome. The focus of the following discussion will be relevant to obstructive sleep apnea. This is arguably a very important disorder in sleep medicine, as it has many serious consequences for the affected individuals, including increased morbidity and mortality and for society in general as its impact affects performance, vigilance and optimal functioning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Parasomnias are disorders that may appear during sleep with and/or without dreams. To describe them we must take in account a subjective description by the patient and his relatives. Objective measurement of this phenomenology is made with Polysomnography, Electromyography and Holter EKG. Material and Methods: We searched the recent data about parasomnia in the Medline, Pubmed, Google academic databases as also in classic books and reviews. Results: The clinical picture is various from motor and neurological signs to autonomic signs as also sleep related hallucinations. There are more rare presentations with associated disorders due to excretion and involuntary urinary emission during sleep disorders. Parasomnias are often preceded by a traumatic event for the patient and his family members which can be a head trauma or an infection or an intoxication which can be accompanied by psycho vulnerable events. On the other part parasomnias can be themselves a preamble announcing neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson disease, Lewy Body Dementia or some synucleopathies. Conclusions: The fluctuations of neurotransmitters (Dopamine, Serotonine or Acetylcholine) due to specific neurologic pathology can lead to particular parasomnias, their evolution corresponding to each impairment. The knowledge of accompanying parasomnias of neurologic disorders like those from Parkinson disease helps manage diseases of neurological patients already known with Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases, leading to increased quality of life for these patients as a result of specialized intervention.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may present neuropsychiatric and conduct disorders at different stages of the development of the disease that make treatment even more difficult. Development The neurologist must be on the lookout for the possible appearance of alterations affecting impulse control, even from the early stages of the disease, so as to be able to prevent them or to plan a suitable adjustment of treatment. Some of the most common impulsivity disorders include hypersexuality, compulsive gambling and other addictive behaviours which, if left undetected and untreated, can end up having a destructive effect on the patient's socio-familial surroundings. Psychotic disorders (hallucinations, delusions) are often associated to advanced phases of PD and to the effect of dopamine therapy, and they are associated to a higher morbidity and mortality rate. Factors of a genetic or pharmacogenetic nature or a gene-environment interaction may account for the different individual susceptibility to disorders in the neuropsychiatric realm among patients with PD. It is wise to bear in mind the possible medico-legal implications that may stem from behavioral disorders, both for the patient and his or her family and for the physician, because situations could arise that trigger conflicts between confidentiality and preventing third parties from being harmed, as well as harm that can be attributed to the side effects of medicines. Conclusions The specialist must be familiar with, foresee and propose suitable treatment for behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders in PD with potential medico-legal implications.",

This complex motor pattern might be confused with a focal epileptic seizure. [1]: http://neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000002224",

      "abstract": "In the last decade we have witnessed substantial progress towards the understanding of Parkinson's disease. According to pathological and neuroimaging studies, the traditional view of Parkinson's disease that begins with the development of motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, has begun to change. It is now understood that there would be a \"premotor\" or \"preclinical\" period in which the alphasynuclein pathology begins outside of the substantia nigra in the lower brainstem and autonomic nervous system. Although the pathophysiology of this phase is still unclear, it is currently thought that its symptoms would correspond to the so-called \"non-motor symptoms\". Hyposmia, depression, constipation and REM sleep disorders are one of the most relevant non-motor symptoms at this \"premotor\" stage. The spectrum of non-motor symptoms is very broad and covers the domains of neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic, gastrointestinal and sensory symptoms as well as sleep disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, impulse control disorder, psychosis and dementia, are a major cause of disability as they are directly related to quality of life.",

Approximately 10% of the general population and 20% of primary care attendees suffer from severe insomnia. Clinical hallmarks of sleeplessness are the patients' complaints about insufficient and non-restorative sleep, severe daytime consequences without any tendency to fall asleep and presence of symptoms on three days per week for more than one month. Insomniacs tend to suffer from psycho-physiologic hyperarousal that prevents physical and mental relaxation. They are more susceptible to stress and seem to have a high sympathetic drive. Insomnia therefore has been compared to chronic caffeine intoxication. It must he pointed out that insomnia is probably more a qualitative rather than a quantitative disorder of sleep. Neither doctors nor patients routinely talk about disturbed sleep during consultations which might he one reason why insomnia very often goes undiagnosed. Consequently, physicians should routinely inquire afoul their patients' sleep and sleeping habits and take, if appropriate, a full sleep history on the basis of which further investigational and therapeutic steps can be planned: well-established tools of proved efficacy are available to treat both primary and secondary insomnia. Acute or transient insomnia lasting less than four weeks can he treated with hypnotics. Chronic insomnia is the domain of nonpharmacological psychotherapy, which can be conducted in a single or group setting.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The cardiorespiratory control system undergoes functional maturation after birth. Until this process is completed, the cardiorespiratory system is unstable, placing infants at risk for cardiorespiratory disturbances, especially during sleep. The profound influence of states of alertness on respiratory and cardiac control has been the focus of intense scrutiny during the last decade. The effects of rapid‐eye movement (REM) sleep on various mechanisms involved in cardiorespiratory control are of particular significance during the postnatal period since newborns spend much of their time in this sleep state. In fullterm newborns, REM sleep occupies more than 50% of total sleep time, and this percentage is even greater in preterm newborns. From term to six months of age, the proportion of REM sleep decreases. 2 Since respiratory and cardiac disturbances are known to occur selectively during REM sleep, the predominance of REM sleep may be a risk factor for abnormal sleep‐related events during early infancy. 3 Awareness of these developmental changes in sleep patterns is important for clinicians dealing with problems such as apparent life‐threatening events (ALTE), sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and/or cardiorespiratory responses to respiratory disorders. Our current understanding of respiratory and cardiac control rests mainly on studies conducted during the first months of life. There is a paucity of data on late infancy and early childhood. The present paper will review available data on how sleep affects 1) ventilatory mechanics, in particular of the upper airways and the chest wall; ventilation and apnea; gas exchange; chemoreceptor function; and arousal responses; 2) changes in heart rate and heart rate variability, and the occurrence and mechanisms of bradycardia. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Sleep, Depression and Insomniac Complaints It has been known for long that depressive disorders are almost always accompanied by disturbances of sleep. Neurobiologically oriented sleep research was able to demonstrate that besides unspecific changes of sleep continuity (prolonged sleep onset latency, increased number of waking periods and early morning awakening) there are also specific changes of sleep, like a reduction of slow-wave sleep and a disinhibition of REM sleep in depression. Disinhibition of REM sleep includes phenomena like a shortening of REM latency (i.e. the time between sleep onset and the occurrence of the first REM period) and intensified REM sleep especially at the beginning of the night with an increased REM density (increased frequency of eye movements during REM sleep). These changes have been interpreted within the framework of an animal model of NREM and REM sleep called the reciprocal interaction model. This model postulates that the early occurrence of REM sleep in depression is based on a central nervous imbalance between cholinergic and aminergic neurotransmission. Besides baseline findings of sleep in depression there are other data suggesting a prominent role of sleep and REM sleep regulation for depression. Almost all antidepressants suppress REM sleep, there is a specific therapeutic effect of sleep deprivation in depression and a close link between the occurrence of insomniac symptoms and depression. In this context, it is also worthwhile mentioning that specific cognitive behavioral interventions for insomniac symptoms, such as sleep hygiene, sleep-wake rhythm structuring and cognitive techniques to reduce nocturnal rumination are very effective in the treatment of insomnia. It is also hypothesized that these techniques may serve as a preventive strategy for ensuing depressive disorders.",

All forms of sensory responses are markedly decreased to varying degrees depending on the sleep cycle stage. Although this phenomenon is observed in all species that have been studied and occupies a significant fraction of the human lifespan, the purpose and function of sleep remain poorly understood.Sleep is measured primarily by polysomnography (PSG) which is considered the gold standard for diagnosing sleep disorders.. PSG reveals that sleep architecture has several distinct stages that vacillate between the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages and rapid eye movement (REM) stages. The REM stage is of particular interest due to its association with various pathological, psychological, and physiological phenomena. The wide variety of medical and psychiatric pathologies, as well as common pharmacotherapies that can disrupt normal sleep, are summarized in this article. With more than 50 million Americans affected by sleep loss, the treatment of sleep disorders is becoming an increasingly more specialized and interprofessional field with a significant impact on patient health in both acute and chronic settings.",

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

There are changes in sleep patterns that are normal with ageing but many changes are the sign of disordered sleep. Sleep can be divided into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM). Each has unique characteristics that are differentiated by their waveforms on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and by other physiological signals; several physiological age-related changes are thought to produce alterations in circadian rhythms. While there are numerous psychological and social factors contributing to quality and quantity of sleep, specific sleep disorders more prevalent in old age are insomnia, sleep apnea, and rapid eye movement disorder. Non-pharmacological treatment is effective in management of sleep disorders. Cognitive behaviour therapy is most effective to tackle insomnia. Cognitive behavior therapy along with meditation is beneficial for other sleep disorders and a new technique is also emerging: mindfulness.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia typically associated with synucleinopathy and evolving to neurodegenerative disorders. RBD is caused by impairment of brainstem nuclei controlling REM sleep muscle atonia. Rarely, focal lesions of the brainstem can cause secondary RBD. We present the case of a 74-year-old patient, previously evaluated at age 70 years for insomnia and periodic limb movements during sleep, who then rapidly developed unpleasant dreams with minor motor behavior, affecting his sleep quality. Polysomnography recorded REM sleep without atonia and motor behaviors in REM sleep. Ischemic lesions in the pons were detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical, biological, and instrumental biomarkers of neurodegeneration were repeatedly negative at 2 years' follow-up. Although rare, a lesional cause of RBD must be considered in cases of atypical presentation and without evidence of neurodegeneration. The complaint of unpleasant dreams suggests a possible role of brainstem nuclei controlling REM sleep atonia in affecting oneiric content.Biscarini F, Montini A, Antelmi E, Vandi S, Pizza F, Plazzi G.

      "title": "Sleepwalking and night terrors: Psychopathological and psychophysiological correlates",
      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors are considered to be manifestations of the same nosologic continuum. It has been proposed that a sudden arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is the cause of these disorders. Benign forms of NREM arousal parasomnias occur frequently in childhood and attenuate in teen years; however, they can persist into or begin in adulthood. The available literature documents high levels of psychopathology in adult patients. Sleepwalking and night terrors are most likely to manifest during the first episode of slow wave sleep, but may also appear any time during NREM sleep. The hypersynchronous delta activity, previously considered to be a hallmark of somnambulism, has proven to be unspecific. Post-arousal EEG activity reveals altered consciousness during sleepwalking and sleep terror episodes. Pathophysiology of NREM arousal parasomnias consists of predisposing factors, which may be a genetically determined tendency for deep sleep, facilitating factors which deepen sleep and increase slow wave sleep, and triggering factors which increase sleep fragmentation, such as stress, environmental or endogenous stimuli, and stimulants. Recently published data on low delta power in the first sleep cycle and slow decline of delta power in successive sleep cycles suggest a chronic inability to sustain slow wave sleep.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is usually characterized by motor symptoms including bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by lack of muscle atonia during REM sleep and enactment of dream content. RBD is closely associated with PD. The pathophysiological mechanisms of PD with RBD may be related to defects of nigrostriatal dopamine and locus coeruleus/sub-locus coeruleus complex in brainstem. RBD has high incidence in PD patients, mainly presented with more severe non-motor symptoms, and more prominent life ability and life quality damage. Injury prevention should be given to PD patients with RBD besides positive intervention of PD.

The sleep forensics expert must have an up-to-date understanding of current sleep science and research, diagnostic and clinical techniques, and the legal requirements of expert testimony and scientific evidence. Sleepwalking and related disorders typically follow sudden, partial awakenings from deep sleep. Higher-level cognition is severely limited or absent, and complex behaviors often consist of “automatic” behaviors not initiated or guided by memory or planning. Sleepwalking and related disorders are noted to occur during deep sleep and often require a genetic predisposition or priming factors. Prior cases of sleepwalking violence find that the victim of sleepwalking violence—most often a family member—seeks out the sleepwalker. The history of sleepwalking includes reports of episodes and sometimes criminal court cases of murder, assault, and rape.",

The most common sleep disorders in schizophrenia are insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm disorders. The relevance of insomnia should be emphasized, as it can be a prodromal signof schizophrenia, as well as an alarm sign of an incipient psychotic decompensation. Additionally, the clinical recovery of a psychotic process is usually correlated with sleep normalization. Multiple polysomnographic disturbances on sleep architecture have been found in patients with schizophrenia, including increased sleep latency, awakenings during sleep, sleep-wake cycle inversion, as well as poor sleep efficiency. These objective disturbances have been correlated to subjective poor sleep quality and other main clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "title": "Physiological and psychological factors in sleep-onset insomnia.",
      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

      "title": "Sleeping through the Ages: An Examination of Sleep in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "It is widely recognized that sleep disorders (SD) are highly prevalent, despite being under diagnosed and under treated in practice. SDs occurs at all ages, although presentation and subsequent consequences for an individual's health varies throughout the lifespan. Currently, evaluation of SDs are inadequate across all age ranges, and for both sexes, as they are compromised by under reporting and relying on self-report, rather than professional sleep studies (i.e., nocturnal polysomnography (NPS) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT)). Moreover, there is a paucity of data specific to the elderly; many older individuals report dissatisfaction with quality of sleep. Indeed, literature has shown that geriatric populations spend less time in slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and have more difficulties maintaining sleep. Their dissatisfaction may occur from changes in sleep architecture associated with the aging process; however, it has been suggested that it largely stems from comorbid illness, social problems, hormonal effects, altered circadian rhythms, or side effects of medications that are common in the elderly. Further, geriatric sleep is related to depression, impaired health and functioning, and weaker/ less synchronized circadian rhythms. In response, we utilized a 111-item questionnaire in conjunction with NPS, MSLT, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and medical chart reviews of individuals referred for SD evaluation to compare sleep in geriatrics with adults. Analysis revealed numerous differences between adult and geriatric groups, with the elderly experiencing more SDs, longer sleep latencies, and fewer sleep complaints. Based on the outcomes of this investigation, we posit further consideration to SDs across the age groups to achieve the best health care and quality of life for all.",

The misalignment between the internal circadian timing system and the external environment is typically due to either an alteration in the functioning of the circadian timing system (e.g., delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome) or to changes in the external environment (e.g., jet lag). However, the clinical presentation of most of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is influenced by a combination of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. These disorders lead to complaints of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with impairment in important areas of functioning and quality of life. Current treatments primarily involve the use of circadian synchronizing agents, such as light, to realign the internal and external environment. These treatments are limited by the availability of adequate diagnostic tools and well-controlled clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders is required to develop more effective treatments.",

      "title": "1204 Importance of Arm Electromyography for REM Without Atonia Detection",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Dream enactment raises concern for rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). RBD is a parasomnia during which the patient has loss of normal atonia during REM sleep. RBD is highly associated with α-synucleinopathies (i.e., Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy) and can precede additional neurodegenerative signs and symptoms. REM sleep without atonia (RWA) is demonstrated through electromyography (EMG) during polysomnography. RWA requires the presence of tonic/sustained activity with ≥50% of the epoch containing excessive chin activity or phasic/transient muscle activity in ≥5 mini-epochs of 3-second duration in a 30-second epoch. We present a case that highlights the necessity of ordering polysomnography with arm EMG when evaluating for RBD. Report of case(s) A 73-year-old man presented to the clinic for concern of obstructive sleep apnea. He was also evaluated by neurology and given a diagnosis of essential tremor. During the initial visit, he also reported frequent “night terrors,” which he later described as dream enactment. His medications included metoprolol but no antidepressants; however, the dream enactment started prior to beta-blocker use. His physical exam was notable for right cogwheel rigidity, mild decrease in right serial finger tapping and rapid alternating movements, and mild dysphonia. A polysomnogram with arm EMG was ordered. On polysomnography, RWA was present in multiple epochs that was seen predominantly with arm (flexor digitorum superficialis) EMG. The RWA index (% of REM sleep meeting criteria for RWA) using the leg (anterior tibialis) and chin EMG was only 5%; however, the RWA index with the addition of arm EMG increased the RWA index to 64%. Conclusion The presence of RWA on PSG with dream enactment behavior gives this patient the diagnosis of RBD. While leg EMG is a part of routine PSG, arm EMG is not and needs to be specifically requested. Although research supports the use of arm EMG leads, we commonly find the addition of arm EMG leads is not ordered by providers when assessing for RBD. Arm EMG increases the chance of observing RWA and can be of strong importance to solidify an RBD diagnosis. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are central features of many movement disorders, exacerbating motor and non-motor symptoms and impairing quality of life. Understanding these disturbances to sleep is clinically important and may further our understanding of the underlying movement disorder. This review evaluates the current anatomical and neurochemical understanding of normal sleep and the recognised primary sleep disorders. In addition, we undertook a systematic review of the evidence for disruption to sleep across multiple movement disorders. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has emerged as the most reliable prodromal biomarker for the alpha synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, often preceding motor symptom onset by several years. Abnormal sleep has also been described for many other movement disorders, but further evidence is needed to determine whether this is a primary or secondary phenotypic component of the underlying condition. Medication used in the treatment of motor symptoms also affects sleep and can aggravate or cause certain sleep disorders. Within the context of movement disorders, there is also some suggestion of a shared underlying mechanism for motor and sleep pathophysiology, with evidence implicating thalamic and brainstem structures and monoaminergic neurotransmission. This review highlights the need for an understanding of normal and abnormal sleep within the movement disorder clinic, an ability to screen for specific causes of poor sleep and to treat sleep disturbance to improve quality of life. Key sleep disorders also act as important biomarkers and have implications in diagnosis, prognosis and the development of future therapies.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years.

In the waking state, these muscles generally respond to loud sound (middle ear reflex). Middle ear muscle activity typically erupts before or at the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and persists throughout the REM period in a discontinuous pattern resembling that exhibited by rapid eye movements. Approximately 80 percent of all nocturnal middle ear muscle activity is contained in REM sleep. Half of the remaining 20 percent occurs in the 10-minute intervals just prior to the onset of REM sleep. Middle ear muscle activity is often associated with other phasic events such as momentary enhancement of electromyogram inhibition, apnea, and K complexes. Rapid eye movements and middle ear muscle activity, though significantly correlated in REM sleep, are not always simultaneous.",

      "abstract": "Recurrent lucid dreaming is unusual and may be associated with an underlying sleep disorder. These are clear, emotionally pleasant dreams where the person is aware they are dreaming and capable of controlling content. They are usually initiated from REM sleep, but without loss of atonia. However, pathologic lucid dreams are associated with negative content and can result in sleep disruption with excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue. The etiology is unknown and we present a case of pathologic lucid dreams occurring after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. A 58-year-old man presents with complaints of sleep fragmentation beginning 15 years earlier since he was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. He experienced lucid dreaming since young adulthood without negative symptoms. Since his fibromyalgia, he complains of frequent purposeful awakening from his dreams due to unpleasant content and difficulty controlling them. He now feels as if he is awake throughout the night and has excess daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography showed increased REM and absent slow wave sleep without obstructive sleep apnea, REM behavior disorder or abnormal movements, or seizures. Treatment for fibromyalgia included various opiates, antidepressants, and pregabalin without improvement in sleep. We initiated prazosin and very low dose methadone, which resulted in improvement sleep fragmentation, tolerance to dream content, and frequency of dreams. Additionally, he had improved daytime function, decreased pain and daytime sleepiness. Lucid dreams are unusual, but are considered normal. However, pathologic lucid dreams are abnormal. The etiology and prevalence are unknown. Patients may be misdiagnosed with nightmares or hypersomnia with possible narcolepsy. Because he responded to prazosin and methadone treatment, we hypothesize that increased hypersensitivity of the monoaminergic system secondary to uncontrolled fibromyalgia may have been the reason behind these pathologic lucid dreams.",

Delta or slow wave sleep is characterized by high voltage, slow waves. The increasing presence of large delta waves indicates the onset of delta sleep. Waking the sleeper is most difficult at this time; hence, delta sleep is considered the deepest stage of sleep. The physiology of the body during rapid eye movement (REM) is quite different from that during non- REM (NREM). The stages of sleep in the average young adult show a fairly regular cyclic alteration. Environmental influences such as daylight, traffic noises, and the activity of other people tend to make prolonged sleep more difficult.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

Sleep architecture is normal and there are no significant changes in REM sleep measures.

Regarding generalized anxiety disorder, the patients complain of 'trouble sleeping' in 60-70%, while polysomnography has shown increased sleep latency and decreased sleep continuity measures. The findings in REM sleep and sleep architecture generally do not show any aberration to exist. In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), results from the sleep laboratory do not seem to support the subjective complaints of poor sleep. The early reports of shortened REM latency in OCD could not be replicated by recent studies. A dysregulation of the REM sleep control system has been reported for patients with PTSD.

      "title": "Circadian aspects in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia",
      "abstract": "Summary Because the endogenous circadian pacemaker is a very strong determinant of alertness/sleep propensity across the 24 h period, its mistiming may contribute to symptoms of insomnia (e.g., difficulties initiating sleep and maintaining sleep) and to the development of insomnia disorder. Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co‐morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.",

NPD is characterized by sudden arousal followed by motor agitation with dystonic posturing, and semipurposeful activity recurring several times per night. When short-lasting, NPD may respond favorably to carbamazepine. ENWs are unusual episodes of ambulation, with unintelligible speech, screaming, and complex, often violent, behavior that responds to anticonvulsants. In both short-lasting NPD and ENWs, electroencephalography may show some evidence of epilepsy; NPD is clinically similar to the frontal lobe seizures that arise mesially or in depth. Paroxysmal arousals (PAs) are even shorter episodes of arousal or awakening during nonrapid eye movement sleep, associated with transient dystonic posturing and related to the short-lasting NPD. PAs, short-lasting NPD, and ENWs probably represent a spectrum of peculiar sleep-related epileptic seizures.",

We report a man with PD who developed an unusual, severe, repetitive behavior characterized by spending most of his time on his computer; this abnormal behavior was concomitant with the introduction of L-dopa (400 mg per day) and was not associated to a pattern of chronic inappropriate overuse of dopaminergic medication or other psychiatric symptoms.

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy and sleep apnoea are the commonest causes of persistent daytime sleepiness. There are approximately 20 000 people with narcolepsy in the United Kingdom, 100 000 in the United States. The diagnosis of narcoleptic syndrome is established by the history of recurrent daily short sleep attacks in combination with cataplexy, brief episodes of loss of muscle tone and paralysis. Narcolepsy often results from monotony, and cataplexy is usually due to a sudden increase in alertness, with laughter or surprise. About one-half of all subjects also have sleep paralysis, and many describe vivid dreams at sleep onset, or even during wakefulness. In classic cases, the diagnosis is obvious from the history, and also from the finding of at least two sleep-onset REM periods during a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The MSLT gives an index of daytime drowsiness, with measurement of the time of sleep onset at 2-h intervals on five occasions throughout the day.",

Parasomnias can occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) stages of sleep and are more commonly seen in children than the adult population. Parasomnias can be distressful for the patient and their bed partners and most of the time, these complaints are brought up by their bed partners because of the possible disruption in their quality of sleep. As clinicians, it is crucial to understand the characteristics of various parasomnias and address them with detailed sleep history and essential diagnostic approach for proper evaluation. The review aims to highlight the epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical features of various types of parasomnias along with the appropriate diagnostic and pharmacological approach.",

      "title": "Daytime Sleepiness and Sleep Attacks in Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of disturbed sleep in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) approaches 100% (1). Sleep abnormalities include decrements in total sleep time, sleep spindling, stages 3 and 4 slow-wave sleep, and rapid eye-movement (REM)-sleep accompanied by sleep fragmentation and poor sleep efficiency (2,3). As primary sleep disorders, which interfere similarly with sleep, are associated with pathological levels of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), EDS might be expected to be relatively commonplace in PD. Suprisingly, EDS in PD has received little prior attention. Only quite recently has subjective (4,5) and objective (6–8) documentation of EDS and intrusion of REM-sleep into daytime naps in PD rekindled interest and a decades-long debate as to whether dopamine (DA) participates in behavioral state control, and if it does, what its role(s) might be. Current heuristic models of behavioral state control have restricted themselves to prominent roles for acetylcholine and other monoamines (e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine). Exclusion of DA from these models derives largely from an inability to reconcile acknowledged influences of exogenous DA upon behavioral state with reported invariability of endogeneous DA activity across unique behavioral states. Lacking a comprehensive conceptual framework that incorporates DA in a sleep—wake state or circadian rhythm modulation, clinical recognition of thalamocortical arousal impairments in PD has been met with surprise and no single parsimonious explanation. It has become increasingly clear, however, that wake (i.e., a thalamocortical-aroused state characterized by electroencephalography [EEG] desynchronization) is strongly influenced by DA (9–11).",

Movements typical of the wake pattern were seen occasionally during unequivocal sleep in all but two completed studies, and in each condition reappeared under similar circumstances. The movements were most likely to occur after awakenings or lightenings of sleep, or in stage one sleep. The movements were very rare during the deeper phases of sleep. Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves. The control group showed normal \"semipurposeful\" movements under the same conditions during sleep. The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway.",

Moreover, in certain conditions, additional parameters may be included such as esophageal pH monitoring, esophageal manometry , and overnight blood pressure monitoring. The test is usually performed at a sleep disorders unit within a hospital or at a sleep disorders centre. Sleep architecture is largely divided into non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM is further divided into three stages: N1, N2, and N3 : N3 being the deepest stage of sleep. REM sleep alternates with NREM sleep and a normal person usually has 4–6 cycles of REM and NREM sleep .

Recent findings Insomnia, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are commonly reported in essential tremor, Wilson's disease, tics or Tourette's syndrome, and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have been observed in Wilson's disease and SCA. A combination of REM and non-REM parasomnias, along with nocturnal stridor with the initiation of sleep and re-entering after awakening, are characterized by undifferentiated Non-REM and poorly structured N2 in anti-IgLON5 disease. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has been reported commonly in SCAs. Sleep-related dyskinesia has been reported in ADCY5-related disease and GNAO1-related movement disorder. Summary Sleep problems can manifest as a result of movement disorders, either through direct motor disturbances or secondary nonmotor symptoms. Medication effects must be considered, as certain medications for movement disorders can exacerbate or alleviate sleep disturbances. Distinguishing sleep problems in some diseases might involve pathognomonic symptoms and signs, aiding in the diagnosis of movement disorders.",

RBD occurs in approximately 0.5% of the general population, with a higher prevalence in older men. RBD is a frequent feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), but is only rarely reported in Alzheimer's disease. RBD is also a risk factor for α-synuclein-related diseases, such as DLB, Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy. Therefore, RBD has major implications for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and for understanding specific neurodegeneration patterns. Several markers of neurodegeneration have been identified in RBD, including cognitive impairments such as deficits in attention, executive functions, learning capacities, and visuospatial abilities. Approximately 50% of RBD patients present mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, RBD is also associated with cognitive decline in PD.",

      "title": "A PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY OF NIGHTMARES AND NIGHT TERRORS",
      "abstract": "Anxious arousals originate from all sleep stages and can be classified as: a) stage 4 night terrors; b) rapid eye movement (REM) nightmares; c) stage 2 awakenings; and d) hypnagogic nightmares. We have confirmed Broughton's finding that the night terror, the most severe type of episode, does not occur in sleep but as part of the \"arousal response,\" a complex of autonomic discharge and behavioral symptoms. The full blown night terror is a fight-flight episode combining sleep utterances, sleep walking and hallucinated or delusional mental content associated with terror. There is a significant positive correlation between intensity of night terror and the amount of delta sleep preceding arousal, e.g., stage 4 arousals designated as night terrors are preceded by longer periods of stage 4 than arousals of lesser intensity (p <.05). About two-thirds of both stage 4 and night terrors occurs in the first non-REM (NREM) period. The night terror arises out of physiologically quiescent sleep as indicated by the normal or slightly less them normal cardiorespiratory rates during the first NREM period and absence of skin resistance changes prior to the attack. The night terror is ushered in by sudden loud piercing screams, the subject passing into an aroused state characterized by alpha rhythm, motility, often somnambulism, intense autonomic discharge (precipitous doubling or even tripling of heart rate, great increase in respiratory amplitude, marked decrease in skin resistance), brief duration (1 to 3 minutes), varying degrees of amnesia for the episode, and rapid return to sleep. The night terror is a much more severe phenomenon than the REM nightmare although the latter is far more frequent. The nightmare occurs in REM sleep, is characterized by slight autonomic fluctuations, compared to the night terror, and, in half of instances, a \"desomatization\" of the anxiety response, that is, absence of its physiological concomitants. The REM state is physiologically activated to begin with, constituting a preparation for fright, possibly a buffer against the extreme terror of the stage 4 variety. The important problem of the triggering mechanisms of the night terror remains unsolved: whether the attack is precipitated by ongoing mental content during delta sleep, or represents a psychosomatic \"arousal response\" (Broughton). The fact that it can be induced artificially by sounding a buzzer speaks in favor of the latter, the finding of significant mental content in favor of the former. The night terror is not a dream but a symptom emerging from stage 3-4 sleep, associated with a rift in the ego's capacity to control anxiety.",

Several studies have confirmed that idiopathic RBD may precede with several years the onset of the specific motor characteristics of PD. The high prevalence of RBD in PD (19‑70%) may be explained by several common pathophysiological pathways, mainly related to the dopaminergic cell loss. RBD is also associated with several comorbidities, including cognitive impairment, hallucinations, dysautonomia, or daytime sleepiness. The gold standard investigation for the diagnosis and assessment of RBD is video polysomnography, but in clinical practice, the use of clinical scales and questionnaires is reasonable for the screening of this complex parasomnia.

The disorders that are often observed during the night in PD include sleep fragmentation that may be due to recurrent PD symptoms, sleep apnea, Restless Leg Syndrome/periodic limb movements and REM sleep behavior disorder. Excessive daytime sleepiness is also a common occurrence in PD. EDS can arise from several etiologies, and patients may have more than one etiology responsible. The causes of EDS include nocturnal sleep disorder with sleep deprivation and resulting daytime somnolence, the effect of drugs used to treat PD, and possibly neurodegeneration of central sleep/wake areas. Appropriate diagnosis of the sleep disturbance affecting a PD patient can lead to specific treatments that can consolidate nocturnal sleep and enhance daytime alertness.",

      "title": "Chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is commonly defined as the subjective report of difficulty in initially falling asleep, difficulty in maintaining sleep (long or multiple awakenings during the sleep period), or awakening too early with the inability to go back to sleep. In recent years,1 a diagnosis of insomnia has also included a report of decreased daytime function associated with the poor sleep at night to differentiate a patient with insomnia from an individual who simply requires less sleep. Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

      "abstract": "A doenca de Parkinson (DP) e uma desordem neurodegenerativa e progressiva com espectro clinico variado. Alem dos sintomas motores classicos tambem podem surgir complicacoes nao-motoras, destacando-se ai problemas cognitivos, psiquiatricos e autonomicos. Evidencias demonstram que tais sintomas nao-motores frequentemente precedem o aparecimento dos sinais motores e sao extremamente relevantes, dado o impacto negativo que causam na qualidade de vida dos individuos. Os sintomas nao-motores podem apresentar multiplas causas, dentre as quais uma possivel disfuncao do sistema circadiano. Dessa forma, diversos processos fisiologicos influenciados pelo sistema de temporizacao circadiano (STC), como o ciclo sono/vigilia podem se mostrar alterados em pacientes acometidos pela DP. O STC e responsavel pela geracao e manutencao dos ritmos circadianos, que sao oscilacoes endogenas manifestadas pelos seres vivos em diversos processos fisiologicos e comportamentais, com periodo em torno de 24 horas. Assim, e fundamental a compreensao dos efeitos da progressao do processo patogenico da DP sobre o perfil circadiano do ciclo sono/vigilia e tambem de componentes do STC, em particular no nucleo supraquiasmatico (NSQ), o principal marcapasso do sistema. No presente estudo, ratos wistar jovens (6 meses) e de meia-idade (10 meses) foram submetidos a um modelo animal cronico de DP com administracao de reserpina durante 20 dias. Ao longo do tratamento foram realizadas analises comportamentais do sono, bem como a avaliacao motora dos animais. Apos o fim do tratamento, foram realizadas analises imunoistoquimicas no NSQ dos animais. Nossos resultados mostraram que o tratamento cronico com reserpina promoveu comprometimento motor progressivo tanto nos animais jovens quanto nos de meia-idade. Alem disso, as analises comportamentais revelaram perturbacoes no ciclo sono/vigilia dos animais tratados em comparacao aos individuos controle, incluindo avanco na fase de sono e aumento na fragmentacao do sono. As analises imunistoquimicas nao permitiram observar efeitos significativos do tratamento com reserpina sobre a composicao neuroquimica do NSQ, contudo novos estudos sao necessarios para a avaliacao neuroquimica e morfometrica desse importante marcapasso circadiano na DP.",

Sleepwalking and sleep terrors can be triggered by stress, sleep deprivation, alcohol ingestion, and almost all sedative medications. This group of parasomnias is composed of three disorders occurring essentially during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Sleep paralysis is one of the main symptoms associated with narcolepsy, but it can also occur individually. REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by a loss of generalized skeletal muscle REM-related atonia and the presence of physical dreamenactment. Polysomnographic recordings of individuals with RBD showed a reduction of the tonic phenomena of REM sleep and the activation of the phasic phenomena. Parasomnias are frequent in the general population; more than 30% of individuals experiences at least one type of parasomnia. At the genetic level, there is growing evidence that many parasomnias have a genetic component.",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

Violent sleep-related behaviors have been reviewed in the context of automatic behavior in general, with many well-documented cases resulting from a wide variety of disorders. Conditions associated with sleep-period-related violence fall into two major categories: neurologic and psychiatric. Psychogenic dissociative disorders may arise exclusively or predominantly from the sleep period. Recent interest in the forensic aspects of parasomnias provides sleep medicine professionals with an opportunity to educate and assist the legal profession in cases of sleep-related violence.

In disorders of cortical hyperexcitability, including cortical myoclonus, an LLR occurring 40–60 ms after stimulation of the median nerve at rest may be present (“C-reflex.”) In response to noxious stimuli to the lower extremities, a polysynaptic network of spinal neurons, flexor reflex afferents, induce a patterned withdrawal response, including hip and knee flexion. These flexor reflexes may aid in the diagnosis of disorders of spinal cord hyperexcitability. Normally, following high stimulation of a peripheral nerve innervating a muscle that is being strongly contracted, no electrical activity occurs for approximately 100 ms (“silent period.”_ In disorders of distal peripheral nerve or muscle hyperexcitability, the silent period may be absent.",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Complaints about sleep are common in elderly adults. While changes in sleep architecture occur with normal aging, complaints about sleep are often related to pathological and treatable sleep disturbances. Primary sleep disturbances occurring in older adults include circadian rhythm disturbances, insomnia, sleep disordered breathing, rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and periodic limb movements in sleep. Particularly in older adults, sleep disturbances are likely to represent a multifactorial syndrome in which medical illness, psychiatric illness, and medications play a role. Sleep complaints necessitate the attention of the clinician as they are associated with poor outcomes. Because treatment strategies differ depending on the etiology of the sleep disturbance, a careful and systematic approach to diagnosis is crucial. This chapter reviews the normal changes in sleep that occur with age and sleep disorders frequently seen in older adults including in those with major neurocognitive disorders/dementia. Diagnosis and treatment strategies are discussed.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "title": "Age Related Changes in Sleep and Circadian Physiology: From Brain Mechanisms to Sleep Behavior",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sleep and circadian physiology change in healthy older adults independent of medical conditions or medications (1-3). In general, deep nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is reduced, there are more awakenings from sleep, and the time spent awake in bed trying to sleep is increased. Such sleep disruptions are exacerbated by age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease (4), cancer (5,6), nocturia (7), pain (4,8), diabetes (8,9), and depression (10,11). It is estimated that 40% to 70% of older adults experience chronic sleep problems, and that about 50% of the cases are untreated by primary care physicians (12). Sleep problems are even more common in geriatric patients with dementia (13,14). Aging with and without associated medical problems is also associated with changes in the physiology of the internal circadian timekeeping system that regulates near-24-hour rhythms in human physiology and behavior; and age-related changes in circadian physiology are thought to contribute to sleep problems (14-17). This chapter will first review sleep-wakefulness and circadian neurophysiology. Knowledge of the brain regions involved in promoting sleep and wakefulness states can provide perspective on how medications commonly used in the geriatric patient can affect daytime and nighttime function. This discussion will be followed by a review of how sleep and circadian brain regulatory systems change with aging. Knowledge of age-related changes in sleep and circadian systems may promote a better understanding of potential mechanisms underlying sleep problems in the geriatric patient and may help to inform the development of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Most sleep‐related seizures occur during non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly during stage changes. Sleep‐related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a rare epileptic syndrome characterized by paroxysmal motor seizures, mainly arising from NREM sleep. Here, we report a patient with SHE who had seven seizures captured on video‐EEG‐polysomnography during REM sleep. Ictal semiology of this patient ranged from brief paroxysmal arousals to hypermotor seizures. On EEG‐polysomnography, the spontaneous arousals were more frequent during REM than NREM sleep, with a considerably higher arousal index in REM sleep (20/hour). While the reason for seizures during REM sleep in this patient is unclear, we speculate that the threshold and mechanisms of arousal during different sleep stages may be related to the occurrence of seizures.

      "abstract": "About one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hallucinations, mostly of a complex visual type, less often auditory or tactile. Minor hallucinatory phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions are frequent. Hallucinations primarily occur in a context of clear sensorium in patients with longstanding PD. They are more frequent in the evening or during the night. Insight in the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon may be retained, partial, fluctuating, or abolished. An altered insight is common when cognitive impairment is present, and may be associated with delusions and (or) delusional misidentifications. Pharmacological factors such as dopaminergic treatment clearly trigger or increase the occurence of hallucinations in PD. However, in the recent years, emphasis has been made on disease-related factors including cognitive impairment, diurnal somnolence, visual disorders (either contrast and color discrimination impairment due to PD, or coincident ocular disorders), long duration of PD, late onset, severe axial impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of hallucinations of PD is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. The first steps of the treatment consist in giving information and reassurance to the patient and his/her caregiver, re-evaluating the antiparkinsonian treatment and associated medications, and evaluating the patient for mood disorder, visual impairment, and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors, when prescribed for associated cognitive impairment, may be beneficial on hallucinations. In the more severe forms, clozapine has been proved to be safe and effective.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterised by the loss of the normal atonia during the REM stage of sleep, resulting in overt motor behaviours that usually represent the enactment of dreams. Patients will seek medical attention due to sleep-related injuries or unpleasant dream content. Idiopathic RBD which occurs independently of any other disease occurs in up to 2% of the older population. Meanwhile, secondary RBD is very common in association with certain neurodegenerative conditions. RBD can also occur in the context of antidepressant use, obstructive sleep apnoea and narcolepsy. RBD can be diagnosed with a simple screening question followed by confirmation with polysomnography to exclude potential mimics. Treatment for RBD is effective and involves treatment of underlying causes, modification of the sleep environment, and pharmacotherapy with either clonazepam or melatonin. An important finding in the past decade is the recognition that almost all patients with idiopathic RBD will ultimately go on to develop Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies. This suggests that idiopathic RBD represents a prodromal phase of these conditions. Physicians should be aware of the risk of phenoconversion. They should educate idiopathic RBD patients to recognise the symptoms of these conditions and refer as appropriate for further testing and enrolment into research trials focused on neuroprotective measures.",

Disturbed sleep can result in fatigue, irritability, morning headaches, impaired motor and cognitive skills, depression, and daytime somnolence. The major sleep complaints include insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia, excessive nocturnal motor activity, circadian sleep–wake rhythm disturbance, and respiratory dysrhythmia. The pathogenetic mechanisms of sleep disturbances may be secondary to direct structural alteration of the sleep–wake generating neurons or from several other indirect mechanisms. At the biochemical level, neurodegenerative diseases may be largely classified as tauopathies, α-synucleinopathies, and other diseases. Overnight polysomnography (PSG), Multiple Sleep Latency Test, Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, and actigraphy are some important diagnostic laboratory tests in the evaluation of sleep disturbances. Management of sleep disturbances is complex and is based primarily on the nature of the sleep disturbance. The clinical profiles, pathogenetic mechanisms, PSG findings, and management issues are discussed here with reference to some common neurodegenerative diseases.",

Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and severe and irresistible episodes of daytime sleep. Narcolepsy is caused by a T cell-mediated destruction of hypocretin-synthetizing neurons located in the hypothalamus. Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis develop severe insomnia at disease onset, and many of them have hypersomnia after the acute stage of the disease or during clinical recovery. Patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis frequently develop REM sleep behaviour disorder. Patients with Morvan syndrome and CASPR2 antibodies present a sleep disorder called agrypnia excitata that consists of severe insomnia, motor and sympathetic hyperactivity, quasi-purposeful movements, and enacted dreams in the setting of loss of slow-wave sleep and circadian rhythmicity. Sleep alterations occur in >80% of patients with anti-IgLON5 disease; the most characteristic are sleep apnoeas and non-REM and REM parasomnias. Symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, sometimes with findings suggestive of narcolepsy, were reported in about 30% of patients with paraneoplastic anti-Ma2 encephalitis, and less frequently in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders associated with aquaporin 4 antibodies.",

Central nervous system hyperarousal, either as pre-existing and/or induced by psychiatric pathology and worsened by stressful events, as well as aging- and menopause-related physiological decline of sleep mechanisms appears to be at the core of this common sleep disorder. Finally, there is emerging evidence that the levels of physiologic hyperarousal are directly related to the degree of polysomnographically documented sleep disturbance in insomnia patients, suggesting that objective measures of sleep duration in insomnia may be a useful marker of the medical severity of the disorder.",

Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism.

      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

Parasomnias are the most frequently encountered non-epileptic paroxysmal events in sleep, which are related to both non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM-sleep parasomnias are otherwise referred to as arousal disorders. They could be mistaken for frontal lobe epilepsy seizures, which predominantly occur at night and are not readily accompanied by epileptiform abnormalities on EEG. Other sleep phenomena also should be considered in differentiating nocturnal epilepsies. Obstructive sleep apnea, periodic leg movements in sleep and some sleep episodes sometimes are expressed with a pattern hardly distinguishable from epileptic seizures.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders can be broadly classified into: (a) insomnia, (b) parasomnia, (c) sleep disorders associated with psychiatric, neurologic and other medical disorders, and (d) proposed sleep disorders (e.g. pregnancy and menstrual related sleep disorders).1 Insomnia is a common encounter in primary care consultations2 and constitutes the commonest sleep problem3,4 that presents to the general practitioner. Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

During sleep, most patients with Parkinson's disease also exhibit the movements characteristically seen during the wake period. Movement activity during sleep may impair sleep quality and lead to daytime sleepiness and reduced quality of life. Disordered REM sleep with enhanced muscle tone is common in patients with neurodegenerative disease, and may precede the clinically evident symptoms of Parkinson's disease by years. Sleep disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease are common, and require the application of individual treatment strategies. A further frequent disorder primarily classified as a sleep disorder (dyssomnia) is the restless legs syndrome (RLS), which is closely related to the nocturnal periodic limb movement disorder and affects up to 15% of the population. The present review focuses on nocturnal motor activity and sleep in Parkinson's disease and RLS.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a very integral part of our functioning with normal adults sleeping for about 1/3rd of their lives. Sleep disorders are a group of conditions that alter the ability of a person to get appropriate sleep which can alter the day-to-day functioning. In the present day and age sleep disorders irrespective of the reason the growth in the sleep disorders is alarming. Although many people tend to experience sleep disturbances on an occasional basis owing to stressful life situations, alterations in job schedules, traveling, and many other external influences, but when these issues occur regularly and become an impedance in the day-to-day activities, it may be suggestive of a sleeping disorder. A deficiency of a good quality sleep can have overall undesirable consequences on the vitality, temperament, attentiveness, and well-being of an individual. Sleep difficulties are linked to both physical and emotional problems. Sleep problems can both contribute to and exacerbate existing mental problems as well as serve as an important indicator of other mental health conditions. While the various sleep problems may resolve on its own or eventually conclude after a successful course of therapy, in a few resistant cases the treatment normally involves a combination of medical treatments and lifestyle changes.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underlying SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprived of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which result in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases maternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.",

The treatment of sleep apnea syndrome is particularly important in managing patients with cerebral infarction of whom 50-80% have moderate to severe sleep apnea. Sleep apnea produces not only poor quality sleep but also excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue and lack of energy. Sleep problems frequently found in patients with dementia are sleep-wake cycle abnormality, fragmentation of sleep, nocturnal insomnia, decreased slow wave sleep and REM sleep, and sleep disordered breathing. The management of sleep disturbances is very important for controlling symptoms such as nocturnal wandering and sundowning syndrome in patients with dementia.

      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children9s sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child9s period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

After clinical evaluation and overnight, hospital-based video-polysomnography, the cause of the chronic injurious parasomnia was deemed to be a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep parasomnia comorbid with severe obstructive sleep apnea. Therapy with bedtime clonazepam and bilevel positive airway pressure was effective, with injurious parasomnia relapse occurring with cessation of either or both of these therapies. The differential diagnosis of sleep-related biting should now include NREM sleep parasomnia (with or without comorbid obstructive sleep apnea), besides previously reported cases of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sleep-related dissociative disorder, sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder and anticipated cases of parasomnia overlap disorder (RBD + NREM sleep parasomnia), sleep-related biting seizures, and sleep-related eating disorder.",

      "title": "Sleep-disordered Breathing in Neuromuscular Disease",
      "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases is due to an exaggerated reduction in lung volumes during supine sleep, a compromised physiologic adaptation to sleep, and specific features of the diseases that may promote upper airway collapse or heart failure. The normal decrease in the rib cage contribution to the tidal volume during phasic REM sleep becomes a critical vulnerability, resulting in saw-tooth oxygen desaturation possibly representing the earliest manifestation of respiratory muscle weakness. Hypoventilation can occur in REM sleep and progress into non-REM sleep, with continuous desaturation and hypercarbia. Specific characteristics of neuromuscular disorders, such as pharyngeal neuropathy or weakness, macroglossia, bulbar manifestations, or low lung volumes, predispose patients to the development of obstructive events. Central sleep-disordered breathing can occur with associated cardiomyopathy (e.g., dystrophies) or from instability in the control of breathing due to diaphragm weakness. Mitigating factors such as recruitment of accessory respiratory muscles, reduction in REM sleep, and loss of normal REM atonia in some individuals may partially protect against sleep-disordered breathing. Noninvasive ventilation, a standard-of-care management option for sleep-disordered breathing, can itself trigger specific sleep-disordered breathing events including air leaks, patient-ventilator asynchrony, central sleep apnea, and glottic closure. These events increase arousals, reduce adherence, and impair sleep architecture. Polysomnography plays an important role in addressing pitfalls in the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases, identifying sleep-disordered breathing triggered by noninvasive ventilation, and optimizing noninvasive ventilation settings.",

      "title": "Parasomnias",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical and/or experiential phenomena accompanying sleep that involve skeletal muscle activity (movements, behaviours), autonomic nervous system changes, and/or emotional-perceptual events. Parasomnias can emerge during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from any stage of sleep; therefore, all of sleep carries a vulnerability for parasomnias. Parasomnias can be objectively diagnosed by means of polysomnography (i.e. the physiologic monitoring of sleep—figures 4.14.4.1, 4.14.4.2), and can be successfully treated in the majority of cases. Understanding of the parasomnias, based on polysomnographic documentation, has expanded greatly over the past two decades, as new disorders have been identified, and as known disorders have been recognized to occur more frequently, across a broader age group, and with more serious consequences than previously understood. Parasomnias demonstrate how our instinctual behaviours, such as locomotion, feeding, sex, and aggression, can be released during sleep, itself a basic instinct. There are at least eight reasons why parasomnias should be of interest and importance to psychiatrists: 1 Parasomnias can be misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated as a psychiatric disorder. 2 Parasomnias can be a direct manifestation of a psychiatric disorder, e.g. dissociative disorder, nocturnal bulimia nervosa. 3 The emergence and/or recurrence of a parasomnia can be triggered by stress. 4 Psychotropic medications can induce the initial emergence of a parasomnia, or aggravate a preexisting parasomnia. 5 Parasomnias can cause psychological distress or can induce or reactivate a psychiatric disorder in the patient or bed partner on account of repeated loss of self-control during sleep and sleep-related injuries. 6 Familiarity with the parasomnias will allow psychiatrists to be more fully aware of the various medical and neuro-logical disorders, and their therapies, that can be associated with disturbed (sleep-related) behaviour and disturbed dreaming. 7 Parasomnias present a special opportunity for interlinking animal basic science research (including parasomnia animal models) with human (sleep) behavioural disorders. 8 Parasomnias carry forensic implications, as exemplified by the newly-recognized entity of ‘Parasomnia Pseudo-suicide.’ Also, psychiatrists are often asked to render an expert opinion in medicolegal cases pertaining to sleep-related violence.",

When no neurologic disorder is obvious, RBD can be considered as idiopathic (iRBD). Several studies have looked at neurophysiologic and neuropsychological functions in iRBD and have found evidence of CNS dysfunc- tion during both wakefulness and sleep in a variable proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of iRBD. Identifying subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies. Some prospective results in iRBD showed that potential markers of neuro- degeneration are the following: 1) marked EEG slowing on spectral analysis; 2) decreased striatal 123I-FPCIT; 3) impaired color vision.",

Primary sleep disturbances are thought to be a disorder of hyperarousal, while a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction has also been confirmed. Secondary sleep disorders have been associated with a large number of potential causes, both physical and psychological.

      "abstract": "Background REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep, often associated with dream enactment behaviors, and is typically a prodromal neurodegenerative condition in middle-aged and older adults. However, emerging case reports and case series suggest that not all RBD presentations follow this trajectory, particularly in younger individuals. Case presentation A case of 7-year history of vivid, immersive dreaming perceived as continuous with waking life, accompanied by persistent dream-reality confusion, is described. The patient frequently engaged in reality-testing behaviors and reported significant cognitive fatigue. Video-polysomnography confirmed REM sleep without atonia and a concordant dream re-enactment episode. Neuropsychiatric evaluation ruled out dissociative or psychotic disorders, and no evidence of neurodegenerative disease was observed. Conclusion This presented case illustrates a potentially distinct, non-neurodegenerative REM parasomnia phenotype that underscores the need to expand current parasomnia classifications to better capture the diverse cognitive and metacognitive dimensions of REM sleep disorders. Moreover, potential mechanisms underlying the main features of this case, including immersive dreaming and persistent dream-reality confusion, are discussed in relation to hypothesized dysfunction in melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) signaling.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by: recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress; and compulsions, which are behaviours or mental acts aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation. Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction. Postnatal onset has been more associated with fears of deliberately harming the baby (for example, ‘I could touch my baby inappropriately’), associated with avoidance of …",

This condition is likely caused by heterogeneous inflammatory mechanisms (autoantibodies, complement activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production) involving the basal ganglia as evidenced by imaging studies (patients vs. controls), sleep studies that found movements and/or atonia during REM sleep, and neurological soft signs that go along with basal ganglia dysfunction. The condition causes significant psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, caregiver burden and sleep abnormalities. Autoantibodies resulting from molecular mimicry of infectious agents (namely group A Streptococcus) and neuronal autoantigens that map to the basal ganglia play also a subtle role. This narrative review aims to describe the key immunological features documented thus far and that likely play a role in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of this disorder.",

      "title": "Dysautonomias: Clinical Disorders of the Autonomic Nervous System",
      "abstract": "The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities. In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after “patchy” autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with β-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dysautonomias are an important subject in clinical neurocardiology.",

      "abstract": "Sleep represents a major frontier both in clinical myology and as a new possibility for delivering treatment to neuromuscular patients since various neuromuscular cases present a variable degree of disordered sleep and such conditions should be diagnosed and prevented, i.e., sleep apnea and hypoxemia. These sleep disorders are present in dystrophinopathies and in various types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD). Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is found in patients affected by spastic paraparesis or cerebellar ataxia but is rather common in both myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2, and the correction of sleep disorders is therefore important to improve their daily quality of life (QoL) and consequent daily functioning. Other types of sleep dysfunction such as insomnia, a reduction in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, loss of normal REM, or sleep-disordered breathing are found in other disorders including myasthenia, ataxias, spastic paraparesis, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and neurogenic disorders, including polyneuropathies, and need appropriate treatment. Research done on this topic aims to incorporate a variety of nuances in metabolic disorders such as those in late-onset Pompe disease and are such as those in late-onset Pompe disease who are susceptible to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The overarching goal is to explore both the diagnosis and methodology of sleep-related problems in both genetic and acquired neuromuscular disorders. We also review the type of available treatment opportunities utilized to improve neuromuscular patients’ QoL.",

Turgid painful erections (five to seven episodes of tumescence) during the sleep hours caused pain together with burning and tingling sensations in the penis and perineal zone during the daytime hours. Swelling of the pubic and perineal area was recurrent. Sleep loss, chronic fatigue, mild anxiety, lack of concentration and decreased work occurred along with this condition. Polysomnographic findings indicated REM sleep fragmentation. Attempts to treat this condition with muscle relaxants or anxiolytics did not prompt an improvement of this disorder, but a single daily dose of gabapentin 300 mg in combination with 1 mg clonazepam at bedtime improved total sleep time and reduced full sleep erections.",

According to the classical standards for sleep stage scoring, it is necessary to record the electroencephalogram, the electrooculogram and electromyogram while a comprehensive sleep laboratory assessment should use a recording of a great number of physiological parameters. Polysomnographic characteristics of the whole-night sleep are described and illustrated in this review. Sleep without rapid eye movements or nonREM sleep consists of four stages that form a continuum from superticial to deep sleep. Sleep with rapid eye movements or REM sleep is characterized by a low amplitude electroencephalographic (EEG) activity with mixed fast frequencies, muscle atonia and episodes of rapid eye movements. Main indications for polysomnography are various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias, circadian rhythm disorders, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, sleep apnea syndrome, parasomnia, forensic psychiatric cases related to sleep, depression, sleep-related epilepsies, periodic leg movements during sleep. Sleep medicine is a multidisciplinary field including many medical disciplines, from psychiatry and neurology to intern medicine and paediatrics, as well as other sciences (from biology and genetics to psychology).",

      "abstract": "Sleep and wake states involve interaction among many brain centers via multiple neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine, hypocretin, acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin (wake promoting), and γ amino butyric acid (GABA) and melatonin (sleep promoting). Most medications for insomnia or hypersomnia act on elements of these neural systems. Initial treatment of insomnia includes sleep hygiene measures. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is useful. Medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for insomnia act on GABA receptors or on melatonin receptors. A frequent cause of insomnia is restless legs syndrome, which is linked to reduced dopaminergic activity in brain structures; idiopathic restless legs syndrome is best treated with dopamine agonists such as ropinerole or pramipexole. Excessive daytime sleepiness is most often due to insufficient sleep hours or sleep apnea but is also caused by medications, illnesses, narcolepsy, or idiopathic hypersomnia. Stimulants generally act through enhanced dopamine action (amphetamines, methylphenidate) or acetylcholine action (caffeine). Modafinil may act through enhanced central histamine, hypocretin, and possibly dopamine action. A newer agent, γ -hydroxybutyrate (GHB), acts on GABA and GHB receptors to consolidate sleep, improving daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. Improving knowledge of sleep/wake mechanisms should lead to more specific and rational treatments for sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "The neurobehavioral deficits of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are often attributed to the rate of respiratory disturbance or rate of arousals during sleep. However, sleep disordered breathing is also associated with other changes in sleep infrastructure that may account for cumulative waking deficits. This was illustrated in polysomnographic data from 1,521 patients with OSAS where increasing arousal indices were associated with increased duration of stage 1 sleep and concomitant reduction in total sleep time. Similar results have been found in paradigms in which sleep was experimentally fragmented in healthy individuals. It appears that chronic fragmentation of sleep, whether by apneas or acoustic stimuli, leads to cumulative homeostatic pressure for sleep, which may explain a number of phenomenan characteristic of both untreated OSAS patients and experimentally fragmented sleepers: (1) increased arousal threshold, (2) rapid return to sleep after arousal, (3) fewer awakenings over time, (4) increased sleep inertia on awakenings, (5) increased amnesia for arousals, and (6) daytime sleepiness. Elevated homeostatic drive for sleep appears to be a function of both the frequency of arousals within a night and the chronicity of sleep fragmentation across nights, neither of which have been adequately modeled in experimental studies of healthy subjects.",

      "abstract": ". Istirahat dan tidur merupakan kebutuhan dasar yang dibutuhkan oleh semua\r\norang. Setiap orang memerlukan kebutuhan istirahat atau tidur yang cukup agar\r\ntubuh dapat berfungsi secara normal (Wicaksono, 2012). Tidur merupakan salah\r\nsatu fungsi biologis yang berperan penting dalam status kesehatan individu.\r\nSebagian individu mengalami masalah dengan tidurnya, dimana gangguan tidur\r\nyang sering terjadi salah satunya adalah insomnia (Putri dan Bayhakki, 2016).\r\nDi Indonesia, belum diketahui angka pastinya namun prevalensi pada orang\r\ndewasa mencapai 20% (Wicaksono, 2012). Insomnia merupakan keadaan tidak\r\ndapat tidur atau terganggunya pola tidur. Orang yang bersangkutan mungkin tidak\r\ndapat tidur, sukar untuk jatuh tidur, atau mudah terbangun dan kemudian tidak\r\ndapat tidur lagi. Insomnia umumnya merupakan kondisi sementara atau jangka\r\npendek. Dalam beberapa kasus, insomnia dapat menjadi kronis. Hal ini sering\r\ndisebut sebagai gangguan tidur yang paling sering terjadi yang berhubungan\r\ndengan situasional stres akut, seperti pekerjaan baru atau menjelang ujian.\r\nInsomnia ini biasanya hilang ketika stressor hilang atau individu telah beradaptasi\r\ndengan stressor. Namun, insomnia sementara sering berulang ketika tegangan\r\nbaru atau serupa muncul dalam kehidupan pasien (Kaplan dan Sadock, 2010).\r\nDalam TCM, insomnia yang diakibatkan sindrom hiperaktivitas Yang karena\r\ndefisiensi Yin disebabkan karena kebiasaan makan manis sehingga terjadi panas\r\npada lambung yang dapat mengganggu fungsi transformasi dan transportasi limpa.\r\nDisamping itu, insomnia juga disebabkan karena suka berpikir. Berpikir yang\r\nmelampaui batas mengakibatkan peredaran Qi terhalang dan fungsi transportasi\r\ndan transformasi Pi-limpa tidak berjalan dengan normal. Organ lambung yang\r\nekses dan organ limpa yang defisiensi (unsur tanah) tidak dapat membatasi organ\r\nginjal sehingga menyebabkan defisiensi Yin pada organ ginjal. Dengan adanya\r\ndefisiensi Yin ginjal menyebabkan Yin ginjal tidak dapat menguap ke atas untuk\r\nmembatasi Yang Qi jantung. Karena Yin ginjal tidak dapat membatasi Yang Qi\r\njantung menyebabkan terjadinya hiperaktivitas api jantung. Saat api jantung\r\nterganggu, Shen-jiwa ikut terganggu menyebabkan terjadinya insomnia.\r\nPenanganan yang dilakukan pada penderita insomnia yaitu terapi akupresur\r\ndan terapi herbal. Terapi akupresur dilakukan pada titik Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen\r\n(HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) dilakukan sebanyak 12 kali terapi yang diberikan\r\nsebanyak 3 kali dalam seminggu. Serta terapi herbal setiap hari selama 28 hari\r\ndengan menggunakan simplisia daun putri malu (Mimosa pudica) dengan dosis 10\r\ngram yang direbus dengan 750 mL air, diminum sehari 1 kali sebanyak 200 mL\r\nsebelum tidur.\r\nDari hasil setelah pemberian terapi kombinasi akupresur pada titik Neiguan\r\n(PC6), Shenmen (HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) serta pemberian herbal putri malu\r\n(Mimosa pudica) dapat memberikan hasil yang baik terhadap pasien dengan\r\nkeluhan insomnia. Pasien merasa lebih tenang, relaks, dan pasien merasa mudah\r\nmengantuk pada malam hari.",

In the latter case, the symptoms may be genuine side effects of drugs (hypotension, pathologic gambling, etc.) or they may be secondary either to the pathoplastic effect they have on the natural course of the disease (nonmotor fluctuations) or to the lack of dopamine (apathy, depression, dopamine withdrawal syndrome, etc.). In all these cases, dopaminergic treatment can be helpful. However, many other nonmotor (and motor) symptoms will have no correlation with dopamine; therefore, they require different treatments, very often with little efficacy, as in apathy or cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are undesirable behaviors that occur during sleep. Some of these events can be violent and result in injuries to self or others, and some may even result in disability or death. There are no predictors to determine if a parasomnia will result in violence; hence, it is importance to learn to identify parasomnias in general and intervene when necessary. A detailed patient history is required to identify parasomnias. Video polysomnography is the recommended test to use, and additional electromyogram leads can be added to identify movement and correlate events with sleep or wakefulness. The polysomnogram is also helpful to determine presence of obstructive sleep apnea, which is a known precipitating factor for parasomnias. Other precipitating and predisposing factors are fragmented sleep, deprivation of sleep, alcohol, medications, disorders of sleep (eg, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, narcolepsy), and environmental triggers such as sudden noise, flickering light, or bed partner's snoring. Violent parasomnias that result in harm can be adjudicated to criminal courts, where investigation attempts to determine the presence of consciousness in the patient during the episode, indicating intent.

Nevertheless, many parasomnia symptoms are considered as a transient deviation from the norm in otherwise normal subjects due to disrupted status of consciousness. Sleep states are classified as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep; similarly, parasomnias are classified as NREM-related parasomnias and REM-related parasomnias. NREM-related parasomnias share common pathophysiology of arousal-related phenomenon out of slow-wave sleep. Although listed as REM parasomnia disorders, nightmares and sleep paralysis are still considered comorbid symptoms or signs of other sleep disorders or mental disorders. Only REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is considered a relatively homogenous disease entity among all parasomnia diagnoses. Although RBD is the most newly added disorder entity in parasomnias, it is the most rigorously studied parasomnia such as RBD is strongly and clearly associated with concomitant or future developing neurodegenerative disease.

      "abstract": "Abstract α-synucleinopathies are a complex group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders with an increasingly recognized long prodromal period, during which sleep dysfunction is a hallmark. Sleep disorders during the prodromal synucleinopathy period, primarily isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and daytime hypersomnolence correlate best with the recently proposed “body-first” Lewy body disease progression. iRBD is the most widely recognized form of prodromal α-synucleinopathy, and patients with iRBD show abnormal α-synuclein in tissues and biofluids even in the absence of cognitive or motor symptoms. More importantly, individuals with iRBD have an elevated risk for near-term development of a clinically diagnosable symptomatic synucleinopathy. Other sleep disorders such as hypersomnia and circadian rhythm dysfunction also occur across the synucleinopathy spectrum, although their prognostic significance is less well understood than iRBD. Finally, isolated REM sleep without atonia may represent an even earlier stage of prodromal synucleinopathy, but further studies are needed.",

The causes of SB range from psychosocial factors to an excessive sleep arousal response. Some studies showed that SB episodes during sleep are under the influences of transient activity of the brainstem arousal. Nocturnal groaning (NG) is a parasomnia characterized by an expiratory monotonous vocalization occurring during sleep, especially in REM sleep and during the second half of the night. The pathogenesis of NG remains still unclear and many hypotheses arose, ranging from the persistence of a vestigial ventilatory pattern rather than an expiratory upper airways' obstruction. Sleep microstructure fluctuation might modulate the NG, since the end of the NG episode usually is synchronized with a cortical arousal and an autonomic activation. Further studies should clarify the pathophysiology of SB and NG, especially when the two phenomena are associated.",

      "abstract": "A subjective disturbance of sleep, including the occurrence of repetitive, stereotypical anxiety dreams, is characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The phenomenology of the PTSD anxiety dream has seemed most consistent with an underlying rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysfunction. However, motor behavior reportedly can accompany PTSD dreams, and normal REM sleep typically involves a nearly total paralysis of the body musculature. As a means of understanding this discrepancy, anterior tibialis muscle activity during sleep was studied in a group of Vietnam combat veterans with current PTSD and in an age-matched normal control group. The PTSD subjects had a higher percentage of REM sleep epochs with at least one prolonged twitch burst; they also were more likely to have periodic limb movements in sleep, during nonrapid eye movement sleep. Both these forms of muscle activation also have been observed in REM behavior disorder (RBD), a parasomnia characterized by the actual enactment of dream sequences during REM sleep. The identification of RBD-like signs in PTSD adds to the evidence for a fundamental disturbance of REM sleep phasic mechanisms in PTSD.",

This case focuses on an individual diagnosed with Parkinson disease whose wife notices him gasping with a high-pitched sound during the night. A sleep study with audio/video recording determines this to be an inspiratory stridor, which confirms a diagnosis of MSA. Inspiratory stridor is due to either dystonia of the thyroarytenoid muscles or paralysis of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. Inspiratory stridor during sleep in an adult with parkinsonian symptoms warrants consideration of MSA, not Parkinson disease. Almost all patients with MSA have rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. A third of patients with MSA have inspiratory stridor, which typically occurs primarily in sleep. Inspiratory gasps awake and asleep are common in patients with MSA.",

The former includes decreased amplitude and advanced phase of circadian rhythms (body temperature, melatonin secretion, and sleep-waking), as well as reduced sleep duration, sleep fragmentation, and a decrease of slow-wave sleep in sleep architecture.

      "title": "Sleep Disorders and Headache",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, difficulty with falling or staying asleep, is the most common sleep complaint among patients with frequent headaches. Insomnia can be related to conditions common among headache patients, such as depression, anxiety, lack of exercise, and medications that make good sleep harder to achieve. Patients with chronic migraine, which includes headache 15 or more days per month, report having almost twice the rates of insomnia as those with less frequent headaches. Rates of sleepiness in the daytime and snoring are also more frequent in those with frequent headaches. Patients with chronic headaches are more likely to be depressed or anxious, which can further worsen sleep problems. Separating out all these issues is sometimes necessary, but also addressing all of the problems without just focusing on only one area is more likely to result in success. Clues to there being a primary sleep disorder in addition to a headache disorder include snoring, gasping during the night, falling asleep during the day, and not feeling rested upon awakening. The overwhelming need to move one's legs when trying to sleep can further disrupt sleep, and is frequently associated with restless legs syndrome. Before a doctor visit to address a possible sleep disorder, it is useful to have a sleep diary in hand. Write down the activities in the hour before bed, the time it takes to get to sleep, the number of awakenings, the total sleep time, and the impression of being rested or tired the next day for each day of the week. Include evening meal times, exercise, and activity in the 4 hours prior to falling asleep. Caffeine intake, energy drinks, weight loss supplements, and any migraine medications, especially those containing caffeine, need to be recorded. Bringing this diary to the office visit can sometimes lead to effective changes that do not involve taking another medicine, and targeted changes can enhance well-being and function throughout the day. Many find that if they can improve sleep time and quality of sleep, headaches do improve. If the sleep log seems to suggest possible sleep apnea, restless legs, or another sleep disorder that requires monitoring for a definitive diagnosis, a formal sleep evaluation will be recommended. While sleeping, the patient is monitored for irregular breathing, temporary obstruction of the airway while relaxed, levels of oxygen, or involuntary movement of the arms or legs while sleeping. Based on these findings, behavioral changes, airway devices, or medicines may be recommended. Many times, consistent behavioral changes are needed for those with headaches and sleep problems. Those with chronic headache tend to cut back on physical activity because exercise temporarily seems to worsen headaches. People with frequent headaches often spend more time resting, lying down, or sitting. This in turn results in being less tired at night. Naps during the day are common. Lack of activity and exercise can worsen depression and anxiety, further adding to difficultly falling and staying asleep. Engaging in restful and non-stress producing activities before going to sleep can set the stage for a better night's sleep. Computer activities, mobile phone devices, and stress-producing work should be avoided in the hour before sleep. The aim is to set aside enough time for 7-8 hours of sleep. This is better achieved by going to bed within an hour of the same time every night, and getting up at similar times. A not uncommon migraine problem is sleeping in on weekends after a long week of not getting quite enough sleep. Catching up on sleep often leads to a wake-up weekend headache, which is frustrating, as this is the time people want to be with their families, run errands, and have fun. This headache coming on after stress has decreased is called let-down headache, and it is unfortunately common. Also common is wake-up headache. The most common time for migraine to occur is in the early morning, and many times people will sleep through the time when a headache is beginning to emerge. By missing the best time to take migraine medicines, which is early in the headache, the medicines are less likely to be effective. Individuals who take their pain and headache medications too frequently, that is, have medication overuse headache, can experience their medications wearing off during the night, triggering a headache. Most over-the-counter and narcotic pain medications wear off in 4-8 hours, making people most vulnerable during the early morning, particularly if overusing these medications. There are unusual headache disorders closely timed to sleep hours. For instance, cluster headache is often called the alarm clock headache, as it will wake a sufferer at a similar time every night with excruciating pain. There may be a link between cluster headache and sleep apnea, with the drop of oxygen while sleeping possibly triggering an attack. Another headache disorder linked to sleep, typically occurring a few hours after falling asleep, is hypnic headache, mostly affecting the elderly. This is sometimes treated with a dose of caffeine before bed, which is sort of a paradox. For most people, frequent intake of caffeine leads to a worsening of a sleep disorder. The caffeine wears off during the night, resulting in a caffeine withdrawal headache. If caffeine is taken too close to bedtime, it can worsen insomnia with trouble falling asleep and restless awakenings. Many over-the-counter migraine medications, as well as butalbital combination tablets, contain caffeine, leading to rebound headaches, withdrawal headaches, and insomnia. If behavioral changes are insufficient, medications can be helpful. It is best to go with a medication that is not habit forming, and will not have side effects the next day. The sleep-inducing effect of some medications wears off over time, so these would not be best for long-term use (Table). In summary, headaches and sleep disorders can be closely linked. Examine your activities as you prepare for sleep, exercise habits, intake of caffeine, and other stimulants. Keep a log of your sleep patterns and your headaches, and bring it in to discuss with your provider. Note whether you snore or gasp at night. Behavioral changes are safe and can lead to better health. Medications, carefully chosen, can improve sleep if behavioral changes are not fully effective.",

      "abstract": "Although the diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on motor symptoms, it is now well known that non-motor symptoms are an integral part of this pathology, involving in fact multiple systems. These non-motor symptoms affect large population of patients and can appear sometimes before the motor disorders. The non-motor symptoms include mainly neuropsychological difficulties, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and autonomic disorders, but involve also pain and sleep disturbances for example. Depression may occur at any stage of the disease, and consists in major depressive disorder, minor depressive disorder, and dysthymia. During the course of the disease, 50% of patients experience anxiety. Apathy is present in up to 30-40% of patients, due to loss of motivation, appearing in emotional, intellectual and behavioral domains. Dopamine dysregulation syndrome and impulse control disorders are not rare, and in relation with dopaminergic therapies. Impulse control disorders include pathological gambling, hyper sexuality, compulsive shopping, and eating disorder. Visual hallucinations can occur in 30% of patients, mostly induced by dopaminergic therapies. Often, they have deeper impact on the quality of life than the motor symptoms themselves, which stay the focus of attention during consulting. Identifying those can help in providing better care with a positive impact on the quality of life of the patients.",

The evolving literature and our clinical experience suggests RBD may not simply represent an interesting parasomnia, but rather reflect dysfunction in REM sleep control that has relevance for understanding certain neurodegenerative disorders. In this chapter, we first review the clinical and polysomnographic features of RBD, criteria for diagnosis of RBD, management of RBD, pathophysiologic underpinnings of RBD, and neuroimaging findings. We then view RBD in the context of certain neurodegenerative disorders. The window that RBD provides in understanding key features of REM sleep control as well as the clinical and pathophysiologic significance of REM sleep dyscontrol in neurodegenerative disorders become clear.",

      "abstract": "Dreams are cognitions that are typically dependent on sleep. However, not all forms of cognition occur during sleep. In spontaneously recalled dreams the visual sense predominates. It is rare to remember a smell or a taste from the dream. Reading and computations (arithmetic) do not frequently occur in dreams. Many dreams contain unusual amounts of emotion, and may provide greater access to older memories – -especially during late morning REM dreams. While impairment in critical self-reflective capacities may occur in dreams, it is not clear if all dreams are characterized by impairment in self-reflectiveness. The dreaming mind/brain spontaneously and automatically produces dreams in the form of narratives and likely uses cognitive operations like Freud's dreamwork to do so.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that rapid eye movement sleep (REM) supports the consolidation of extinction memory. REM is disrupted in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and REM abnormalities after traumatic events increase the risk of developing PTSD. Therefore, it was hypothesized that abnormal REM in trauma-exposed individuals may pave the way for PTSD by interfering with the processing of extinction memory. In addition, PTSD patients display reduced vagal activity. Vagal activity contributes to the strengthening of memories, including fear extinction memory, and recent studies show that the role of vagus in memory processing extends to memory consolidation during sleep. Therefore, it is plausible that reduced vagal activity during sleep in trauma-exposed individuals may be an additional mechanism that impairs extinction memory consolidation. However, to date, the contribution of sleep vagal activity to the consolidation of extinction memory or any emotional memory has not been investigated.",

Understanding the physiology and pattern of normal sleep is an important foundation for interpreting the clinical symptoms, signs, and neurophysiological abnormalities observed in patients with sleep disorders. The term polysomnography refers to the simultaneous recording of multiple sleep parameters, including a limited electroencephalogram, respiratory parameters, chest excursion, limb movements, and the electrocardiogram. Polysomnography is important for assessing a variety of sleep disturbances, including disorders such as sleep-related breathing disorders (including obstructive sleep apnea), rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and periodic movements of sleep. The multiple sleep latency test and maintenance of wakefulness test are studies that are especially useful in the evaluation of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias.",

In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "abstract": "This 52-year-old man suffered from auditory hallucinations that occurred during brief episodes of sleep paralysis at the end of REM sleep periods. During these episodes the patient experienced a dissociated state of consciousness with REM sleep intrusions into wakefulness. The occurrence of this mixed state, and of excessive sleep-onset REM periods during daytime polysomnography (MSLT = Multiple Sleep Latency Test), point to a disorder of REM sleep generation. The existence of narcolepsy could be ruled out. The observation of REM sleep-associated hallucinations has been reported earlier. In the presented polysomnographic sleep studies the existence of a REM sleep associated parasomnia characterised by hallucinations and sleep paralysis could be confirmed.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in childhood: a review.",
      "abstract": "Several studies in the last ten years have been directed towards a better understanding of sleep disorders in childhood. Defining sleep disorders in this age is difficult in dependence of relevant differences in sleep patterns at subsequent developmental stages. In new-borns total sleep time is fairly equal during night and day. Normally, day-time sleep gradually decreases over the first three years of life, such that night-time sleep progressively increases till the age of four, and similar to adult sleep-time by adolescence. The most frequent sleep disorders observed in childhood are parasomnias, that, thought to be a CNS sign of immaturity, tend to be quite predictable, recurring in the same families and not even influenced by environmental stimuli. These disorders included: a) arousal disorders, that generally emerge from delta sleep or relate to arousals occurring during NREM sleep, very common in childhood and fairly common in adulthood either; b) somnambulism and somniloquy, that have many common characteristics: first of all, they have the potential to generate a great sense of discomfort and fear in parents watching a child who suddenly sits up in bed eyes-opened but 'unseeing'; c) nocturnal enuresis, that is substantially not a problem of depth of sleep, despite many parents believe. Although narcolepsy is more common in adolescence, many studies have demonstrated that narcoleptic symptoms may begin in childhood. Narcoleptic symptoms in children are similar in their appearance to those predominant in adults, but their expression may be different because of CNS maturational factors. Historical descriptions of the OSAS evidenced since the beginning the importance of neurobehavioral complications associated with the cessation of airflow at the nose and mouth accompanied by respiratory effort, deriving from upper airway obstruction which occurs during sleep.",

      "title": "Electroencephalographic Finding in Idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a type of parasomnia manifested by vivid, often frightening dreams associated with motor behaviors during REM sleep, sometimes causing injuries to patients themselves or to their bed partners. The polysomnographic features of RBD include increased muscle activity during REM sleep (REM sleep without atonia). The majority of RBD-affected persons are older men. The disorder might be idiopathic (iRBD) or secondary to neurological disorders of various kinds. iRBD management with pharmaceutical measures is usually straightforward and effective. Several longitudinal studies have revealed that a high proportion of iRBD patients convert to α-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy body disease (DLB). Considering this, many studies have been conducted to identify common clinical markers between α-synucleinopathies and iRBD or indicators for the future development of α-synucleinopathies in iRBD patients. In this context, electroencephalographic (EEG) slowing occurring while awake and asleep, which is frequently observed in DLB, has received much attention. Clarification of the association between EEG slowing and the presence of mild cognitive impairment, which is also commonly seen in early stages of DLB, has been particularly expected to offer a breakthrough for the identification of cases which might convert to α-synucleinopathies. In this article, we introduce the progress in quantitative EEG research in iRBD during the past decade. We also discuss the relationship between EEG findings and cognitive decline as well as the mechanisms of EEG changes or cognitive abnormalities in patients with the disorder.",

To better describe this phenomenon we studied 11 consecutive drug‐free patients undergoing a video‐polysomnographic (V‐ PSG ) study who present at least 5 NM events in one single night of recording. All events were measured and checked for their association with rapid eye and leg movements, EEG arousals, awakenings and Bereitschaftspotential. One hundred and eighty‐two motor events from 11 subjects were analyzed. Motor events were approximately 0.5 s in duration and occurred during REM sleep in 79.7% of the cases. Only 14.8% of the events were associated with rapid eye movements, 52.2% with leg movements, while approximately 80% of them were accompanied by an arousal or awakening. No EEG abnormalities and Bereitschaftspotential were observed. For its duration and its segregation in sleep, NM could be more appropriately named “sleep‐related head jerks” ( SRHJ ). SRHJ should be recognized and its effect on sleep stability should be re‐considered.",

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

However, the sleep-wake rhythm may be out of sync with the light-dark cycle or endogenously out of sync, resulting in insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in activities of daily living. Sleep disorders are classified by the American Sleep Disorders Association, as intrinsic dyssomnias, extrinsic dyssomnias, parasomnias, or medical/psychiatric sleep disorders. Circa¬dian sleep disorders have been categorized separately to recognize that in most cases the etiology of circadian dis¬turbances is a mix of internal and environmental factors or a temporary mismatch between the two. Symptoms are usually insomnia or hypersomnia, common symptoms in patients with circadian sleep disorders although other causes can be attributed and must be excluded before a diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder is made. In the patient without other sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool in assessing circadian sleep disorders. These records should be kept for 2 weeks or more, as a disturbance due to job changes or travel across time zones can have effects on sleep and daytime alertness weeks after the event.

The subject usually is readily aroused to full alertness and is able to recall much of the content of the dream. This distinguishes nightmares from night terrors, which are associated with a prolonged transition to wakefulness and scant recall of dream narrative. Although nightmares are featured prominently in literature and descriptive psychoanalytic writings, there is limited empirical research on this phenomenon. This fact is driven in part by pragmatic scientific limitations that make it difficult to observe neurocognitive events during the actual dream. Dreams can only be recalled following an awakening, and the fidelity of recall is not known. For example, it is possible that dream recall is limited to dream events occurring in the immediate period just prior to arousal. Further, dream recall is subject to retrieval biases in which the subject imposes order on what has been a chaotic mental experience.",

      "abstract": "All 24-hour endocrine rhythms partially reflect the interaction of circadian rhythmicity with sleep-wake homeostasis but their relative contributions vary from one system to another. In older adults, many 24-hour rhythms are dampened and/or advanced, including those of cortisol and GH. Amplitude reduction and phase advance of 24-hour rhythms may represent age-related changes in the central nervous systems underlying circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis. Age-related alterations in circadian function could also reflect decreased exposure and/or responsivity to the synchronizing effects of both photic (e.g. light exposure) and nonphotic (e.g. social cues) inputs. There are pronounced age-related alterations in sleep quality in aging which consist primarily of a marked reduction of slow-wave sleep, a reduction in REM stages and a marked increase in the number and duration of awakenings interrupting sleep. Alterations in slow-wave sleep occur abruptly in young adulthood (30–40 years of age) whereas disturbances in amounts of REM and wake appear more gradually. This article reviews evidence indicating that deficits in characteristics of sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian function may mediate age-related alterations in somatotropic and corticotropic function. Because sleep loss in young subjects results in endocrine disturbances which mimic those observed in aging, it is conceivable that the decrease in sleep quality which characterizes aging may contribute to age-related alterations in hormonal function and their metabolic consequences.",

(i) In typical narcolepsy, psychotic-like symptoms include predominantly visual hallucinations at the sleep-wake transition (experienced as \"not real\") and dissociation because of intrusion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena into wakefulness. (ii) Atypical patients (\"the psychotic form of narcolepsy\") experience more severe and vivid, apparently REM-related hallucinations or dream/reality confusions, which patients may rationalize in a delusion-like way. (iii) Some patients have a comorbid schizophrenia spectrum disorder with psychotic symptoms unrelated to sleep. Psychostimulants used to treat narcolepsy may trigger psychotic symptoms in all three groups. We analyzed 58 published cases from groups 2 and 3 (n = 17 and 41). Features that were reported significantly more frequently in atypical patients include visual and multimodal hallucinations, sexual and mystical delusions, and false memories. Dual diagnosis patients had more disorganized symptoms and earlier onset of narcolepsy.Epidemiological studies tentatively suggest a possible association between narcolepsy and schizophrenia only for very early-onset cases, which could be related to the partially overlapping neurodevelopmental changes observed in these disorders. We propose a clinical algorithm for the management of cases with psychotic-like or psychotic features.",

      "title": "Sleep Movements and Respiratory Coupling as a Biobehavioral Marker for Early Alzheimer’s Disease in Independently Dwelling Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract INTRODUCTION: Sleep disorder is often the first symptom of age-related cognitive decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), or early Alzheimer’s disease. Patient or family sleep complaints in primary care do not reliably lead to screening for sleep or cognitive loss. In this study, poor sleep and arousability were examined using movement arousals, a novel biobehavioral marker of cumulative sleep loss, identified by periodic (circa 4 min) sleep movements (SM). We report that SM events trigger respiratory upregulation (RR) in healthy, but not in MCI-related, sleep. Time latency (TL) between SM-RR events is proposed as a marker of sleep loss and potentially of neurodegeneration associated with cognitive loss in MCI. METHOD . Community-dwelling older adults (N=95; 62-90 years) were tested in the home bed for two days on an “under the sheets” mattress overlay with high sensitivity for respiration and all movement, including micro-movements of SM. Wrist actigraphy (7 days) and standard sleep self-reports were collected as well. A suite of neurocognitive testing identified three groups: Normal Cognition (NC; n=45); clinic diagnosed MCI (MCI-DX; n= 17); and MCI-Consensus determined by an expert panel (MCI-CON; n=33 consensus or pre-clinical MCI) groups. RESULTS: In adjusted cohort analyses, sleep fragmentation (SF) and WASO predicted poorer memory performance selectively. Actigraphy revealed greater sleep latency (SL; p&lt;.008), sleep duration (p&lt;.01) and SF (p=.008) in MCI-DX compared to NC groups. Longer SL and poor sleep were associated with depression which was more prevalent in both MCI groups than NC. Neural Networks AI methods were applied to discriminate MCI and NC cases using the TL metric between SM-RR coupling events. ROC diagnostics were applied which identified MCI vs. NC cases with 87% sensitivity; 89% specificity; and 88% positive predictive value. DISCUSSION: MCI cognitive phenotype was detected with a novel sleep biomarker TL, associated with the tight gap between SM-RR coupling, which is proposed as a corollary of sleep quality/loss that affects the autonomic regulation of respiration during sleep. Movement arousals are less effective in initiating respiratory upregulation in MCI which suggests a potential mechanism for neurodegenerative changes and cognitive loss in early MCI.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucination and sleep paralysis, with abnormal characteristics of shorter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency. The management of the patients is very important. The present study focused on the clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods and long-term prognosis of this particular syndrome.The clinical data of 39 narcoleptic children were analyzed. Sleep EEG monitoring was performed in all patients. Among the 39 cases, 23 were followed up.All the patients manifested with excessive daytime sleepiness, with disrupted nocturnal sleep occurring in 35 cases. Cataplexy appeared in 36 cases, and sleep paralysis in 9, hypnagogic hallucination in 19, and automatic behavior in 6 cases, respectively. Sleep EEG monitoring demonstrated a short mean sleep latency (< 5 minutes) and two or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in 38 cases. Twenty-three of the 39 cases were followed-up. Seventeen cases were followed-up for over one year. The longest follow-up duration was 14 years. Methylphenidate was administered in 10 cases. The excessive daytime sleepiness had been improved in 7 cases (70%). No obvious adverse effects were found. Psychosocial and academic problems appeared in most cases.Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder. A definite diagnosis is established when the symptoms of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness occur in association with the characteristic findings on sleep EEG monitoring. Appropriate drug therapy and psychosocial management are of help for such patients. Stimulant medication is an important component of the overall treatment program. A comprehensive approach is necessary to meet the needs of children with narcolepsy. Family education and emotional support are key elements in the management plan. The overall goal for managing childhood narcolepsy is to assist the child and family in achieving optimal quality of life.",

A variety of medical and psychiatric factors may also produce marked sleep disruption. All of these factors are in this chapter. A recent randomised double-masked placebo-controlled trial in children with neurodevelopmental disorders showed that melatonin reduced sleep onset latency but at the same time was associated with earlier waking time than placebo. Melatonin is not generally considered to produce tolerance, rebound insomnia or dependency, problems often associated with other sedative hypnotics. The chapter explains the use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. The misalignment of the internal sleep-wake circadian clock with environmental day/night patterns and other environmental cues may also result in sleep disorders.",

The quality of life during the wakeful stage is heavily dependent on the quality of REM and non-REM sleep experienced, whether during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The most restorative sleep is delta sleep (slow wave sleep or deep sleep) that occurs in Stages 3 and 4 of non-REM sleep; it is during these stages that one is the most difficult to waken. Individuals waken during REM sleep, but the state of being awake is normally so brief that it is not recalled later when in the true wake state. Rapid eye movement and generalized muscle atonia are characteristic of REM sleep; diaphragmatic movements and erections are the only muscle movements not inhibited.",

Individual dyskinesias occurring during sleep can be characterized not only by their frequency, rhythmicity, and anatomic predilections, but also by the stage of sleep in which they characteristically occur. Wake-pattern movement disorders improve during sleep but, contrary to common belief, they do not entirely disappear. Instead, these disorders reemerge in attenuated form, often during nonrapid eye movement sleep. The identification and proper characterization of the various sleep-related dyskinesias are greatly aided by careful polysomnographic study.",

Polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that besides impaired sleep continuity, sleep in depression is characterized by a reduction of slow wave sleep and a disinhibition of random eye movement (REM) sleep, with a shortening of REM latency, a prolongation of the first REM period and increased REM density.Our own experimental work has focused on the reciprocal interaction hypothesis of non-REM and REM sleep regulation as a model to explain the characteristic features of depressed sleep.In agreement with the major tenet of this model, administration of cholinomimetics provoked shortened REM latency in healthy subjects and led to an even stronger REM sleep disinhibition in depressed patients. Manipulations of the sleep-wake cycle, such as sleep deprivation or a phase advance of the sleep period, alleviate depressive symptoms.These data indicate a strong bidirectional relationship between sleep, sleep alterations and depression.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for human survival since it helps to restore and maintain our bodies' immune systems and other essential processes. One-third of a person's life is devoted to sleeping, although few are aware of the many positive aspects of this activity. Two distinct types of sleep, REM and NREM, have been identified. A good night's rest is achieved when REM and NREM sleep alternate in a regular pattern. Disruptions to this cycle, whether they originate physiologically or psychologically, have been linked to a variety of health problems. Polysomnography (PSG) equipment is often used in sleep labs inside hospitals to perform sleep studies. A polysomnogram is an in-depth medical technique that records a patient's vital signs while they sleep and necessitates a hospital stay. Clinically, sleep apnea is defined as a breathing disease in which there are periodic pauses in breathing lasting 10 seconds or more that occur more than five times during the night. Sleep apnea may be classified as either Obstructive, Central, or Mixed. The prevalent sleep problem known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by the relaxation of muscles in the upper airway during sleep. The purpose of this study is to provide a technique for screening for Obstructive Sleep Apnea by analysing Heart Rate Variability of Electrocardiogram (ECG) data while the subject is asleep. The goals of this study are to create computational approaches for identifying OSA based on characteristics extracted from Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals derived from sleep electrocardiograms (ECGs). Physio Net's Apnea-ECG recordings serve as the source for the ECG data.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnia in which the normal muscle atonia of REM sleep is absent. The lack of muscle atonia may lead to motor activation and the appearance of dream enactment behaviors. Dream content during RBD is vivid and often has aggressive themes, such as being threatened, defending loved ones, being chased, or attacked. During an episode, both the patient with RBD and their bed partner are at risk for serious injuries (e.g., bruises, lacerations, and bone fractures). Polysomnography is required for RBD due to its potentially injurious behavior and to rule out the treatable condition of obstructive sleep apnea that can mimic RBD. Controlled trials are lacking; yet, clonazepam has been effective in treating symptoms in up to 90 % of patients with RBD. Other treatment approaches include melatonin, quetiapine, antiepileptic agents, adrenergic agonists, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. RBD is frequently associated with synucleinopathies such as multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson's disease. In these patients, RBD symptoms may precede motor symptoms by months to years. Abnormalities in central dopaminergic mechanisms have been postulated.",

Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes. Hypersomnia may occur as a side effect of many drugs, due either to the soporific effects of the drug or to the effect of the drug on reducing night-time sleep.",

Drugs, especially those related to neurotransmitters may induce complicated symptoms in the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. Some of these symptoms are accompanied by peripheral neuropathy. Intoxication, especially alcoholism is often are combined with a malnutrition, such as avitaminosis. Dysautonomic symptoms change successively; at an early stage, drugs or toxins stimulate sympathetic or parasympathetic receptors, while the same receptors are inhibited at a later stage when the concentration of the substances rises in the blood. Frequent stimulations of the same receptor may produce change in the sensitivity of receptors, decreased metabolism or addiction. These changes suggest that a different approach towards the acute and chronic autonomic disorders caused by intoxications is needed.",

Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena.

      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder is a non-REM sleep parasomnia that is associated to other sleep disorders, especially sleepwalking. It becomes chronic, is not remitting and consists in episodes of compulsive eating during the night, which are then partially or completely forgotten by the patient. This condition must be differentiated from night-eating syndrome, which is far more common and is linked to endocrinological and psychiatric disorders, as well as to other disorders involving eating behaviour during sleeping hours.A 28-year-old male who had suffered from the clinical picture every day for 10 years; this condition consisted in nocturnal episodes of binge eating in a state of semi-sleepiness, with no remembrance of what had happened the next morning. The patient had no history of psychiatric pathologies or any other eating disorder, but he did not rest adequately at night, was overweight and had a family and personal history of other sleep disorders. Since he did not respond to other treatments, we decided to try therapy with topiramate; as a result, the episodes disappeared, tolerance was excellent and effectiveness was maintained throughout the two years' follow-up.In this paper we review eating disorders that occur during sleep, nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder and its therapeutic possibilities, while highlighting the usefulness of topiramate to treat this condition.",

      "title": "[Non-epileptic motor paroxysmal phenomena in wakefulness in childhood].",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. Fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos motores en vigilia en la infancia.Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migraña (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

Su evolucion natural sin tratamiento puede derivar en serias repercusiones negativas en el funcionamiento academico, social y familiar de los ninos, interfiriendo de forma importante en el desarrollo. Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

      "abstract": "Accessible summary • Explores current research illuminating the physiological mechanisms contributing the relationship of sleep dysfunction and depression. • Investigates the crucial role of sleep in the affective modulation of brain functioning. • Describes the relationship between emotional brain processing during rapid eye movement and depression. • Points to the use of multi-therapeutic approaches for treatment with emphasis on positive behavioural imagery therapies. Abstract This review synthesizes some of the most current investigative research to illuminate the physiological mechanisms contributing to the relationship between sleep dysfunction and depression. Major depression has consistently been linked to sleep abnormalities and insomnia is a robust risk factor in the initiating and development of depression. Recent neurobiological findings indicate the crucial role of sleep in the affective modulation of brain functioning. Studies have demonstrated that sleep in major depression is characterized by a reduction in slow wave sleep, interruptions in sleep continuity, longer periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep including a shortening of REM latency (i.e. the time between sleep onset and the occurrence of the first REM period), as well as an increase in REM density. The failure of sleep dependant emotional brain processing in REM sleep that seems to occur in depression, support the development and fostering of clinical depression. How depression likely interplays with these sleep processes points to the use of multi-therapeutic approaches for treatment with emphasis on positive behavioural imagery therapies.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent sleep-related sensorimotor disorder defined by an urge to move the legs in the evening while resting. Severe RLS symptoms can negatively impact sleep, mood, and quality of life. Periodic leg movements during sleep and wakefulness are found in 60% to 80% of patients with RLS. The pathophysiology of RLS and periodic leg movement is still poorly understood and involves brain iron deficiency, dopamine dysregulation, and genetic predisposition. Over the past decades, several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have reported an association between RLS, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension although the magnitude, direction, and underlying mechanisms of these associations remain inconclusive. Periodic leg movements during sleep are concomitant with an increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which may affect the physiological nocturnal blood pressure dip and, therefore, lead to an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Insomnia and sleep deprivation linked to sensory discomfort could also increase the sympathetic tone and contribute to an increase in cardiovascular risk. Comorbidities and associated sleep disorders may also synergically increase cardiovascular risk. This narrative review details the current knowledge of RLS, a still underdiagnosed and poorly recognized disorder, and examines the epidemiological relationship between RLS, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, potential mechanisms underlying this association, and strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with moderate-to-severe RLS. Greater multidisciplinary collaborations between cardiologists and sleep specialists are needed to better identify, understand, and manage patients with sleep disorders, including those with RLS.",

      "title": "Sleep Problems in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "In his famous monograph “An Essay in Shaking Palsy,” James Parkinson provided astute descriptions of impaired sleep in his case series of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) two centuries ago. It is only three decades ago that sleep dysfunction started to attract attention of medical and scientific communities involved in the clinical care and research of PD. Tremendous advancements in our understanding of impaired sleep and alertness associated with PD have developed since then.\r\n\r\nSleep problems are one of the major, challenging issues in patients with PD, affecting a significant number of patients. The etiology of sleep problems is multifactorial, including disease-related nocturnal symptoms, medication adverse effects, and primary sleep disorders including restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and sleep apnea syndrome. These causes of impaired sleep-wake cycles in the PD population often coexist or even overlap, rendering the management of sleep problems in PD patients difficult. Also, excessive daytime sleepiness is observed in a significant number of patients. In PD patients, therefore, appropriate assessment of disease-related nocturnal disturbances and primary sleep disorders is imperative. This special issue addresses unmet need for understanding PD-related sleep problems.\r\n\r\nPD sleep scale 2 (PDSS-2) is a recently developed tool for screening and managing sleep disturbance in PD patients, consisting of 15 items which are clinically relevant to nocturnal problems including nonmotor and motor problems in PD [1]. The original PDSS-2 (German and English) has been translated into several languages, including Japanese [2] and Italian [3]. The PDSS-2 has been used to observe treatment response. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, including 287 PD patients, mean PDSS-2 total score decreased by −5.9 points with rotigotine and by −1.9 points with placebo [4]. In this special issue, K. Horvath et al. estimated the threshold representing minimal clinically important difference of the PDSS-2 total score: the study results showed −3.44 points for detecting improvement or the threshold of 2.07 points for observing worsening. This finding is important when planning studies using the PDSS-2 as outcome measures.\r\n\r\nFull-night polysomnography (PSG) is a gold standard for diagnosing sleep apnea syndrome; however, applying PSG is often difficult in patients with PD, who have severe parkinsonism or psychiatric comorbidity. P. Gros et al. evaluated the usefulness of unattended portable monitoring (PM) for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with PD. Although discrepancy between portable monitoring and PSG was greater in PD patients with more motor dysfunction, the authors confirmed the usefulness of portable monitoring in diagnosing moderate to severe OSA in PD patients. These results provide the rationale for the use of portable sleep monitoring in PD and are very relevant for circumstances where a complete PSG in a sleep laboratory is not available and/or feasible.\r\n\r\nM. Kaminska et al. performed a review on the relationship between OSA and PD. Although the clinical significance of OSA in PD has been controversial [5, 6], the authors suggest the possibility that treatment of OSA could delay cognitive decline or motor dysfunction in patients with PD. This area of research is of high significance as it is important to assess the prevalence of OSA and the impact of its treatment in the PD population.\r\n\r\nD. Martinez-Ramirez et al. correlated PSG findings and sleep disorders with clinical characteristics in PD patients and found that sleep disorders and sleep architecture were poorly predictable by clinical characteristic of PD patients. This comprehensive study demonstrates the complexity of sleep dysfunction associated with PD and its complex associations with metrics of PD.\r\n\r\nIn a fine and thoughtful study K. Suzuki et al. provided an interesting insight into the complex relationship between PD and restless legs syndrome (RLS) and leg motor restlessness (LMR). A significant relationship between RLS and PD is suggested by observing a favorable response to dopaminergic treatment in both disorders. However, RLS prevalence in PD patients varies according to different studies. Recently, LMR, characterized by an urge to move the legs that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for RLS, has been reported more frequently in patients untreated with PD than healthy controls. This review article may provide a new insight into the relationship between RLS, LMR, and PD.\r\n\r\nFinally, the complex and still only partially understood interaction of impulse control disorders in PD and sleep is discussed in a review from the clinic of one of the guest editors.\r\n\r\nIn summary, sleep problems are common but underreported by PD patients and underdiagnosed by health professionals. Further understanding of mechanisms that underlie impaired sleep and alertness in PD will allow for development of much needed treatment approaches for this nonmotor manifestation of PD.\r\n\r\n\r\nKoichi Hirata\r\n\r\nBirgit Hogl\r\n\r\nEng King Tan\r\n\r\nAleksandar Videnovic",

      "title": "A possible link between circadian rhythm disorders and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm disorders are problems with your circadian rhythm, the internal body that keeps your biological processes in step. This cycle lasts about 24 hours. The term circadian comes from Latin words that mean “around the day.” Patterns of brain waves, hormone production, cell regrowth, and other activities are linked to this cycle. Your circadian rhythm plays a key role in things like when you sleep and when you wake. Your normal circadian clock is set by the cycle of light and dark over 24 hours. People with circadian rhythm disorders may have problems: Falling asleep, Staying asleep, Waking up too early and not being able to go back to sleep, Getting sleep but not feeling refreshed by it. Things that can cause circadian rhythm disorders include Shift work, Pregnancy, Time zone changes, Medications, Changes in routine, such as staying up late or sleeping in, Medical problems including Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, Mental health problems, Menopause. Various Circadian Rhythm Disorders include Jet lag, or rapid time zone change syndrome: This involves symptoms like too much sleepiness and a lack of daytime alertness in people who travel across time zones. It gets worse with each time zone crossed, especially when traveling toward the east. Shift work sleep disorder: This sleep disorder affects people who frequently rotate shifts or work at night. A conflict between someone’s circadian rhythm and the time of their shift can mean they get up to 4 hours less sleep than the average person. Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS): This is a disorder of sleep timing. People with DSPS tend to fall asleep very late at night and have a hard time waking up in time for work, school, or social activities. It’s especially common in teens and young adults. Advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS): This is a disorder in which a person goes to sleep earlier and wakes earlier than they wanted. For example, they might fall asleep between 6 and 9 p.m. and wake up between 1 and 5 a.m. Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder: This disorder often affects people who are blind because the circadian clock is set by the light-dark cycle. With this condition, that cycle is disturbed. It can cause a serious lack of sleep time and quality at night and sleepiness during daylight hours. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder: With this disorder, people’s circadian rhythms are jumbled. They may sleep in a series of naps over 24 hours. Seasonal affective disorder and all the circadian rhythm disorders are related to a discrepancy between the duration of the solar day and the circadian cycle. The circadian cycle of humans and other mammals is close to one hour longer than the 24 hours period from sunrise to sunrise. Interestingly, birds show a circadian cycle of less than 24 hours and close to 23 hours. Terrestrial invertebrates, the insects provide the key to understanding this discrepancy. The earliest identifiably mammalian fossils are from the Permian era strata. Insect orders that first appeared in the Permian era include the Hemiptera (bugs), Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), Coleoptera (beetles) and the Neuroptera (lacewings). All of whose modern survivors show a circadian cycle longer than 24 hours in at least some stage of the life cycle. The insects whose ancestors first appeared in Mesozoic strata with the birds include Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Their modern survivors, like the birds, demonstrate a circadian rhythm shorter than 24 hours. It is proposed here that the duration of these animal classes circadian day may reflect the duration of the solar day at the time of their origin. There is now evidence for three large meteorite impacts on Pangea near the end of the Permian era, one in Wilkes Land of Antarctica, one near the Falkland Islands, and one just west of Australia. The eastward movement of the Australian, African, and Eurasian continent/plate and the southeastward movement of the Antarctic continents/plates suggest that those meteorites were moving eastwards and struck the planet obliquely. Having done so, they might have imparted momentum to the planet’s rotation and so accelerated it. This may mean that circadian rhythm disorders are the consequence of a change in the duration of the solar day due to a disaster and that daytime lethargy and depression may have had adaptive value to the mammals who survived that disaster. If this is true, it adds context to our treatment of these disorders with bright light and melatonin",

      "title": "Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "he classic features of the clinical picture in Parkinson's disease (PD) are the motor disorders: akinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability.However, non-motor symptoms (NMS) are frequently present.Therefore, patients with PD can present, besides the typical parkinsonian motor syndrome, a wide arrow of NMS, mainly neuropsychiatric manifestations (as depression and cognitive impairment), sleep disorders (as rapid eye movement behavior disorder), autonomic dysfunctions (as intestinal constipation, postural hypotension and miccional disorders) and others, as fatigue and pain.In their various combinations, NMS may eventually become the main complaints of patients with PD.NMS may be related to the neurodegenerative changes affecting several neural systems and/or caused by drugs employed in the treatment of PD.The mainly neural systems related to NMS are: non-motor frontostriatal circuits, serotoninergic nuclei of median raphe, noradrenergic nuclei (locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus), autonomic centers (hypothalamus and dorsal motor of vagus) and olfactory system.The clinical picture of PD has been compared with an iceberg.The visible part represents the motor symptoms, and the larger non-visible part represents the several NMS, often underecognized in clinical practice.The study of Cosentino et al. 1 published in this issue of Arquivos de Neuropsiquiatria was performed aiming to determine the prevalence of NMS in 300 PD outpatients seen at the Movement Disorders Unit of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Neurológicas in Lima, Peru.The patients completed the Spanish validated version of the Non-motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest).This questionnaire was developed by Chaudhuri et al. 2 to address the need for a quantitative and validated instrument to measure NMS in PD.The NMSQuest is a simple self-completed tool and it is comprised of 30 items grouped according to 9 NMS domains.The results of this study show the high prevalence and the variety of NMS in PD: at least one NMS was present in 99.3% of the patients evaluated and the mean total NMS (NMSQ-T) was 12.41 ranging from 0 to 27 of a maximum of 30.These data confirm those from previous similar studies.performed a multicentric, international, cross-sectional study involving 545 PD patients (mean disease duration: 6.96 year) using the same questionnaire (NMSQuest) and reported 10.3 as the mean total NMS, and such symptoms were present in 98.4% of the patients evaluated.The PRIAMO study (Barone et al. 4 ) is another important one to be compared to the Cosentino et al. 1 study.This Italian multicenter survey using a semi-structured interview in 1,072 consecutive patients with PD was performed to assess the prevalence NMS in 12 domains, their association with cognitive impairment and the impact on patients' quality of life.They found that 98.6% of patients with PD reported the presence of NMS and the mean number of NMS per patient was 7.8 ranging from 0 to 32.The NMS in PD may be present in all the clinical phases of the disease: pre-motor phase, the initial phase (when the motor symptoms appear and the diagnosis is made), the moderate phase and in the advanced phase.In the pre-motor phase, the most common NMS symptoms are: hyposmia, depression, intestinal constipation and rapid eye movement behavior disorder.Along the initial and moderate phases, several autonomic and neuropsychiatric manifestations may be present, and in the advanced one the most important NMS is dementia of PD.Consentino et al. 1 observed that the mean total NMS increased significantly with disease duration.Mean total NMS was 10.74 in patients with less than 5 years of disease, 13.71 between 5 and",

      "abstract": "Individuals with disorders of circadian rhythm have normal sleep, but the underlying biological rhythms that play a role in the timing of their sleep are set either too late or too early. Patients with disturbances of circadian rhythm find themselves unable to shift their sleep/wake cycle to adapt to the schedule requirements of work, school, and/or family life. In delayed sleep phase syndrome, patients may experience “sleep drunkenness” upon awakening, with confusion, disorientation, and impaired motor coordination. Generally individuals suffer with disturbances of circadian rhythm for years before getting treatment. Treatment approaches often involve a carefully planned, gradual shifting of sleep time and the use of melatonin as well as the bright light therapy that are timed carefully, depending on the clinical situation. The control of the sleep/wake cycle is complex. It is affected by the genetic factors, maintained by neurologic and hormonal systems, and responsive to external stimuli.",

      "title": "Sleep-Related Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Under normal circumstances, movement is relatively suppressed during sleep. Motor system activity reflects this paucity of movement as it decreases from drowsiness to slow wave sleep (SWS) and then further in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Some movement during sleep in fact is adaptive with small shifts in body weight preventing pressure-related injuries such as nerve palsy and skin ulceration. Other movements occurring during sleep serve no obvious purpose and may even fragment sleep, especially when recurrent. This latter constellation of movements constitutes the sleep-related movement disorders. This chapter will focus on the sleep-related movement disorders which are largely characterized by repetitive, non-epileptic, purposeless movement which occurs during sleep. Many of the sleep-related movement disorders are clinically benign or on the severe end of the normal spectrum and as such our discussion will begin with an introduction to normal movement during sleep. The chapter continues with a discussion of benign sleep-related movement then the clinically recognized sleep-related movement disorders. Special attention will be given to restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) as these entities are both common and a major source of morbidity.",

      "abstract": "People begin the sleep cycle with a period of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, followed by a very short period of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During a normal night of sleep, humans usually experience about four or five periods of REM sleep. Penile erections have generally been considered to be an epiphenomenon of REM sleep-related physiological changes for healthy males. Thus, men are very likely to awaken in the morning with a REM sleep-related erection, which is also known as nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT). Men who are physically under great strain or serious psychological stress may find it difficult to maintain a psychogenic erection. The best time for them to have sex would be during sleep time, such as when they are experiencing REM sleep-related erections. It is reasonable to assume that the NPT phenomena might have evolved as a tool for having sex, in the context of both procreation and recreation.",

The typical clinical features of PD reflect well-known pathology in the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, while extra-nigral pathology accounts for many of the non-motor features of PD. As will be subsequently discussed, the most characteristic pathologic feature of PD is neurodegeneration with Lewy body (LB) formation, but it must be acknowledged that occasionally other pathologic processes cause clinical features typical of PD. In particular, some cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA) or even progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may be clinically mistaken for PD (Bower et al., 2002). More problematic are cases of PD with juvenile onset or those associated with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, such as cases with Parkin and DJ-1 mutations (see below), in which LBs may not be present. Other early onset familial cases present with atypical clinical features such as early dementia and psychosis, which are not characteristic of typical PD (Gwinn-Hardy et al. 2000). Another diagnostic challenge is the relationship of cognitive dysfunction in PD to concurrent Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (McKeith et al. 1996).",

Elles s’associent souvent chez un meme individu et pourraient representer des variantes cliniques d’une meme pathologie.Longtemps considerees comme des troubles benins du sommeil, les donnees actuelles soulignent les consequences des parasomnies, avec des mises en danger et un retentissement fonctionnel diurne. Nos trois premiers travaux ont permis une meilleure caracterisation du phenotype et des consequences des parasomnies, en particulier sur le plan de la somnolence et des phenomenes douloureux chroniques. Pres de la moitie des adultes parasomniaques rapportaient une plainte de somnolence diurne excessive associee a une propension marquee au sommeil sur les premieres heures de la journee. Nous retrouvions une frequence elevee de douleurs chroniques, de cephalees et de migraine.

Si des travaux recents suggerent que les parasomnies sont associees a des alterations discretes de la microstructure du SLP, les performances diagnostiques de ces parametres n’ont pas fait l’objet d’etudes specifiques. Nous avons developpe une nouvelle methode d’analyse polysomnographique qui offre de bonnes performances de classification chez des adultes parasomniaques et des sujets temoins.Malgre cinq decennies d’etudes cliniques et experimentales, la physiopathologie de ces parasomnies reste mal connue. Un modele permet de conceptualiser les mecanismes de la maladie. Chez un patient predispose genetiquement, certaines conditions responsables d’une instabilite du SLP favorisent la survenue d’un eveil dissocie precipite par un stimulus eveillant.

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "title": "Sleep and Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Sleep problems and fatigue are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The etiology of these disturbances is multifactorial. Sleep disturbance and fatigue after TBI can be a result of the trauma itself or can be secondary to medical problems, pain, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and/or side effects of medications. Because sleep disturbance is common in the general population, the clinician needs to differentiate between premorbid sleep problems and those that are temporally related to TBI. The complex relationship between sleep and TBI can be understood as a series of mutually independent processes. First, acute brain injury can lead to disrupted levels of consciousness and a disrupted sleep process. A second and distinct type of sleep disruption often develops in the chronic phase of recovery; during this phase, severity of injury is often another factor that influences the type and nature of sleep problems experienced by patients. Finally, subjective and objective measures of sleep disturbance may be discordant, in that subjective complaints may occur without objective evidence, and vice versa (Orff et al. 2009). The relationship between sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders is also complex. The neural mechanisms that mediate sleep also have a role in the regulation and stabilization of mood. Dysfunction of these neural circuits after TBI can, therefore, cause both mood and sleep problems. In addition, psychotropics can exacerbate sleep problems, and sleep disturbances can precipitate psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety and dysphoria. Fatigue is a nonspecific and highly subjective symptom that is often reported in patients with TBI. It is described as a feeling of exhaustion, tiredness, or weakness. In many ways, sleep disturbances after TBI are better defined and understood than symptoms of fatigue. Therefore, in this chapter, we first discuss the normal sleep cycle, and then the prevalence, pathophysiology, and types of posttraumatic sleep dis-orders, followed by the evaluation and treatment of these sleep dis-turbances. We then focus on fatigue after TBI. Although sleep disturbances and fatigue overlap, we treat them as separate entities, for clarity. We briefly review the literature and make practical suggestions for the management of sleep and fatigue following TBI. A more detailed description of TBI sleep disturbances can be found in the chapter \"Fatigue and Sleep Problems\" in the Textbook of Traumatic Brain Injury (Rao et al. 2005).",

Abdominal motion was little affected, and hence the adverse effects of phasic events on overall ventilation were limited. Ventilation during non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) is characterized by regular periodicities. 'Itro mechanisms are thought to be involved. First, instability of the chemical feedback system caused by high overall loop gain leads to ventilatory oscillations. Second, removal of the wakefulness stimulus leads to reductions in ventilation at sleep onset. It is likely that these two mechanisms interact to produce periodicities in ventilation during early stage 1-2 NREMS. Ventilation is commonly disturbed in sleep. This both occurs in normal individuals, and is particularly severe in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. The mechanisms underlying this are likely to be different in the different stages of sleep. In rapid eye-movement sleep, the disturbances are coupled to the phasic events that occur in this state. One method to measure these phasic events is by recording rapid eye-movements. We have developed a method to examine the interrelationship between ventilation and its components and eye-movements. This method is based on computing separately a running average of ventilation and its components and eye movement density (number of eye movements/second). The window length of the running average, the degree of overlap between adjacent windows and the delay (or lag) between the ventilation and eye movement measures is adjustable. The latter is to allow for asynchrony between the ventilatory changes and the occurrence of eye movements. We have found that a window length of",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose of Review: This article provides a review of disturbances of sleep comorbid with common neurologic disorders. Recent Findings: A wide variety of neurologic disorders are frequently complicated by comorbid sleep disturbances. In many cases, a bidirectional relationship appears to occur between sleep function and the neurologic disease, such that treatment of comorbid sleep disturbances may improve the symptoms of the neurologic disease. Summary: Neurologic disorders are often associated with abnormalities of sleep. Sleep influences the severity of both epilepsy and headache, and treatment of comorbid sleep disorders may improve seizure and headache frequency. Alzheimer disease is characterized by circadian phase delay and poor nighttime sleep and is strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Parkinson disease is associated with several sleep disorders, including insomnia, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, daytime hypersomnia, and sleep-disordered breathing. Hypoventilation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neuromuscular disorders often presents initially with sleep problems, and treatment with noninvasive ventilation improves survival and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Psychomotor disadaptation syndrome (PDS) was first described in France by the Dijon geriatric school, 25 years ago, and named \"psychomotor regression syndrome\". The initial clinical description still remains without modifications. However, progress has been made both in understanding its physiopathology and management, and its name has been changed into PDS in the late 1990s. Since the early 2000s, it was also termed frontal-sub-cortical dysfunction syndrome. PDS results from decompensation of postural function, gait and psychomotor automatisms linked to posture and motor programming impairment related to fronto-sub-cortical lesions. PDS is characterized by retropulsion, non-specific gait disorders, neurological signs (including akinesia, reactional hypertonia, and impaired reactive postural responses and protective reactions) and psychological disorders (fear of standing and walking as an acute feature or cognitive processing retardation and anhedonia as a chronic feature). PDS occurrence is linked to three factors implicated in functional reserve impairment due to frontal-sub-cortical structures disturbances: aging, chronic affections (mainly of degenerative or vascular origin), and acute organic or functional factors which induce cerebral blood flow decrease. Multidisciplinary management, including medical motor physiotherapy and psychological approach, is required for patients with PDS care.",

      "title": "Dreaming during REM sleep: autobiographically meaningful or a simple reflection of a Hebb'ian-based memory consolidation process?",
      "abstract": "REM sleep is a state of desynchronized electrophysiological activity of the brain. It is usually accompanied by mental activity characterized by a succession of complex visual experiences commonly referred to as dreaming. Although REM sleep and dreaming are not implicitly conjoined, when they co-occur, they have a very distinct phenomenology, as, typically, the dream plot is bizarre and incohesive which is mirrored in heightened brain activation coupled with strongly attenuated coherence levels. At the same time, owing to increased limbic system activity, REM sleep dreams are highly emotional. Moreover, concrete emotions are often unrelated to dream events. Nevertheless, REM sleep dreams are often subjectively perceived as story-like and autobiographically meaningful. Indeed, elements of salient life events, attachment figures, and personally relevant emotions, especially trauma, seem to have a higher probability of re-appearing in dreams, albeit the dream plot itself remains highly distorted. This has prompted several theories on the interpretability of dreams, some authors leaning towards dreams reflecting waking mentation, others suggesting complete dissociation between waking and dreaming, both sides not fully accounting for empirical findings. In this review, we provide an overview of recent findings on the factors mediating REM sleep neurophysiology and dream content. As a first step towards integration of conflicting research results, we introduce a testable model (Trace-Spur-model) based on Hebb'ian theory of neural networks, proposing that dream bizarreness is a function of state-related modulations in synaptic strength allowing for hyper-associative mental activity, possibly enabling either a restructuring and integrative consolidation or extinction of learning experiences acquired in waking. In this model, dreams are viewed as phenomenological expressions of this neurophysiologic activity where dream recall allows a fragmentary witnessing of such processes, similar to peeking into an enduring and complex networking system. However, the content of the recollected dream is probably strongly deterred by autobiographical memory bias, favoring those images we can form some sort of association with.",

      "abstract": "A person's well-being and health are greatly affected by disorders of sleep and wakefulness. It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

During NREM sleep, arousal-related phasic events tend to aggregate into the ordered sequences of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), which keeps the sleeping brain under control and provides a continuous balance between the programming centers (order) and the contingent psychological, organic and environmental factors (chaos). Due to its functional properties, CAP translates a condition of criticality and undergoes specific alterations in most sleep pathologies. The clinical applications of CAP are explored in sleep apnea syndrome, insomnia, narcolepsy, epilepsy, NREM and REM sleep parasomnias, as well as the involvement of CAP in cognitive processes and in critical care settings. During NREM sleep, the locus coeruleus (LC) exhibits infra-slow oscillatory activity with a periodicity that partially overlaps with that of CAP, suggesting a functional interaction between LC-driven noradrenergic rhythms and CAP dynamics. Through the structured collection of phasic events, CAP regulates sleep continuity, modulates responsiveness to internal and external stimuli and plays a coordinated activity in NREM sleep oscillations.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a multifaceted physiological and behavioral process that plays a crucial role in determining quality of life, inuencing both longevity and overall well-being. It is a state of rest for the otherwise active nervous system. It is dened as a state of unconsciousness from which a person can be aroused by appropriate sensory or any other stimulus (1). Sleep duration varies with gender, age and also according to one's daily routine. A lack of sleep, or sleep deprivation (SD), is a widespread phenomenon that can induce adverse changes in cognitive performance. Sleep duration is very important but sleep quality is often ignored factor. Sleep is very essential for learning, memory, attention, alertness, judgement, and overall health of an individual.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Trauma-associated sleep disorder (TASD) is a proposed parasomnia that, while sharing criteria with REM-behavior disorder (RBD) remains under-recognized by clinicians. It is more common in the veteran population, and lacks clear guidelines on treatment, especially when accompanied by dream enactment behavior. Report of case A 67 year-old Gulf War veteran presented to sleep clinic with over 30 years of frequent dream enactment behavior (DEB). He has a concurrent history of insomnia, depression, and PTSD. Military service lasted 23 years, with active combat 1990-1991. DEB started then, as frequently as 5-7 times weekly. Behaviors include throwing nearby items, jumping out of bed, crawling on the floor, swinging, and yelling. The patient can only intermittently recall corresponding dreams. He has no tremor, shuffling gait, or change in handwriting. Neurological exam showed no cogwheel rigidity or resting tremor. He was diagnosed with trauma-associated sleep disorder and started on melatonin in 2017. Even with doses up to 15 mg there was no effect on parasomnia frequency or intensity, or any effect on sleep length or latency. He tried prazosin and doxazosin without improvement. These were stopped for side effects. Nighttime nausea and dizziness from other medication prevented starting clonazepam. He was later started on amitriptyline, which helped with sleep onset, but did not affect parasomnia. The patient is averse to group therapy because hearing others’ trauma has previously made his nightmares worse. The planned treatment is 1-on-1 image rehearsal therapy. Conclusion TASD with DEB is a parasomnia not discussedin the ICSD-3-TR. Proposed mechanisms include hyperactivity in the locus coeruleus and peri-LC structures, as seen in PTSD, chronic stress, and psychiatric medications. TASD features nightmares that can occur in REM and NREM sleep and should be considered in any veteran with dream enactment. IRT is a non-pharmacologic treatment for PTSD-associated nightmares, but its effect on DEB is unclear, with only case reports. This patient has a decades-long history of DEB, but no signs of other neurological illnesses. The risk of evolution to true RBD and of developing alpha-synucleinopathies in these patients need to be clarified. Support (if any)",

      "title": "Complex visual hallucinations. Clinical and neurobiological insights",
      "abstract": "Complex visual hallucinations may affect some normal individuals on going to sleep and are also seen in pathological states, often in association with a sleep disturbance. The content of these hallucinations is striking and relatively stereotyped, often involving animals and human figures in bright colours and dramatic settings. Conditions causing these hallucinations include narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, peduncular hallucinosis, treated idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia without treatment, migraine coma, Charles Bonnet syndrome (visual hallucinations of the blind), schizophrenia, hallucinogen-induced states and epilepsy. We describe cases of hallucinosis due to several of these causes and expand on previous hypotheses to suggest three mechanisms underlying complex visual hallucinations. (i) Epileptic hallucinations are probably due to a direct irritative process acting on cortical centres integrating complex visual information. (ii) Visual pathway lesions cause defective visual input and may result in hallucinations from defective visual processing or an abnormal cortical release phenomenon. (iii) Brainstem lesions appear to affect ascending cholinergic and serotonergic pathways, and may also be implicated in Parkinson's disease. These brainstem abnormalities are often associated with disturbances of sleep. We discuss how these lesions, outside the primary visual system, may cause defective modulation of thalamocortical relationships leading to a release phenomenon. We suggest that perturbation of a distributed matrix may explain the production of similar, complex mental phenomena by relatively blunt insults at disparate sites.",

      "abstract": "Several studies over the years have demonstrated that sleep complaints in general, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), in particular, tend to be more prevalent among women. The 2007 Sleep in America poll of women age 40–60 years old found that 20% reported sleepiness that interfered with daily life (Chasens et al., Behav Sleep Med 8(3):157–71, 2010). This chapter discusses EDS due to primary sleep disorders other than Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) including Narcolepsy, Recurrent Hypersomnia, Idiopathic Hypersomnia, Behaviorally Induced Insufficient Sleep Syndrome as well as Hypersomnia Due to Medical condition and Hypersomnia Due to Drug or Substance. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the tetrad of EDS, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic/hypnapompic hallucinations. Recurrent hypersomnia is characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia often associated with other symptoms that typically last weeks or months apart. Episodes usually last a few days to several weeks and appear one to ten times a year. Sleep and general behavior must be normal between episodes. Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) and Menstrual-related hypersomnia are two distinct clinical subtypes of recurrent hypersomnia. Idiopathic hypersomnia is characterized by constant and severe excessive sleepiness. Naps are typically unrefreshing and post-awakening confusion (sleep drunkenness) is often reported. EDS is a very prevalent problem in developed societies. Women tend to complain more of EDS than men. This prevalence may partially be due to greater sleep deprivation, hormonal factors, and the higher incidence of some primary and secondary sleep disorders in women.",

Insomnia is associated with a disturbance in one or more of the three systems that regulate sleep: homeostatic, circadian and arousal. A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues. A number of treatment methods have been developed that use behavior modification and cognitive restructuring to facilitate homeostatic and circadian mechanisms of sleep, and to reduce arousal during bedtime. These methods actively engage the patient to implement life style changes, attitudes and beliefs that promote sleep.",

      "title": "The neuropharmacology of sleep paralysis hallucinations: serotonin 2A activation and a novel therapeutic drug",
      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis is a state of involuntary immobility occurring at sleep onset or offset, often accompanied by uncanny \"ghost-like\" hallucinations and extreme fear reactions. I provide here a neuropharmacological account for these hallucinatory experiences by evoking the role of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Research has shown that 5-HT2AR activation can induce visual hallucinations, \"mystical\" subjective states, and out-of-body experiences (OBEs), and modulate fear circuits. Hallucinatory experiences triggered by serotonin-serotonergic (\"pseudo\") hallucinations, induced by hallucinogenic drugs-tend to be \"dream-like\" with the experiencer having insight (\"meta-awareness\") that he is hallucinating, unlike dopaminergic (\"psychotic\" and \"life-like\") hallucinations where such insight is lost. Indeed, hallucinatory experiences during sleep paralysis have the classic features of serotonergic hallucinations, and are strikingly similar to perceptual and subjective states induced by hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin), i.e., they entail visual hallucinations, mystical experiences, OBEs, and extreme fear reactions. I propose a possible mechanism whereby serotonin could be functionally implicated in generating sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions through 5-HT2AR activity. Moreover, I speculate on the role of 5-HT2C receptors vis-à-vis anxiety and panic during sleep paralysis, and the orbitofrontal cortex-rich with 5-HT2A receptors-in influencing visual pathways during sleep paralysis, and, in effect, hallucinations. Finally, I propose, for the first time, a drug to target sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions, namely the selective 5-HT2AR inverse agonist, pimavanserin. This account implicates gene HTR2A on chromosome 13q as the underlying cause of sleep paralysis hallucinations and could be explored using positron emission tomography.",

      "abstract": "Camptocormia (a flexion of the trunk that only appears when standing or walking) affects a minority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). As it responds poorly to levodopa and is associated with reduced midbrain and pons volume, it may result from non-dopaminergic, brainstem lesions. As several sleep abnormalities in PD also result from non-dopaminergic brainstem lesions, we monitored sleep in 24 non-demented PD patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 12) camptocormia and in 12 controls. Nearly half (42%) patients with camptocormia had abnormal periodic leg movement indices (>15/h), versus 17% patients without camptocormia and 8% of controls (p = 0.02). In addition, the percentage of enhanced muscle activity during REM sleep (measured on the chin and on the limb muscles) tended to be higher in patients with than without camptocormia (51 +/- 39% vs. 20 +/- 25%, p = 0.06). The other sleep and REM sleep characteristics (sleep and REM sleep onset latencies, sleep time and sleep stage percentages, REMs density, arousal, and apnea-hypopnea indices) were not different between these two PD groups. Lesions causing this axial dystonia may spare the sleep systems but affect the control of movements during sleep.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

In this chapter, the authors review those parasomnias that may resemble a seizure disorder, with special attention to treatment. Classical childhood somnambulism is characterized by sleepwalking episodes, which usually occur in deep non-REM sleep. Typically, sleepwalking in children is a self-limited, developmental phenomenon without attendant somatic illness or psychopathology. A family history of sleepwalking or night terrors is usual, suggesting a genetic predisposition.

Although the prevalence of RLS has been estimated to be 1-5%, the condition is probably underdiagnosed and undertreated. Its onset may occur at any age, and there may be long periods of remission, but the condition is generally chronic. In its primary form, there is often a family history of the disorder suggestive of an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, where the results of EMG (electromyography) and nerve conduction studies are normal. In secondary forms, clinical signs and laboratory evidence of an associated abnormality are present. The most characteristic symptom of RLS is the spontaneous occurrence of paraesthesia or dysaesthesia during waking hours. The symptoms of RLS are worse or exclusively present during rest, and are partially or temporarily relieved by activity. About 80 per cent of RLS patients also suffer from 'periodic limb movements during sleep' (PLMS), which may cause microarousals during sleep. The diagnosis of RLS is based on characteristic clinical criteria, and the sleep disturbance is diagnosed polysomnographically. L-dopa and clonazepam have been found successful in the treatment of primary RLS, though lifelong treatment is often necessary.",

      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

With the onset of sleep, voluntary control of ventilation that overrides automatic control during wakefulness becomes terminated. Also ventilatory response to various stimuli including hypoxemia and hypercapnia is decreased. With these reasons respiration during sleep becomes fragile and unstable so that marked hypoxemia can be happened in patients with lung disease especially during REM sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea may also be developed if upper airway resistance is increased in addition to these blunted ventilatory responses.",

      "abstract": "The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) includes a constellation of symptoms, most prominently excessive daytime somnolence and unrefreshing sleep, associated with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The periodic respiratory events constituting SDB may be complete cessation of airflow (apneas), reductions in airflow of various degree (hypopneas), increased respiratory \"effort\" events with no increase in airflow (flow limitation events), or a combination of these events occurring at various times during the sleep period. Unrefreshing sleep and excessive daytime somnolence are thought to be because of disruption of the normal sleep architecture from recurrent brief arousals associated with the respiratory events, usually resulting in reduced \"deep\" (slow wave) and rapid eye movement sleep. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation, often severe, usually accompanies the respiratory events and may be a major factor in the cardiovascular morbidity associated with OSAHS. However, this satisfyingly simple and logical construct for OSHAS is likely an oversimplification. The lack of universally accepted criteria for defining a specific disease entity and the lack of certainty about the causal relationship of the various types of respiratory events and associated arousals/desaturations with symptoms and the pathophysiological consequences, limit the understanding of the prevalence, risk factors, and natural history of clinically important SDB.",

      "abstract": "L'oeil est un organe sensoriel complexe qui rassemble des informations sur notre environnement. Il peut etre modelise par un ensemble : diaphragme, lentille convergente et ecran. Les troubles de l'accommodation representent un effet indesirable oculaire, souvent mentionne dans les resumes des caracteristiques des medicaments. Ils peuvent se manifester de plusieurs facons, allant d'un simple inconfort en vision de loin ou de pres a des symptomes plus marques tels qu'une fatigue oculaire ou des cephalees. On definit les troubles de l'accommodation soit par : -­ Une perte ou une paralysie de l'accommodation qui s'explique par une gene ou une incapacite a lire de pres sans correction. Il s'agit d'une atteinte du muscle ciliaire et/ou a une mydriase par stimulation du nerf sympathique ou par inhibition du systeme parasympathique. -­ Un spasme d'accommodation a l'origine d'une myopie transitoire. Cela s'explique par la contraction permanente du muscle ciliaire et s'associe, en cas d'origine medicamenteuse, a un myosis par stimulation excessive du systeme parasympathique. Les medicaments parasympathomimetiques induisent ainsi un myosis actif, et les medicaments parasympatholytiques une mydriase passive. A l'inverse, les medicaments sympathomimetiques alpha-­adrenergiques provoquent une mydriase active, et les medicaments sympatholytiques alpha-­adrenergiques un myosis passif. Le but de ce travail a ete de faire l'etat des lieux bibliographique le plus large possible des medicaments a l'origine des troubles de l'accommodation. Cela permet d'apprehender les familles therapeutiques couramment decrites comme pourvoyeuses de troubles de l'accommodation et d'utilisation tres diverse (antihistaminiques, neuroleptiques, antiparkinsoniens, anticancereux, antidiabetiques, etc…), mais aussi d'autres molecules moins decrites. Le pharmacien est un acteur important dans la prise en charge des patients. Il permet, grâce a ses conseils, d'accompagner le patient en matiere d'effets indesirables et de lui signaler leur survenue eventuelle en matiere de vision. Afin de mieux maitriser les risques de troubles de l'accommodation, le pharmacien doit garder une formation continue, et etre vigilant quant aux risques que comporte chaque molecule commercialisee.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) is well established. However, the effects of DBS on nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are less clear.To review the published literature on nonmotor aspects of DBS for PD.The outcome of NMS after DBS in PD varies across studies. Some symptoms improve -sleep disorders, pain or sensory complaints, obsessive-compulsive disorder- and other aspects decline or appear -word fluency, apathy, body weight gain-. Isolated studies note mild improvements in working memory, visuomotor sequencing and conceptual reasoning, some gastrointestinal, urogenital, sweating and olfactory disturbances; whereas other studies have reported declines in verbal memory (long delay recall), visuospatial memory, processing speed and executive function; orthostatic hypotension remains without changes. The reasons for such a range of symptoms observed is due to the multifactorial etiology of the NMS, including preoperative vulnerability, changes in dopaminergic medications, surgical and stimulation effects, underlying PD-related factors and psychosocial effects. Specific patient subgroups may be at greater risk of cognitive deficits -e.g., those older than 69 years or with cognitive impairment prior to surgery- or depression, mania and suicide -e.g., those ones with preoperative psychiatric symptoms-.Patients who undergo DBS must be well-selected, weighing the risks and benefits, in order to obtain the best results with this treatment. Further multicentre studies are necessary to understand the role of DBS on NMS.",

      "title": "Sleep Physiology, Circadian Rhythms, Waking Performance and the Development of Sleep-Wake Therapeutics",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle are highly prevalent and diverse. The aetiology of some sleep disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, is understood at the conceptual level of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep and in part at a mechanistic level. Other disorders such as insomnia are more difficult to relate to sleep regulatory mechanisms or sleep physiology. To further our understanding of sleep-wake disorders and the potential of novel therapeutics, we discuss recent findings on the neurobiology of sleep regulation and circadian rhythmicity and its relation with the subjective experience of sleep and the quality of wakefulness. Sleep continuity and to some extent REM sleep emerge as determinants of subjective sleep quality and waking performance. The effects of insufficient sleep primarily concern subjective and objective sleepiness as well as vigilant attention, whereas performance on higher cognitive functions appears to be better preserved albeit at the cost of increased effort. We discuss age-related, sex and other trait-like differences in sleep physiology and sleep need and compare the effects of existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep- and wake-promoting treatments. Successful non-pharmacological approaches such as sleep restriction for insomnia and light and melatonin treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorders target processes such as sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Most pharmacological treatments of sleep disorders target specific signalling pathways with no well-established role in either sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythmicity. Pharmacological sleep therapeutics induce changes in sleep structure and the sleep EEG which are specific to the mechanism of action of the drug. Sleep- and wake-promoting therapeutics often induce residual effects on waking performance and sleep, respectively. The need for novel therapeutic approaches continues not at least because of the societal demand to sleep and be awake out of synchrony with the natural light-dark cycle, the high prevalence of sleep-wake disturbances in mental health disorders and in neurodegeneration. Novel approaches, which will provide a more comprehensive description of sleep and allow for large-scale sleep and circadian physiology studies in the home environment, hold promise for continued improvement of therapeutics for disturbances of sleep, circadian rhythms and waking performance.",

Methods Ten cases of RBD verifted by polysomnography(PSG)were analyzed retrospectively. Results All patients were senile or in middle ages and most of them were male.The main clinical features included violent movements,shouting and other abnormal behaviors occuring in dreams when they fell asleep.Four cases were diagnosed as Parkinsonism,2 as multiple system atrophy and 1 as cerebral trauma.The causes of another 3 cases were unknown.all symptoms of them were relieved by using clonazepam administered prior to sleep.The PSG of all cases showed a loss of normal muscular atonia and an appearance of EMG activities during REM sleep. Conclusions RBD should be considered when patients showed abnormal especially violent behaviors in sleep.PSG should be essential for its correct diagnosis and the differentiation from partial complex epilepsy.Clonazepam given prior to sleep should be effective for treatment.",

      "title": "Medical-Psychological Implications of Recent Sleep Research",
      "abstract": "Recent sleep research has shown that the conventional concept of sleep as a period of inactivity for recovery from fatigue is outmoded. Active neurophysiological mechanisms regulate the sleep cycle in a manner similar to other circadian rhythms. The slow wave (NREM) part of the sleep cycle appears to be involved in recovery from muscular fatigue; the dreaming (REM) part appears to be involved in psychological adaptation to life events. Since most hypnotic drugs suppress REM sleep, they should be used after careful consideration of the possible psychological effects. For example, some depressions may be alleviated by agents which suppress dreaming at the cost of isolating the patient from his inner emotional life. Chloral hydrate, chlordiazepoxide, and diazepam avoid this problem because they do not affect REM sleep. Some sleep disorders like severe nightmares may be treated by suppressing deep NREM sleep. Other disorders like enuresis and narcolepsy appear to be psychosomatic conditions and require a medical psychological-approach. There is some evidence that methods which increase or substitute for REM sleep may eventually be useful in facilitating emotional adjustment.",

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

      "abstract": "Neurological outcome after preterm birth refers to neurologically defined conditions due to disorders of the motor system – e.g. spasticity, dyskinesia or ataxia – which are commonly summarized under the term “cerebral palsy” (CP). Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW. This means that CP following preterm birth, or brain compromise affecting the motor system, is probably related to a pathomechanism specifically affecting the immature brain, which stresses the importance of gaining insight into the following questions:",

      "title": "1699 – Long lasting personality changes after the onset of dissociative amnesia",
      "abstract": "Across various cultures, dissociative amnesia is triggered by psychological stress or trauma. Its hallmark is a severe (usually retrograde) memory impairment, occurring without evidence of significant brain damage (as detected by conventional structural brain imaging). In a substantial number of cases, the memory impairment follows a chronic course. Sometimes dissociative amnesia occurs on a background of a personality disorder (narcissistic or borderline). Other times, amnesia itself triggers long lasting personality changes. This work's objectives are establishing greater recognition among health care providers of the spectrum of the personality changes that may accompany chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. We review data from own patients with chronic forms of dissociative amnesia. Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically, neuropsychologically and and neuroradiologically. Changes in personality dimensions occur after the onset of amnesia. These may involve affectivity, perception (e.g. impaired self face or face-emotion processing), cognition (e.g. social cognition) and behaviour (e.g. changing in eating, smoking, drinking or working habits). The observed personality changes may represent a consequence of amnesia. Functional imaging studies show metabolic changes in dissociative amnesia in brain areas involved in conscious mnemonic processing. Several structures engaged in processing within episodic-autobiographical memory system were also implicated in self and reward-related processing. Alternatively, the personality changes may be viewed as being pivotal in the development and maintenance of dissociative amnesia; this personality shift may subsequently lead to enduring changes in ways of cognitive processing, self-processing, perception and affect.",

Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep at night for many hours or inability to have a sound sleep, which deprives one of natural rest and interferes with activities during the day. Each of us has suffered a restless night at some point in our lives. We’ve all occasionally sacrificed sleep for a cram session before an exam, or an important deadline. Many of us also know the feeling of losing sleep due to an intense emotional upset or the accumulation of stress or anxiety. For some of us, loss of sleep is short-lived; for others, it is chronic and we’ve come to anticipate losing sleep on a regular basis. Insomnia can be caused by elevated or chronic stress, illness, physical discomfort, environmental factors, changes in our schedules, side effects from prescribed medications, depression, anxiety, and…",

      "abstract": "Seizures and epilepsy commonly occur in patients with organ system failure, either as a consequence of trophic effects on cerebral function or of therapies used in such conditions. Acute organ failure results in an abrupt, but often reversible, lowering of seizure threshold, whereas chronic organ failure results in more pervasive and indolent cerebral compromise, often permanently altering both the seizure threshold and the physiologic responses to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Failure of an organ system is not typically a sudden, all-or-none phenomenon but occurs in stages with variable susceptibility to seizures as the condition worsens or remits. Although the principles of diagnosis and management of seizures in adult and pediatric patients with a specific organ dysfunction are similar, the underlying etiologies and influences of comorbid conditions differ between adults and children. Adult organ failure often involves multiple systems to different extents and is superimposed on other chronic diseases of adulthood. Pediatric organ failure is usually the result of inherited metabolic disorders, infections, and unique pediatric susceptibilities to metabolic effects of medications (Table 1).",

      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a prevalent complaint among patients in psychiatric and medical care. Patients with EDS have often been misdiagnosed with depression due to their complaints of lack of energy and poor concentration. Also, they have even been diagnosed erroneously with a psychotic disorder in case of coexistence with hypnagogic hallucination. EDS can seriously affect the person's quality of life by causing decreased academic achievement or work performance, low self esteem, and social withdrawal. EDS is also frequently associated with various medical and psychiatric conditions, and often fatal traffic or on-the-job accidents. The causes of EDS range from insufficient sleep to central nervous system-originated hypersomnia. The conditions that can lead to EDS include circadian rhythm disorders, primary disorders of alertness such as narcolepsy, sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, sleep-related movement disorders such as periodic limb movement disorder and restless legs syndrome, chronic medical conditions such as cancer, and medications causing sleepiness. Treatment options should be tailored according to the underlying condition and include sufficient sleep time, light therapy, sleep scheduling, wakefulness-promoting medications, or mechanical airway managements such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).",

Sleep disorders result from multiple factors--including pharmacologic, physiologic, biologic, and behavioral--and can be mildly debilitating or life-threatening. Diagnosis includes consideration of the presence of physical or mental illness, drug and/or alcohol use or abuse, a primary sleep disorder such as sleep-disordered breathing or periodic limb movements during sleep, changes in circadian rhythms, or poor sleep hygiene. Despite a high rate of use, hypnotics are best suited for periodic rather than chronic sleep disorder symptoms and, in general, should be used only after adjustments in sleep hygiene prove unsuccessful as first-line therapy.",

The prevalence of PD increases with increasing age and in the UK is ∼150 per 100 000 population with incidence of 10.8 cases of PD per 100 000 population. The mean age of onset of PD is in the seventies. The diagnosis of PD is based on the presence of bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes all of which are likely to be asymmetrical. It is now recognised that PD is much more than a motor disorder, having a spectrum of non-motor symptoms, which may occur prior to the onset of the motor signs. The non-motor symptoms of PD may have more impact on long term quality of life compared with the motor symptoms1. Non motor symptoms include autonomic impairment (eg constipation, sweating, urinary problems, dribbling and dysphagia) psychiatric problems (eg depression, dementia, psychosis), sleep disturbances (eg sleep behaviour disorder), sensory disturbances, nutritional problems and problems of balance and falls. This chapter will focus on the depression in PD (dPD) which is the most common psychiatric non-motor symptom of PD. dPD is associated with a poor quality of life, excess disability, carer stress and treatment of depression can reduce functional disability\"",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related painful erections (SRPE) are characterized by penile pain occurring during nocturnal erections, without apparent penile pathology. Sleep loss caused by the disorder may result in severe anxiety, mood disorders, irritability, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Until now, the phenomenon of SRPE has not been well understood. The rarity of the published cases probably does not reflect the actual prevalence, which is presumably over 1 percent. Because of the bizarre nature of the complaints, patients are often referred to a psychiatrist. The authors present the case of a 69-year-old patient, who, during frequent nocturnal awakenings, experienced hard-to-define burning, tingling sensations in symmetric hypogastric localisation. Sometimes the skin of both legs, and, occasionally, the arms and hands was involved, too. Initially, however, no definite erection-associated penile pain was present. Micturating quite a small amount just after awakening consistently resulted in immediate and complete relief. After two years, painful nocturnal erections reoccurring at stable intervals of 90–120 minutes during sleep developed to be the leading complaint. In default of urological or gastroenterological pathology, the patient has been referred to a psychiatrist. Quite futilely, mianserin and alprazolam, later sertralin and carbamazepine, respectively, were administered. Clozapine has also been tried out; however, it has to be rejected due to some adverse effects. Finally, 10 mg baclofen in the evening resulted in complete and permanent remission. This is consonant with the literature data stating that only clonazepam, baclofen and clozapine are likely to have long term beneficial effects in SRPE.",

Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

      "title": "The impact of stress on sleep: Pathogenic sleep reactivity as a vulnerability to insomnia and circadian disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep reactivity is the trait-like degree to which stress exposure disrupts sleep, resulting in difficulty falling and staying asleep. Individuals with highly reactive sleep systems experience drastic deterioration of sleep when stressed, whereas those with low sleep reactivity proceed largely unperturbed during stress. Research shows that genetics, familial history of insomnia, female gender and environmental stress influence how the sleep system responds to stress. Further work has identified neurobiological underpinnings for sleep reactivity involving disrupted cortical networks and dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Sleep reactivity is most pathologically and clinically pertinent when in excess, such that high sleep reactivity predicts risk for future insomnia disorder, with early evidence suggesting high sleep reactivity corresponds to severe insomnia phenotypes (sleep onset insomnia and short sleep insomnia). High sleep reactivity is also linked to risk of shift-work disorder, depression and anxiety. Importantly, stress-related worry and rumination may exploit sensitive sleep systems, thereby augmenting the pathogenicity of sleep reactivity. With the development of cost-effective assessment of sleep reactivity, we can now identify individuals at risk of future insomnia, shift-work disorder and mental illness, thus identifying a target population for preventive intervention. Given that insomniacs with high sleep reactivity tend to present with severe insomnia phenotypes, patient sleep reactivity may inform triaging to different levels of treatment. Future research on sleep reactivity is needed to clarify its neurobiology, characterize its long-term prospective associations with insomnia and shift-work disorder phenotypes, and establish its prognostic value for mental illness and other non-sleep disorders.",

Not all patients have all symptoms. When cataplexy is present, the disorder is almost always due to a destruction by the immune system of about 70,000 brain cells that produce a chemical called hypocretin. As this chemical helps in staying awake and regulating sleep and muscle tone, the lack of hypocretin explains all the symptoms of narcolepsy. In these cases of narcolepsy, the disease is life-long and does not resolve. When cataplexy is not present, many causes may be involved and the diagnosis is more difficult. Evolution and response to treatment are also more variable. Narcolepsy is diagnosed using sleep tests, biochemical measures and occasionally by measuring hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after a lumbar puncture. Current treatments involve medication and behavioral, life styles changes.",

However, these complex behaviors can also occur in other sleep disorders, a clinical situation termed as \"pseudo-RBD\". Anecdotal reports of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome simulating the clinical features of RBD have been reported. It has been suggested that \"pseudo-RBD\" is a form of a confusional arousal caused by a combination of severe oxyhemoglobin desaturations and other unknown factors. However, there have been no previous reports of RBD-like behaviors associated with central sleep apnea. Here, we describe two patients who reported complex motor and vocal behavior mimicking RBD, but REM sleep without atonia was not observed in video-polysomnography (VPSG). Furthermore, VPSG demonstrated severe central sleep apnea-hypopnea inducing abnormal motor and vocal behaviors.

      "title": "Relationship between the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states and reports of anomalous experiences.",
      "abstract": "A whole range of anomalous experiences (1) has been reported during the hypnagogic or hypnopompic states that surround periods of sleep. It is not uncommon for people to experience brief, vivid, and often strange imagery or to find themselves temporarily unable to move or speak during these periods between wakefulness and sleep. These brief sensations and the temporary paralysis are known as hypnagogic or hypnopompic imagery and sleep paralysis, (2) respectively (American Sleep Disorders Association [ASDA], 1990). Recent surveys found that people who report more childhood experiences of hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery or sleep paralysis also report a greater number of anomalous experiences during childhood or adulthood (Sherwood, 1999, 2000). More specifically, hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery has been associated with reports of extrasensory perception (ESP), apparitions and communication with the dead, out-of-the-body experiences (OBEs), visions of past lives, and experiences involving extraterrestrials (e.g., Glicksohn, 1989; Gurney, Myers, & Podmore, 1886; Leaning, 1925; Mavromatis, 1983, 1987; McCreery, 1993; McKellar, 1957; Spanos, Cross, Dickson, & DuBreuil, 1993). In addition to the above anomalous experiences, sleep paralysis has also been associated with reports of psychokinesis (PK) and near-death experiences (NDEs) (Baker, 1992; Green & McCreery, 1994; Rose & Blackmore, 1996; Rose, Hogan, & Blackmore, 1997; Spanos et al., 1993; Spanos, McNulty, DuBreuil, Pires, & Burgess, 1995). The question is: are the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states conducive to anomalous processes and events or are normal hypnagogic/hypnopompic features being misinterpreted? Perhaps both statements are true? The aim of this article is to consider evidence for each of these possibilities. First, it is necessary to outline the characteristics of the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states and the features of some of the experiences that can occur within them. CHARACTERISTICS OF HYPNAGOGIC/HYPNOPOMPIC STATES Most research, both experimental and survey-based, seems to have focused on the hypnagogic state (the period between wakefulness and sleep, i.e., just as a person is falling asleep). Comparatively little research has been carried out on the hypnopompic state (the period between sleep and wakefulness, i.e., just as a person is waking from sleep). Thus, this article focuses mainly on the hypnagogic state. The hypnagogic state, like the sleep state, is fairly complex and contains a number of steps and stages (Mavromatis, 1983; Rechtschaffen, 1994). Hori, Hayashi, and Morikawa (1994) concluded that the sleep onset period is unique and cannot be accurately categorised as either waking or sleeping. It is very difficult to determine the precise point of falling asleep, except by using arbitrary criteria, because the transition is gradual, because the changes are not always synchronised, and because there are large individual differences in when the changes occur (Lavie, 1996; Rechtschaffen, 1994). During alert wakefulness, eye movements are fairly rapid, and the normal EEC trace consists of irregular waves of high frequency (Bray, Cragg, Macknight, Mills, & Taylor, 1992). As a person relaxes or becomes drowsy, there is an increase in alpha activity (8-12 Hz), and eye movements become slower and less frequent (Parker, 1975; Rechtschaffen, 1994). In fact, the presence of slow eye movements is considered to be an extremely accurate indicator of hypnagogic mentation (Schacter, 1976). Stickgold and Hobson (1994) found that as the period of eyelid movement quiescence lengthens, that is, as the eyelids move less, mentation becomes more dreamlike. This contrasts with the positive association between eyelid movements and dreamlike mentation during REM sleep. As a person passes through the hypnagogic period into the early stages of non-REM sleep, there is a decline in alpha activity and a concomitant increase in slower theta activity (4-7 Hz; Baddia, Wright, & Wauquier, 1994; Bray et al. …",

      "abstract": "Disturbances in sleep and wakefulness are important symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and are associated with negative effects on patients' quality of life. The analysis of literature on the relationship between RLS and PD revealed three main hypotheses explaining the relatively high incidence of RLS in PD: (1) RLS can be considered as an early (prodromal) manifestation or a predictor of PD that can outpace its main symptoms by several years (by analogy with conduct disorder during sleep with REM); (2) the high incidence of RLS in the advanced stage of PD may be associated with augmentation of previously latent RLS symptoms during prolonged dopaminergic therapy of PD; (3) a significant proportion of RLS cases in PD patients are not «classical» RLS, but represent, for example, manifestations of motor or non-motor fluctuations or a special form of stereotypy in the legs. Further research is needed to determine if any of these statements are true.Нарушения сна и бодрствования являются важными симптомами болезни Паркинсона (БП), которые отрицательно влияют на качество жизни пациентов. Проведенные в обзоре данные свидетельствуют о существовании трех основных гипотез, касающихся взаимоотношения СБН и БП. Согласно первой из них СБН можно рассматривать как раннее (продромальное) проявление или предиктор БП, способный опережать ее основные симптомы на несколько лет (по аналогии с расстройством поведения во сне с БДГ); в соответствии со второй гипотезой, высокая частота СБН на развернутой стадии БП может быть связана с аугментацией ранее латентных симптомов СБН на фоне длительной дофаминергической терапии БП; третья гипотеза допускает, что значительная часть случаев СБН у пациентов с БП не является «классическим» СБН, а представляет собой, например, проявления моторных или немоторных флуктуаций либо особой формы стереотипии в ногах. Дальнейшие исследования необходимы, чтобы определить, является ли хотя бы одно из этих утверждений верным.",

      "abstract": "In the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), sleep related rhythmic movement disorder (RMD) is classified as a disorder characterized by rhythmic movements of large muscle groups in different parts of the body. These are repetitive, stereotyped, rhythmic motor behaviors that occur predominantly during drowsiness or sleep,and are typically seen in infants and children. Episodes often occur at sleep onset, at any time during the night, and during quiet wakeful activities at a frequency of 0.5-2 sec), lasting <15 min. The prevalence is high in infants (59%), dropping to 5% at the age of 5 years. When persisting to older childhood or beyond, association with mental retardation, autism, or other significant pathology is reported. Few cases in adults of normal intelligence have been reported in the literature. There is a strong association with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, suggesting a similar pathogenetic mechanism. There is also one adult case report occurring during strictly REM sleep. Mayer et al reported 24 subjects with RMD that persisted into adolescence and adulthood. Twenty of the subjects were adults, and 16 of them had the condition since childhood. Of these 20, 16 had no other sleep disorders (but 2 had a family history of RMD), and 4 had obstructive sleep apnea. This was the first ever report of familial RMD.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in patients with Parkinson’s disease: It’s time to wake up!",
      "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop a range of non-motor symptoms (NMS). Sleep disturbance is one of the common NMS of PD and the onset of sleep disorders often precede the onset of motor symptoms of PD. Motor symptoms of PD often receive the main clinical focus and the sleep disturbances often go unnoticed in clinical practice. Given that the prevalence of PD is higher in the elderly population, primary care physicians, geriatricians, and gerontologists are usually the first point of contact for a majority of patients with PD. Because of this, it is important that they have a clear understanding about the diagnosis and management of the sleep disturbances in PD. This review provides an overview of the full spectrum of sleep disturbances in PD that includes insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movements, and obstructive sleep apnea. Although these sleep disorders may be primarily associated with PD, it is crucial to delineate the other treatable causes of sleep disturbances such as side effects of medications and physical symptoms not related to PD. This review highlights the major sleep disorders observed in patients with PD and succinctly discusses their management aspects. In addition, we have briefly described the effect of deep brain stimulation on the natural course of several sleep disorders in PD in this article.",

      "abstract": "Drivers' sleepiness and falling asleep while driving account for a considerable proportion of vehicle accidents (studies show different results from 1% to 30%). Sleepiness is rarely well recognised as a causing factor of traffic accidents. 2.5% up to 20% people suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) with sleep deprivation as its most frequent cause. There is a strong association between sleep deprivation and medical problems--especially sleep disturbances. The sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) has been identified as the most common cause of habitual drowsy driving. Patients with SAS (apart from other health problems) are 6 times more likely to have accidents. After adequate treatment of severe SAS with continuous positive airway pressure the risk of accident lowered 5 x. Other important sleep disturbances include chronic insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement in sleep. Sleepiness was described in Parkinson's disease, dementia, epilepsy, in chronic cardiacs and in people with complex internal health problems. Regular or single intake of drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistaminics, antipsychotics and others) can itself induce sleep problems. Sleepiness in persons without sleep disorder may occur due to preventable causes such as poor sleep habits which lead to sleep deprivation.",

      "title": "The ICSD-3 and DSM-5 guidelines for diagnosing narcolepsy: clinical relevance and practicality",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disease manifesting as difficulty with maintaining continuous wake and sleep. Clinical presentation varies but requires excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) occurring alone or together with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep dissociation (e.g., cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with reductions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin due to destruction of hypocretin peptide-producing neurons in the hypothalamus in individuals with a specific genetic predisposition. Updated diagnostic criteria include the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Sleep Disorders Third Edition (ICSD-3). DSM-5 criteria require EDS in association with any one of the following: (1) cataplexy; (2) CSF hypocretin deficiency; (3) REM sleep latency ≤15 minutes on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG); or (4) mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) with ≥2 sleep-onset REM-sleep periods (SOREMPs). ICSD-3 relies more upon objective data in addition to EDS, somewhat complicating the diagnostic criteria: 1) cataplexy and either positive MSLT/PSG findings or CSF hypocretin deficiency; (2) MSLT criteria similar to DSM-5 except that a SOREMP on PSG may count as one of the SOREMPs required on MSLT; and (3) distinct division of narcolepsy into type 1, which requires the presence of cataplexy or documented CSF hypocretin deficiency, and type 2, where cataplexy is absent, and CSF hypocretin levels are either normal or undocumented. We discuss limitations of these criteria such as variability in clinical presentation of cataplexy, particularly when cataplexy may be ambiguous, as well as by age; multiple and/or invasive CSF diagnostic test requirements; and lack of normative diagnostic test data (e.g., MSLT) in certain populations. While ICSD-3 criteria reflect narcolepsy pathophysiology, DSM-5 criteria have greater clinical practicality, suggesting that valid and reliable biomarkers to help standardize narcolepsy diagnosis would be welcomed.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Parkinson's disease (PD) patients demonstrate a variety of sleep/wake complaints. Some of these are associated with dopaminergic dysfunction, some presumed to arise from nondopaminergic PD pathology, some from PD treatments and, in some, the etiologies are multifactorial or unknown. Optimal management of sleep/wake problems requires a good understanding of sleep/wake principals in the PD population, as there are few controlled trials to dictate therapy. In this article, we review the main causes of sleep/wake disorders in PD patients, namely sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement of sleep, rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder and sleep apnea. Available therapies and management recommendations for each disorder are given particular emphasis.",

The most common type of syncope is neurally mediated syncope. History-taking should include questions about the circumstances before the syncope attack, and about body position. Specifically to inquire whether (a) the patient was supine, sitting, or standing; (b) the patient was active, at rest, or changed posture; (c) the syncope occurred during urination, defecation, cough, or swallowing; (d) the presence of predisposing factors (e.g., a crowded or warm environment, prolonged standing, or sudden excruciating pain); and the timing of the event (e.g., the immediate postprandial period). For the neurologist, specific questions about a prior neurologic history such as Parkinson’s disease, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, epilepsy, or the possibility of narcolepsy should be asked. Syncope and seizures are not always clearly distinguished, and guidance is provided.",

      "title": "Neurodegenerative diseases and sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The interest in sleep disorders associated with neurodegenerative diseases is growing. Indeed, they add up to the clinical features of each of these conditions and may bring insight into their mechanisms. Along this line one of the major findings in recent years has been that REM-sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) has a predilection for synucleinopathies including idiopathic Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies, though not for tauopathies. We have reviewed neurodegenerative diseases without dementia (with the exception of idiopathic Parkinson's disease reviewed in another article of the same issue) and neurodegenerative diseases with dementia, in considering clinical features, pathologic patterns, associated sleep disorders and their treatments. Multiple system atrophy is characterised by rather severe breathing abnormalities, including obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome, dysrhythmic breathing and laryngeal stridor, and by REM-sleep behaviour disorder which may precede the onset of clinical features of multiple system atrophy by several years. Insomnia is the most common sleep-related symptom of progressive supranuclear palsy. It is generally more severe than in other neurodegenerative diseases. Polysomnography shows the progressive shortening of sleep. Rapid eye movements of REM sleep are abnormal. Sleep disorders have not been systematically investigated in corticobasal degeneration. The most efficient therapeutic approaches of these conditions include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the case of sleep breathing abnormalities and clonazepam for REM-sleep behaviour disorder. Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease with dementia. Sleep is both reduced and disorganised. Sleep-related breathing disorders are common. Special features of Alzheimer's disease are sundowning''. an agitation behaviour occurring during the early evening and episodic nocturnal wandering. In frontotemporal dementia sleep disorders are comparable to those of other dementias with aspecific impairment of sleep continuity and architecture. In comparison with other dementias, dementia with Lewy bodies leads to more severe sleep disturbances, including more movement disorders whilst asleep, more excessive daytime sleepiness and REM-sleep behaviour disorder characteristic of a synucleinopathy. Current treatments fall into four categories: identifying and treating any medical factor of impaired sleep, using sedative medications as parcimoniously as possible, environmental and circadian manipulations.",

      "abstract": "The commonest and simplest operational definition of consciousness is, the state of the patient’s awareness of self and environment and his responsiveness to external stimulation and inner need. Therefore, unconsciousness has the opposite meaning, that is, a state of unawareness of self and environment or a suspension of those mental activities by which people are made aware of themselves and their environment, coupled with a diminished responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness can have many different causes, for example, stroke, traumatic brain injury, anesthesia, brainstem lesions and sleep, the various causes of unconsciousness primarily interfering with different brain functions. Clinically, impaired consciousness such as coma, vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) is a very common manifestation in subjects with acquired brain injury. Unconsciousness does not always consist of a general suppression of the entire activity of the central nervous system. Depending on the actual cause(s), many functions, such as protective reflexes and various cognitive processes, can remain intact. The Management of such a patient in VS or MCS requires carefully reaching the correct diagnosis, pronouncing an evidence-based prognosis, and thoughtfully considering the medical, ethical, and legal elements of optimum treatment (Bernat, 2006).",

When these signaling pathways are deficient or interrupted (e.g., by a hypoxic-ischemic event), the neurons do not migrate to the proper areas of the brain.

When the restriction extends to 2 weeks, it can reach levels of impairment that are comparable to 2 nights in total sleep deprivation, resulting in problems in memory consolidation, as well as impaired attention, learning and executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, self-monitoring, impulsiveness, planning and inhibition, and social cognition). Although the association between sleep restriction and memory disorders is well known, there is insufficient information regarding alterations in executive functions, specifically those of social cognition in subjects with sleep restriction. Social cognition involves those human skills necessary to successfully interact in a social environment and according to recent research, it can be affected if people cannot sleep.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders (CRSWD) are sleep dysfunctions related to circadian functioning. They are characterized by symptoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness that occur because the intrinsic circadian pacemaker is not entrained to a 24-h light/dark cycle. Affected individuals with a free-running disorder or hypernycthemeral syndrome (N24SWD) have a longer sleep–wake cycle that produces a sleep pattern that typically delays each day. The disorder is seen in 70% of blind people, and among people with healthy vision, it is a rare pathology. Among sighted cases, 80% are young men and 28% have a psychiatric disorder. The patient was a 14-year-old boy with a psychiatric pathology diagnosed with a PANDAS syndrome (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci), a sudden acute and debilitating onset of intense anxiety and mood lability accompanied by obsessive compulsive-like issues and/or tics, in association with a streptococcal A infection that occurs immediately prior to the symptoms. As a comorbidity, he exhibited severe insomnia due to an irregular sleep pattern that strongly delayed his sleep schedule day to day. It affected his daily routines, as he was not going to school, and aggravated, furthermore, the psychiatric symptoms. He was referred for sleep consultation, where the case was explored by ambulatory circadian monitoring (ACM) using the novel system Kronowise ® (Chronolab, University of Murcia) and diagnosed with a non-24-h sleep–wake disorder (N24SWD). The first treatment approach for the patient was focused on improving symptoms during the acute infection and psychiatric symptoms. Additionally, sleep pathology was treated by light therapy and melatonin. After 8 months and different trials, it was possible to establish a treatment to normalize the symptoms and fix his sleep rhythm in a normal schedule as well as to reduce anxious symptoms during the day. The association of PANDAS and N24SWD has not previously been reported in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Children born very preterm are at a greater risk of abnormal visual and neurological development when compared to children born at full term. Preterm birth is associated with retinopathy of prematurity (a proliferative retinal vascular disease) and can also affect the development of brain structures associated with post‐retinal processing of visual information. Visual deficits common in children born preterm, such as reduced visual acuity, strabismus, abnormal stereopsis and refractive error, are likely to be detected through childhood vision screening programs, ophthalmological follow‐up or optometric care. However, routine screening may not detect other vision problems, such as reduced visual fields, impaired contrast sensitivity and deficits in cortical visual processing, that may occur in children born preterm. For example, visual functions associated with the dorsal visual processing stream, such as global motion perception and visuomotor integration, may be impaired by preterm birth. These impairments can continue into adolescence and adulthood and may contribute to the difficulties in learning (particularly reading and mathematics), attention, behaviour and cognition that some children born preterm experience. Improvements in understanding the mechanisms by which preterm birth affects vision will inform future screening and interventions for children born preterm.",

Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

      "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed on the basis of motor symptoms, including slowness of movement, tremor, rigidity and difficulties with balance and walking, now we are aware that non-motor symptoms are highly prevalent, since they can anticipate motor symptoms and can cause severe consequences. Several studies have shown that non-motor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and apathy, psychosis (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), sleep disturbance, and pain may have a greater adverse impact on quality of life and health economics compared with motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms can be divided into four domains: neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression, anxiety, apathy, hallucinations, dementia), autonomic (e.g., constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary changes, sweating abnormalities), sleep (e.g., insomnia, sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement, sleep behavioural disorder, restless leg syndrome), and sensory dysfunction (e.g., pain, olfactory dysfunction). This review addresses diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. The causative mechanisms remain complex, since they reflect the widespread brainstem and cortical pathology of PD, with involvement of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. The diagnosis is often challenging, especially for psychiatric disorders, and in particular affective disorders, because somatic features of psychopathology may overlap with the movement disorder itself. Treatments used are limited and psychiatric drugs may not be as effective as in general population. Evidence based medicine is quite poor and it still requires well-designed clinical studies.",

This is where narcolepsy is characterized by “excessive daytime sleepiness that is typically associated with cataplexy (i.e., narcolepsy with cataplexy) and/or with abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. Since the abnormalities seen in narcolepsy cannot be explained independently from occurrences of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sleep fragmentations, pathophysiological aspects of these symptoms are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Sleep/wake disorders are common in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, sometimes the most prominent or sole initial symptom, then delaying diagnosis. Sleep/wake disorders in autoimmune encephalitis vary and include severe sleeplessness, hypersomnia, central and/or obstructive sleep apnea, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, indeterminate sleep/wake states, and loss of circadian sleep/wake rhythms. N-methyl- d aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDAR) is often associated with insomnia, then hypersomnia and sleep-related central hypoventilation. Profound sleeplessness and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are seen in patients with voltage-gated potassium channel-complex antibodies. Fragmented sleep and hypersomnia are common in paraneoplastic syndromes associated with anti-MA protein encephalitis; rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in those with antibodies against leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein (LGI1) or contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2) antibodies. Antibodies against a cell adhesion protein IGLON5 may result in obstructive sleep apnea, inspiratory stridor, disorganized nonrapid eye movement sleep, and excessive movements and parasomnias fragmenting nonrapid and rapid eye movement sleep. Recognizing a particular sleep/wake disorder is often a presenting or prominent feature in certain autoimmune encephalitis permit for earlier diagnosis. This is important because reduced morbidity and better short- and long-term outcomes are associated with earlier diagnosis and immunotherapies.",

OSAHS is caused by blockage of the airway, typically when the soft tissue at the back of the throat collapses during sleep due to lack of muscle tone, predominantly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. OSAHS is common and is one extreme of a continuum of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) (Young et al., 1993) that ranges from normality with few obstructive events, to a life-threatening condition, which may present with cardiovascular, respiratory, or sleep related symptoms (Shneerson, 2000). OSAHS differs from central sleep apnoea, which is caused by problems with brain mechanisms that control breathing and can be found in patients with cardiac failure or neurological disease, particularly stroke (Douglas, 2002) (see ‘Stroke’).",

Dream-enacting behaviors can also occur in patients with other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This clinical situation has been termed âpseudo-RBDâ. In contrast, OSA causes frequent arousal, which may consequently result in masking of RBD symptoms. We reported two patients with severe OSA, who were initially diagnosed with âpseudo-RBDâ but on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration, rediagnosed with âtrue-RBDâ. When RBD is clinically suspected but is not confirmed by diagnostic overnight polysomnography, we have to keep in mind that RBD could be detected during CPAP titration.

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep physiology begins with development of the sleep/wake cycle, and the origins of active versus quiet sleep. The 24-hour circadian cycle becomes established at 3-6 months. Sleep disorders during infancy commonly include mild, usually self-limited conditions such as sleep-onset association disorder, excessive nighttime feedings, and poor limit-setting. These require behavioral management to avoid long-term deleterious sleep habits. In contrast, other sleep disorders are more ominous, including SIDS, central congenital hypoventilation syndrome, and sleep apnea. Childhood is generally considered the golden age of sleep, with brief latency to sleep onset, high efficiency, and easy awakening. Yet parasomnias, psychological factors, and sleep disturbances associated with common disorders such as ADHD disrupt the idealistic notion of childhood being a period of unfettered sleep. Adolescents have sleep requirements similar to adults, posing a challenge for them to adapt to school schedules and increasingly demanding lifestyles. Narcolepsy, usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood, is a lifelong sleep disorder and has led to the identification of the hypocretin/orexin neurotransmitter system. Research advances in the complex interrelationships between developmental neurobiology, sleep disorders and behavior will lead to an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of sleep problems and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for sleep disturbances in children.",

Numerosas alteraciones metabolicas pueden ser responsables de los trastornos de la conciencia en el postoperatorio, aunque la mayoria no surgen de forma espontanea en el intraoperatorio(2,3). Por ello, una exploracion neurologica superficial es obligada en todo paciente que ingresa y egresa de sala de quirofano, y una determinacion de parametros bioquimicos puede ser necesaria (examenes de laboratorio), asi como la revision detallada de los antecedentes personales y de los acontecimientos intraoperatorios, siempre que no exista un suceso que justifique el problema. La disfuncion cognitiva postoperatoria es un sindrome especifico conocido, con una incidencia que oscila en forma muy variada; segun las diferentes estadisticas, se encuentra entre 0% hasta 79% dependiendo de multiples variables como son el tipo de cirugia, periodo estudiado, poblacion y tipo de test psicologico que se haya implementado. Dado que el deficit cognitivo puede acompanarse de aumento de la morbilidad, sus repercusiones sobre la estadia en el hospital y el costo por paciente pueden ser importantes(4-6). El MMS fue desarrollado por Folstein, et al. (1975) como un metodo practico para facilitar al clinico el graduar el estado cognoscitivo del paciente y poder detectar demencia o delirium. El MMS evalua la orientacion espacial y temporal, el recuerdo inmediato (fijacion), la memoria a medio termino y habilidades de sustraccion serial o el deletreo hacia atras. Tambien mide capacidades constructivas (la habilidad de copiar una figura de Bender), y el uso del lenguaje. La puntuacion total se obtiene sumando los puntos alcanzados en cada tarea y puede ir de 0 a 30(7-9). Una puntuacion entre 27 y 30 puntos se considera normal, de 25 o 26 indica sospecha patologica, de 12 a 24 se considera como deterioro, mientras que una puntuacion de 9 a 12 indica demencia.",

      "abstract": "This chapter finds that Parkinson’s disease (PD) manifests itself in the agentic self impairments, which emerge due to weak cognitive processes and lack of coordination in neural networks. The impaired agentic self gives rise to anxiety and restlessness, resulting in problematic sleeping or sleep behavior disorder (SBD) in PD patients. Patients suffering from SBD are unable to sleep peacefully and reach the rapid eye movement stage, which helps in consolidating neural activities and memory. Sleep disorders result in obstructions in normal memory and learning functions, and reduce the ability to focus or remain attentive during a task when awake. Disruptions in such cognitive activities lead to psychiatric disorders, which play a key role in the onset of PD. Disturbed sleep also has a significant adverse impact on the moods of the patients, resulting in unstable mood swings and irritation.",

      "title": "Neurodegeneration in Narcolepsy‐Associated Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia associated with increased muscle tone during REM sleep.1 It strongly marks neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.2 Many narcolepsy patients have RBD symptoms.3 It has been suggested that the pathophysiology of RBD in narcolepsy differs from idiopathic RBD, perhaps being related to the instability of sleep stages. Moreover, patients with narcolepsy show fewer degenerative disease signs.4 This would imply that narcolepsy–RBD should not be associated with neurodegenerative disease. Here we report a patient with narcolepsy who developed neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, albeit with characteristics that seemed to suggest 2 independent pathophysiologies. Our patient developed severe daytime somnolence in adolescence and was clinically diagnosed with narcolepsy. Approximately 10 years later, he developed progressive cataplexy, which caused the ending of his sports career. He also had classic hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations and episodes of sleep paralysis. Since marriage, his wife had noted sleep talking/thrashing during sleep, which was without consequent injury. Multiple sleep latency testing disclosed a mean sleep latency = 5.9 minutes (median = 2.4), with 2 sleep-onset REM periods. A polysomnogram (PSG) in 1965 demonstrated equivocal REM atonia loss, with tonic REM = 20% and phasic REM = 32% chin Electromyography (EMG).5 He had poor sleep efficiency (67%), with an apnea–hypopnea index = 30; for this he received a Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) without any benefit on his somnolence. Cataplexy improved considerably with paroxetine. All of these symptoms were stable for >30 years until the age of 67 when there was a dramatic change in the nature and severity of dream enactment. Dreams became threatening (new for him), and he would respond vigorously. The amplitude of movements increased dramatically with minor injury. He presented again to our center. The polysomnogram demonstrated 46% tonic REM and 58% phasic REM chin EMG. During REM sleep, he moved his arms, had myoclonic jerks, and spoke distinctly in apparent response to dreams (which was not observed on the previous polysomnogram). He underwent a complete evaluation for signs of neurodegenerative synucleinopathy (he was not formally included in our ongoing research cohort because of associated narcolepsy,5 but nevertheless underwent the same protocol). In 2010, Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 24/30 and Mini-Mental State Exam was 26/30, losing points for short-term recall and repetition. He had no cognitive changes at that time. Olfaction was severely decreased (0/12 on the brief University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test). Color vision was profoundly decreased (Farnsworth-Munsell (FM)-100 = 288). There was mild erectile dysfunction (new) with no orthostatic hypotension, urinary dysfunction, and constipation. Motor testing was within the normal range, with Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-II = 1, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-III = 3, alternate tap test = 189 (normal >1757), Timed Up-and-Go = 6 seconds, and Purdue Pegboard = 12.5 pegs/30 seconds (normal >10.5). During the subsequent 9 years, he developed episodes of vivid hallucinations. His cognition then worsened and progressed through Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia (no clear fluctuations). He was ultimately diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies.6 He also developed episodes of likely non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnia (sleep walking and sleep talking with preserved interactivity with environment). Subtle bradykinesia in the hands was noted on the last evaluation. He has had good response to cholinesterase inhibition. Table 1. Narcolepsy is commonly associated with RBD symptoms and is generally considered to be unassociated with neurodegenerative risk. Here, our patient had clear narcolepsy with cataplexy and then an unequivocal change in dream enactment behavior at age 67. Here the systematic documentation of evolution toward neurodegenerative synucleinopathy might have suggested that narcolepsy-associated RBD should be considered a risk factor for neurodegenerative synucleinopathy. In support of this might be the findings of abnormal olfaction documented in idiopathic narcolepsy, a somewhat similar biological signature (ie, increased loss of REM atonia relative to controls) as well as the fact that dream enactment can co-occur with RBD in NREM sleep in both narcolepsy and neurodegenerative synucleinopathy.7 However, elements of the clinical course suggest that narcolepsy in this case should perhaps be better considered a separate problem. Most notable was the relatively discrete and clear change in dream enactment behavior occurring in advanced age, without neurodegenerative symptoms occurring beforehand. After this change, there occurred a classic neurodegenerative evolution indistinguishable from idiopathic RBD.8 This suggests the possibility of a coincidental double hit. Given the profound neurodegenerative implications of idiopathic RBD, what evaluations might be recommended in narcolepsy-associated RBD? To start, there are a series of well-established clinical markers for prodromal Parkinson's disease that can be assessed in an office setting9 (noting that olfaction testing may be less informative in this population). Recent studies have also suggested meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy (an early marker of peripheral cardiac sympathetic denervation), and an examination of skin biopsy for abnormal phosphorylated α-synuclein can help identify prodromal neurodegenerative synucleinopathy.10 In summary, our findings suggest that even if conversion to neurodegeneration is coincidental, and the likelihood of phenoconversion to neurodegeneration is low, evaluation for potential neurodegenerative signs should be considered if clinical features change markedly late in life.

      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia has been linked to a variety of contributing variables, including as psychological training, genetic predispositions, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes, and cognitive and physiological arousal. The hyper-arousal theory of insomnia postulates that sleep disturbances are caused by an increase in physiological arousal based on the discovery of high physiological arousal, which may be connected to these people's active stress system. Sometimes, sleep issues including difficulties getting asleep, difficulty remaining asleep, or having poor-quality sleep are referred to as insomnia. Insomnia can be brought on by a variety of things, including the use of psychoactive drugs, caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, and cocaine; hormonal changes, such as menstruation and menopause; stressful life events, like the birth of a child and bereavement; disruptions of the circadian rhythm, like shift work and jet lag; some neurological disorders; and medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis. Everything in the universe vibrates at a specific frequency, and when we are in a state of natural resonance, we are in perfect health. But if a bodily component begins to vibrate at the incorrect frequency, the energy becomes trapped, and illness appears. In order to release the repressed energy and return resonance to its natural level, chanting can therefore be employed to affect a therapy.",

      "title": "REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) as a marker od neurodegenerative disorders",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) can occur in the absence of any other obvious asso- ciated neurologic disorder or in association with a neurodegenerative disease, in which case it is considered as symptomatic RBD. RBD is frequently associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia or multiple system atrophy (MSA), and in several cases may even antedate the occurrence of motor symptoms by decades. When no neurologic disorder is obvious, RBD can be considered as idiopathic (iRBD). Several studies have looked at neurophysiologic and neuropsychological functions in iRBD and have found evidence of CNS dysfunc- tion during both wakefulness and sleep in a variable proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of iRBD. Identifying subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies. Some prospective results in iRBD showed that potential markers of neuro- degeneration are the following: 1) marked EEG slowing on spectral analysis; 2) decreased striatal 123I-FPCIT; 3) impaired color vision.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

It is a fairly common problem in paediatric age: approximately 1 child out of 5 is affected at 5 years of age, with a potential significant impact on their quality of life and family. Pathogenesis is multifactorial, resulting in a combination of genetic factors, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, night-time anti-diuretic hormone deficiency and, in case, coexisting conditions such as sleep and behavioural disorders. Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases. Treatment mainly involves behavioural approach alongside, in those in which this approach fails, nocturnal alarm and/or pharmacological therapy. Assessment of associated comorbidities is crucial (ex. constipation, sleep and behavioural disorders).",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

Quality differentiation is possible in case of good knowledge of semiology of sleep-related epileptic seizure types and epileptic syndromes. Difficulties in identification can lead to further diagnostic mistakes. Parasomnias are the most frequently encountered non-epileptic paroxysmal events in sleep, which are related to both non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM-sleep parasomnias are otherwise referred to as arousal disorders. They could be mistaken for frontal lobe epilepsy seizures, which predominantly occur at night and are not readily accompanied by epileptiformabnormalities on EEG. Other sleep phenomena also should be considered in differentiating nocturnal epilepsies. Obstructive sleep apnea, periodic leg movements in sleep and some sleep episodes sometimes are expressed with a pattern hardly distinguishable from epileptic seizures. Complex approach and appropriate diagnostic algorithm would further help clinicians in this field to better assess any given situation.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances and platelet serotonin in alcoholism",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Chronic alcoholism is frequently associated with sleep disorders, disrupted sleep, insomnia, mood instability and craving. Namely, alcohol affects sleep latency, disrupts the sleep periods during night, affects rapid eye movement sleep and elicits frequent episodes of wakefulness, and frequent shifts between sleep stages. Alcoholics often experience insomnia, especially during the withdrawal syndrome. In addition, insomnia is a risk factor for relapse into addiction of alcohol. Although the consumption of alcohol may improve sleep latency at the beginning of alcohol abuse, at later stages chronic alcoholism is associated with poor sleep quality, early wakening, and insomnia. Numerous neurotransmitters have been implicated in regulation of normal and irregular sleep behavior, and in the etiology of alcoholism. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has a major role in the control of many physiological and pathological functions and behaviors, including sleep, wakefulness, arousal states, vigilance behaviors, synchronization of the biological clock and circadian rhythmicity. Serotonergic neurotransmission from the dorsal raphe is associated with arousal and is turned off during sleep. Serotonin has a role in etiology of alcoholism. Central 5-HT synaptosomes and platelets similarly store, release and metabolize 5-HT, and therefore blood platelets might be used as a limited peripheral model for the central 5-HT synaptosomes. Platelet 5-HT concentration has been proposed to represent a biomarker for particular symptoms in psychiatric disorders, to be reduced in chronic alcoholics, and in subjects with disturbed sleep. Materials and Methods: Platelet 5-HT concentration was determined in male and female patients with chronic alcoholism, subdivided into patients with or without insomnia with a spectrofluorimetric method. Clinical diagnosis of alcohol dependence made according to the DSM-IV criteria, using Structured Clinical Interview. Insomnia was evaluated using the items 4, 5 and 6 from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and alcoholics were subdivided into those with early, middle and late insomnia. Results: Male alcoholic patients with middle insomnia had significantly lower platelet 5-HT concentration compared to male alcoholics without middle insomnia. Platelet 5-HT concentration did not differ significantly among male alcoholic patients with or without early or late insomnia, or between female alcoholic patients with or without early, middle and late insomnia. Conclusions: Since ethanol improves the onset of sleep, while at the same time the duration of sleep is disturbed, lower platelet 5-HT concentration in middle insomnia suggest that this peripheral marker is altered in alcoholics with middle insomnia.",

      "title": "Care and management of the patient with advanced dementia",
      "abstract": "References 316Many of the distinctions among the illnesses that cause the syndrome of dementia become blurred or disappear in advanced or late stage dementia for several reasons. First, neuropathological abnormalities become so widespread that almost all brain systems that subserve cognition and function become impaired. A second and related issue is that the widespread involvement of subcortical or 'downstream' structures and systems results in widespread and near total dysfunction of 'upstream' cognitive and motor systems that are not directly involved by neuropathology. Thus, this chapter will approach late stage or advanced dementia as a single or common end point of all the dementias even though some distinctions, for example the frequency of myoclonus and seizures, do persist. Thus, while knowledge of the unique aspects of specific diseases plays a prominent role in the care of people with dementia in the earlier stages of the dementia, this is usually not the case in late-stage dementia (Robinson et al., 2006).",

      "abstract": "AD and other types of dementias are associated with many problematic behaviors. Noncognitive feature is a terminology that draws the distinction between cognitive loss and the heterogeneous group of symptoms that include psychiatric symptoms such as depression, hallucinations, delusions and misidentifications. This term also includes behavioral disturbances such as aggression, agitation, pacing and eating disorders (Burns et al., 1990). An alternative expression is neuropsychiatric features (Cummings et al., 1994). The term \"Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia\" (BPSD) has also been defined as \"symptoms of disturbed perception, thought content, mood and behavior that frequently occur in patients with dementia\" (Consensus Conference on the Behavioral Disturbances of Dementia, 1996). Noncognitive disorders can cause distress both to patients and carers. Such changes are often a determinant for institutional care. A study reported that psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) were present in about 50% of patients with dementia and disruptive behavior (e.g., physical violence, hiding things, wandering, demanding or critical behavior) in up to 70% (Rabins et al., 1982). These include hitting, yelling, grabbing people, wandering, hoarding, and repetitive gestures and questioning (Moak & Fisher, 1990; Reisberg et al., 1987). All of these problematic behaviors are often grouped together as \"agitation\" or \"agitated behavior\".",

      "title": "Heart rate variability during sleep in synucleinopathies: a review",
      "abstract": "Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal accumulations of insoluble alpha-synuclein in neurons or glial cells. These consist of Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Moreover, idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is often the first manifestation of synucleinopathies, demonstrating a pathophysiological continuum. While these disorders vary in prevalence, symptom patterns, and severity, they can all include autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, which significantly reduces quality of life and worsens prognosis. Consequently, identifying abnormalities of the ANS can provide opportunities for improving quality of life through symptomatic treatments that are tailored to the individual's symptoms. An exciting development is using heart rate variability (HRV) as a non-invasive research tool for analyzing how the ANS regulates physiological processes. HRV during sleep, however, may provide a more accurate and reliable measure of ANS activity than during wakefulness, as during awake time, ANS activity is influenced by a variety of factors, including physical activity, stress, and emotions, which may mask or confound the underlying patterns of ANS activity. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge regarding sleep-related HRV in synucleinopathies and to discuss contributing mechanisms. Evidence suggests that iRBD, PD, and MSA are associated with nocturnal ANS dysfunction. Further, comparative studies indicate that the presence of RBD could exacerbate this abnormality. In contrast, no studies have been conducted in patients with DLB. Overall, this review provides new insight into the complex interplay between the ANS and synucleinopathies and underscores the need for further research in this area to develop effective therapies to improve sleep and overall quality of life in patients with synucleinopathies.",

Less frequent problems included parasomnias such as pavor nocturnus (0.5%), sleepwalking (0.1%), and frequent nightmares (1.7%).Sleep disorders increase the risk of daytime fatigue and of psychological problems in general, including both hyperactivity and excessive emotional stress.

      "abstract": "Productive mental disorders (PMD) are the result of pathological mental activity. Alongside with deficient disorders PMD are the main characteristics of post-traumatic disturbances of consciousness. PMD can be represented by different types of excitation, mistaken judgments (including paranoidal ones, confabulations, false orientation), false perception (psychosensory, in particular, illusory and hallucinatory phenomena) and affective disorders. Occurrence and signs of PMD were studied in 417 patients with brain injuries and their consequences. It was found that occurrence of PMD in clear consciousness (in form of delirium, confusion etc) is often a sign of deterioration of cerebral and/or somatic situation and requires urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures. In another situation with PMD being revealed during emergence from coma, they are regarded as a prognostically favorable sign and require some correction only in case of long-term (more than 1-3 weeks) course. It was determined that PMD are characterized by: (a) a gradual (after emergence from unconsciousness) aggravation and complications of clinical symptoms till achieved orientation in the surroundings with their possible partial or complete regress; (b) the highest frequency and intensity with prevailed signs of dysfunction of any of cerebral hemispheres and the lowest frequency in case of relatively symmetric bilateral and profound brain damage; b) a great variety and severity in adult patients (compared with children and elderly). Irritation of different brain structures and their disconnection as well as pathological neuroplasticity in prolonged forms--are considered the basis for PMD occurrence.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and sleeping difficulty are poorly-addressed problems of aging. Research has shown that as many as 50% of older adults complain about difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Elderly with varieties of sleep complaints are differentially affected by 'age-related cognitive decline'. Normal developmental processes have been affected with changes in sleep, which can be further compromised by sleep disturbances secondary to medical or psychiatric diseases such as chronic pain, depression, dementia or age-related primary sleep disorders (e.g., sleep disordered breathing and periodic limb movements during sleep), or certain combinations of these high-risk factors. Sleep serves as a protective mechanism to keep the organism out of danger; therefore, it is imperative to consider sleep disorders for quality life. The evaluation of these disorders is discussed in this review.Anwer Khan Modern Medical College Journal Vol. 7, No. 1: Jan 2016, P 45-49",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "title": "REM sleep behavior disorder: update on diagnosis and management",
      "abstract": "Abstract REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by a loss of atonia of skeletal muscles during REM sleep, associated with acting out behaviors during dreams. Knowledge of this pathology is important to predict neurodegenerative diseases since there is a strong association of RBD with diseases caused by the deposition of alpha-synuclein in neurons (synucleinopathies), such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Proper diagnosis of this condition will enable the use of future neuroprotective strategies before motor and cognitive symptoms. Diagnostic assessment should begin with a detailed clinical history with the patient and bed partner or roommate and the examination of any recorded home videos. Polysomnography (PSG) is necessary to verify the loss of sleep atonia and, when documented, the behaviors during sleep. Technical recommendations for PSG acquisition and analysis are defined in the AASM Manual for the scoring of sleep and associated events, and the PSG report should describe the percentage of REM sleep epochs that meet the criteria for RWA (REM without atonia) to better distinguish patients with and without RBD. Additionally, PSG helps rule out conditions that may mimic RBD, such as obstructive sleep apnea, non-REM sleep parasomnias, nocturnal epileptic seizures, periodic limb movements, and psychiatric disorders. Treatment of RBD involves guidance on protecting the environment and avoiding injuries to the patient and bed partner/roommate. Use of medications are also reviewed in the article. The development of neuroprotective medications will be crucial for future RBD therapy.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population and are associated with adverse effects such as motor vehicle collisions, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized into three groups: people with problems falling asleep, people with behavior and movement disturbances during sleep, and people with excessive daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is defined by difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or both, resulting in daytime consequences. Insomnia is diagnosed by history and is treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without medications. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in patients acting out their dreams with potentially harmful effects. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with melatonin or clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome is defined by an urge to move the legs that worsens when at rest. Restless legs syndrome is treated with gabapentin or dopamine agonists, depending on the severity. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep hallucinations. Diagnosis is suggested by the history and can be confirmed with polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test the following day. Narcolepsy is treated with behavior modifications and medications such as stimulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sodium oxybate, and pitolisant. Obstructive sleep apnea may be diagnosed in patients with excessive snoring and witnessed apneas and can be diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Treatment consists of positive airway pressure therapy while sleeping in conjunction with weight loss.",

Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

Diagnostic procedure for insomnia should include evaluation of sleep–wake behaviour and sleep history, as well as questions about somatic and mental disorders, anamnesis of medication and other substances used, physical examination, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, and additional measures. Sleep diaries or actigraphy can be used to evaluate sleep–wake schedules or circadian rhythm disorders. Polysomnography is recommended when other sleep disorders (periodic limb movement disorder, sleep apnea or narcolepsy) are suspected, also for treatment-resistant insomnia. Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age. A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective or not available. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia. Long-term treatment of insomnia with benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists is not recommended. Sedating antidepressants are effective for short-term insomnia treatment. Antihistaminics and antipsychotics are not recommended for insomnia treatment because of insufficient evidence. Melatonin is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of low efficacy.

      "abstract": "The notion that cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions of epileptic origin can be prolonged and with an insidious onset, has meant a radical conceptual change about epilepsy considered so far uniquely as a paroxysmal disorder. Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are many different conditions in which children may behave strangely or have unusual experiences in relation to sleep. Although some may be dramatic and worrying to parents, they do not usually mean that the child is psychologically disturbed or medically ill in any way. Very often, parasomnias stop of their own accord after a while, but safety measures may be necessary in the meantime in some of them. Occasionally, sleep disorders of this type are part of a medical or psychological disorder that needs treatment in its own right. Many parasomnias can be grouped according to when at night they occur.",

Insomnia, the most common sleep disturbance, can present as an inability to initiate sleep or to maintain sleep such that the restorative benefits of sleep are limited. This case report describes a client in her 60s who sought treatment for early morning awakening that persisted for four years despite the use of sleep-inducing medications. Her successful course of treatment utilized hypnotic suggestions and interactions that targeted distinctive features of the sleep cycle as well as her daily transition from wakefulness to sleep to early morning reawakening. The article highlights the coordination of neurophysiological features of sleep, psychological dynamics at play while awake and in her dream sleep, and how attention to their interplay utilizing hypnosis enabled the client to reestablish restorative sleep patterns in a treatment process spanning less than a dozen treatment sessions.",

      "abstract": "【With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.】",

Sleep has many benefits, one of which is the restoration of physical and mental functions, the consolidation of memory and improving the learning ability of a person both motorically and sensitively. Other studies have also shown a correlation between electrographic sleep time and cognitive function of stroke patients during recovery. Another experimental study also indicated that sleep disorders can increase the expression of neurocans, which are genes that inhibit nerve growth.

Initial brain compromise can be caused by genes, toxins, chemicals, infective agents, hypoxia or trauma. The original insult leads to a compensatory process of ‘rendering the synapse supersensitive’, a general neural mechanism that is involved in nervous system adaptation, repair, and regeneration. For example, in psychoses, the many and diverse early risk factors that underlie the psychosis converge to increase the number of supersensitive dopamine D2 receptors (i.e., D2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state for dopamine). Supersensitivity of synapses compensates for and protects the brain from further injury. This leads to heightened neurotransmission, which is experienced subjectively as overstimulation, with subsequent attempts to psychologically adapt. Out of individual attempts at compensation, arise the signs and symptoms that have been identified with schizophrenia and other psychoses.",

Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and parasomnias may also occur after a head injury. In addition, depression, anxiety, and pain are common brain injury comorbidities with significant influence on sleep quality. Two types of traumatic brain injury that may negatively impact sleep are acceleration/deceleration injuries causing generalized brain damage and contact injuries causing focal brain damage. Polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and/or actigraphy may be utilized to diagnose sleep disorders after a head injury. Depending on the disorder, treatment may include the use of medications, positive airway pressure, and/or behavioral modifications.

      "title": "Beyond the Dopaminergic System: Lessons Learned from levodopa Resistant Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Diagnosis and clinical burden in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is often related to the cardinal motor features (tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity) and occurs when at least 40–60% of striatal dopamine nerve terminals are lost.1 However, in the \"Essay on the shaking palsy\" James Parkinson already reported presence of constipation, cognitive dysfunction or sleep disorders in addition to motor involvement.2 With the introduction of l-dopa therapy it became evident that only specific clinical features would improve while many others would show limited or no benefit from medications even if they significantly contribute to quality of life decline and disability. In recent years the detection of pathological hallmarks in many tissues beyond the central nervous system has supported the concept that PD is a systemic multi-organ condition where dopamine is less centric and various neurotransmitters and pathways are involved. In the prodromal phase (the time between onset of neurodegeneration and occurrence of motor symptoms), orthostatic hypotension (OH), constipation, hyposmia, rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms (ie, subtle frontal lobe deficits and depression) may be observed.3 Severe autonomic dysfunction and cognitive impairment significantly contribute to clinical deterioration in the advanced disease stages.4 In this Viewpoint, we aimed to challenge the traditional vision of PD motor and non-motor dichotomy. We have reviewed the most relevant PD features and the respective neurotransmitters' systems involved, suggesting a categorization based on response to dopamine replacement therapy. We believe these considerations are relevant in light of the possibility to detect and possibly treat the disease years before motor manifestations (Fig. 1). Innervation in the retina (especially around the fovea) is mainly dopaminergic, and therefore vision dysfunction is common in PD. It is often expressed as difficulties in color and contrast vision during off periods which may benefit from treatment optimization.5 Diplopia is often not corrected by dopaminergic treatment and it may develop from a combination of convergence insufficiency and exophoria. Shoulder pain is frequently reported at onset of motor manifestations but this is generally secondary to limb rigidity and progressively improves once dopaminergic therapy is established.5 Bradykinesia and rigidity usually present a satisfying and sustained response to l-dopa while rest-tremor may be more difficult to treat in some patient.6 Medications-related fluctuations, wearing off and dyskinesias develop after a few years of therapy in patients with good response to l-dopa. Variability in brain dopamine levels secondary to intermittent l-dopa administration, heterogeneous gastrointestinal function and absorption, progressive loss of dopamine nerve terminals and storage capacity contribute to the development of these symptoms.7, 8 Therapeutic strategies aiming at more constant drug delivery and dopamine receptor stimulation are helpful and if started early, may minimize the severity of motor complications.7 The dopaminergic pathway plays a key role in the regulation of the genitourinary system. Dopamine selectively inhibits or activates the pontine micturition center, explaining the frequent urinary symptoms in PD. Optimizing dopaminergic treatment may help in the management of the urinary urgency secondary to detrusor overactivity in PD.5 However, early occurrence of urinary urgency and bladder dysfunction may also express more rapid disease progression and deserves careful assessment by treating physicians. l-dopa non-responsive symptoms are common and may be observed already at prodromal phase. They are generally related to either misfolded alpha-synuclein accumulation in various tissues including the dopamine pathways (structural alterations) or consequence of dysfunctions affecting other neurotransmitters (functional alterations). Olfactory dysfunction occurs months or years before motor onset and it is associated with fourfold increase in risk of PD within 4–10 years9 However, it is often overlooked by clinicians and patients, and sometimes is confused with the physiological age-related olfactory decline. The lack of response to l-dopa supports the concept that hyposmia is not related to the dopamine system and generally does not follow a parallel progression with motor decline.10 Abnormalities have been observed in the central olfactory structures, whereas the involvement of the peripheral olfactory system is less defined. Lewy bodies are commonly found in these regions, supporting the hypothesis of pathology starting in the periphery then extending to the brain.10, 11 Since the olfactory system directly links the brain to the external environment, it could be a gateway through which many viruses, including novel coronavirus, could trigger inflammation and ultimately promote neurodegenerative processes.12 Constipation is another common PD risk factor. There is increasing interest regarding the role of the gut–brain axis, and both alpha-synuclein aggregates and reactive enteric gliosis have been detected in nerve fibers of the duodenal mucosa, in both early and advanced PD.13-15 In addition, presence of constipation is associated with faster progression and involves the cholinergic system.16 Finally, alterations in the gut microbiota composition are also well documented supporting interventions modulating gut microbiota.17 Generalized painful sensations or dystonic pain may develop in patients with motor fluctuations, off periods and peak-dose dyskinesias, as well as in association to restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movement. Given the key role of dopamine in mediating several pain networks in the central nervous system (spinal cord, thalamus, basal ganglia, cingulate cortex), advanced patients suffering from pain often benefit from an optimized dopaminergic therapy.5 However, many patients suffer from neuropathic and central pain independently from motor complications suggesting involvement of other neurotransmitters including glutamate, norepinephrine and serotonin. A broader approach to pain management that considers multiple drugs including opiate is warranted given its relevance to quality of life.18 Mild cognitive deficits in executive functions, working memory, attention, difficulties in planning and problem solving are common early PD features. Dementia is reported in PD with long survival and its occurrence is underpinned by cholinergic dysfunction, diffuse Lewy body pathology and frequently associated with amyloid pathology in elderly patients.19 Rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, may improve executive function, attention and behavioral symptoms in PD patients with dementia suggesting a role for cholinergic drugs. Presence of different regional patterns of cholinergic dysfunction may explain various l-dopa unresponsive features including cognitive decline.20 Gait difficulties and postural instability are amongst the most disabling PD features and often overlap with cognitive impairment resulting in rapid loss of autonomy and worsening quality of life. The unsatisfying response to dopaminergic treatment and device aided therapies suggests involvement of non-dopaminergic networks and nuclei.21 Abnormal striatal plasticity and pharmacodynamic changes in dopaminergic transmission are the neurobiological substrates of dyskinesia. l-dopa treatment determines internalization of A2A-D2 heteromers and compensatory upregulation of A2A homomers, ultimately leading to an impaired firing pattern in the striato-pallidal pathway.22 Hence, management of dyskinesia is challenging and requires a diversified treatment targeting different neurotransmitters especially glutamatergic modulation (ie, amantadine, a NMDA receptor antagonist) or implementation of device aided therapies. Strategies targeting serotonin have not been successful in patients although animal models suggest a role for this neurotransmitter in the development of dyskinesia. Psychosis is characterized by hallucinations, delusions (false beliefs against contrary knowledge) and delirium. They occur in the context of cognitive decline and dementia but may be also triggered by dopaminergic therapy.23 Modulation of dopaminergic therapy along with use of atypical antipsychotic medications including pimavanserin (currently available only in the USA) should represent the treatment of choice, as older antipsychotic medications often led to worsening of motor manifestations. Impulsivity and ICD are more common in patients on DA replacement treatment especially dopamine agonists.24-26 This supports the notion that ICD is related to dopaminergic dysfunction and can be managed only by modulation of dopamine replacement therapy. OH has an estimated prevalence ranging from 30–65% of PD patients. It is reported occasionally as a prodromal feature but more frequently detected across all stages of the disease. The main role played by noradrenaline in modulating the autonomic function explains why the disruption of the noradrenergic pathways in PD underlines the cardiovascular abnormalities including OH. Extracardiac, and more importantly, cardiac sympathetic denervation are frequently associated with additional dysfunction in the parasympathetic compartment and impaired baroreflex.27 To date, a standardized approach to OH is lacking and the relationship between dopamine and OH is still debated,28 together with the inclusion of OH among potential side effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists, non-pharmacological treatments are often recommended as the first choice. These manifestations result from the complex interplay between multiple neurotransmitter systems, and may partially benefit from dopaminergic treatment. Indeed, this category comprises manifestations presenting motor, cognitive and behavioral components, likely reflecting the involvement of multiple anatomical and neurochemical circuits. RBD is a strong risk factor and predictor of PD and other synucleinopathies (25–40% at 5 years, 40–65% at 10 years).13, 29 Several neuroimaging and functional studies support the role of dopaminergic dysfunction and nigrostriatal degeneration in the genesis of RBD although the involvement of other neurotransmitters is likely since RBD is often unresponsive to dopaminergic treatment alone.30 RBD generally occurs many years before motor manifestations and the role of noradrenergic depletion of the locus coeruleus has been documented by many studies.31 In support of this hypothesis, a recent study suggested the efficacy of safinamide, a medication with both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic actions (inhibition of monoamine oxidase-B, modulation of glutamate release) in improving symptoms related to RBD.32 Depression or depression-related symptoms are listed among the criteria for Prodromal PD.33 The presence of comorbid anxiety disorders is also common and may occur as a separate entity or in relation to motor fluctuations especially during the off periods. In addition to dopamine, extra-striatal pathology and degeneration in the serotonergic and noradrenergic afferent pathways from the midbrain play an important role in PD depression.34 In addition, reactive behavioral patterns, symptoms occurring during motor worsening or as drug adverse effects, need to be considered when approaching treatment. There is no randomized clinical trials on the antidepressant effects of l-dopa and one randomized placebo controlled study documenting the effect of pramipexole.35 However, in some PD patients depressive symptoms may not benefit from dopaminergic therapy and they require additional drugs targeting the serotonergic and/or noradrenergic system especially if anxiety or apathetic features are present.5 Apathy can be observed alone or in association with depression or anxiety. A prominent dopaminergic and noradrenergic dysregulation are relevant causative factors in determining apathy and should both be considered when introducing treatment. Apathy may also be a strong predictor of cognitive decline and its persistence should require careful monitoring of neuropsychological skills.36 An increasing body of work supports the view of PD as a systemic condition with multiple organs and neurotransmitters involved and where symptoms poorly addressed by l-dopa therapy have a key role on quality of life, autonomy and functional decline.5, 37 Moreover, l-dopa resistant symptoms constitute a major target for advanced and palliative treatments in the late stage of disease.38 Given the traditional focus on dopamine, many of these manifestations are often overlooked although they significantly impact on the global progression of the disease, life expectancy and on the cost of care.5 Indeed patients presenting early multidomain cognitive impairment or RBD may suffer more rapid physical decline as opposed to individuals who manifest predominant mild motor and mood dysfunction where disease course is generally more benign. Similar prominent early autonomic deficits including OH and constipation have been associated with worse prognosis, higher risk of cognitive impairment, functional decline and death.39 Overall these findings support the redefinition of PD as a systemic neurodegenerative process involving different systems but with different rates of degeneration and progression. l-dopa unresponsive symptoms present a heterogeneous progression pattern, that does not mirror classic and well-documented motor decline. Identification and tracking of those symptoms should parallel motor evaluation to properly define prognosis.37, 39 The neuropathological hallmarks of many l-dopa unresponsive features might be related to alpha synuclein misfolding and aggregation involving various neurotransmitters and functional networks in addition to nigrostriatal dopamine neurons.11 Indeed, the presence of overlapping pathological processes (amyloid and Tau) or concomitant cerebrovascular disease is increasingly relevant and documents the heterogeneity of the disease and the need of more patient centric therapeutic approaches. Current \"clinical markers\" of disease are heavily weighted towards the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system but we believe the objective of pharmacological research should expand to other neurotransmitter systems, particularly on compounds targeting serotoninergic, glutamatergic and purinergic pathways. Our suggestion is that a new approach to PD diagnosis and management beyond dopamine replacement therapy should be rapidly adopted, encompassing all clinical features and addressing their contribution to early disease detection, prognosis, progression and quality of life. Recent discoveries in disease biomarkers indicate that it is important to change our dopamine-centric perspective for PD diagnosis if we want to test and possibly implement disease modifying therapies before motor symptoms become manifest.40 Figure 1 was created with BioRender.com.

      "abstract": "During the past century, infrequent, anecdotal reports of sleep-related violence with forensic science implications have appeared. Recent rapid developments in the field of sleep-disorders medicine have resulted in greater understanding of a variety of sleep-related behaviors, and formal sleep-behavior monitoring techniques have permitted their documentation and classification. Sleep-related violence can be associated with a number of diagnosable and treatable sleep disorders, including (1) night terrors/sleepwalking, (2) nocturnal seizures, (3) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-behavior disorder, (4) sleep drunkenness, and (5) psychogenic dissociative states occurring during the sleep period. Potentially violent automatized behavior, without consciousness, can and does occur during sleep. The violence resulting from these disorders may be misinterpreted as purposeful suicide, assault, or even homicide. Sleep-related violence must be added to the list of automatisms. A classification system of both waking and sleep-related automatic behavior is proposed, with recommendations for assessment of such behavior.",

      "title": "Seizure and Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Seizures are transient abnormal neuronal discharges of the cerebral cortex that often result in stereotyped behavior. Seizure is often a manifestation or symptom of many medical conditions. Epilepsy is the occurrence of two or more unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder. In other words, a seizure is a sign, and epilepsy is a disorder. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of individuals reaching age 70 will have a seizure, but only 1–2% will be subject to recurrence and become epileptic. After a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, with normal exam, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG), 15–30% have recurrence. Seizure should be differentiated from syncope, migraine, transient ischemic attack, multiple sclerosis, hypoglycemic attack, sleep disorder (narcolepsy/ cataplexy/night terror, rapid eye movement behavior disorder), anxiety attacks, and pseudoseizure (psychogenic nonepileptic seizure). Routine workup for onset of unprovoked seizure in adults includes blood count, chemistry profile, EEG, and neuroimaging (computed tomography scan, MRI). Further workup depends on individual case (lumbar puncture). Late onset of seizures is usually because of vascular, degenerative, and neoplastic processes. However, more than half of the patients remain idiopathic, which is possibly genetically determined. Family history of seizure, previous history of head trauma, and prior history of seizure including febrile convulsion in childhood are important to establish.",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

      "abstract": "To describe the current state of the art about the main cognitive deficits that appear in patients affected with narcolepsy with cataplexy (NT1).The majority of the studies have found that the most impaired cognitive functions are attention (especially maintenance of attention or sustained attention), speed of information processing and executive functions (in particular, verbal fluency and resistance to the stimuli interference). These data indicate the difficulty to use the available cognitive resources of the patient. These alterations are similar to those present in other hypersomnias, although they might differ in intensity. Moreover, most of the studies emphasize a high prevalence of different depressive and anxious disorders. It has been suggested that predisposition to anxiety could be part of the characteristic phenotype of these patients. Anxiety could act either as a trigger for the disease or a consequence of the disease.Cognitive deficits in patients with NT1 appear in long lasting and/or monotonous tasks and in high cognitive demanding tasks. The presence of depressive symptomatology, together with excessive daytime sleepiness in these patients could affect their performance in neuropsychological test, and it might be related to their subjective perception of the cognitive deficits.Alteraciones neuropsicologicas en la narcolepsia con cataplejia: una revision.Objetivo. Describir el estado actual de conocimiento sobre los principales deficits cognitivos que presentan los pacientes con narcolepsia con cataplejia o narcolepsia de tipo 1. Desarrollo. La mayoria de los estudios ha encontrado que las funciones cognitivas mas afectadas son la atencion (especialmente el mantenimiento de la atencion o atencion sostenida), la velocidad de procesamiento de la informacion y las funciones ejecutivas (en particular, la fluidez verbal y la resistencia a la interferencia de estimulos). Estos datos indican una dificultad para utilizar los recursos cognitivos de los que dispone el sujeto. Estas alteraciones son similares a las presentes en otras hipersomnias, aunque difieren en la intensidad. Por otra parte, la mayoria de los estudios destaca una elevada prevalencia de diferentes trastornos depresivos y ansiosos. Se ha sugerido que la predisposicion a la ansiedad forma parte del fenotipo caracteristico de estos pacientes. La ansiedad podria actuar como un factor desencadenante de la enfermedad y ser asimismo una consecuencia de la enfermedad. Conclusiones. Los deficits cognitivos en los pacientes con narcolepsia de tipo 1 se manifiestan en tareas de larga duracion o monotonas y en tareas con alta demanda cognitiva, principalmente en tareas de atencion sostenida. La presencia de sintomatologia depresiva en estos pacientes, junto con la excesiva somnolencia diurna, parecen afectar a su rendimiento en las pruebas neuropsicologicas, y estar estrechamente relacionadas con la apreciacion subjetiva de dificultades cognitivas.",

      "title": "The influence of sleep on fear extinction in trauma-related disorders",
      "abstract": "In Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), fear and anxiety become dysregulated following psychologically traumatic events. Regulation of fear and anxiety involves both high-level cognitive processes such as cognitive reattribution and low-level, partially automatic memory processes such as fear extinction, safety learning and habituation. These latter processes are believed to be deficient in PTSD. While insomnia and nightmares are characteristic symptoms of existing PTSD, abundant recent evidence suggests that sleep disruption prior to and acute sleep disturbance following traumatic events both can predispose an individual to develop PTSD. Sleep promotes consolidation in multiple memory systems and is believed to also do so for low-level emotion-regulatory memory processes. Consequently sleep disruption may contribute to the etiology of PTSD by interfering with consolidation in low-level emotion-regulatory memory systems. During the first weeks following a traumatic event, when in the course of everyday life resilient individuals begin to acquire and consolidate these low-level emotion-regulatory memories, those who will develop PTSD symptoms may fail to do so. This deficit may, in part, result from alterations of sleep that interfere with their consolidation, such as REM fragmentation, that have also been found to presage later PTSD symptoms. Here, sleep disruption in PTSD as well as fear extinction, safety learning and habituation and their known alterations in PTSD are first briefly reviewed. Then neural processes that occur during the early post-trauma period that might impede low-level emotion regulatory processes through alterations of sleep quality and physiology will be considered. Lastly, recent neuroimaging evidence from a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in patient groups and their controls will be considered along with one possible neural process that may contribute to a vulnerability to PTSD following trauma.",

      "title": "The challenge of sleep management in military operations.",
      "abstract": "It has long been known that short-term (days) insufficient sleep causes decrements in mental effectiveness that put individuals at increased risk of committing errors and causing accidents. More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.",

      "title": "Physiologie et manipulations expérimentales des interrelations entre la douleur et le sommeil",
      "abstract": "Dans le quotidien, l'être humain associe intuitivement un sommeil de bonne qualité au bon fonctionnement physiologique et psychologique. D'autre part, la douleur entraîne souvent un sommeil de mauvaise qualité, voire de l'insomnie. Parmi les patients souffrant de douleur chronique (p. ex. lombalgie, douleur orofaciale, fibromyalgie ou arthrite rhumatoïde), près des deux tiers rapportent que leur sommeil n'est pas suffisamment récupérateur. La relation entre la douleur et le sommeil est soit unidirectionnelle soit bidirectionnelle-circulaire. Une crise de douleur aiguë, précédant le plus souvent une plainte de mauvais sommeil, suggère une relation unidirectionnelle. Toutefois, chez les patients souffrant de douleur chronique ou intense (p. ex. post-brûlure), à une mauvaise nuit de sommeil succède une exacerbation diurne de la douleur qui, à son tour, peut diminuer la qualité du sommeil suivant et ainsi de suite. Il s'agit alors d'un trouble bidirectionnel circulaire. Des études polysomnographiques ont mis en évidence certaines caractéristiques physiologiques chez le patient souffrant de douleur chronique. La plus fréquente est l'intrusion d'ondes alphadelta électroencéphalographiques dénotant une activité corticale rapide normalement associée à l'état d'éveil. Cette intrusion, d'une durée de 20 à 40 secondes, répétée de façon périodique au cours du sommeil, reflète l'expression de micro-éveils cérébraux et du système nerveux autonome cardio-sympathique. D'autre part, des études expérimentales ont permi de caractériser les effets de la douleur sur l'architecture du sommeil. En effet, on a noté que la douleur induisait des éveils prolongés importants pendant tous les stades de sommeil (léger, profond etparadoxal) contrairement à ce que l'on pense généralement.",

Polysomnography is done in particularly puzzling cases and for evaluation of invasive therapeutic measures.",

      "title": "Les hallucinations dans la maladie de Parkinson",
      "abstract": "Les hallucinations dans la maladie de Parkinson sont une complication relativement fréquente au stade des complications cognitives de la maladie. Étant généralement peu inquiétantes, le sujet ne les rapportera pas toujours spontanément. Pourtant, elles peuvent en effet signer l’entrée dans une psychose ou une démence parkinsonienne. Elles grèvent la qualité de vie du patient, de son entourage et parfois mettent en péril le maintien à domicile des sujets. Elles ne doivent donc pas êtres négligées. Classiquement les hallucinations dans la maladie de Parkinson sont d’abord visuelles, parfois mineures (simples de passage à la périphérie du champ visuel) ou au contraire très élaborées. Leur physiopathologie demeure imparfaitement connue. L’atteinte visuelle centrale, et notamment au niveau de l’intégration des données visuelles semble jour un rôle majeur. Cependant, d’autres systèmes dont le fonctionnement est perturbé dans la maladie de Parkinson sont impliqués dans la survenue des hallucinations : système visuel périphérique (rétine), voies régulatrices du cycle veille sommeil et notamment du sommeil paradoxal et enfin le système frontal et notamment exécutif. La prise en charge des hallucinations dans la maladie de Parkinson est relativement stéréotypée. Il faut tout d’abord dépister pour les éliminer les facteurs favorisants, notamment de type médicamenteux ou métabolique. Si les hallucinations persistent, le traitement antiparkinsonien doit être revu rapidement avec en priorité la diminution ou l’arrêt des anticholinergiques, des agonistes dopaminergiques et de l’amantadine, puis des inhibiteurs de la catéchol-O-méthyltransférase (COMT) et de la monoaminoxydase B (MAO B). Au besoin, les doses de dopamine peuvent être diminuées. Ces adaptations thérapeutiques permettent en général de contrôler les hallucinations, parfois au détriment de l’état moteur. Malgré tout, si les hallucinations persistent, un traitement neuroleptique par petites doses de clozapine peut être indiqué avec en générale une excellente efficacité.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

Parasomnias as an important part of sleep disorders associated with PD, have become hot topics in recent years. Parasomnias include rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sleep-related movement disorders and wakefulness disturbance, while wakefulness disturbance consists of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sleep attacks. Some of these disorders, including RBD and EDS may occur before the motor symptoms of PD and become potential early markers of the disease. Sleep-related movement disorders include restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement (PLM). In addition, a part of them such as EDS is related to pharmacologic treatment.

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder, which is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) that is typically associated with cataplexy, sleep fragmentation and other REM sleep-related phenomenon such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucination. Narcoleptic symptoms can be developed from various medical or neurological disorders. A 17-year-old male patient admitted for the evaluation of EDS which started three-month ago. He slept more than 18 hours a day with cataplexy and hypnagogic hallucination. He was obese with body mass index (BMI) of 30.4 kg/. After admission he was newly diagnosed to the thyrotoxicosis. T3 391.2 ng/dL (60-181), free T4 4.38 ng/dL (0.89-1.76), TSH /mL (0.35-5.5) were measured. His pulse rate ranged 70-90 beats per minute and blood pressure ranged 150/100-120/70 mmHg. Polysomnography revealed many fragmentations in sleep with many positional changes (81 times/h). Sleep onset latency was 33.5 min, sleep efficiency was 47.9%, and REM latency from sleep onset was delayed to 153.6 min. REM sleep percent was increased to 27.1%. Periodic limb movement index was 13.4/h. In the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), average sleep latency was 0.4 min and there were noted 3 SOREMPs (Sleep Onset REM sleep period) on 5 trials. We couldn't discriminate the obvious sleep-wake pattern in the actigraph and his HLA DQB1 type was negative. His thyroid function improved following treatment with methimazole and propranolol. Vital sign maintained within normal range. Cataplexy was controlled with venlafaxine 75 mg. Subjective night sleep continuity and PLMS were improved with clonazepam 0.5 mg, but the EDS were partially improved with modafinil 200-400 mg. Thyrotoxicosis might give confounding role when we were evaluating the EDS, though sleep fragmentation was one of the major symptoms of narcolepsy, but enormous amount of it made us think of the influence of thyroid hormone. The loss of sleep-wake cycle, limited improvement of EDS to the stimulant treatmen, and the cataplexy not supported by HLA DQB1 should be answered further. We still should rule out idiopathic hypersomnia and measuring CSF hypocretin level would be helpful.",

Cognitive dysfunction includes mainly problems with verbal fluency and executive functioning. The main distinguishing feature of multiple system atrophy is a disturbance in the functioning of the autonomic division of the nervous system, which controls involuntary muscles and fundamental biological functions. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system begins early in the course of multiple system atrophy. Erectile dysfunction and urinary symptoms may be the first signs of this disorder.

      "abstract": "Sleep consists of two phases that periodically alternate: the rapid eye movement (REM) phase and the non-REM phase. The non-REM stage is characterized by wide synchronous waves in the electroencephalogram, by a low heart rate and by a decrease in arterial blood pressure and peripheral resistances. This hemodynamic setting is the consequence of the autonomic balance characterized by high vagal activity and low sympathetic activity. Such an autonomic condition is adequately described by the spectral analysis of heart rate variability documenting a prevalence in the high frequency band (the respiratory vagal band). The REM stage of sleep is characterized by asynchronous waves in the electroencephalogram and it is associated with a further increase in the vagal dominance of the autonomic balance resulting in a lower heart rate and decreased peripheral resistances. The REM phase of sleep is, however, also characterized by hemodynamic instability due to sudden bursts of sympathetic activity, associated with the rapid eye movements. These sympathetic bursts cause sudden changes in heart rate and peripheral resistance and may influence cardiac electrical stability both at the atrial and ventricular levels. Additionally, REM sleep may enhance the risk of anginal attacks in coronary artery disease patients. Analysis of the autonomic balance during the different phases of sleep may also help in the identification of autonomic derangements typically associated with myocardial infarction.",

A video polysomnography recording documented two typical manifestations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, characterized by the persistence of slow waves and without any electroencephalographic or breathing abnormalities. The quantified analysis of the acoustic features while confirming the rhythmic and stable characteristic of the sound suggests the involvement of the vocal fold vibration on its production.

All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided.

      "title": "Excessive Daytime Sleepiness",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and can lead to serious medical consequences, including depression, cognitive impairment, and death or injury from sleeprelated accidents. It can also have a deleterious impact on social functions such as work and marriage. To successfully prevent or remedy such negative outcomes, it is important to periodically screen PD patients for EDS. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), which can be completed in about 5 minutes, is a reasonable screening tool when used in conjunction with a focused history. When EDS is present, assessment of safety is a priority, and recommendations should be clearly stated to the patient. Next, an underlying cause of EDS can often be identified. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and treatable cause of EDS in the general population. Patients with PD are also at increased risk for other sleep disorders that cause EDS, such as rapid eye movement (REM), sleep behavioral disorder, and insomnia. PD symptoms can directly cause EDS by dramatically reducing sleep quality. PD treatment can cause EDS directly, or cause hallucinations and dyskinesias that similarly interfere with sleep. Furthermore, medications that reduce these side effects also cause somnolence. Finally, the underlying pathophysiology of PD also appears to directly cause EDS. Polysomnography may be needed to clarify the etiology of EDS, but often history and physical examination can lead to correct diagnosis and specific treatment. When no cause can be found, or treatment is unsuccessful, it may be appropriate to treat patients with wakefulness-promoting agents. Our goal is to provide the clinician with a rational, flexible, and cost-effective approach to evaluate and manage EDS in patients with PD. Sleep attacks and driving are additional issues that we discuss at the end of this chapter",

      "title": "Ask About Daytime Sleepiness!",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is being recognized increasingly as a significant public health problem.1 Sleep loss or inadequate sleep time is the most common cause of EDS in the general population.1–3 Primary sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, and periodic leg movements in sleep are prevalent, particularly among older persons, and can contribute to EDS.4 Other medical conditions, such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, psychiatric illness, chronic pain syndromes, and several neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders, can disrupt sleep and lead to EDS. Moreover, widely prescribed medications, including diuretics, antihypertensives, sympathomimetic agents, corticosteroids, sedative-hypnotics, analgesics, and certain antidepressants, can cause EDS by interfering with sleep continuity and/or by having a direct sedating effect in the daytime. The adverse consequences of EDS are numerous. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hypersomnolence is associated with neurocognitive deficits, including decrements in attention, vigilance, and memory.5 Evidence also supports a strong association between EDS and an increased risk for domestic, work-related, and motor vehicle accidents.6,7 Impaired general health status and limitations in activities of daily living are yet other common sequela.8,9 Furthermore, landmark epidemiologic studies such as the Honolulu Heart Program and the Cardiovascular Health Study have associated EDS with a higher prevalence of heart disease, congestive heart failure, and dementia.10,11 The important report by Newman et al. in this issue extends our understanding by documenting an independent association between EDS and incident cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. In addition, the gender differences noted in the current investigation are consistent with previous reports of the high prevalence of sleep complaints among women and with the association of sleep disordered breathing with increased mortality in women in the nursing home setting.12 The causal pathway between EDS and morbid events, including cognitive dysfunction, accidents, and impaired quality of life, is readily envisioned. The occurrence of brief “microsleeps” and even prolonged sleep episodes in the daytime can decrease vigilance and lead to compromised performance at home, work, or during safety-sensitive tasks such as driving. Moreover, the inability to maintain wakefulness during the day can have a deleterious influence on social functioning and can lower one's sense of well-being. See also p 115 Yet unresolved, however, are the mechanisms through which EDS relates independently to cardiovascular end-points and mortality. At least three different causal pathways are proposed. First, it is possible that the increased morbidity and mortality associated with EDS are a function of underlying sleep disorders that cause EDS. It is well established that sleep-disordered breathing is prevalent in the general population. In middle-aged adults the prevalence is estimated to be at least 2 to 4%, and in certain subgroups it may be much higher.13 Several investigators have shown that the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing increases with age, with estimates that perhaps 30 to 40% of older individuals may have this chronic disorder.12,14,15 Recent work indicates that the frequency of disordered breathing events, severity of associated oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and degree of sleep fragmentation contribute independently to the occurrence of EDS.16 Clinic- and population-based studies have also shown an association between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension and prevalent cardiovascular disease independent of the effects of age, gender, smoking, and obesity.17 Therefore, in this setting, morbidity and mortality caused by EDS reflect underlying primary sleep disorders that are, in turn, associated with cardiovascular end-points and mortality. Second, many of the chronic medical conditions that are prevalent in older people, such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, emphysema, and depression, can be related indirectly to EDS through their interference with nocturnal sleep quality. It is now appreciated that congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease can predispose to sleep-disordered breathing, which can potentially exacerbate the predisposing condition.18,19 As with the occurrence of a primary sleep disorder, EDS in this setting is merely a surrogate marker for these chronic ailments, Third, it is possible that EDS has a direct role, through an undefined mechanism, in increasing morbidity and mortality, independent of either underlying primary sleep disorders or other recognized chronic medical illnesses. Experimental sleep deprivation studies in normal volunteers demonstrate a heightened sympathetic drive with elevated levels of circulating catecholamines.20,21 Extensive data indicate that sleep deprivation is also linked with significant alterations in the neuroendocrine axis characterized by an increase in serum Cortisol levels and a slower rate of daylong decline following the early morning circadian elevation.21,22 In the context of multiple chronic illnesses that are common among older adults, such neurohumoral alterations can increase further the probability of precipitating adverse events and require further delineation. Daytime sleepiness is assessed either objectively or subjectively. Objective methods include the multiple sleep latency test and the maintenance of wakefulness test.21–24 The former is used commonly in the clinical setting and many consider it to be the gold standard for the assessment of sleepiness. Subjective methods utilize self-report to identify sleep propensity and include validated questionnaires such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale.24,25 Since patients often underestimate their own degree of sleepiness, validated questionnaires addressing the likelihood of feeling drowsy or falling asleep during specific activities are more effective than general inquiries regarding the presence or absence of EDS. Moreover, questions about specific sleep-wake habits and input from family members, bed partners, and/or caregivers can provide a more accurate estimate of the degree and functional impact of EDS. In their study, Newman et al. use a general inquiry for identifying sleep-related problems and daytime sleepiness, raising the possibility of some degree of misclassification in their exposure variable (i.e., daytime sleepiness). In another recent prospective population-based study, the presence of self-reported snoring and general EDS was associated with total death rate and cardiovascular mortality. This effect was age-dependent and persisted after adjustment for body mass index, history of hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes. Interestingly, isolated snoring or hypersomnolence were not associated with increased mortality.26 In each of these investigations, the use of validated questionnaires to assess EDS and information regarding the presence of documented sleep-related disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing) would have been invaluable in examining the true independent effect of EDS on cardiovascular endpoints and all-cause mortality and the pathogenesis of this relationship. Newer initiatives sponsored by the National Institutes of Health have addressed some of the limitations of these important initial studies. The Sleep Heart Health Study, a multi-site longitudinal cohort study, is investigating the links between sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular endpoints.27 Until such prospective data clarify these relationships, we believe that currently available evidence supports the simple, noninvasive measure of asking our patients about their sleep and, in particular, about the presence of inappropriate hypersomnolence. All healthcare professionals have an important role in recognizing EDS as a sign and symptom that is amenable to effective treatment, The time-honored notion that somnolence is an expected (and accepted) concomitant of normal aging requires reevaluation: EDS that intrudes on daytime function not only compromises the quality of life but may also threaten lifespan. Despite the high prevalence of primary and secondary sleep problems among older persons, health professionals have often not prioritized the sleep history essential to recognition of potentially treatable conditions, and an important opportunity for health promotion is lost.28 We can and must do better.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

Unawareness of the meaning of these symptoms often mislead both the patient and his physician.To define and describe the types of visual illusions and hallucinations which can be commonly encountered in neuro-ophthalmological practice.Overview article.Hallucinations are a perception not based on sensory input, whereas illusions are a misinterpretation of a correct sensory input. Both phenomenon can be due to medication or drug, or to an altered mental status. Visual hallucinations can be formed (objects, people) or unformed (light, geometric figures). They can be generated either by a lesion on the antechiasmatic pathway, by a seizure phenomenon, by a migrainous phenomenon, or by a release phenomenon secondary to visual differentiation. Investigations will be directed towards a retinopathy, an optic neuropathy, a chiasmal or retrochiasmal lesion, or a bilateral antechiasmal lesion (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Visual illusions include meta-morphopsias, micro- macropsias, polyopia, palinopsia (visual perseveration), achromatopsia, Pulfrich phenomenon, or subjective vertical deviation. Illusions can be due to lesions of the retina, the optic nerve, the visual cortex (primary or associative), or the graviceptive pathways.As most patients do not spontaneously mention their symptoms, history taking is essential. The first step is to rule out medication or an altered mental status as the possible cause of these symptoms.

Common sleep issues include chronic insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, and sleep-disordered breathing. Diagnostic tools, such as a comprehensive sleep history and questionnaires, or a sleep log for more specific complaints, are commonly used. Polysomnography is not recommended as a routine test; however, it can be used for abnormal behaviors during sleep or if treatment fails. Sleep disorder management is based on the etiology and may include nonpharmacological and pharmacological alternative treatments. For example, nonpharmacological management for chronic insomnia and some sleep disorders may consist of cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene education, relaxation therapy, sleep restriction, light therapy, and stimulus control therapy. Because the quality of evidence for pharmacological treatment is poor, the medication choice should be based on shared decision-making between the practitioner and the patient, with limited prescription.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

      "title": "Sleep and circadian difficulties in schizophrenia: presentations, understanding, and treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is common in mental health care to ask about people’s days but comparatively rare to ask about their nights. Most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia struggle at nighttime. The next-day effects can include a worsening of psychotic experiences, affective disturbances, and inactivity, which in turn affect the next night’s sleep. Objective and subjective cognitive abilities may be affected too. Patients commonly experience a mix of sleep difficulties in a night and across a week. These difficulties include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping at all; nightmares and other awakenings; poor-quality sleep; oversleeping; tiredness; sleeping at the wrong times; and problems establishing a regular sleep pattern. The patient group is also more vulnerable to obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. We describe in this article how the complex presentation of non-respiratory sleep difficulties arises from variation across five factors: timing, mental state, need for sleep, self-care, and environment. We set out 10 illustrative patterns of such difficulties experienced by patients with non-affective psychosis. These sleep problems are eminently treatable with intensive psychological therapy delivered over approximately eight sessions. We describe key techniques and their typical order of implementation by presentation. Sleep problems are an important issue for patients. Giving them the therapeutic attention patients often desire brings both real clinical benefits and improves views of services. Treatment is also very likely to lessen psychotic experiences and mood disturbances while improving daytime functioning and quality of life. Tackling sleep difficulties can be a route toward the successful treatment of psychosis.",

      "title": "Sleep-related Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract As in many areas of sleep medicine, it is often a challenge deciding whether or not movements during sleep reflect truly abnormal nocturnal phenomenona or are simply physiological variants. Indeed, when asleep, subconscious shifts of body position occurring every 15 minutes or so are considered entirely normal, as are minor jerks of the extremities and face, particularly during periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, if nocturnal movements are observed to be excessive, violent, or arousing, either to the subject or bed partner, they will usually indicate a defined disorder, especially if the events are stereotypic through the night. Although the second edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) was revised in 2005 to include a new section dedicated to movement disorders occurring specifically during the state of sleep, diagnostic precision of such phenomena is often lacking and evidenced-based treatment protocols, when indicated, are poorly developed. Furthermore, if a sleep-related movement disorder is recognized, it can be very difficult to determine its true clinical significance for sleep quality and subsequent daytime wakefulness, especially in the elderly patient. This chapter addresses those movement disorders that are intimately or exclusively related to the state of sleep or the sleep–wake transition. By convention, parasomnias causing abnormal arousals from deep non-REM sleep, such as sleepwalking or night terrors, will not be covered, although restless legs syndrome is discussed, partly because of its close association with periodic limb movements during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The term Charcot–Wilbrand syndrome (CWS) denotes dream loss following focal brain damage. We report the first case of CWS, in whom neuropsychological functions, extension of the underlying lesion, and sleep architecture changes were assessed. A 73‐year‐old woman reported a total dream loss after acute, bilateral occipital artery infarction (including the right inferior lingual gyrus), which lasted for over 3 months. In the absence of sleep–wake complaints and (other) neuropsychological deficits, polysomnography demonstrated an essentially normal sleep architecture with preservation of REM sleep. Dreaming was denied also after repeated awakenings from REM sleep. This observation suggests that CWS (1) can represent a distinct and isolated neuropsychological manifestation of deep occipital lobe damage, and (2) may occur in the absence of detectable REM sleep abnormalities.

      "title": "Overview of sleep & sleep disorders.",
      "abstract": "Sleep is defined on the basis of behavioural and physiological criteria dividing it into two states: non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep which is subdivided into three stages (N1, N2, N3); and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep characterized by rapid eye movements, muscle atonia and desynchronized EEG. Circadian rhythm of sleep-wakefulness is controlled by the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The neuroanatomical substrates of the NREM sleep are located principally in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus and those of REM sleep are located in pons. A variety of significant physiological changes occur in all body systems and organs during sleep as a result of functional alterations in the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. The international classification of sleep disorders (ICSD, ed 2) lists eight categories of sleep disorders along with appendix A and appendix B. The four major sleep complaints include excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, abnormal movements or behaviour during sleep and inability to sleep at the desired time. The most important step in assessing a patient with a sleep complaint is obtaining a detailed history including family and previous histories, medical, psychiatric, neurological, drug, alcohol and substance abuse disorders. Some important laboratory tests for investigating sleep disorders consist of an overnight polysomnography, multiple sleep latency and maintenance of wakefulness tests as well as actigraphy. General physicians should have a basic knowledge of the salient clinical features of common sleep disorders, such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, circadian rhythm sleep disorders (e.g., jet leg, shift work disorder, etc.) and parasomnias (e.g., partial arousal disorders, REM behaviour disorder, etc.) and these are briefly described in this chapter. The principle of treatment of sleep disorders is first to find cause of the sleep disturbance and vigorously treat the co-morbid conditions causing the sleep disturbance. If a satisfactory treatment is not available for the primary condition or does not resolve the problem, the treatment should be directed at the specific sleep disturbance. Most sleep disorders, once diagnosed, can be managed with limited consultations. The treatment of primary sleep disorders, however, is best handled by a sleep specialist. An overview of sleep and sleep disorders viz., Basic science; international classification and approach; and phenomenology of common sleep disorders are presented.",

Accumulating data support depression as a circadian-related illness, as evidenced by abnormalities in sleep, mood, hormonal secretions, and/or temperature in a subgroup of depressed patients. An estimated 70%–80% of depressed patients complain of sleep disturbances, including insomnia, -morning awakening, and difficulty in initiating sleep. Studies of the mechanisms of action of sleep deprivation may provide potentially important clues as to the switch process. Sleep deprivation in animals has a wide range of physiological and cognitive effects. Relatively little is understood about the interaction between sleep and depression and why sleep patterns frequently normalize with improvement in symptoms.",

      "abstract": "• Decreased slow-wave sleep (SWS) and sleep continuity are major effects of healthy aging and of associated psychopathological states. Using sleep deprivation, we studied the extent to which age- and psychopathology-related sleep \"decay\" is reversible in aged normal, depressed, and demented subjects. Depression or probable Alzheimer's dementia compromised the augmentation of sleep continuity and SWS seen in healthy elderly following sleep deprivation. Rapid eye movement (REM) latency decreased during recovery sleep in the controls but increased in both patient groups. Compared with demented patients, depressed elderly had greater severity of sleep continuity disturbance both before and after sleep deprivation, a more protracted course of recovery sleep, and increased slow-wave density in the second non-REM (NREM) sleep period (during recovery). The REM sleep time was diminished in dementia compared with depression both at baseline and during recovery sleep. These differential effects of age, health, and neuropsychiatric disease on recovery from sleep loss are relevant to recovery or reversal theories of sleep and have implications for daytime well-being in the elderly.",

Studies have emerged linking narcolepsy with various other conditions, ranging from neurodegenerative disease to cardiovascular health. However, the dangers of narcolepsy go beyond the presence of physical hindrances in an individual’s life; they can go as far as threatening an individual’s emotional and mental well-being.",

Some disturbances of the circadian system are responsible for clinical syndromes characterized by chrono-fatigue, one of them being the sleep delayed phase insomnia. Circadian sleep disorders, either functional or structural, are characterized not only by disturbances in sleep architecture and/or sleep quality, but also by the inability to fall asleep and stay awake at desired times. Similarly, sleep and fatigue present in those circadian disorders typically exhibit a daily cyclic pattern. Night workers and shift workers do have chronic sleep deprivation and desynchronisation of their circadian system with the entraining environment. Those phenomena are responsible for severe vigilance problems, a decrease in work productivity and deleterious health side effects. Fatigue and sleep problems in circadian disorders can now benefit from treatments based on the programed use of synchronizers of the circadian clock, like chronotherapy, bright light and melatonin, combined with adequate sleep hygiene recommendations.",

Pain stimuli disturb sleep and nonpainful stimuli [e.g., noise] that disrupt sleep [e.g., slow wave sleep] cause unrefreshing sleep, myalgia, and fatigue. Forced awakenings from sleep reduce pain inhibition and yields pain and nonpainful symptoms. Neurotransmitter dysfunctions, for example, central nervous system serotonin and substance P affect both sleep and pain. In clinical studies of FMS and CFS, unrefreshing sleep is associated with frequent periodic electroencephalogram arousals from sleep, i.e., the cyclical alternating pattern, sleep apneas, and periodic limb movements.Conclusions: These experimental and clinical findings have clinical and therapeutic implications in the assessment and management of FMS. Diurnal sleep/wake-related physiological studies provide objective evidence that further the understanding of FMS and chronic fatigue syndrome. Preliminary studies of novel treatments that aim to facilitate restorative sleep suggest a rationale for better management of FMS and related illnesses.",

People with sleep disturbances may complain of difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, abnormal behaviors during the night, daytime sleepiness or fatigue. Asking about typical bedtime rituals, sleep times and habits is a good place to start in the assessment of any sleep disorder. Many people who present with the classic symptom of insomnia may have more than one problem with sleep. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), parasomnias, narcolepsy, and nocturnal seizures sometimes require formal evaluation in the sleep laboratory. The most commonly used techniques used in recording and evaluating sleep disorders include the polysomnogram (PSG), the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and under special circumstances, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT).",

From the moment clinicians first see patients, they quite naturally notice many things about their motor behavior: body posture, degree of muscle tension, amount of fidgeting or pacing and facial expression. The muscles of the eye and face are innervated by cranial nerves that originate in the brain. Consequently, disturbances in facial or eye muscle functioning provide crucial clues about whether individua's difficulties originate in the nervous system outside the brain or within brain. Neurological soft signs are subtle, lifelong abnormalities in motor and sensory functioning that are likely caused by imperfect embryonic development or minor, early brain injury. “Automatic behavior” refers to rote movement behaviors that are carried out by individuals in an altered state of consciousness.

It is characterized by atonia during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep that continues into wakefulness, causing patients to become temporarily unable to talk or move but possessing full consciousness and awareness of their surroundings. Sleep paralysis is listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition (ICSD-3) as a parasomnia occurring during REM sleep that be classified as either isolated or narcolepsy-associated. Several brain areas, including the forebrain, hypothalamus, and brainstem, as well as several neurotransmitters and modulators, are involved in the control of REM sleep. The primary brain region responsible for inducing muscle paralysis during REM sleep is the subcoeruleus nucleus, also known as the sublaterodorsal (SLD) nucleus in rats. Sleep paralysis results from the inability to immediately restore muscle tone during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. In this article, we systematically review the neural circuit that controls REM sleep and the underlying mechanisms, predisposing factors, clinical characteristics, and treatments for sleep paralysis. We also compare isolated sleep paralysis (ISP) and narcolepsy-associated sleep paralysis and speculate upon the role of microsleep in sleep paralysis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is the result of the loss of physiological inhibition of muscle tone during REM sleep, characterized by dream-enacting behavior and widely recognized as a prodromal manifestation of alpha-synucleinopathies. Indeed, patients with isolated RBD (iRBD) have an extremely high estimated risk to develop a neurodegenerative disease after a long follow up. Nevertheless, in comparison with PD patients without RBD (PDnoRBD), the occurrence of RBD in the context of PD (PDRBD) seems to identify a unique, more malignant phenotype, characterized by a more severe burden of disease in terms of both motor and non-motor symptoms and increased risk for cognitive decline. However, while some medications (eg, melatonin, clonazepam, etc.) and non-pharmacological options have been found to have some therapeutic benefits on RBD there is no available treatment able to modify the disease course or, at least, slow down the neurodegenerative process underlying phenoconversion. In this scenario, the long prodromal phase may allow an early therapeutic window and, therefore, the identification of multimodal biomarkers of disease onset and progression is becoming increasingly crucial. To date, several clinical (motor, cognitive, olfactory, visual, and autonomic features) neurophysiological, neuroimaging, biological (biofluids or tissue biopsy), and genetic biomarkers have been identified and proposed, also in combination, as possible diagnostic or prognostic markers, along with a potential role for some of them as outcome measures and index of treatment response. In this review, we provide an insight into the present knowledge on both existing and future biomarkers of iRBD and highlight the difference with PDRBD and PDnoRBD, including currently available treatment options.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder (SRRMD) is characterized by repetitive rhythmic motor behaviors involving large muscle groups that occur predominantly during stage N1 sleep. SSRMs are common in infants and children but they usually spontaneously resolve before adolescence. This case presents a rare adult case of SRRMD. Report of case(s) A 60-year-old man initially presents to clinic for evaluation of repetitive movements needed to initiate sleep. Patient reports the problem starting in his childhood, where he needs to rock and roll intentionally in bed to fall asleep. He had been prescribed clonazepam 2mg and had been taking this along with doxylamine and melatonin nightly, but still reports frequent nocturnal awakenings due to body rolling. He specifically denies any hypnic kicking/jerking, or discomfort in legs while falling asleep. Patient has no excessive alcohol consumption, marijuana, or illicit drug use. Differentials for the patient’s condition include hyperarousal, chronic anxiety, iron deficiency, sleep-related breathing disorder, and rhythmic movement disorder. Patient consequently underwent an in-lab diagnostic polysomnography study which showed no evidence of sleep-related breathing disorders with AHI of 1.6 (AASM 3%). Sleep efficiency was low at 60.8% and sleep architecture showed decreased REM sleep and decreased N3 sleep. Rhythmic movements were noted during sleep and it was manifested by excessive transient muscle activity in both limb &amp; chin EMG leads and also whole body rocking in the video recording. Moderate periodic limb movements were noted with PLM index to 17. Patient was seen in clinic 6 months later with persistent symptoms and his dose of clonazepam was increased slowly to 2.5 mg and then 3 mg. On the 3 mg of clonazepam, patient had resolution of symptoms. Conclusion Our case describes a patient who had SRRMs that commenced in childhood persisting well into adulthood. Reported adult cases of SRRMD are few, and have been associated with sleep apnea, REM sleep behavior disorder, and RLS, while many remain idiopathic such as the case with this patient. While benzodiazepines are still first line for SRRMD, further work up and investigation into possible comorbid conditions could yield insight into the etiology and offer alternative treatment options to patients.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common motor movement disorder and second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease (AD), is often preceded by a period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is associated with impairment of a variety of cognitive domains including executive function, attention, visuospatial abilities and memory. MCI, a risk factor for developing dementia, affects around 30% of de novo PD patients and can increase to 75% after more than 10 years. While 30–40% remain in the MCI state, up to 60% will convert to dementia. Characteristic findings are slowing of EEG rhythms, frontotemporal hypoperfusion, decreased functional connectivity in the default mode and attentional networks, prefrontal and basal-ganglia-cortical circuits, which often manifests prior to clinical symptoms and overt brain atrophy. The heterogeneity of cognitive phenotypes suggests that a common neurodegenerative process affects multiple functional neuronal networks and neuromodulatory systems that may be superimposed by Lewy body and Alzheimer's-related or other co-pathologies. Sparse neuropathological data for PD-MCI revealed a heterogenous picture with various morphological changes similar to MCI in other diseases. This review highlights the essential epidemiological, clinical, neuroimaging and morphological changes in PD-MCI, available biomarkers, and discusses the heterogenous pathobiological mechanisms involved in its development. In view of its complex pathogenesis, well-designed longitudinal clinico-pathological studies are warranted to clarify the alterations leading to MCI in PD, which may be supported by fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers as a basis for early diagnosis and future adequate treatment modalities of this debilitating disorder.",

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "abstract": "Many conditions that can cause “sleep disturbance” for many different health conditions, where normal constant sleep is interrupted since altering falling asleep to a frequent disturbance for a long time duration, usually implicit for a wide range of causes including environment alteration, health problems that affect physical or mental body functions, and others. Finding causes for “sleep disturbances or sleep disorders” is not an easy task, even for medical professionals. At this time, where humanity is confronting a huge amount of disasters due to climate change, bacteria and viruses of different kinds have been evolving as a treat with a long pandemic time, and economic impacts do not present a near sign of stabilization; technological advances based on artificial intelligence are making frequent changes in our way of living, which usually widen the amount of information that we receive and process. These factors and others are misdirecting the basic survival needs of human beings, such as food, water, air quality, and the necessary and confronting need to sleep. These altered facts overuse our brains and, as a consequence, maximize their normal functions. Including natural biology tools such as the “circadian clock” that regulate all brain sub-structures, the nervous system expresses its frustration as a progressive brain structural deterioration.",

      "abstract": "Sleep inertia (SI) defines a period of transitory hypovigilance, confusion, disorientation of behavior and impaired cognitive and sensory-motor performance that immediately follows awakening. SI, the cognitive and behavioral correlate of the transition from sleep to wakefulness, has been incorporated in several models of sleep and vigilance regulation. Monitoring of several physiological parameters during the awakening period clearly indicate that this transition process is very slow. On the cognitive and behavioral side, SI has relevant operational implications. SI is one of the most serious contraindications to the use of napping during quasi-continuous operations if the individual may be required to perform complex tasks immediately after sudden awakening at unpredictable times. The studies on SI modulating factors showed that SI is strongly affected by slow wave sleep amount and sleep depth, while the outcomes concerning the modulation of SI by circadian factors are not consistent. Cognitive tasks involving high attentional load seem to be much more affected by SI than simple motor ones, performance accuracy being more impaired than speed. Finally, some possible countermeasures against the detrimental effects of SI to be applied in operational settings have been provided.",

Careful evaluation and therapy can prevent inappropriate psychiatric diagnosis, avoid ineffective treatment, and ameliorate the sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "The question as to whether the beneficial effect of sleep deprivation in depression is related to the increased wakefulness or to the sleep suppression by itself, is made moot by the search activity concept. According to this concept, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is functionally deficient in depression and increases feelings of helplessness and hopelessness instead of restoring mood and search activity. Thus, REM sleep deprivation, either selective or not, is beneficial by breaking a vicious circle: depression in wakefulness…giving up (helplessness) in dream scenario…increased depression in the subsequent wakefulness. In addition, sleep deprivation is an important challenge for the depressed patient. The ability to confront this challenge and maintain wakefulness has a positive outcome on depression, especially when wakefulness is accompanied by active behavior.",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea, polysomnography, and split-night studies: consensus statement of the Connecticut Thoracic Society and the Connecticut Neurological Society.",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a state-dependent syndrome. It is characterized by repeated collapse of the upper airway as the result of the loss of waking neuromuscular drive as the brain changes from wakefulness to sleep. This produces a state-dependent decrease in muscle tone, which, together with other predisposing factors such as obesity and anatomical narrowing of the upper airway, results in the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing describes the continuum from simple snoring (pharyngeal vibration), to flow limitation (hypopnea), to complete cessation of breathing (apnea). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the common description of what is now appreciated as the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. The cardinal symptoms are snoring, observed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The immediate physical consequences are hypoxia, repeated sympathetic discharges, increased cardiac load, and repeated brain arousals. The repetitive arousals are required to restore airway patency, resulting in severely fragmented sleep and consequent sleep deprivation. The syndrome, untreated, produces significant cognitive and cardiorespiratory morbidity, and potential mortality. Compared to matched controls, patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea use twice the health resources and spend double the health-care dollars in the 10 years prior to diagnosis. Both trends are reversed by successful treatment. It is by definition a sleep-related illness and can be observed and evaluated only when the patient is asleep. Polysomnography is the laboratory procedure to study sleep and its protean dysfunctions. Multiple physiologic parameters are required to document the various types of sleep disorders as well as to establish the origin of pathologic sleep fragmentation. Complete polysomnography includes (but is not limited to) electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram ((EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory effort, air flow, and oxygen saturation. Treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, uvulopalatal and/or maxillomandibular surgery, positional control, and weight loss. The efficacy of each depends on the individual anatomy and the severity of the sleep-disordered breathing. CPAP is accepted as the most reliable treatment regardless of anatomy and severity. It is currently the only treatment modality which can be titrated during sleep and requires simultaneous polysomnography.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu.

      "abstract": "Similar to the adult patient, a child or adolescent may actively feign or produce artificial symptoms (synonymous: Munchausen syndrome). The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

They remain poorly recognized and understood. They fall under 3 categories; \"NREM parasomnias\", \"REM parasomnias\" and \"Other parasomnias\". Sleepwalking, sleep terrors and confusional arousals constitute the first category. The key differentiating characteristic of sleepwalking is the extensive wandering, of sleep terrors the autonomic hyperarousal and of confusional arousal the complex behaviors and sluggish response to the environment. There is a degree of overlap among all three. Among the REM parasomnias the most common is nightmares and the most injurious REM sleep behavior disorder or RBD. Nightmares are anxiety and fear provoking recurrent dreams and most do not require treatment but of those that do tend to respond to cognitive therapy low dose prazosin, an alpha 1 antagonist. RBD is a condition where the normal atonia of REM is absent and patients tend to act out their dreams hence risking injury to self or bed partner. This condition can be idiopathic but may also be related to neurodegenerative disorders, other sleep disorders or secondary to exposure to antidepressant medication. Treatment is generally successful with either clonazepam or high dose melatonin. The category of other parasomnias comprises of conditions that are not state dependant. Catathrenia or nocturnal groaning is such a condition that although benign can lead to significant sleep disruption and social embarrassment. It usually responds to CPAP even in the absence of sleep related breathing disorder. Sleep related eating disorder is another such parasomnia which can lead to injury, obesity and other adverse health outcomes. The treatment of choice is usually topiramate although pramipexole and SSRIs have been shown effective as well.

Discharges occurring in phases of light sleep had greater activity and more focal character in relation to the remaining NREM phases. On the other hand, discharges in deep sleep phases had a greater tendency for generalization. In half the cases focal discharges disappeared in the REM sleep phase. Intraseizure changes depended on the phase of sleep, focal or generalized character, and localization of pathological focus.

Symptoms commenced in adolescence or early adult life in most patients, and remissions were uncommon. Narcolepsy occurred several times each day, often in unusual circumstances and sometimes with little warning. The mean total sleep time of narcoleptics was a little over 9 hours in each 24 hour period, as compared with under 8 in normal subjects. Cataplexy occurred in 93 patients, most commonly when subjects were tired. Attacks were similar in nature to physiological weakness with laughter, although other sudden sensory or emotional stimuli did not cause paralysis of voluntary movement nor loss of muscle tone in normal subjects. Half these patients had frequent dreams before the onset of proper sleep, and 62 had sleep paralysis. This was often frightening, with feelings of suffocation, accompanied by dreams, and of uncertain length. A minority of patients with narcolepsy had muscle aches and jerks before sleep, double vision or loss of focus during cataplexy, went sleep-walking by day, and had daytime hallucinations. Amphetamines had been given to 71 patients for periods of up to 33 years with adequate, but rarely complete, control of narcolepsy. Side effects were common and almost half these patients became tolerant, needing higher dosage to control symptoms. Three patients had a cerebrovascular accident whilst taking amphetamines. Imipramine or clomipramine had ben given in combination with amphetamines to 33 patients for periods of up to 6 years with considerable improvement in both cataplexy and sleep paralysis, and few side effects. Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension as a result of amphetamines or combined treatment did not occur.",

      "title": "CHRONIC SLEEP FRAGMENTATION ACCELERATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODROMAL SYMPTOMS AND PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN PARKINSON’ S DISEASE MODEL MICE",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Parkinson’ s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’ s disease. Patients with PD exhibit various non-motor symptoms, including constipation, hyposmia, and sleep disturbance, in addition to classical motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and rest tremor. The pathological hallmarks of PD are phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (p-syn) accumulation and dopaminergic neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars compacta. Patients are generally diagnosed with PD after the onset of motor symptoms, but the onset of non-motor symptoms often precedes that of motor symptoms. This prodromal phase of PD, which lasts for more than a decade, is a critical time window for disease modification to prevent or delay the onset of motor symptoms. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in older adults and patients with PD. In patients with PD, chronic sleep fragmentation due to frequent nocturnal arousals is the most prevalent symptom of insomnia. While various PD-related etiologies induce chronic sleep fragmentation, recent epidemiological studies suggested that chronic sleep fragmentation itself may accelerate the clinical and pathological progression of PD. However, the precise causal relationship between progression of PD and chronic sleep fragmentation remains unknown. Aims &amp; Objectives We aimed to test whether chronic sleep fragmentation accelerates the disease course of PD using model mice. Method Transgenic mouse model of PD (Tg) that recapitulates age-dependent onset and progression of premotor non-motor symptoms, or wild type (WT) mice were housed in either of the following cages from the age when Tg mice do not exhibit non-motor symptoms: (1) sleep disturbance (SD) cage, a running- wheel-based device that induces chronic sleep fragmentation similar to PD patients (SD group), (2) wheel cage (WC), a control cage with a running wheel but with no sleep disruption (WC group), or (3) normal cage (NC), another control cage without running wheel (NC group). After 5 or 6 weeks, multiple non- motor symptoms were evaluated. After 7 weeks, brains were collected, and p-syn accumulation in the brains of Tg mice was evaluated. Results Among Tg mice, only the SD group showed non-motor symptoms. Among WT mice, the SD group showed no or minimal non-motor symptoms which were milder than that of Tg mice in the SD group. Among Tg mice, the SD group showed significantly increased p-syn accumulation in multiple brain regions. Discussion &amp; Conclusion These results suggest that chronic sleep fragmentation accelerates the onset of prodromal symptoms and p-syn accumulation in PD model mice.

      "abstract": "In a 52-year-old man who presented with an obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS) syndrome, we observed cerebral anoxic attacks during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Polysomnography showed that the attacks were due to severe hypoxia provoked by apneas lasting up to 220 s. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical features clearly differentiate cerebral anoxic attacks from epileptic seizures. The length of apneas in our patient is very unusual, indicating an impairment of the mechanism terminating apneas. The cause of this impairment is unknown. However, this case report documents a possible pathogenetic mechanism other than heart arrhythmias responsible for sudden death or coma arising during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Introduction 1.1 Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease Idiopathic Parkinson`s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by basal ganglia dysfunction frequently being associated with frontostriatal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.The prevalence of PD increases with age and is estimated at 100-200/100000 people (Chen et al., 2001;Schrag et al., 2000) worldwide.The clinical hallmarks of PD are akinesia, rigidity and tremor (Douglas et al., 1999;Hughes et al., 1992).In the past PD has been considered as a pure movement disorder, but in recent years the presence of non-motor symptoms in PD has been recognized.Non-motor symptoms include a variety of autonomic dysfunctions such as orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia, bladder dysfunction, sleep disturbances, psychiatric symptoms, i.e. depression, hallucinations or psychosis and cognitive impairment.Non-motor symptoms such as pain, depression or sleep disturbances might precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and are sometimes even more disabling than motor deficits.For many years cognitive impairment and the occurrence of dementia have been considered as not typical for IPD.James Parkinson (Parkinson, 1817) wrote in his essay on the shaking palsy \" the senses are not disturbed\".However, there is now enough evidence in the literature that dementia might occur in up to 40% of PD-patients (Emre et al., 2004).PD dementia is the third most common reason for dementia.Dementia in PD has been associated with reduced quality of life, greater sensitivity to medication, higher risk of developing psychosis, shortened survival (Levy, 2002), increased caregivers stress and frequent transfer to nursing homes (Aarsland et al., 2000) compared to PD-patients without dementia.In contrast to dementia mild cognitive impairment might occur early in the course of the disease.Approximately, a quarter of PDpatients without dementia have mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 20% might have MCI at the time of diagnosis (Aarsland et al., 2011).The cognitive deficits in PD are specific and include executive dysfunction, attentional and visuospatial deficits.Executive functions include control, manipulation, and cognitive flexibility (",

      "title": "Concussion in Sport",
      "abstract": "Concussions affect millions of athletes of all ages each year in a variety of sports. Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

The application of selective and total PSD techniques caused no noticeable changes in the functional state and integrative activity of the brain, the latter warranting its successful use for treatment of some psychoneurological disturbances in clinics. The assumption has been advanced about the similarity of the neurochemical changes forming the need both for wakefulness and PS.",

      "abstract": "The olfactory system participates in the reception, integration, and interpretation of olfactory signals. This chemical sense is essential for survival since it is involved in basic behaviors and physiological processes. Olfactory function decreases with age; however, olfactory impairments are also observed in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric pathologies. It is widely described that olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom in Parkinson (PD) and Alzheimer (AD) diseases, furthermore, olfactory brain areas are affected by the pathological hallmarks of these diseases before the brain areas involved in the motor and cognitive impairments, respectively. This information suggests a key role of olfactory system damage in the beginning of a neurodegenerative process. Not only does the early injury of the olfactory system occur in AD and PD, but also in other pathologies since increasing evidence indicate the presence of olfactory impairments in other neurogenerative and psychiatric diseases namely, depression, schizophrenia, and autism among others. In addition, people with systemic chronic diseases that promote central nervous system damage such as type 2 diabetes and obesity also show olfactory dysfunction, which also suggests that olfactory alterations in these individuals could be an early manifestation of a neurodegenerative process. Then, the aim of the manuscript is to describe the information which supports that olfactory system impairment is a prodromal factor for the development of several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, to recognize it as a shared mechanism of degeneration among diverse neuropathologies, and discuss the relevance of the assessment of the olfactory function in the diagnosis and improvement of neurodegeneration.",

Ситуація в країні сприяє збільшенню травматичних стресів, які можуть мати серйозні наслідки для дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Ці події порушують базове відчуття безпеки особистості дитини та можуть призвести до розвитку різних психічних проблем. Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

      "abstract": "Sleep comprises one third of human life and is very important for maintaining healthy mental and physical states. Sleep disorders disturbing normal sleep are very common and may induce serious consequences. Sleep disorder medicine is based on the concept of two different states (waking and sleep) of the human brain. The problems of the waking conscious state affect sleep and problems during sleep also affect daytime mental and physical activities. The common symp-toms of patients with sleep disorders are excessive daytime sleepiness, a decrease in alertness, and fatigue. To detect sleep disorders, we should understand the physiology of normal sleep. Normal sleep consists of non-rapid eye movement (75% to 80%) and rapid eye movement (20% to 25%) sleep. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders second edition lists 77 different sleep disorders divided into 8 categories. Clinical approaches to sleep disorder patients should include detailed history taking including sleep history, a sleep questionnaire, sleep diary, physical examination including the nasal/oral cavities and airway, and neurological/psychological examination. The common sleep disorders are obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and circadian rhythm sleep disorder. We should learn the characteristic clinical features of each sleep disorder and how to detect and treat them. We need a more active effort to educate physicians about sleep disorder medicine and should try large sample, long-term, and prospective studiesto reveal the pathophysiology and enhance the treatment of sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are common, serious, and treatable. However, most patients with sleep disorders are underdiagnosed and not treated appropriately due to lack of knowledge of sleep disorder medicine. The Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea should focus more attention on and provide more support for timely diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.",

Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep problem affecting nearly one-third of the population as either a primary or comorbid condition. Insomnia has been defined as both a symptom and a disorder, and is characterized as sleep that is chronically unrestorative or poor in quality often due to difficulty in initiating sleep, in maintaining sleep, or with waking up too early. Insomnia results in some form of daytime impairment in the patient's normal activites. Although the exact pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood, it is often believed to arise from a state of hyperarousal in multiple neurophysiological and/or psychological systems. Population-based studies suggest that while about one-third of the general population complains of sleep disturbance, only 10-15 percent has associated symptoms of daytime functional impairment, and even fewer, only 6-10 percent have impairments sufficient for the diagnostic criteria of insomnia. The cornerstone of the insomnia evaluation and diagnosis is a comprehensive history obtained by the clinical interview with patient and/or family. Additional assessment tools, such as sleep diary or log, various questionnaires, actigraphy, and multichannel polysomnography (PSG) have been used as an aid to diagnosis, although many are limited in their validation. Insomnia causes a significant burden of medical, psychiatric, societal consequences on the individual and societal level. Clinicians in either primary settings or specialized clinics should have knowledge to manage insomnia with confidence.",

      "title": "Prognostic Counseling for Patients With Idiopathic/Isolated REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: Should We Tell Them What's Coming? Yes",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by often violent dream enactment behavior, such as sleep-related vocalization, screaming or shouting, punching, arm flailing, or kicking movements, that parallel the content of a nightmare or vivid dream.1, 2 Diagnosis requires confirmation by polysomnography (PSG), which demonstrates its neurophysiological signature of REM sleep atonia loss (a.k.a., REM sleep without atonia).3-5 iRBD has been recently demonstrated to be a common neurological disorder in the general population with a prevalence of approximately 1% to 2%.6, 7 Whether RBD is idiopathic/isolated (iRBD) or symptomatic, RBD is strongly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and MSA.1, 2, 8-10 Even iRBD is strongly associated with symptoms or signs of an underlying covert syncleinopathy, with up to 80% of iRBD patients having nonmotor manifestations of autonomic, cognitive, olfactory, or visual manifestations, or \"soft\" motor signs insufficient for PD diagnosis of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, or postural instability at the time of diagnosis by PSG.10, 11 Approximately 70% of iRBD patients develop PD, DLB, or MSA over longitudinal follow-up of 10 to 15 years, and currently there is no proven beneficial neuroprotective strategy or therapy to prevent the evolution of increasingly devastating neurological deficits.10 Given this, there is currently prevailing uncertainty about the utility of prognostic counseling for iRBD patients, who are at high risk for future development of a neurodegenerative disorder. Should we tell them about their likely future, and if so, what should we tell them?12 Prognostic counseling in iRBD is further complicated by how the patient presents and is given the diagnosis. In between 50% to 60% of patients, dream enactment is not the patient's primary clinical complaint or concern in the sleep clinic, given that they may instead first present for concerns related to obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, hypersomnia symptoms, or chronic insomnia.13 Previous research suggests that sleep clinic populations are unsurprisingly enriched for the discovery of iRBD, with approximately 5% of sleep clinic cohorts having an iRBD diagnosis.14 In another recent study, 11% of patients had another presenting primary sleep complaint and RBD diagnosis was elicited only upon specific questioning, whereas 44% of patients in this cohort were unaware of their dream enactment behaviors.13 These data are consistent with our clinical experience in sleep medicine clinics where RBD is commonly discovered in the history taking process, by screening questionnaires, or even as a secondary and incidental finding during PSG indicated for another primary sleep concern. As such, not all iRBD patients receiving a diagnosis are aware of their dream enactment; many do not consider it a significant concern in their daily lives and are less likely to be seeking prognostic information. For these patients, relaying bad news is much more difficult than if the patient had a primary focus on their dream enactment as a chief complaint. Despite this differential presentation, recent evidence suggests that iRBD as a primary/chief or secondary complaint follows a similarly poor prognostic trajectory toward acquiring overt neurodegenerative disease.13 Currently, there are limited data concerning prognostic counseling of RBD patients. In one recent study, only 47% of adults with iRBD received prognostic counseling (or, at least, documentation concerning counseling), and male neurologists were most likely to have documented counseling in the electronic medical record.15 A more recent study of worldwide experts found that most RBD subspecialty experts provided prognostic counseling, but few asked patients their views concerning their preferences. There are currently no published studies concerning iRBD patient preferences regarding prognostic counseling. Given this evidence vacuum, providers must currently utilize their best judgment and individualize counseling for their specific patients. One prevailing view is that patients seem highly likely to learn about the strong associations between RBD and synucleinopathy risk regardless of what is discussed in the office, given wide availability of the Internet and increasing evidence that patients may seek medical information from this source. Given this, it may be logical to counsel proactively to avoid erosion of trust in the physician-patient relationship. The ethical principle of respect for autonomy holds that patients have a right for self-determination, including knowing as much as possible about their future risk and likelihood for developing a disease, and withholding prognostic information that may be valued by the patient would therefore constitute a breach of the physician's fiduciary responsibility. Despite the current lack of actionability for an ultimately poor and undesirable neurodegenerative disease, additional advantages for transparency in providing counseling to iRBD patients include future life planning regarding finances, health, and retirement. Informed by a likely future with a high risk for developing a neurodegenerative disease, iRBD patients who are currently healthy may want to contemplate their values and preferences for future health needs (including advance care directive documentation), purchase additional insurance for long-term care, ensure adequate financial resources available to support their future health needs, or even accelerate retirement planning (including pursuit of their individual \"bucket list\" wishes and plans). On the other hand, the principle of nonmaleficence demands that physicians carefully consider and minimize any potential harms that may be incurred by prognostic counseling. Whereas there is no evidence that prognostic counseling may be harmful for most patients, caution is needed especially for some individuals with significant mental health comorbidities who may be more vulnerable to experience worsened anxiety or deterioration in mood state. Asking about the iRBD patient's own values and preferences should be the first step in considering prognostic counseling. At a minimum, the iRBD patient should be informed that there is a strong association with other underlying or future neurological diseases, which then presents an opportunity to inquire whether they wish to know more about this association, and if so, when they would wish to be told, and in how much depth. Future research concerning iRBD patients' values and preferences is greatly needed, to inform best practices concerning counseling, but at the current time, at least discussing and documenting the strong iRBD/neurodegenerative disease risk association is a good start.

Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience.

In this condition, the clinical features of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) converge. Both PD and DLB populations have different sleep disturbances that are amplified when combined. Hence, sleep disruption is often significant and multifactorial in PDD. It is proposed that sleep–wake neural networks are affected early in the neurodegenerative process. The resultant lack of sleep results in impaired clearance of toxic metabolites, hastening disease progress. As the motor and nonmotor symptoms of PDD worsen, sleep becomes more disturbed. Medications used to control these symptoms can be sedating or cause insomnia. Comorbid sleep disorders are also often present. All of these factors contribute to poor sleep in these patients. Management is centered on symptom control, quality of life, and treatment of comorbidities.",

In the first part of this review, the relationship between sleep and anxiety is discussed in terms of adaptive response to stress. Recent studies suggested that the corticotropin-releasing hormone system and the locus ceruleus-autonomic nervous system may play major roles in the arousal response to stress. It has been suggested that these systems may be particularly vulnerable to prolonged or repeated stress, further leading to a dysfunctional arousal state and pathological anxiety states, Polysomnographic studies documented limited alteration of sleep in anxiety disorders. There is some indication for alteration in sleep maintenance in generalized anxiety disorder and for both sleep initiation and maintenance in panic disorder; no clear picture emerges for obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. Finally, an unequivocal sleep architecture profile that could specifically relate to a particular anxiety disorder could not be evidenced; in contrast, conflicting results are often found for the same disorder. Discrepancies between studies could have been related to illness severity, diagnostic comorbidity, and duration of illness. A brief treatment approach for each anxiety disorder is also suggested with a special focus on sleep.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of sleep and wakefulness occur in about 60-98% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The majority of research on the scale and nature of the disorders was performed in patients treated with antiparkinsonian drugs, and, therefore, the true picture of sleep disorders was interfering with side effects of therapy. The spectrum of these disorders in PD patients is broad and includes insomnia, parasomnia and hypersomnia. The main symptoms of insomnia are difficulty in maintaining sleep, associated with nocturia, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), night cramps, akinesia and tremor. The frequency of hypersomnia in PD patients not receiving antiparkinsonian drugs was comparable to that in healthy people. In some studies, hypersomnia is considered as an independent phenomenon of PD, and not associated with the quality of night's sleep or concomitant therapy. Parasomnias in PD patients at the early stage are manifested primarily by REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which has been proven to be a predictor of development of PD. According to our data, insomnia, hypersomnia and RBD were identified in patients who did not receive antiparkinsonian drugs. The polysomnographic study showed the development of RBD in 25% of patients. In the analysis of the anamnesis, it was noted that in 8 cases sleep disorders appeared several years before the first motor symptoms.Нарушения сна и бодрствования встречаются у 60—98% пациентов с болезнью Паркинсона (БП). Большинство исследований, касающихся масштаба и характера нарушений, проводилось на фоне лечения противопаркинсоническими препаратами, и соответственно картина истинных нарушений сна дополнялась побочными эффектами терапии. Спектр нарушений сна, обусловленных БП, включает инсомнию, парасомнию и гиперсомнию. Основными проявлениями инсомнии являются затруднения поддержания сна, связанные с никтурией, расстройством поведения в фазе сна с быстрыми движениями глаз (РПБДГ), ночными крампи, акинезией и тремором. Гиперсомния у пациентов с БП, не получающих противопаркинсонической терапии, встречаются не чаще, чем у здоровых. В других исследованиях гиперсомнию рассматривают как самостоятельный феномен БП, не связанный с качеством ночного сна или сопутствующей терапией. Парасомнии на ранней стадии БП проявляются РПБДГ, которое является предиктором развития БП. У пациентов, не получающих противопаркинсонические препараты, нами были выявлены инсомнические расстройства, гиперсомния и РПБДГ. Полисомнографическое исследование подтвердило РПБДГ у 25% пациентов.

What are often perceived as abnormal awakenings are really only the normal awakenings associated with normal sleep stage cycling, and, parents' \"treatment\" of these awakenings with interventions, such as rocking or feeding, only make it more difficult for the child to go back to sleep without them after subsequent awakenings. 4. No evaluation of a sleepless child is complete without a thorough understanding of the child's daily schedule. The child's sleep schedule may be consistent and his sleep normal, and only the timing may be shifted from that desired by the parents.

      "abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting multiple organ systems. 30-40 % of the patients manifest variable neuropsychiatric symptoms leading to significant morbidity and mortality. CNS involvement could be primary if directly related to SLE activity in the CNS or secondary to treatment, infections, metabolic abnormalities or other systemic manifestations such as hypertension (Futrell et al,1992). Primary NPSLE is divided into focal and diffuse disease. Focal NPSLE is characterized by focal neurologic deficits and is strongly associated with the occurrence of thromboembolic events. Diffuse primary NPSLE is a group of neurologic, psychiatric, and cognitive syndromes that vary from overt neurologic and psychiatric symptoms (eg. seizures, psychosis) to more subtle signs such as headache, mood disturbances, anxiety disorders or mild cognitive dysfunction. Neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) manifestations can occur in the absence of either serologic activity or other systemic disease manifestations (Sibbit et al., 1999). Thus, in clinical practice the diagnosis of primary NPSLE is rather presumptive, after the exclusion of alternative causes of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is no single diagnostic test that is sensitive and specific for SLE-related neuropsychiatric manifestations. The assessment of individual patients is based on clinical, neurologic and rheumatologic evaluation, immunoserologic testing, brain imaging, and psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. These examinations are used to support or refute the clinical diagnostic impression, rule out alternative explanations, and form the basis for prospective monitoring of clinical evolution and response to treatment interventions. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard makes the correct diagnosis of primary NPSLE a challenge. This realization has led us in developing under the auspices of the European League Against Rheumatology (EULAR) evidence and expert based recommendations for the management of NPSLE (Bertsias et al, 2010).",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Nonrapid eye movement (NREM) or arousal parasomnias are prevalent conditions in children and young adults, apparently provoked by any medical, physical, mental, or pharmacologic/toxic agent disturbing normal biorhythm and causing sleep fragmentation or abundant amount of slow wave sleep. The nadir and the ascending slope of the first sleep cycle of night sleep are the typical periods when NREM parasomnias, especially sleepwalking may occur on sleep-microstructural level; microarousals are the typical moments allowing NREM parasomnias. While sleep-disturbing factors have a clear precipitating effect, a genetic predisposition appears necessary in most cases. A candidate gene for sleepwalking has been identified on chromosome 20q12-q13.12 in one sleepwalking family. NREM parasomnias have a genetic and clinical link with nocturnal-frontal lobe epilepsies; possibly through an abnormality of the acetylcholine-related sleep-control system. The association of NREM parasomnias with the human leukocyte antigen system might be the sign of an autoimmune background to be further clarified. In the treatment of arousal parasomnias, the main tools are adequate sleep hygiene and the management of underlying conditions. Their pharmacotherapy has remained unresolved; the best options are clonazepam and some of the antidepressants, while a psychotherapy approach is also justified.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and nightmares are core symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The relationship seems to be bidirectional, and persistent disturbed sleep may influence the course of the disorder. With regard to sleep quality, insomnia and nocturnal anxiety symptoms, as well as nightmares and stressful dreams, are the most prominent sleep symptoms. Polysomnographic measurements reveal alterations of the sleep architecture and fragmentation of rapid eye movement sleep. In addition, sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders and parasomnias are frequent comorbid conditions. The complex etiology and symptomatology of trauma-related sleep disorders with frequent psychiatric comorbidity require the application of multimodal treatment concepts, including psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, there is little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of long-term drug treatment for insomnia and nightmares. For nondrug interventions, challenges arise from the current lack of PTSD-treatment concepts integrating sleep- and trauma-focused therapies. Effective therapy for sleep disturbances may consequently also improve well-being during the day and probably even the course of PTSD. Whether early sleep interventions exert a preventive effect on the development of PTSD remains to be clarified in future studies.",

Many patients experience transient deficits that disappear within 24 hours (Hennerici et al., 1988) or suffer from slight or moderate hemiparesis that regresses completely within a couple of days (Donnan et al., 1991; Duncan et al., 1992). Of the patients with severe completed stroke, approximately 50% recover from hemiparesis (Heinemann et al., 1987; Gresham et al., 1998). In most of these patients, recovery takes place within the first four weeks after infarction, usually starting with shoulder and synergistic arm–hand movements (Donnan et al., 1991; Duncan et al., 1992; Katrak et al., 1998). In subcortical infarctions, functional restoration may be slower, continuing over several years (Fries et al., 1993; Manto et al., 1995). This suggests that a variety of mechanisms may be involved in the restoration of motor functions after brain infarction. Also, clinically undetected white matter changes and the prevalence of silent stroke lesions in patients presenting with the symptoms of acute stroke affect the cognitive and attention state of patients and their capacity to recover (Kase et al., 1989; Sultzer et al., 1995; van Zagten et al., 1996). Therefore, the challenging aspect in each stroke patient is the question to what degree he or she will recover. To monitor recovery, the importance of an adequate assessment of the functional deficit and of the disability level of daily activities has increasingly been recognized (Duncan et al., 2000), since correlation with the tissue perfusion state, the recruitment of peri-lesional and remote areas during functional activation, and changes of cortical excitability, as assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), will provide the basis for an evaluation of the recovery mechanisms and of the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions that have been or will be introduced into clinical use.",

      "title": "Exploring the connection between sleep disorders and neurological diseases: implications for diagnosis and management",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital and complex physiological process which is critical to maintain normal functioning of the nervous system1. Research suggests that lack of sleep or sleep disorders increase the risk of several health issues including hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, depression, and obesity1. In this article, we aim to discover the relationship between sleep disorders and neurological diseases and its implications for diagnosis and management. Sleep disorders have been shown to have an impact on several neurological diseases. Poor sleep can increase the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease2. Moreover, sleep disorders have also been shown to have an impact on increasing the risk of stroke, epilepsy, and affecting cognitive function such as learning and memory. Furthermore, autism spectrum disorder and neuropathic pain have also shown to have an association with sleep disorders2. Just like sleep disorders have a negative impact on the nervous system, some neurological diseases can affect the sleeping patterns of an individual. A few central nervous system conditions have been shown to cause sleep apnea which results in a disturbed circadian rhythm resulting in difficulty sleeping at night. Over 50% of patients with a history of stroke have reported of sleeping problems. Moreover, AD and PD have also been shown to have an association with poor sleep3. Establishing a robust diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological diseases can prove to be challenging due to overlap in symptoms which may lead to misdiagnosis. The current gold standard test for diagnosing sleeping disorders is polysomnography4. Other tests include: lab testing to screen for stimulants or other medications which may increase the level of alertness and disturb sleep; Multiple Sleep Latency Test to determine the degree of sleepiness; Maintenance of Wakefulness Test to test for the ability of staying awake; and actigraphy which includes the use of a device worn on the writs which provides data regarding periods of rest and/or sleep activities5. Even though these tests are accurate per se, there are always certain limitations. In order to understand the complex relationship between neurological diseases and sleep disorders, there is a need for emerging diagnostic technologies to improve accuracy which is critical for providing an early intervention and improving patient outcomes. Treating sleep disorders among patients with underlying neurological disorders can also be arduous, given the complex nature of the relationship between the two. Therapies targeted toward treating sleep disorders include light therapy, orofacial therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). In addition, medical management includes the use of medications such as benzodiazepines (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone), melatonin receptor agonists (eg, ramelteon), and orexin receptor antagonists (eg, suvorexant)6. Furthermore, continuous positive airway pressure has shown promising results in improving sleep among patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea7. Although the discussed managements and treatments are excellent for treating sleep disorders, there still remains a lack of literature in the management and treatment for sleeping disorders among those with underlying neurological disorders. Thus, there is a need for more targeted therapies which take account of the underlying mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological diseases. Collaboration between neurologists and sleep specialists is crucial to enhance the identification and early intervention of sleep disorder and neurological diseases. It is also imperative for primary care physicians to have a strong understanding of sleep abnormalities in patients with neurological conditions. These physicians can screen patients for sleep disorders and refer them so specialists for further evaluation and treatment, which will provide appropriate care to the patients and improve outcomes. Moreover, educating the patients regarding importance of sleep and their beneficial effects on neurological health is essential. The combined effort of patients and their health care professionals will provide a more comprehensive care for those suffering with neurological diseases and sleep disorders. To conclude, sleep is crucial for optimal functioning of the nervous system and research has shown that sleep disorders increase the likelihood of several health issues. The relationship between sleep disorders and neurological disorders in complex making appropriate diagnosis and treatment challenging. Poor sleep has been linked to various neurological diseases including AD, PD, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease. Establishing an accurate diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological disease is necessary for early intervention and improved outcomes. Moreover, targeted therapies that consider the underlying disease mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological are needed to improve management and treatment of these patients. Collaboration between neurologists, sleep specialists, and primary care physicians is necessary for better identifications and treatment of sleep disorders in patients with underlying neurological conditions. Lastly, educating the patients regarding the importance of sleep and encouraging a combined effort between patients and health care providers will provide a more comprehensive care for those with neurological diseases and sleep disorders.

Inevitably, there is an overlap as the disease advances and patients require higher dosages and more complex medical regimens. The non-motor symptoms that emerge secondary to dopaminergic therapy encompass several domains, including neuropsychiatric, autonomic, and sleep. These are detailed in the paper. Neuropsychiatric complications include hallucinations and psychosis. In addition, compulsive behaviors, such as pathological gambling, hypersexuality, shopping, binge eating, and punding, have been shown to have a clear association with dopaminergic medications. Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is a compulsive behavior that is typically viewed through the lens of addiction, with patients needing escalating dosages of dopamine replacement therapy. Treatment side effects on the autonomic system include nausea, orthostatic hypotension, and constipation. Sleep disturbances include fragmented sleep, nighttime sleep problems, daytime sleepiness, and sleep attacks. Recognizing the non-motor symptoms that can arise specifically from dopamine therapy is useful to help optimize treatment regimens for this complex disease.",

Not only are seizures common in the first few days of life, but they are also difficult to diagnose because the clinical manifestations are varied, subtle, and unlike those seen at other times of life. The diagnosis of seizure should be considered if a baby makes odd repetitive stereotyped movements of the limbs or face. Subtle seizures can manifest as repetitive blinking, chewing, eye-rolling or darting tongue movements. Seizures can also involve a stare without blinking, forced eye deviation, peculiar limb postures, apnea or a fixed smile. Ocular manifestations are common, and eye closure during a suspicious event makes the diagnosis of seizure less likely, although it does not exclude it completely [1]. Myoclonic jerks can be normal in sleep but myoclonic epilepsy does occasionally manifest in the neonatal period. Clinical seizures are often short-lived in babies; typically the baby becomes still, there is a change in breathing pattern (sometimes apnea), and a change in level of alertness followed by subtle repetitive movements involving the face or limbs. The whole episode may be over in less than a minute, but the same pattern does tend to recur, in which case it becomes more suspicious.",

      "title": "Sleepwalking and night terrors related to febrile illness",
      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal (1 ) that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep (2, 3). During a sleepwalking episode, the individual seems confused, detached, and relatively unresponsive. Night terrors are more dramatic; patients manifest terror and panic, and there is extreme autonomic discharge and vocalization. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. A genetic component underlies these disorders in that patients often have a family history of sleepwalking, night terrors, or both (4). Sleepwalking and night terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually ‘ ‘outgrown’ ‘ by the end of adolescence, suggesting a delay in CNS maturation (5). When sleepwalking or night terrors have a postpubertal onset or continue into adulthood, however, psychopathology is a more significant causative factor (6, 7). These shared characteristics have led us to propose that sleepwalking and night terrors have a common etiology and are part of the same pathophysiologic spectrum (8). In this paper. we report on febrile illness as a precipitating factor for the onset of sleepwalking or night terrors. To our knowledge. this is the first report establishing this relationship. We have evaluated five children or adolescents who began to sleepwalk or to experience night terrors during or immediately after a febrile illness. The following three case reports illustrate our observations of this phenomenon.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders as both risk factors for, and a consequence of, stroke: A narrative review",
      "abstract": "Background and purpose: Sleep disorders are increasingly implicated as risk factors for stroke, as well as a determinant of stroke outcome. They can also occur secondary to the stroke itself. In this review, we describe the variety of different sleep disorders associated with stroke and analyze their effect on stroke risk and outcome. Methods: A search term-based literature review (“sleep,” “insomnia,” “narcolepsy,” “restless legs syndrome,” “periodic limb movements during sleep,” “excessive daytime sleepiness” AND “stroke” OR “cerebrovascular” in PubMed; “stroke” and “sleep” in ClinicalTrials.gov) was performed. English articles from 1990 to March 2023 were considered. Results: Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disorders are risk factors for stroke. In addition, sleep disturbance has been reported in half of all stroke sufferers; specifically, an increase is not only sleep-related breathing disorders but also periodic limb movements during sleep, narcolepsy, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, insomnia, sleep duration, and circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders. Poststroke sleep disturbance has been associated with worse outcome. Conclusion: Sleep disorders are risk factors for stroke and associated with worse stroke outcome. They are also a common consequence of stroke. Recent guidelines suggest screening for sleep disorders after stroke. It is possible that treatment of sleep disorders could both reduce stroke risk and improve stroke outcome, although further data from clinical trials are required.",

      "title": "Finding Genes for Parkinsonism",
      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep (sleep onset disturbance), difficulty staying asleep (sleep maintenance disturbance), or poor quality (nonrestorative) sleep, leading to impairment of next-day functioning, including psychological distress. Published prevalence estimates of insomnia vary considerably, very likely due to differences in definitions, study setting, and data collection methods. However, estimates based on large population-based surveys provide a rather constant prevalence rate for chronic insomnia in the United States of about 10% (approximately 25 million people). Chronic insomnia is associated with numerous physical and psychiatric conditions and is more common in women and the elderly. Although it is often perceived as a symptom of depression, insomnia is also a precursor of depression and is associated with a substantial increase in the relative risk of major depression. Chronic insomnia is correlated with impaired mood, subjective functioning, and quality of life and, in some cases, with increased daytime sleepiness and accident risk. Those reporting insomnia have higher rates of absenteeism and health care utilization. Direct costs of insomnia have been estimated to be $13.9 billion annually, with a large majority of costs attributable to nursing home care. Chronic insomnia is a common problem, often associated with negative waking mood or function. As such, heightened clinical attention and clinical research appear warranted.",

These NMS can have a profound negative effect on patient quality of life and on the health of the person providing care. This fact is now receiving more attention in clinical practice and measures are being taken to improve the recognition and treatment of NMS, and to provide better support for care-givers. As our knowledge base of NMS expands, we are increasingly finding that some of them, e.g. olfactory deficit and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder, also occur early in Parkinson’s disease, possibly pre-dating a diagnosis based on motor signs alone.",

      "title": "1171 Hypersomnia Secondary to Long Covid",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Recognition of Long Covid is increasing. In a recent meta-analysis in youth with Long Covid, the most prevalent clinical symptoms were mood (16.50%), fatigue (9.66%), and sleep disorders (8.42%). However, there is a paucity of data in the management of these symptoms. Report of case(s) We present a case of severe hypersomnolence after a mild Covid-19 infection in a 13 year-old female with no significant history, an acceptable age-appropriate sleep-wake schedule without nighttime awakenings or sleepiness prior to infection. Post-infection, she developed a one year history of sleep onset and maintenance insomnia, significant circadian delays, sleep inertia, brain fog and headaches. She was referred to sleep medicine and responded to treatment for a circadian rhythm disorder with sleep-wake restructuring, melatonin, and strict sleep hygiene. Sleep fragmentation, unrefreshing sleep, and hypersomnolence persisted; ESS=15/24. Sleep duration was often ≥12 hours in a 24 hour period. The patient could not wake easily, and often missed school or left early for sleepiness and headaches. A trial of gabapentin 200mg at bedtime failed. Sleep diagnostics were performed. Polysomnography showed no sleep disruptors, 8 hours of sleep, and some delayed slow wave sleep periods. Mean sleep latency testing (MSLT) showed MSL of 15.4min; 1 SOREM (nap #1). With a working diagnosis of hypersomnia due to medical condition vs. idiopathic hypersomnia, methylphenidate up to 36mg ER was trialed with some improvement. A recent adult case with Long Covid and ADHD-like syndrome also responded to stimulant use, though no guidelines are established for Long Covid. Oxybate was later added up to 2g once nightly which helped resolve sleep inertia, improve sleep quality and reduce sleepiness(ESS=4/24). She was able to return to school full time and reached normal functioning. Conclusion While the pathophysiology of Long Covid is still under investigation, symptom management of sleepiness can impact functioning. This case demonstrates a successful treatment of a patient with Long Covid and hypersomnolence with resolution of excessive sleepiness, morning inertia, and sleep fragmentation with a treatment approach similar to that of idiopathic hypersomnia, using an oxybate along with daytime stimulant use.

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Development in Adults and Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter reviews age-related changes in sleep, circadian rhythms, and sleep disorders in adults and older adults. With advancing age there are major changes in sleep, including sleep timing, the amount of slow-wave sleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings, sleep consolidation, and total sleep time. There are also changes in circadian rhythmicity with aging, including a reduced amplitude of some circadian rhythms and some evidence for reduced sensitivity to light. The interaction between the sleep and circadian regulatory systems also changes with age, resulting in greater difficulty sleeping during the biological daytime, the nocturnal sleep episode occurring at earlier circadian phases than in young adults, and a reduced ability to obtain a long and consolidated sleep episode. In addition to these general changes in sleep and circadian rhythmicity with aging, the sleep of many older people is impacted by a higher prevalence of specific sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements of sleep, and rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder; and they are also more likely to have chronic medical problems that interfere with sleep and to take medications that either disrupt nighttime sleep or impact daytime alertness.",

      "abstract": "Summary Non‐rapid eye movement parasomnia disorders, also called disorders of arousal, are characterized by abnormal nocturnal behaviours, such as confusional arousals or sleep walking. Their pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, and objective diagnostic criteria are lacking. It is known, however, that behavioural episodes occur mostly in the beginning of the night, after an increase in slow‐wave activity during slow‐wave sleep. A better understanding of the prospect of such episodes may lead to new insights in the underlying mechanisms and eventually facilitate objective diagnosis. We investigated temporal dynamics of transitions from slow‐wave sleep of 52 patients and 79 controls. Within the patient group, behavioural and non‐behavioural N3 awakenings were distinguished. Patients showed a higher probability to wake up after an N3 bout ended than controls, and this probability increased with N3 bout duration. Bouts longer than 15 min resulted in an awakening in 73% and 34% of the time in patients and controls, respectively. Behavioural episodes reduced over sleep cycles due to a reduction in N3 sleep and a reducing ratio between behavioural and non‐behavioural awakenings. In the first two cycles, N3 bouts prior to non‐behavioural awakenings were significantly shorter than N3 bouts advancing behavioural awakenings in patients, and N3 awakenings in controls. Our findings provide insights in the timing and prospect of both behavioural and non‐behavioural awakenings from N3, which may result in prediction and potentially prevention of behavioural episodes. This work, moreover, leads to a more complete characterization of a prototypical hypnogram of parasomnias, which could facilitate diagnosis.",

Each of these states is composed of a number of physiologic variables generated in a variety of neural structures. The predictable oscillations of these states are driven by presumed neural pacemakers which are entrained to the 24 h geophysical environment by the light/dark cycle. Experiments in nature have indicated that wake/sleep rhythm perturbations may occur either involving desynchronization of the basic 24 h wake/sleep cycle within the geophysical 24 h cycle (circadian rhythm disturbances) or involving the rapid oscillation or incomplete declaration of state (such as narcolepsy). The use of phase spaces to describe states of being may be of interest in the description of state determination in both illness and health.

P. p and r. p. p are two different manifestations of the dissociation between EEG and many other physiological activities, especially vegetative functions.3. The fact that p. p is apt to appear at the end of each single sleep cycleand r. p. p comes at the beginning or in the middle of each single sleep cycle could account for the phasic shift of changes in EEG and other physiological functions.4. The prominent occurrence of p. p in the latter half and r. p. p in the first half of the natural night sleep could be attributed to the difference in distribution pattern of activity level of each physiological function. For instance, more occurence of EEG III can be seen in the earlier period of the night sleep, while the depressed or minor activity of GSR, blood pressure is distributed more in the latter half of the night sleep.",

      "title": "An Elderly Man With Chaotic Sleep Behaviors and Rapidly Progressive Ataxia",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are increasingly recognized as common features of autoimmune encephalitis (AE), manifesting in various presentations, including insomnia, hypersomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), non-rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnias, and sleep breathing disorders. These features may be overlooked because of the difficulty of detecting them and a lack of awareness of their significance. Here, we provide an interesting case, with video-polysomnography (v-PSG) documentation, of an unusual sleep manifestation associated with rapidly progressive ataxia of an elderly man with AE. An 87-year-old man, who was a retired soldier with previously able activity of daily living is activity of daily living, presented with progressive hypersomnolence and abnormal behaviors during sleep over the last 3 months. His wife observed that he occasionally had abnormal motor behaviors during sleep, resembling fighting in the air during the night. In the last 2 months, he also had visual hallucinations and his cognition had declined. One week before admission, he developed an unsteady gait with repeated falls and the abnormal motor behaviors during sleep occurred more frequently. His past medical history included well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications were linagliptin (5 mg/day) and repaglinide (150 mg/day). He had no history of illicit drug or alcohol use. On admission, general examinations were unremarkable. However, although he was alert and co-operative, he intermittently lapsed into sleep, but was easily roused. During those sleep episodes, he developed abnormal behaviors resembling daytime work tasks and vocalizations (mumbling sound), which immediately presented from the onset of sleep (Video 1). These abnormal sleep episodes occurred most of the day and night time. Eye movement examination revealed broken pursuit and hypermetric saccades, whereas other cerebellar signs were impaired, consisting of truncal ataxia, wide-based gait, impaired tandem gait, and impaired bilateral finger-to-nose test (Video 2). Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 14/30 with the prominent impairment of attention and recall memory. Other examinations were normal. After a few days after admission, his symptoms rapidly progressed. His consciousness declined to stupor with frequent inspiratory stridor, requiring intubation and ventilator support. We did not observe any episode of faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) during admission. This video was performed on the second night of admission. He developed abnormal behaviors resembling doing daytime work tasks and vocalization (mumbling sound), which immediately presented from sleep onset. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13537 Eye movement examination revealed broken pursuit and hypermetric saccades, whereas other cerebellar signs were impaired, consisting of truncal ataxia, wide-based gait, impaired tandem gait, and impaired bilateral finger-to-nose test. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13537 Blood chemistry revealed marked hypokalemia (2.2 mmol/L) without hyponatraemia (Na 138 mmol/L). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles revealed white blood cell (WBC) 3 cell/mm3, no red blood cell (RBC), protein 27 mg/dL, glucose 75 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan showed no abnormal hypersignal intensity or contrast enhancement, whereas electroencephalography demonstrated diffuse background slowing without epileptiform discharge. Interestingly, the 24 hours wearable v-PSG test exhibited at almost every time period a mixture of α rhythm, REM, and slow-wave sleep, which was compatible with status dissociatus (SD) (Fig. 1). The serum autoimmune and paraneoplastic antibodies were positive for leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibody, whereas the rest (NMDAR, CASPR2, GABAb, DPPX6, AMPA, Ma2, IgLON5) were all negative, but anti-LGI1 and other antibodies were negative in CSF studies. Comprehensive radiological investigations, consisting of computed tomography (CT) chest and whole abdomen did not identify any underlying malignancy. A complete course of intravenous immunoglobulin and pulse methylprednisolone was given, followed by oral prednisolone, which gradually improved cognition and reduced abnormal sleep episodes. He could walk without support 3 months later and abnormal sleep episodes were gone. The presentations of our patient, consisting of rapidly progressive cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment, and subacute sleep–wake disorders including progressive hypersomnolence and abnormal behaviors during sleep, raised the possibility of an autoimmune process, prion disease, or an atypical presentation of a neurodegenerative disease, such as dementia with Lewy bodies. The presence of SD was a unique characteristic in this case. SD is an extreme form of parasomnia with overlapping features of non-REM, REM sleep, and wakefulness and is presented in fatal familial insomnia1 or severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome.2 In addition, the combination of sleep disturbances, inspiratory stridor, and gait instability could lead to the possibility of encephalopathy associated with IgLON5 antibodies.3 However, our case had other atypical presentations, including progressive cerebellar ataxia, lack of FBDS, and lack of hyponatraemia. The typical presentation of anti-LGI1 encephalitis, which is frequently manifested in elderly men,4-6 is characterized by a triad of memory changes, seizures, and abnormal movements. FBDS has been reported in 26% to 71% of patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis.4 Finally, although sleep disorders in AE are less recognized in clinical practice, these features have been reported in 20% to 65% of patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis, encompassing insomnia, hypersomnia, RBD, periodic limb movements in sleep, and obstructive sleep apnea.7-9 In addition, we reviewed relevant literature on sleep disorders and AE, as shown in Table 1. Considering cerebellar ataxia in anti-LGI1 encephalitis, only two case reports were identified of a child and a young adult with LGI1 antibody-associated AE presented with progressive and episodic ataxia.10, 11 In conclusion, we would like to emphasize the importance of sleep disorders in AE. Sleep disorders can be the first clinical presentation in AE, a treatable disorder, and v-PSG can assist in differentiating sleep disturbances to aid diagnosis. Early awareness and prompt effective management of uncommon sleep manifestations are vital and potentially associated with improved treatment outcomes (Video 3).

      "abstract": "Nearly half of older adults complain of difficulty sleeping [1]. Although most of such complaints can be attributed to the changes in the sleep architecture as we grow old, primary sleep disorders are more prevalent in elderly [2]. Poor sleep due to these disorders results in increased risk of significant morbidity and mortality. As we age, sleep efficiency decreases as time spent in bed increases. Underlying sleep disorders are aggravated due to a decrease in the ability to get needed sleep. However, the decreased ability is less a function of age and more a function of other factors that accompany aging, such as medical and psychiatric illness, increased medication use, advances in the endogenous circadian clock and a higher prevalence of specific sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Sleep and awakening disorders are almost obligate manifestations of Parkinson’s disease. Primary sleep and awakening disorders in Par-kinson’s disease are associated with the degeneration of serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus and cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus. Impaired awakening maintenance with the development of hypersomnia may result from neuron degeneration in the locus coeruleus or pedunculopontine nucleus. A certain role may be played by the pathological basal ganglionic pulsation caused by striatal dopamine deficiency, which goes to both the thalamic reticular nucleus and pedunculopontine nucleus, as well as by dysfunction of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathways involved in sleep-wake cycle regulation. Synthetic melatonin (Melaxen) is one of the effective medications for the treatment of sleep disorders in Parkinson’s disease. The drug normalizes circadian rhythms and has a hypnotic effect although it is in the usual sense not a soporific agent. Melaxen has a minimum of side effects and is well tolerated by patients from different age groups.",

When this situation causes a significant impairment, it's called circadian rhythm sleep The underlying pathophysiology involves either a dysfunction of the endogenous clock (located in the Suprachiasmathic nucleus of the hypothalamus) or a failure of the mechanisms of environmental synchronization (involving the retina and retino-hypothalamic tract). The principal clinical syndromes are: delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS), irregular sleep-wake rhythm, free-running disorder, jet lag disorder and shift work disorder. The treatment requires resynchronization of the endogenous clock with environmental clues. Some useful alternatives include timed exposure to bright light, melatonin and physical activity, associated to correct sleep hygiene. In some cases, the intermittent use of stimulants (caffeine, modafinil) and hypnotics may be useful for symptom relief, but only for short periods.",

The most frequent cause is stroke, followed by tumor, trauma, anoxia, vascular malformation, or multiple sclerosis. For some causes (and for stroke in particular), AIM can occur immediately after the brain lesion (for example, hemiballism during the acute phase of the stroke (Destée et al., 1990) whereas initial motor deficit may improve or be recovered rapidly. However, in other situations, AIMs (e.g. dystonia) emerge following a long period (a few months or years) of stable motor impairment (Marsden et al., 1985; Scott and Jankovic, 1996). AIMs can also be subdivided into transient (hemiballism, often in the acute phase) and persistent (dystonia, tremor, etc.). Whatever their timescales of appearance or disappearance, AIM may be the main symptom of stroke. This induces a delay in diagnosis or even a lack of knowledge of the specific diagnosis, since for the same underlying cause, the type of AIM can be quite different. This problem is sometimes clinically evident when the AIM is intense (hemiballism) or, in contrast, very moderate and focalized (asterixis). It is clear that a delay in diagnosis may have unhelpful consequences in terms of the patient's clinical and therapeutic management.",

      "abstract": "Neuromuscular disease (NMD) is a diverse group of hereditary or acquired conditions involving the anterior horn cells, nerves, neuromuscular junction or muscles. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in children and adults with NMD with an estimated prevalence exceeding 40%. Characteristics of NMD like progressive neuromuscular weakness of respiratory and diaphragmatic muscles, anatomic or neurologic propensity to upper airway obstruction during sleep, and/or cardiomyopathy contribute to the development of SDB. Prevalence and pattern of SDB vary with different types of NMD, depending on the features of the disease and the tempo of progression to respiratory muscle impairment. Importantly, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and nocturnal hypoventilation are often the first signs of respiratory muscle weakness in patients with NMD. The imbalance between respiratory capacity and respiratory loads usually first manifests during sleep, if not acutely during respiratory decompensation in respiratory infection. In patients with NMD, SDB typically first develops in rapid-eye-movement sleep when muscle atonia occurs, followed by continuous nocturnal hypoventilation through the night and eventually by progression into daytime respiratory failure. Untreated SDB and hypoventilation in NMD carries high respiratory morbidity and mortality. Therefore, screening for SDB and nocturnal hypoventilation is a vital part of long-term management of NMD and to detect patients at risk for respiratory failure. Anticipatory approach with regular assessment of symptoms, pulmonary function and sleep in children affected by NMD can aid early diagnosis and management of SDB. Timely provision of respiratory care and non-invasive ventilation are essential components of a multi-disciplinary care to improve quality of life and survival of patients with NMD.",

Historically, they did not always belong to the ‘hysteria’ complex. The fact that they were added later has created interesting conceptual obstacles to their analysis. Conversive symptoms, however, cannot be said to be specific to hysteria; indeed, 50-80 per cent are reported to ‘coexist’ with other psychiatric disorders, most commonly depression (Guze et al. 1971; Lecompte 1987). In about 50 per cent of cases, some form of ‘personality disorder’ is also found (Binzer et al. 1997). But in 80 per cent, conversive symptoms are not associated with the so-called hysterical personality or Briquette’s syndrome (Marsden 1986).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias include complex behaviors such as sleepwalking, sleep-related eating disorder and confusional arousals that emerge mainly during deep sleep. Adult lifetime prevalence varies widely (4–67%). Management typically focuses on education, safety measures, and addressing underlying triggers. When standard therapies prove insufficient, adjunctive techniques like hypnosis may offer additional benefit. Report of case A 59-year-old female with a long-standing history of intermittent sleepwalking and sleep-related eating sought care following a near-fatal sleep-driving incident. Her background included generalized anxiety, depression, PTSD, anorexia, and restless legs syndrome. Comprehensive evaluation ruled out nocturnal epileptiform activity, periodic limb movements, and obstructive sleep apnea. Polysomnography demonstrated confusional arousals from N2 sleep and increased phasic muscle tone in REM, without witnessed abnormal movements. Reduced arousals in the first half of the night suggested sedation from multiple psychotropic medications concerning for polypharmacy. Initial management involved psychiatry consultation to streamline her psychotropic regimen, alongside behavioral and environmental interventions to ensure safety. After excluding active organic or psychological factors perpetuating the episodes, one session of clinical hypnosis was performed and recorded. The patient listened to the recording daily, gradually reducing its use as episodes improved. Clonazepam was introduced and up titrated when potentially harmful episodes persisted. At follow-up, both the patient and her bed partner reported a notable reduction in frequency and severity of the episodes, with no further injurious events. Conclusion In a case of refractory NREM parasomnia, hypnosis—implemented after careful evaluation, medication adjustment, and safety measures—resulted in meaningful clinical improvement. This brief, time-efficient intervention may serve as a valuable adjunct to established therapies when conventional measures alone do not achieve adequate control. Support (if any)",

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master circadian clock that regulates various endogenous circadian rhythms. Light and social cues are important factors that help align the endogenous circadian rhythms to the 24 hour day. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders can be due to abnormalities in the endogenous circadian clock (“intrinsic disorders”) such as delayed sleep phase type, advanced sleep phase type, free running type, and irregular sleep wake rhythm type. Shift work or air travel leads to an artificial mismatch between the endogenous circadian clock and the external environment (“extrinsic disorders”) leading to shift work disorder and jet lag disorder. Individuals with circadian rhythm sleep disorders are presented with insomnia or excessive sleepiness or both. These disorders are under recognized in the general population but they can affect a significant number of people if a the large number of shift workers and air travelers are considered. The symptoms may be misdiagnosed for other common sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or insomnia. Meticulous history and sleep diary data are integral tools in diagnosing CRSD. Actigraphs (activity monitors) may supplement the sleep diary data. In the past two decades major advances have been made in understanding the genetic basis of these disorders. Understanding the circadian principles has led to various therapeutic options such as phototherapy and exogenous melatonin.",

Neben diesen kognitiven Auffälligkeiten kennzeichnen psychiatrische Begleiterscheinungen z.B. Depression das Krankheitsbild. Bei Parkinson Patienten ohne Demenz scheinen diese Defizite in frühen Erkrankungsstufen unabhängig von der Motorik zu sein und die Alltagskompetenz der Patienten wenig zu beeinflussen. Verschiedene Untersuchungen weisen darauf hin, dass diese kognitiven Defizite und Verhaltensauffälligkeiten bereits vor dem Auftreten der ersten motorischen Symptome nachzuweisen sind. Die Erfassung spezifischer bei der Parkinson-Erkrankung typischerweise veränderter kognitiver Leistungen ist daher sowohl im Frühstadium der Erkrankung wie möglicherweise auch in der prämotorischen Diagnostik von Bedeutung.",

      "title": "Nightmares in Migraine: A Focused Review",
      "abstract": "Nightmares usually occur during the sleep phase of rapid eye movement (REM) and are associated with some physical symptoms, including sweating, shortness of breath, and lower limb movements. Emotions of fear, anger, shame, and sadness may also accompany nightmares. These symptoms can occur during dreaming, upon awakening, or later when the dream experience is recollected. Nightmares may sporadically occur for everyone, but nightmare disorders are associated with features of impaired mental and physical health and require professional medical treatment. The occurrence of nightmares with several disorders has been reported in the literature, but in migraines it has only been investigated in a small number of studies. Considering the existing relationship between sleep disorders and migraine, the occurrence of nightmares in migraine can negatively affect this association and elevate the risk of depression and anxiety. This, in turn, further reduces the quality of life of affected individuals. Hence, expanding the knowledge on the link between nightmares and migraine, promoting an acceptable quantity and quality of sleep through pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions in the management of nightmares in migraine, and further scientific investigation of the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying the link, will be highly valuable for optimal care. This focused review, therefore, gives a brief overview of the current understanding of nightmares in migraine to highlight the open questions and value of further research. The ultimate goal is to contribute to timely recognition and sufficient action to offer beneficial outcomes for affected patients.",

Numerous synaptic relays and neurotransmitters allow the autonomic control of organ function at local and central levels to be integrated with the requirements of the whole body. The peripheral and central components of the autonomic nervous system are frequently affected by diseases, conditions, or toxins. Autonomic disorders are described as (1) primary—without defined cause, including multiple system atrophy and acute/subacute dysautonomias; or (2) secondary—with specific defects or as a consequence of other conditions, including diabetes mellitus, Riley–Day syndrome, amyloid neuropathy, dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency, spinal cord injury, and many drugs.",

The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms. The prognosis without treatment is poor once the disability is established.",

      "title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP QUALITY, BODY PERCEPTION AND MOTOR AND SENSORY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an autoimmune neurological disease, where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of the central nervous system, causing inflammation that impairs the transmission of nerve impulses. It is characterized by episodes of flare-ups with exacerbation of symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness in the lower and upper limbs, tremors and balance, difficulty walking, loss of vision, among others, followed by remissions with partial or complete recovery, which can last for months or years, during which the progression of the disease is minimal or absent. Insomnia or poor sleep quality can occur indirectly as a consequence of RRMS. That is, a secondary symptom that is caused by the presence of the specific symptoms of the disease and pseudo-outbreaks. Body Perception (PC) can be defined in two ways, such as Body Image (CI) and Body Schema (CE). HF is related to the psychic, emotional, cognitive, sociocultural, evolutionary, genetic and neuroscientific aspects, in relation to the expectation of the image of their body. The CS is the perspective that enables, through kinesthetic and proprioceptive mechanisms, the recognition of the anatomical body and the relationship it establishes with the environment and with the objects around it. In view of these definitions, the opportunity arose to relate sleep quality with body perception and symptomatological conditions. Thus, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between sleep quality and body perception, by the aspect of body schema and the symptomatological conditions of multiple sclerosis. Participants were 18 people, aged between 21 and 67 years, who were evaluated for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh questionnaire, body perception using the Askevold test, and symptoms through a structured interview. The results indicated that all participants with adequate sleep were classified as hyperschematic, while 67% of those who had inadequate sleep were classified as hyposchematic. In addition, individuals with inadequate sleep showed a balanced distribution between motor and sensory symptoms, while those with adequate sleep predominantly reported sensory symptoms. Fatigue was a relevant symptom in 67% of individuals with inadequate sleep. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be associated with body perception and symptom manifestation in RRMS, highlighting the importance of sleep-enhancing interventions for the management of this condition.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "Total sleep deprivation (TSD) has been established as a successful though short lasting treatment modality in depressed patients. Anecdotal reports (1) indicate that the beneficial effect of sleep deprivation may be reversed by naps even as short as 90 seconds during the day fol lowing the sleepless night. This paradoxical phenomenon, that sleeplessness ameliorates depressive symptomatology and that depression usually returns after the next night of sleep or even after short naps, raises the question, if in depressed patients, sleep may have a depressiogenic influence? N a p studies conducted up to now draw an inconsistent picture. G i l l i n et a l . (2) and Giedke (3) did not f ind detrimental effects of naps on mood, either during the morning or the afternoon, in successfully sleep deprived depressed patients. However , in one study (2), only very brief naps were allowed (< 10 minutes), whereas the patients in the other study (3) were not free of psychoactive medication. A study by our group (4) showed that naps at 1300 h reestablished depressive symptomatology in approximately half of the patients, particularly when the nap included R E M sleep. This effect was, however, confounded with a longer sleep length in the patients wi th R E M n a p s . The present investigation aimed at evaluating the questions: (a) whether morning naps are capable of reinducing depression in sleep deprived depressed patients, (b) if a relapse is related to the occurrence of R E M sleep during these naps, when controll ing for sleep length?",

Others lie in bed, stare into space, and posture for hours or days. At times, this behavior is so extreme as to be a stupor. Psychotic patients exhibit tremors or peculiar facial and body movements described as parkinsonism, dystonia, or dyskinesia. Manic patients are in constant motion. Children and adolescents bang their heads and pick at their skin, injuring themselves. Little attention is paid to such behavior unless it overwhelms the patient’s life, but it does distress the patient, the family, and the community. These motor symptoms often bring psychiatric patients to medical care. Catatonia is the motor syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity, unusual posturing, negativism (refusal to obey simple commands), mutism (persistent silence), echolalia (repetition of what has been said), echopraxia (imitation of movements), and repeated stereotyped mannerisms. It appears suddenly and quickly immobilizes the patient or it appears insidiously. When it dominates behavior and threatens the patient’s life by the failure to eat or drink, treatment becomes compulsory. Forced feeding, bedsores resulting from immobility, muscular atrophy, bladder catheterization and consequent infection, and blood clots in immobilized limbs all take a terrible toll. If the clots move to the lungs or brain, stroke or death may ensue. Catatonia was first described as a consequence of intense emotional anguish and tension. Although the movements frequently respond to sedative drugs, ECT is a more complete and effective treatment. The condition is frequently seen in patients with affective illnesses— both depression and mania—in patients with systemic disorders, and in those with toxic brain states caused by hallucinogenic drugs. For decades, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that each instance of catatonia represented a type of schizophrenia. The major classification systems in psychiatry—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases—assigned to all patients with catatonia the diagnosis of schizophrenia, catatonic type. As a consequence, few patients were treated with anticonvulsant sedatives or with ECT, because those treatments were not recognized as effective in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Exercising for People with Parkinson’s Disease and Their Support Group",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONParkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative brain disorder that markedly impairs the performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease, affecting nearly 700,000 individuals in the United States 45 years and older, and is projected to double by 2030 (1). PD is characterized by bradykinesia (slowness in movement and reduced movement amplitude), resting tremor (rhythmic limb shaking), rigidity (increased muscle tone), postural instability (intolerance to postural threat, causing impaired balance), and gait abnormalities. The cause of PD is unknown, but aging, genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction likely all play a role (2). PD advances over time resulting in increased disability, driven by the progression of motor and nonmotor symptoms, medication complications, and motor disabilities with poor responses to medication such as postural instability and gait (2). Individuals with PD often display a stooped posture and a short shuffling walking stride along with a decreased arm swing and poorer walking economy when compared with persons without PD (3). Getting up, changing direction, turning around, and transferring from one place to another gets harder as PD advances. Other symptoms that affect quality of life may include excessive salivation or drooling; soft, slurred speech; and a variety of nonmotor features, including cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and sleep disorders. Individuals with PD (especially those in advanced stages) may have autonomic nervous system dysfunction, including cardiovascular dysfunction (4). Orthostatic hypotension, heat intolerance, sweating disturbances, and urinary problems also are associated with PD (4). HOW PD IS DIAGNOSED, ASSESSED, AND TREATEDPD is diagnosed following a comprehensive review of medical history and a neurological and physical examination. A person must have bradykinesia and either tremor or rigidity for the diagnosis of PD. The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is used to monitor the burden and extent of PD (5). It is the gold standard for assessing treatment interventions. The MDS-UPDRS covers four domains: part I assesses the nonmotor experiences of daily living such as cognition, depression, sleep, fatigue, and hallucinations; part II assesses the patient’s perception of their ability to engage in ADLs such as eating, dressing, hobbies, and walking; part III covers the motor evaluation, which includes ratings for rigidity, bradykinesia, gait, postural stability, and tremor; and part IV assesses the motor complications, including ratings for dyskinesias (involuntary movements), dystonia (painful cramps), and motor fluctuations (irregular responses to PD medication) (5). The standard treatments for PD are exercise, medication, and deep brain stimulation. However, medication and deep brain stimulation can have serious side effects, and neither have consistently demonstrated efficacy for balance/mobility, cognition, or delaying disease progression. By contrast, evidence suggests that exercise can reduce disease severity (6), slow the progression of the signs of the disease (7), as well as improve strength (6), aerobic capacity (7), and gait performance (8). EXERCISE BENEFITS AND PRESCRIPTION Because PD is a chronic and progressive disorder, an exercise program should be prescribed early when the individual is first diagnosed, should continue throughout life, and should be reviewed and revised as the disease progresses. Exercise prescription should ultimately aim to slow the rate at which the signs of the disease progress, limit comorbidities, minimize complications associated with muscle disuse, and maintain the ability to live an independent life. This can be accomplished by simultaneously addressing cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, flexibility/mobility, neuromotor training, and balance. Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to attenuate PD progression (9). Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise improves aerobic fitness, fatigue, mood, executive function, and quality of life in mild to moderate PD (10,11) and high-intensity endurance exercise (80% to 85% HRmax) attenuates the worsening of motor signs (7). An individual with PD can safely enjoy a variety of exercise modalities, including treadmills, stationary cycles, recumbent cycles, ellipticals, rowers, and arm ergometers. Aerobic training at high intensity (80% to 85% HRmax) (7) and even higher intensity (12) as well as HIIT training involving whole body movements (>85% HRmax) (13) can be safely prescribed to individuals with early stage PD and should be encouraged for individuals who are willing and able to do this. Aerobic exercise should be performed for 30 minutes per day, 3 to 4 days per week at high intensity (80% to 85% HRmax) for mild to moderate PD, or at moderate intensity (60% to 65% HRmax) for deconditioned individuals or those with more advanced PD, with the goal of eventually progressing to 80% to 85% HRmax. This combination of frequency, intensity, and time has the strongest support in the literature for potentially slowing down the progression of the signs of the disease. The optimum training load for each individual may vary, so it may be useful for certain individuals to break exercise bouts into shorter durations that accumulate to 30 minutes per day. Although some individuals may be capable of and motivated to exercise more than 3 to 4 days per week, it is important not to underestimate the importance of rest and recovery and be cognizant of the signs and symptoms of overtraining. Individuals who want to exercise more than 3 to 4 days per week should intersperse different types of low-intensity exercise between days of high-intensity exercise. Resistance training also is beneficial in PD and can improve muscle strength and power (14), movement speed, and dynamic balance, along with quality of life, usually the same as seen in neurologically normal controls (6). Free weights may be used, although they tend to be less safe at more advanced stages and in those with increased severity of tremor, especially during exercises that involve overhead lifting (15). Resistance training should be performed between 2 and 3 days per week at 30% to 60% of 1-RM for individuals beginning to improve strength or 60% to 80% 1-RM for more advanced exercisers. In lieu of free weights, weight machines, resistance bands, or body weight can be implemented as needed or preferred. As resistance training progresses, unstable devices such as balance pads, dyna discs, balance discs, BOSU balls, or Swiss balls should be incorporated with the resistance training routine. When unstable devices are incorporated, mobility, motor signs, neuromuscular outcomes, balance, and quality of life improve, whereas cognitive impairment and fear of falling are reduced (16–18). The increase in motor complexity of the exercise routine (i.e., degree of instability) along with the increase in strength both contribute to the positive outcomes (16–18). Balance impairment and falls can be major problems in those with PD, and although both endurance and resistance exercise will benefit posture and balance, it is crucial for individuals with PD to perform neuromotor training specifically for posture, balance, gait, and mobility. Neuromotor training consists of a variety of different challenging physical activities (e.g., multidirectional step training, step up and down, reaching forward and sideways, obstacles, turning around, walking with suitable step length, standing up, and sitting down). Using rhythmic auditory stimulation during multidirectional step training can improve functional gait parameters, including balance, and those improvements will be maintained longer than when external cueing is not used (19). Neuromotor training should progress exercise motor complexity (coordinative and control requirements of the motor activity) and quantitative training parameters (i.e., FITT principles). The progression of both the exercise motor complexity and the quantitative training parameters should be done sequentially rather than simultaneously, as the former impairs the progression of the latter. Other alternative forms of exercise are beneficial for individuals with PD, including Tai Chi, partnered and unpartnered dance (20,21), and Lee Silverman Voice Training (LSVT)/BIG. Dance interventions improve certain motor symptoms and functional mobility, especially those that use rhythmic tasks and visual and auditory cues (22). Tai Chi has been shown to improve motor function, balance, and quality of life in those with PD, and it also may improve fall risk and depression (20). LSVT/BIG is a movement-based behavioral treatment that improves motor function in people with PD (23). In addition, incorporating concepts of the LSVT/BIG program (large amplitude, exaggerated movement patterns performed with high intensity, and effort that become progressively more difficult and complex) into functional exercise helps to restore normal movement amplitude in real life situations (23). SUMMARY The PD exercise prescription consists of resistance, endurance (cardiovascular), and balance exercises. In addition, core training, neuromotor training, dual-task training, and multitask training also will benefit overall health, well-being, and the ability to perform everyday activities for the person with PD. Each exercise modality addresses different components of health and should not be overlooked. Although it is clear that there are benefits to rigorously quantifying exercise dose, many forms of exercise do not naturally lend themselves to the FITT principles, and yet the activities can be clearly beneficial such as dancing and boxing. In parallel to considering exercise dosage, it is important to monitor fatigue, any increases in motor symptoms, fluctuations in response to medication, as well as disease progression. It is important to adapt and identify the optimum training load for the current state of the individual.",

A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

      "title": "Relationship between Sleep Quality and Cognitive Function in Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in middle-aged and elderly people. PD is characterized by resting tremor, myotonia, bradykinesia, abnormal posture, and gait. The incident of PD increases with age. In addition to motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms have raised additional concerns in recent years. Cognitive impairment is very common in PD patients. It is estimated that the incidence of PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is 20–50%,[1] which is present at the initial visit in some patients and a great number of patients with PD-MCI eventually develop PD with dementia (PDD). PD patients are much more likely to develop dementia than the normal population. It has been found that 2/3 of PD patients suffer from different forms of sleep disorders, which are indicated to be one of the common nonmotor symptoms in PD patients. The symptoms of various sleep disorders in PD patients include night insomnia, increased sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, reduced sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, thus having a serious impact on the patient's sleep quality and increasing the risk of dementia.[2] Therefore, cognitive dysfunction and sleep disorders are two important nonmotor symptoms of PD, exerting greater impacts on the quality of life (QOL). Here, we evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive function of PD patients. From May 2016 to May 2017, we enrolled a total of 111 native Chinese patients with primary PD and without audiovisual dysfunction who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, the First Hospital of Hebei Medical University. The diagnosis of PD was based on the criteria of the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank. Moreover, the diagnosis of PDD conformed to the diagnostic criteria of dementia proposed by the Movement Disorder Society Task Force: (1) diagnosis of primary PD, (2) PD-related cognitive decline by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), (3) cognitive impairment that affected the patient's daily life ability, and (4) development of extrapyramidal system of PD before dementia, with regular time interval. Patient information was collected by two trained neurologists, including name, sex, age, duration of illness, and educational level. Of these, duration of disease was calculated from the time the patient initially complained of discomfort. The assessment was performed since medications were initiated. The Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) was used to assess the severity of the disease, and Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) staging was utilized for disease rating. According to the severity, the patients were divided into stage 1.0–5.0, including mild (1.0–2.0), moderate (2.5–3.0), and severe (4.0–5.0). According to complaints of patients and their family concerning declined cognitive function and interference with daily life activities in our study, PD patients were divided into three groups as follows: normal group, MCI group, and dementia group, according to MMSE and MoCA (Beijing version) normal cognitive function. MoCA ≥26 points and denying cognitive decline was categorized as a normal cognitive function, MoCA <26 points and MMSE ≥26 as well as a complaint of decreased cognitive function but denying interference with daily life activities as MCI, and MMSE <26 and complaint of decreased cognitive function and affected daily lives as dementia. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the quality of sleep in PD patients over the pastmonth. Patients with PSQI score ≥6 points were classified as suffering sleep disorders, and patients with long-term use of sleeping pills were excluded. SPSS version 19.0 software (SPSS, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Student's t-test was used for the comparisons. The significance level was set at a value of P < 0.05. There were a total of 111 (61 males and 50 females) PD patients, with a mean age of 66.5 ± 8.7 years, a mean educational level of 11.2 ± 3.5 years and a mean duration of 6.1 ± 4.1 years. The mean H-Y staging was 2.20 ± 0.80, which was classified as mild-to-moderate PD, including mild in 59 (53.15%) patients, and moderate in 52 (46.85%) patients. Patients with PSQI ≥6 were diagnosed with having sleep disorders. There were 67 (60.36%) patients with cognitive impairment, including 30 (27.03%) with MCI and 37 (33.33%) with dementia. The MMSE score in dementia group was 23.04 ± 1.73, which was categorized as mild dementia. The results of the comparison of sleep quality in PD patients with different cognitive levels showed different sleep quality in mild PD patients with different cognitive levels, with the poorest sleep quality in the dementia group. Pairwise comparison showed that the PSQI score was significantly higher in the dementia group than in the normal group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) [Supplementary Table 1]. Different cognitive levels in moderate PD patients were associated with different sleep quality, with the poorest quality in the dementia group. The pairwise comparison indicated significantly higher PSQI scores in dementia group than in the normal group (P < 0.01) [Supplementary Table 2]. Regarding sleep quality, no significant differences were noted in mild and moderate PD patients (P = 0.935).Supplementary Table 1: Comparison of sleep quality in mild Parkinson's disease patients with different cognitive levelsSupplementary Table 2: Comparison of sleep quality in moderate Parkinson's disease patients with different cognitive levelsWith respect to general information in PD patients with different sleep quality, there was no significant difference between the two PD groups regarding age, educational level, duration of disease, and H-Y staging (P > 0.05). However, UPDRS score was significantly higher in the sleep disturbance group than in the normal group, whereas MoCA score and MMSE score were remarkably lower than those in the normal group (both P < 0.05) [Table 1]. The correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between cognitive level and sleep quality in PD patients after controlling H-Y variables (r = 0.461, P < 0.01).Table 1: Comparison of general information in Parkinson's disease patients with different sleep conditionsPD is a common degenerative disease of CNS in the elderly. In addition to motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms in recent years, such as cognitive decline, sleep disorders, autonomic nerve damage, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seriously affect the QOL of patients, thereby raising additional concerns. A considerable number of people experience decreased sleep quality at the onset of early PD or before PD symptoms. Common types of sleep disorders in PD patients include difficulty falling asleep, wakefulness/sleep fragmentation, daytime lethargy, sleep-deprivation, REM sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep episodes. In addition, altered sleep parameters have been observed, including sleep structure. Those are confronted with unapparent difficulties of falling asleep, difficulties of maintaining sleep and disordered sleep structure, higher incidence of asymptomatic periodic limb movements, and REM sleep behavior disorder, adversely impacting patients' QOL. There are studies suggesting that RBD is a risk factor for cognitive impairment in PD patients.[3] As we reported, mean H-Y staging of all 111 patients was 2.20 ± 0.80, showing a mild-to-moderate PD. PQSI scale was used to assess the quality of sleep in 111 PD patients enrolled, indicating the prevalence of 54.95% in sleep disorders. PD sleep disorders have been reported to be associated with aging, the severity of illness, depression, and dopaminergic dose. There is no consensus on the prevalence of sleep disorders in PD patients based on various studies, which is, however, generally higher than our results. Several studies have shown that PD patients suffer abnormal sleep at an early stage, which is likely to worsen as the disease progresses. Even at early stage, PD patients have a significantly decreased health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) compared with their peers, and that PD impacts HR-QOL in various manners. PD at an early stage has a limited effect on HR-QOL due to relatively mild motor symptoms. Thus, the priority should be given to nonmotor symptoms. The authors of the study recognize depression, fatigue, and sleep disorders as the leading cause of the decline in HR-QOL in early PD patients.[4] The current findings reveal that a higher rate (54.95%) of sleep disorders is noted in mild-to-moderate PD patients, and sleep disorders negatively impact cognitive function in PD patients, thereby leading to further decline of HR-QOL. Sleep disorders and cognitive disorders, as the two major nonmotor symptoms of PD, interact with each other. Sleep disorders can be seen as a concomitant symptom of cognitive impairment and can lead to involvement of the brainstem nerve nucleus, thus impairing cognitive function. The current results showed that sleep disorders in PD patients were associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and a marked decline in cognitive function. Consistent with the above findings, PD patients with dementia had poorer sleep quality than those with normal cognitive function, suggesting an interaction between sleep quality and cognitive function. Based on studies in the Western countries,[5] α-synuclein, Aβ protein, and tau protein have been found in multiple brain functional areas of PD patients with sleep disorders. Currently, Aβ protein and tau protein are recognized to be associated with pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease.[6] In addition, α-synuclein abnormally aggregates to form Lewy bodies, which are characteristic pathological changes of Lewy body dementia, suggesting a common pathological basis of sleep disorders and cognitive decline. This study has several limitations. First, patients enrolled had mild-to-moderate PD and MCI. Second, there was a small sample size. Third, the effect of medications patients took on sleep is not taken into account. Last, the types of sleep disorders patients suffered were not specified. Patients with severe PD should be included, and larger sample size is needed. In addition, research methods need to be improved to obtain more detailed and accurate data. Conclusively, our findings suggest that sleep disorder in PD patients can be considered as a concomitant symptom of cognitive decline, and further aggravate cognitive impairment, indicating a potential interaction. Although the underlying pathophysiological processes remain incompletely understood, the association between sleep disorders and cognitive function in PD patients may suggest a decrease in dopamine levels in the limbic system.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are both common and consequential, but too often remain undiagnosed. The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

This condition, attributed to the persistence of muscle atonia from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep into wakefulness, is associated with factors like sleep deprivation and irregular sleep patterns. While isolated episodes of SP are generally benign, recurrent episodes may warrant clinical attention, particularly when accompanied by distressing symptoms. Despite its prevalence across cultures and its documented association with various medical conditions, SP remains poorly understood by many. This review explores the clinical characteristics, epidemiology, and associated risk factors of SP, drawing from a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature. Additionally, the review discusses potential treatment modalities, including pharmacological interventions and cognitive-behavioral therapy, highlighting the need for further research to enhance our understanding and management of this intriguing phenomenon.",

The neurotransmitter dopamine may play a role in REM sleep control, but there is limited direct evidence for this. Dopamine may also play a role in regulation of the sleep/wake cycle with a wakefulness promoting effect that is similar to histamine and hypocretin. In the future, a greater focus should be placed on non-dopaminergic pathways to evaluate sleep disorders in PD and MSA.",

      "abstract": "Most movement disorders in children are hyperkinetic. The most common type is tic disorders, which can involve motor and phonic tics and are classified as simple or complex. Motor or phonic tics that persist for more than 1 year are defined as persistent (chronic) tic disorder. Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

      "title": "Relation between dizziness and sleep quality",
      "abstract": "Dizziness may be caused by multiple factors including unknown reasons. It is well known that insomnia is associated with increased psychological symptomatology and perceived stress, higher predisposition to arousal, and greater impairments to quality of health. The relationship between dizziness and stress is well documented, but that between dizziness and insomnia is unclear. In this series, we focus on Ménière's disease, which is characterized by fluctuating and progressive hearing loss, aural fullness, tinnitus, and intermittent attacks of vertigo, an illusory sensation of movement resulting from dysfunction of the labyrinth and cochlea, to investigate the relation between sleep disorders and dizziness. In our previous report, we first found that the sleep quality of Ménière's disease patients was impaired. Ménière's patients have a longer total sleeping time, lack of deep sleep stages, increased arousal, and the combination with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and/or periodic limb movement disorder was occasionally noted. Poor quality of sleep may cause additional stress and lead Ménière's disease patients into a negative spiral of symptoms. Furthermore, poor sleep quality may result in Ménière's disease patients being refractory to medical management. Therefore, prospective treatment focusing on the sleep disorders of, not just Ménière's disease but possibly also dizziness symptoms, may become an additional new strategy for terminating the negative spiral of symptoms and reduce exacerbation of the affected patient's conditions.",

      "title": "[Pain and sensory disturbance in Parkinson disease].",
      "abstract": "Pain or sensory symptoms are a frequent complaint in Parkinson disease (PD), which reduce health-related quality of life (QOL) and interfere with patient's ability to participate in activities of daily living, thus contributing to sleep disturbance or major depression. The frequency of pain is thought to have a bimodal distribution. The initial peak seems to occur before, or at the onset of PD and a second peak occurs later in the disease course in conjunction with the development of motor fluctuations or dyskinesia. The spectrum of sensory symptoms is wide, and the most common sites that experience pain are the back, legs, and shoulders. In cases, pain occurs on the side that is more affected by parkinsonism; however unusual distributions, such as oral or genital pain syndrome, chest pain, and upper or lower abdominal discomfort may be observed. The etiological basis of PD-related pain is multifactorial, with varying degrees of contribution from peripheral and central sources. Central mechanisms include derangement of the intrinsic pain-modulating monoaminergic mechanism in addition to plastic central nervous system changes induced by chronic anti-parkinsonian medication. The importance of dopaminergic deficits as a causal factor in PD-related pain is supported by the normalization of these abnormalities after L-dopa administration, which suggests that the human striatum plays a central role in processing nociceptive information. Nevertheless, the lack of response to dopaminergic agents in some patients suggests the involvement of non-dopaminergic structures in PD. Abnormalities of noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways descending to the spinal cord are assumed to play a role in pain perception in PD. Some reports have highlighted the problem of delayed diagnosis in PD patients with an initial presentation of pain. Greater awareness of this possibility among physicians is important. Physicians also should bear in mind that psychological factors are major components of pain and that patient education and support are critical to successful treatment.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the pharmacological treatment of nocturnal sleep problems of which chronic insomnia, as defined by impaired sleep onset and/or maintenance, is by far the commonest. If a drug treatment is considered appropriate, however, it is important to recognise the precise nature of a patient's insomnia with respect to sleep onset or sleep maintenance as this will influence the choice of drug. Most non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) parasomnias are considered as 'disorders of arousal' in which a behavioural event occurs when a subject arouses abnormally and partially from the first cycle of deep slow wave sleep. Administration of exogenous melatonin has been investigated for insomnia because it assists sleep in circadian rhythm disorders when phase is altered such as during jet lag. Gabapentin and pregabalin are more commonly used as neuropathic pain agents but have the relatively rare pharmacological property of enhancing slow wave non-REM sleep.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver.

Shortly after reaching stage N2 sleep, EEG showed brisk lateral eye movements with concurrent sawtooth waves (figure), indicating sleep-onset REM period (SOREMP). Normal REM sleep is reached 90–120 minutes after sleep onset. SOREMP is an abnormal EEG finding thought to be suggestive of narcolepsy. However, it may also be present in 3.9% of the general population1 and is normal in infants. It is also associated with severe sleep deprivation, obstructive sleep apnea, and alcohol or medication (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) withdrawal.

Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position.

Sleep deprivation affects a large spectrum of vital systems such as thermoregulation, energy and mineral balance, and immunofunction. Based on the fact that sleep is a very important process for the normal development of many metabolic pathways, it is logical to think that insomnia has serious organism consequences.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Agrypnia Excitata (AE) is a syndrome characterized by loss of sleep with permanent motor and autonomic hyper activation. This case describes this peculiar syndrome in a patient with paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis. Report of Case DG is a 35 yr old male with a history of anti-Ma2 limbic encephalitis secondary to cystic teratoma of the left testis diagnosed 6 months prior to presenting in Sleep Clinic. His parents described significant sleep disturbances including short sleep and wake periods throughout the day and night with no apparent pattern, acting out dreams, motor activity during sleep including pulling at his clothes or using his hands to manipulate invisible objects. Additionally they described low-grade fevers, and severe hyperphagia. Polysomnogram showed absence of slow-wave sleep and what appeared to be an admixture of stage 1 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) with rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Multiple sleep-latency testing (MSLT) demonstrated a mean sleep latency of 5.2 minutes and four sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed persistent inflammation of the mesial temporal lobes and hippocampal region. Cerebral spinal fluid testing showed persistent anti-Ma2 antibodies. Based on this clinical presentation we made a diagnosis of Agrypnia Excitata. Conclusion Agrypnia Excitata is a syndrome characterized by loss of the normal sleep-wake rhythm. Sleep consists of the disappearance of spindle-delta activities, and persistent stage 1 NREM sleep mixed with recurrent episodes of REM sleep. The second hallmark of AE is persistent motor and autonomic hyperactivity observed during wake and sleep. AE has been described in three distinct clinical syndromes: Morvan Syndrome (autoimmune encephalitis), Fatal Familial Insomnia, and Delirium tremens. The pathogenesis of AE consists of intra-limbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from cortico-limbic inhibitory control. In autoimmune encephalitis, antibodies that act on voltage-gated potassium channels within the limbic system have been implicated in the pathophysiology.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscles and substances released during physical activity (myokines) have a beneficial influence on the functioning of the organism. Myokines (released also by myocardium) together with hepatokines and adipokines play an important role not only in energetic metabolism, but they also influence, among others, the function of the circulatory and nervous systems, modulation of inflammatory state and atherogenesis. Under pathological conditions connected with the presence of chronic diseases, chronic inflammatory state, low physical activity, long-term immobility the following consequences are observed: reduction of muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia) and changed profile of released myokines. The incidence of sarcopenia is connected with an unfavorable course of the aging process, often leading to disability and multiple morbidities. Sarcopenia can also lead to frailty syndrome, which not only worsens the prognosis of various diseases, but it can also increase the risk of medical procedures. Sarcopenia and adverse przymyokine profile are modifiable risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and affecting them may improve functional status and prognosis. An important intervention to improve muscles function and myokine profile, apart from nutritional treatment and pharmacotherapy, is regular physical activity as a component of cardiac rehabilitation. In our paper we focused on a review of the newest research regarding the association of sarcopenia and the profile of released myokines with incidence and course of cardiovascular diseases such as chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, carotid artery atherosclerosis or ischemic cerebral stroke.",

The most common and prominent symptoms of apnea is excessive diurnal drowsiness, as well asin addition to alterations of the memory and concentration, irritability, headache, and depression, among others. To date, no known studies have related OSAS with another type of more serious psychiatric disorder, such as psychotic symptoms. The case of a 51-year-old man who was diagnosed of SAOS after presenting psychotic and affective symptoms that did not respond to any medication is presentedreported. The treatment resulted in complete remission of the psychiatric symptoms mentioned.",

Sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) recording showed significantly shorter rapid eye movement (REM) latency in depressed PD patients (41.1 +/- 21.7 min) compared to nondepressed PD patients (129.0 +/- 84.9 min, p less than 0.002). Furthermore, shortened REM latency (less than or equal to 65.0 min) was observed with significantly more frequency in depressed PD patients (6 out of 8) compared to nondepressed PD patients (4 out of 18, p less than 0.02). The other sleep parameters studied did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients. Because shortened REM latency is one of the most reliably documented biological features of major depression, these findings may be of some importance for understanding the nature of depression in the course of PD.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorders are the most frequently experienced parasomnias in patients with PD. Non-REM sleep disorders like confusional arousals, sleep terrors, sleepwalking, and sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) are also associated with PD. Parasomnias can affect the quality of life of the patients as well as the night time sleep of their bed partners. Hence, it is important for physicians to recognize the occurrence of parasomnias in PD. We report an unusual case of PD with SRED along with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and REM behavior disorder. To our knowledge, only two cases have been reported in the literature highlighting the association of SRED with PD. We also explain the different night-time eating disorders like nocturnal eating syndrome and binge eating syndrome, which can be seen in PD, and differentiate them from SRED.",

Insomnia disorder may also increase risk for heart disease. There are many things that trigger insomnia like stress, anxiety, alcohol, tobacco, looking at bright screens, working shifts and too much of caffeine. Once these tricks go away, the insomnia may continue and head to insomnia disorder. This may happen because of habits formed because of insomnia (such as napping, getting in bed before being sleepy, and lying-in bed awake for long periods of time). Insomnia disorder can also sometimes appear on its own with no known cause.",

      "abstract": "The authors review the literature on the epidemiology, the clinical and electrophysiological symptoms of somnambulism. The disorder specified as \"nREM parasomnia with awakening disorder\" belongs to the nREM sleep (awakening) parasomnias. In most of the cases its occurence is familial with the highest prevalence at age 12 year. Above age 12 year most cases recover whereas 6% of prevalence is reported in adults. It is probable that most patients seek medical help only in severe cases associated with injuries, accidents or violence. Its etiology is unknown; in essence it is a sleep regulation disorder characterised by a dissociated state of partial awakening from nREM sleep: the motor system becomes awake while consciousness remains clouded. There are several medicines inducing somnambulism in patients otherwise free from this disorder. In somnambule patients the most important provoking factors are sleep deprivation as well as pathological states and circumstances evoking sleep loss. Somnambulism should be differentiated from complex partial epileptic seizures and REM behaviour disorder. As there is no specific treatment at the moment it is important to assure safe sleeping circumstances - ground flour, closed windows, and no fragile furniture. Clonazepam and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors prove sometimes effective, but the most effective methods in decreasing the frequency of somnambule episodes are the regular sleep-wakefulness schedule and the avoidance of sleep deprivation.",

It is known that sleep can facilitate epileptic activity and that seizures in sleep tend to occur during specific sleep stages.

Disorders that may present with nocturnal nonepileptic paroxysmal events may include not only sleep-related disorders per se but also psychiatric/behavioral conditions\"benign\" paroxysmal phenomena with unrelated etiology, and nonneurologic disorders. These phenomena, especially when involving complex motor activity, such as that observed in parasomnias, nocturnal panic attacks, and rapid eye movement behavior disorders may be difficult to differentiate from seizures. Moreover, there is increasing awareness that certain sleep disorders, such as sleep-disordered breathing, may coexist with epilepsy. There are several clinical and electrographical features that allow an accurate diagnosis, and diagnostic tools such as video-EEG polysomnography may be essential.",

The problems range from nocturnal issues such as difficulty with sleep initiation, sleep fragmentation, disturbance of circadian rhythm, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, to daytime problems such as excessive daytime sleepiness. Frequent nighttime awakening and sleep disruption are the most common sleep problems in Parkinson's disease. Dopamine plays an important role in maintaining wakefulness. To improve sleep in Parkinson's disease, it is important to achieve the critical balance of adequate dopaminergic therapy and control of symptoms. Increased dopaminergic agents can cause dyskinesias and painful dystonia, and undertreatment can cause nighttime akinesia, rigidity, and worse quality of sleep. Other nondopaminergic drugs commonly used in Parkinson's disease can also affect sleep. In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has a favorable impact on sleep quality and sleep architecture.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurological disorders are disorders that involve the brain, spinal cord or nerve and muscle. Children with neurological disorders may have disorders such as epilepsy, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, meningitis, genetic/metabolic diseases or diseases of muscle or nerve such as muscular dystrophy or peripheral neuropathy. These illnesses are frequently severe and potentially have long lasting consequences for the affected children. The pathologies most frequently responsible for psycho-physical disorders can be summarized into three groups: collaboration difficulties (autism spectrum disorders, intellectual impairment, phobia); motor dysfunction (cerebral palsy, epilepsy, other brain pathologies, neuromuscular disorders), and craniofacial anomalies (Down syndrome, other genetic syndromes). Due to their clinical history, and the lack of collaboration, in pediatric non-cooperative patients with Special Needs (SN), the anesthesiological risk may result difficult to assess, despite the fact that they meet the criteria of the outpatient management applied for the patient without disabilities. The perioperative management of pediatric patients with psycho-physical disorders with related relational and cognitive problems must be carefully planned, in order to make the entire hospitalization process as comfortable and as less traumatic as possible. General anesthesia is the most suitable type of anesthesia in pediatric patients with Special Needs (SN), although anesthetic complications are more frequent in these patients, mainly due to comorbidities, taken drugs and anatomical peculiarities. Some studies observed no correlation between multiple anesthesia exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits, while others reported that even a single exposure could increase the risk of deficits. An increased risk of developmental or behavioral disorders as the consequence of surgeries requiring general anesthesia was observed. Based on current studies, it is necessary to endeavor to limit the duration and numbers of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic agents. The evaluation must include history and physical examination pertaining to the conditions requiring special anaesthetic considerations. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing these neurological disorders in pediatric patients to improve overall quality of life and long-term outcomes.",

While the prevalence of sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome has a pronounced increase across the lifespan (1-3), the prevalence of psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders remains somewhat constant frommiddle to old age (4). Sleep disturbance is a symptom criterion across a number of psychiatric illnesses, including many of the mood and anxiety disorders as delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th revision (DSM) (5). Most commonly, the sleep disturbance is in the form of an insomnia complaint and to a lesser extent it relates to hypersomnia and other common disorders of sleep such as sleep apnea. Alterations in sleep architecture are evidenced across a variety of mood and anxiety disorders when sleep is subjected to polysomnographic evaluation. It is also the case that a host of psychotropic medications either alter sleep architecture and/or contribute to subjective sleep complaints.",

      "abstract": "Transient recurrent confusional and stuporous states of nonepileptic origin are clearly less frequent than epileptic ones. They are relatively common in diseases of disturbed vigilance, like narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnolence, and sleep apnea. These patients often suffer from attacks of hypovigilance, characterized by altered awareness, automatic behaviour and partial or complete amnesia for the attack. Because of the memory 'black outs' and the frequently associated hypnagogic hallucinations, the patients behave inappropriately and often appear confused. Confusional states also typically arise during basilar artery migraine attacks. This special form of complicated migraine predominantly affects young females and is characterized by symptoms and signs of brain stem dysfunction such as vertigo, ataxia, paresthesia, limb weakness, dysarthria; in 75% of the cases, disorders of consciousness dominate. Transient ischemic attacks are sometimes recurrent and, when involving the cranial basilar territory, may result in confusional states without significant motor dysfunction. Attacks of transient global amnesia are possibly also ischemic in nature and are assumed to arise from transient bilateral limbic failure. Affecting only memory functions, they are strictly spoken not confusional, but must nevertheless be taken into consideration when proper observation during the attack was not possible.",

      "title": "Factors Affecting Sleep and Wakefulness in People with Epilepsy: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "The importance of sleep has been reported for decades. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder comprising multiple elements that might influence sleep and wakefulness. Notably, animal studies show disruptions of the circadian molecular system in different models of epilepsy, along with altered rest-activity and other circadian rhythms. So far, studies of molecular circadian systems in people with epilepsy are lacking, prompting further research. Seizures-the primary and most debilitating symptom of epilepsy-and interictal activity disrupt regular sleep and sleep-wake rhythms. Alterations in one's sleep structure are seen in both drug-naïve and drug-resistant patients with epilepsy. In particular, low sleep efficiency, a reduction in total sleep time, and changes in sleep stages were found in both homogenous and mixed samples of epilepsy patients. Both ictal and interictal activity were also shown to be associated with changes in peripheral circadian phase biomarkers such as melatonin and cortisol. Moreover, epilepsy comorbidities, antiseizure medications, and a variety of syndromes can be a cause of sleep problems or even sleep disorders. Sleep disorders vary depending on various comorbidities and syndromes, and encompass all major groups of sleep disorders defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Controversial findings on the effects of various antiseizure medications were found in the literature. However, medications such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and barbiturates are particularly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Overall, a sleep evaluation must be included in the management of every patient with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are complex elements of many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual and developmental disabilities, and insomnia. Sleep disturbances are caused by a variety of factors, resulting in short-term and long-term consequences that can affect self-care, daily functions, and well-being. Sleep disturbances can compromise not only he general health of individuals but also on the health of caregivers and support systems. There is a need to understand the interaction between neurodevelopmental disorders and sleep disturbances to identify patterns of sleep fragmentations contributed to neurobiological and neurodevelopmental conditions determine appropriate treatment, improve the quality of life for individuals with neurological comorbidities.",

      "title": "Report from the <scp>WPA</scp> Section on Psychiatry and Sleep‐Wakefulness Disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, which is considered a psychiatric disorder itself, is the most common sleep-related complaint in the general population. Furthermore, complaints about sleep and wakefulness are among the most common and impairing symptoms in psychiatric patients. Disturbed sleep frequently precedes the onset of several mental disorders, exacerbates as mental disorders progress, and frequently presents as a residual and treatment-resistant symptom. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in sleep research and the treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders in psychiatry, although many questions remain to be answered1. We still do not know exactly the causative link(s) between the various psychiatric disorders and sleep complaints, although it would be important to know, for instance, whether early treatment of sleep disturbances can prevent the development of depressive disorders. Moreover, the relationship between subjective complaints of insomnia patients and objective polysomnographic results remains elusive, and we do not know whether the health consequences of insomnia, for example on metabolic systems, are related to subjective or objective measures of sleep, or both. Besides objective methods for assessing sleep and wakefulness – such as polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, multiple sleep latency test, and maintenance of wakefulness test – there is now considerable literature on various biomarkers for sleep disorders. For insomnia, the measures with the highest performance include PSG-derived cyclic alternating patterns, actigraphy, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. These are followed by heart rate around sleep onset, deficient melatonin rhythm, and specific neuroimaging patterns, mainly reflecting the activity of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia2. For central disorders of hypersomnolence, novel measures derived from quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), high-density EEG, cognitive testing, structural and functional neuroimaging, and pupillometry have been proposed3. Significant progress has also been made in the assessment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. In addition to established laboratory protocols, circadian rhythms can now be assessed through long-term ambulatory monitoring of activity, skin temperature, heart rate, and light exposure4. Significant progress has also been made in the treatment of insomnia, emphasizing not only the role of appropriate pharmacotherapy but, above all, non-pharmacological treatment options. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is currently recommended as the evidence-based psychotherapy for chronic insomnia, also in patients with comorbidities5. This treatment includes techniques such as sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep education and hygiene, relaxation techniques, and cognitive restructuring. These techniques help strengthen the basic sleep-regulating mechanisms, including the homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm, and reduce sleep-related anxiety and arousal6. The treatment of insomnia in psychiatry should be based on an integration of pharmacotherapy (including novel medications, such as orexin antagonists) and non-pharmacological interventions, to address psychological and behavioral factors that contribute to the development or persistence of insomnia. It is particularly important to emphasize the need to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, getting up at the same time every day, even after a night of poor sleep, and to exercise regularly. Additionally, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and limiting naps and rest periods during the day are essential. To prevent insomnia, it is also important to limit screen time during the day and avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs) at least one hour before bed. Several new wakefulness-promoting agents have been introduced for the treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence7. Moreover, it is now well recognized that effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with mental disorders is critical for improving their response to treatment, quality of life, and overall health7. As the prevalence of sleep and wakefulness disorders has further increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in deterioration of mental health and increased alcohol and hypnotic use8, it is evident that mental health professionals require effective training in diagnosing and treating disrupted sleep. People with mental disorders can greatly benefit from mental health services that incorporate routine assessment and treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders within standard care pathways. Consequently, the main aim of the WPA Section on Psychiatry and Sleep-Wakefulness Disorders is to educate psychiatrists in recognizing and giving appropriate attention to sleep disturbances (such as insomnia and hypersomnolence) and in being able to provide guidance to their patients on the importance of basic sleep hygiene rules. The education of psychiatrists should also include awareness on obstructive sleep apnea, which can manifest with psychiatric symptoms, including increased daytime sleepiness, fatigue or loss of energy, loss of interest or pleasure, irritability, mood swings, emotional instability, and cognitive dysfunction such as impaired memory, attention and executive functions. These psychiatric manifestations highlight the importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea promptly, as managing the sleep disorder can improve overall well-being and quality of life. Moreover, since 30-40% of patients with chronic insomnia fulfill diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea, screening for this condition should be performed before initiating any hypnotic medication. This is crucial, because medications such as benzodiazepines are contraindicated in patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea. Such screening can be performed with short questionnaires such as the STOP-BANG. This questionnaire consists of eight yes-or-no questions, focusing on snoring, tiredness, observed apneas, pressure (high blood pressure), body mass index, age, neck circumference, and gender (male). Each \"yes\" answer scores one point. A higher total score indicates a greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea9. Our WPA Section has been active for many years. Its activities have been focused on providing information about sleep and sleep-related disorders to clinical health professionals, as well as optimizing the diagnosis and therapy of sleep disturbances in patients with mental disorders. Since sleep is an interdisciplinary field, one of our main goals is to connect sleep specialists from around the world. We believe that our Section can mediate between basic researchers, clinicians, educational institutions, scientific professional societies, health care institutions, and governmental authorities, in order to improve the recognition and treatment of sleep disorders. Our Section's action plan for 2023-2026 includes several goals. A primary one is advancing research and knowledge about disturbances of sleep and wakefulness in patients with mental disorders, by fostering collaboration between basic researchers, clinical scientists, and health care providers. Additionally, we will keep focusing on education and training on diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, by organizing workshops, webinars and scientific conferences with WPA involvement. Furthermore, we will be active in promoting clinical practice guidelines, to improve the quality and interdisciplinary nature of care in people with mental disorders suffering from disturbed sleep. A major goal also pertains to engaging in policy and advocacy, by calling for pertinent actions in support of research and public health initiatives to improve access of patients with mental disorders to sleep medicine services. We will also be supporting the building up of networking and collaboration, by fostering relationships with scientific societies to promote interdisciplinary research and clinical care. To this end, our Section has already organized a highly successful symposium, \"State of the Art in the Management of Insomnia\", during the World Congress of Psychiatry in 2023. Finally, we intend to develop public sleep health campaigns to educate the public on sleep hygiene, health consequences of poor sleep, and prevention of sleep disorders. By implementing this action plan, our Section can play a pivotal role in advancing the field, improving patient care, and promoting the importance of sleep health in the broader mental health context.",

      "title": "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "abstract": "Most depressed patients suffer from sleep abnormalities, which are one of the critical symptoms of depression. They are robust risk factors for the initiation and development of depression. Studies about sleep electroencephalograms have shown characteristic changes in depression such as reductions in non-rapid eye movement sleep production, disruptions of sleep continuity and disinhibition of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep alterations include a decrease in REM sleep latency, an increase in REM sleep duration and REM sleep density with respect to depressive episodes. Emotional brain processing dependent on the normal sleep-wake regulation seems to be failed in depression, which also promotes the development of clinical depression. Also, REM sleep alterations have been considered as biomarkers of depression. The disturbances of norepinephrine and serotonin systems may contribute to REM sleep abnormalities in depression. Lastly, this review also discusses the effects of different antidepressants on REM sleep disturbances in depression.

      "abstract": "Neurogenic dysphagia results from sensorimotor impairment of the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing due to a neurologic disorder. The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia include drooling, difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, difficulty managing secretions, choke/cough episodes while feeding, and food sticking in the throat. If unrecognized and untreated, neurogenic dysphagia can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and respiratory complications. The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia may be relatively inapparent on account of both compensation for swallowing impairment and diminution of the laryngeal cough reflex due to a variety of factors. Patients with symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia should undergo videofluoroscopy of swallowing, which in the case of neurogenic dysphagia typically reveals impairment of oropharyngeal motor performance and/or laryngeal protection. The many causes of neurogenic dysphagia include stroke, head trauma, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease and myopathy. Evaluation of the cause of unexplained neurogenic dysphagia should include consultation by a neurologist, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, blood tests (routine studies plus muscle enzymes, thyroid screening, vitamin B12 and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies), electromyography/nerve conduction studies, and, in certain cases, muscle biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid examination. Treatment of neurogenic dysphagia involves treatment of the underlying neurologic disorder (if possible), swallowing therapy (if oral feeding is reasonably safe to attempt) and gastrostomy (if oral feeding is unsafe or inadequate).",

      "abstract": "Insomnia, a more or less chronic sleep disturbance, is a very common symptom in psychiatric patients but also relatively freguent in the general population to a lesser degree. Two broad types of insomnia may often be distinguished: (1) difficulty falling asleep and frequent wakening, characteristic of anxiety states or obsessive worrying; and (2) early morning wakening, sometimes in a panic, suggestive of endogenous depression. The first group of patients respond well to minor tranquilizers and psychotherapy, whereas the second do well with tricyclic anti-depressants. Many studies in sleep laboratories have declineated the stages and cycles of sleep physiology and pathology, especially the importance of REM or dreaming sleep. The clinician should be cautious in the use of hypnotics like barbiturates which suppress REM sleep and produce a rebound increase on withdrawal, as well as problems of dependence of habituation. Flurazepam and chloral hydrate are considerably safer in this respect. Understanding sleep neurophysiology and biochemistry permits appropriate individual clinical management for both psychiatric patients and medical patients with conditions like peptic ulcer and nocturnal angina pectoris.",

      "title": "REM Sleep Instability – A New Pathway for Insomnia?",
      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia afflicts approximately 10% of the adult population and is associated with daytime impairments and an elevated risk for developing somatic and mental disorders. Current pathophysiological models propose a persistent hyperarousal on the cognitive, emotional and physiological levels. However, the marked discrepancy between minor objective alterations in standard parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is unresolved. We propose that \"instability\" of REM sleep contributes to the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep and to the explanation of this discrepancy. This concept is based on evidence showing increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients. As REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep it seems particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. The continuity hypothesis of dream production suggests that pre-sleep concerns of patients with insomnia, i. e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, dominate their dream content. Enhanced arousal during REM sleep may render these wake-like cognitions more accessible to conscious perception, memory storage and morning recall, resulting in the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Furthermore, chronic fragmentation of REM sleep might lead to dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas that are specifically activated during REM sleep. This dysfunction, along with attenuated functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression.",

      "title": "Cardiovascular Consequences of Disordered Sleep",
      "abstract": "Sleep is an important component of every clinician's health assessment. Common sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic insomnia) have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system when left untreated. In this column, we discuss sleep/cardiovascular neurobiology and highlight the impact of nurse-led programs for improving patients' sleep and cardiovascular health. To reduce cardiovascular disease risk, people generally require 6 or more hours of uninterrupted sleep,1 which is composed of 2 types: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep.2 Non-REM sleep can be further divided into 3 substages (N1, N2, and N3) that reflect the lightest (N1) to deepest (N3) sleep. Sleep types/stages are quantified when a patient undergoes polysomnography, which records electrical activity in the cortex, measures cardiorespiratory parameters (eg, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), and calculates diagnostic indices (eg, sleep apnea index). Sleep stages are defined by their distinctive electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns.2–4 Sleep normally begins with the N1 stage when cortical neurons begin producing a synchronous EEG rhythm. The transition from N1 to N2 sleep follows as the EEG rhythm shifts toward a lower-frequency pattern that is interspersed with 2 distinctive types of high-amplitude EEG waves (sleep spindles and K complexes). The deepest stage of sleep (N3) follows—slow (0.5–4 Hz), high-amplitude, synchronized EEG waves characterize N3 sleep (the slow neural oscillations are called delta waves; N3 sleep is also called \"slow-wave sleep\").2–5 Short bouts of REM sleep normally alternate with longer periods of non-REM sleep. The REM sleep EEG is distinctly different from the signals observed during non-REM sleep.3 Similar to the EEG during wakefulness, the EEG rhythm is fast and desynchronized during REM sleep—REM sleep is associated with vivid dreaming, rapid movements of the eyes, and muscle atonia.2 The role of REM sleep in cardiovascular homeostasis is incompletely understood, although anatomical brain research has revealed how REM-sleep regulatory centers in the brainstem (pontine tegmentum) send projections to medullary regions that control sympathetic output (rostral ventrolateral medulla), suggesting that REM sleep may be important in regulating the sympathetic innervation of the heart and blood vessels.3,6 Non-REM sleep also has important implications for cardiovascular health—sympathetic outflow declines during sustained periods of non-REM sleep. When asleep, a patient's blood pressure should drop significantly, a phenomenon called \"blood pressure dipping.\" Nondipping (the failure to produce a reduction in blood pressure by ~10% during sleep) is associated with cardiovascular morbidity.3 Obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia are examples of prevalent sleep disorders with detrimental cardiovascular effects—these conditions can fragment/reduce sleep (particularly the N3 and REM sleep stages) and impair blood pressure dipping.3,7 Prevalence estimates for insomnia range from 5% to 50% in the general population, whereas obstructive sleep apnea afflicts 3% to 53% of adults, with higher rates associated with men, older age, and obesity.7–10 Nurse-led programs have been important for understanding, treating, and preventing sleep disorders and their cardiovascular consequences. For example, Siebmanns et al11 and Kapella et al12 treated insomnia by developing cognitive behavioral therapy programs for patients with cardiac and pulmonary disorders, respectively. Both programs significantly improved patient-reported and objective sleep quality indicators. Urcan and Kolcu13 developed an educational program for patients to improve their sleep after experiencing a stroke, and Zhu et al14 found that indicators of poor sleep quality (eg, number of awakenings) were significantly associated with poorer glycemic management in patients with type 2 diabetes. To understand adherence to sleep apnea therapies, Sawyer et al15,16 studied the factors affecting patients' use of positive airway pressure ventilation, finding that the facilitators, barriers, and perceptions varied across patients—this knowledge could be used to tailor nurses' future interventions toward sleep apnea management. In fact, nurse-led interventions have been successful in improving continuous positive airway pressure adherence. Nurses also examined sleep in hospital settings and provided recommendations to enhance patients' abilities to sleep in intensive care units, where lighting and noise can be particularly disruptive.17–21 In summary, healthy sleep is critical for cardiovascular health. Nurses have been designing, testing, and implementing novel approaches toward improving sleep. Nurses' research, practice, teaching, and policy initiatives about sleep are vital components of the national/global strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention.",

We investigated the relevance of this phenomenon in 375 consecutive subjects examined polysomnographically in a sleep disorders center. Rhythmic feet movements while falling asleep (RFM) were found in 28 subjects (7.5%). RFM occurred mostly as single, short series with a duration of between 10 and 15 seconds. They had a high night-to-night variability and were detected as rhythmic, oscillating movements of the whole foot or toes. Surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings displayed series of repetitive phasic bursts with a periodicity mostly between 1 and 2 per second. Single EMG burst duration varied between 300 and 700 msec. RFM at highest intensity occurred during presleep wakefulness, and usually persisted in sleep stages 1 and 2. RFM did not have a major sleep-disturbing effect in any of the affected subjects. Due to its high prevalence and the lack of a major sleep-disturbing effect, short series of RFM could be considered a quasiphysiological phenomenon. However, in more severe forms of RFM with evidence of a sleep-disturbing effect, RFM should be considered abnormal.",

Mechanisms of neurocognitive dysfunction may include hypoxia (in OSA specifically), sleep loss and/or sleep fragmentation (leading to prefrontal cortex dysfunction), and loss of memory consolidation. Additional research is needed on whether, and how, OSA or chronic insomnia contribute to the development of dementia.",

      "title": "PTSD in the Context of Malignant Disease",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "title": "Depression and Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Depression and Parkinson's DiseaseParkinson's disease (PD) is generally considered to be a neurological disorder.However, because of the frequency of mood and other psychiatric complications, PD could be considered a neuropsychiatric disease.In fact, James Parkinson himself observed in 1817 that depression is commonly associated with PD. 1 The estimated prevalence of depression in PD varies according to the type of mood assessment applied (interview versus self-report questionnaire), diagnostic criteria or definition of depression (the number and type of symptoms required), and research setting (community-based versus neurology clinic). 1,2However, overall the data suggest that at any given time 20-40% of individuals with PD are experiencing depression of some type.4][5] Depression can be difficult to diagnose in PD because of the overlap between symptoms of depression and PD.For example, the biological symptoms typical of depression-such as low energy, insomnia or excessive sleep, weight loss, diminished sexual function, and an emotionless face-can be directly related to the neuroanatomical disruption characteristic of PD.These symptoms are not necessarily evidence of depression and, conversely, the psychomotor slowing of depression might be accidentally overlooked in a patient with PD. 2,6 Depression in PD could be considered an understandable reaction to a disabling chronic illness.However, some researchers believe that depression may be a part of the disease and caused by neurological changes. 2,7This notion is supported by the fact that depression sometimes precedes the diagnosis of PD.Of course, the cause of depression in patients with PD could be a combination of a subjective reaction to the illness and the brain changes brought about by the disease. 5The consensus is that depressive symptoms should be addressed and treated by physicians regardless of whether these symptoms are part of PD itself or due to a separate cause. 1,8,9e psychiatric complications of PD require attention because they can exacerbate the already considerable physical challenges brought on by the disease.In fact, an international survey of patients with PD discovered that depressive symptoms were the most important factor in patient quality-of-life ratings. 10,11Another reason to treat depression in PD is that reports of care-giver burden correlate significantly with patients' depression and quality of life. 12",

      "title": "Behavioral sleep medicine—The need for harmonization of clinical best practice outcome measures in children and adolescents with intellectual or developmental disabilities and restless sleep",
      "abstract": "In behavioral medicine, sleep disorders, insomnia in particular, may be considered comorbidities and precipitating factors to intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD). Nevertheless, sleep alterations have often been neglected in favor of daytime features and symptoms, albeit simple behavioral nighttime observations may disclose hypermotor features that characterize restless sleep. The root of most hypermotor restlessness is linked to central iron deficiency. The latter is often exacerbated by vitamin D deficiency (VDD), which interferes with both dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms. In this way, an imbalance affecting daytime behavior and mood is created. Several sleep-related motor disorders such as bruxism, periodic and aperiodic leg movements, Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), and Restless Sleep Disorder (RSD) are commonly seen in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). However, they are rarely diagnosed and often overlooked in affected children and adolescents. As a result, not only are these disorders not adequately addressed therapeutically, but their symptoms may be worsened by the side-effects of drugs used to contain disruptive daytime behavior, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. In children with IDDs, obesity, inactivity and metabolic effects of antipsychotics often lead to Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), which is currently understood as an inflammatory state leading to “hyperactive” lethargy and further alterations of the hypoxic chain and vitamin D levels. Endorsing simple routine blood tests, including inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, ferritin, transferrin, and vitamin D levels, may favorably complement caregiver observations and ambulatory sleep recordings, leading to a sleep disorder diagnosis and consequent therapy. In fact, the treatment of SDB, RLS, and RSD has been copiously demonstrated to favorably impact vigilance, behavior, social competence, and academic skills in healthy and, to a greater extent, in IDD children. Thus, consulting and deliberating the root causes of functional and categorical diagnoses within a clinical framework may engender a more precise diagnosis and further benefit pediatric daytime and nighttime management of hyperactive behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The spontaneous behavior of 5 previable human prematures born between 24 and 27 weeks of gestational age and weighing between 600 and 900 g was studied, between the 3rd and 30th hr of life. Death occurred between the 28th and 120th hr. Body motility, eye movements, respiratory and cardiac rhythms, chin myogram, electroencephalogram (EEG), and crying were evaluated by careful observation and by polygraphic recordings for periods of from 1 to 2 hr. A very rich and continuous motility is described consisting of rapid jerks, either diffuse or localized, and of slow movements. Rhythmic movements of the chin or peribuccal area occur in bursts and are particularly striking. The paucity of rapid eye movements (REM) is also remarkable. The EEG is composed of silent periods interrupted by discontinuous polymorphic activity. The fixation of the cardiac rate, the absence of periodic respiration and of apneic periods are the most important vegetative phenomena. Crying occurs in short periods rarely lasting more than 20 sec. The state of these previable prematures cannot be considered as waking; it seems to be a very immature state of sleep that differs from both the quiet and the active sleep of full‐term newborns. This atypical sleep, which appears to be present in other species characterized by a great degree of immaturity at birth, does not give any evidence of cyclic organization.",

      "title": "Endocannabinoide und andere Lipidmediatoren bei Morbus Parkinson-assoziierten Schmerzen : Untersuchung mittels Quantitativer Sensorischer Testung (QST)",
      "abstract": "Morbus Parkinson ist die zweithäufigste neurodegenerativen Erkrankung, die durch Untergang der dopaminergen Neuronen im Mesenzephalon zu einer Störung des extrapyramidalen motorischen Systems führt. Daraus resultierende Bewegungsstörungen, zu denen Rigor, Tremor, Hypokinese und posturale Instabilität gehören, werden von nichtmotorischen Symptomen wie autonome Dysregulation, veränderte sensorische Wahrnehmung, sowie kognitive und psychische Störungen begleitet. Mehrere Studien berichten über erhöhte Schmerzprävalenz bei Parkinson Patienten. Die genaue Pathogenese der gestörten Schmerzwahrnehmung bleibt unklar. Zusätzlich zu den zentralen Mechanismen entstehen die Schmerzen bei Morbus Parkinson wahrscheinlich durch eine Schädigung der peripheren somatosensorischen und autonomen Neuronen, die sich in sensorischen Defiziten, sowie in erhöhter Schmerzempfindlichkeit manifestieren. Als Korrelat dazu wurden abnormale somatosensorisch evozierte Potenziale, pathologische Ergebnisse in der quantitativen sensorischen Testung und eine Abnahme der Nervenfaserdichte beschrieben. Ein Schwerpunkt unserer Untersuchungen lag auf der Erforschung von potentiellen Veränderungen von Lipidsignalmolekülen. Eine Reihe von Studien zeigen eine Schmerzlinderung durch Cannabis-Einnahme, sowie eine Tendenz zur Schmerzentwicklung bei Parkinson Patienten mit dem bekannten FAAHPolymorphismus. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass eine Störung im Endocannabinoid-System höchstwahrscheinlich zu erhöhter Schmerzprävalenz bei Morbus Parkinson beiträgt. Eine weitere wichtige Lipid-Gruppe sind Glycosylceramide. Ihr Abbau kann durch heterozygote Mutationen des lipidabbauenden Enzyms Glukocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) gestört sein. GBA1 Mutationen sind mit der schnell progredienten sporadischen Verlaufsform der Parkinson-Krankheit assoziiert. Im Rahmen der Studie wurden zwei Kohorten von Parkinson Patienten analysiert. Die 128 Patienten aus Israel wurden im ersten Teil mit 224 jungen gesunden deutschen Probanden verglichen. Im zweiten Teil wurden 50 deutschen Patienten und 50 gesunde altersgleiche Probanden untersucht. Die Schmerzevaluation erfolgte anhand der \"Brief Pain Inventory“ und \"Neuro Detect“ Fragebögen. Bei allen Probanden wurde quantitative sensorische Testung durchgeführt und die Plasmakonzentrationen der Lipidsignalmoleküle mittels quantitativer HPLC-Tandem-Massenspektrometrie analysiert. Nach Auswertung der Schmerzevaluation konnte eine erhöhte Schmerzprävalenz bei Parkinson Patienten festgestellt werden. Die Prävalenz betrug 66% im ersten Teil der Studie und 74% in der deutschen Kohorte, im Vergleich zu 40% bei den altersgleichen gesunden Probanden. Ergebnisse der quantitativen sensorischen Testung zeigen einen Verlust der thermischen Empfindung (erhöhte Schwellen) bei der gleichzeitigen mechanischen Überempfindlichkeit (erniedrigte Schwellen). In der multivariaten LipidAnalyse konnten erniedrigte Konzentrationen von Anandamid und Lysophosphatidsäure 20:4 und eine Erhöhung der Glucosylceramide nachgewiesen werden. Diese Veränderungen waren bei Parkinson Patienten mit Schmerzen stärker ausgeprägt. Außerdem wurde eine lineare Korrelation zwischen Glucosylceramiden (GlcCer 18:1, GlcCer 24:1) und der Schmerzintensität, sowie sensorischem Defizit festgestellt. Nach sorgfältiger Auswertung der Studienergebnisse kommen wir zu der Schlussfolgerung, dass eine Veränderung der Endocannabinoide und der Glucosylceramide zur Pathogenese der Schmerzen und der sensorischen Neuropathie bei Morbus Parkinson beitragen. Die Erkenntnisse könnten zukünftig zur Diagnosestellung durch frühzeitige Erkennung prämotorischer sensorischer Symptome beitragen. Darüber hinaus könnten unsere Ergebnisse zur Therapieoptimierung durch Wiederherstellung der Lipid-Homeostases beitragen.",

This chapter deals specifically with sleep apnoea, REM sleep behaviour disorder (RSBD) and periodic leg movement during sleep (PLMS), as these are the primary sleep disorders with increased prevalence in the elderly. Patients with sleep apnoea have recurrent episodes of cessation of breathing during sleep. Management options include general measures like weight reduction, use of continuous positive airway pressure and surgical treatment. RSBD is characterized by excessive motor acts during sleep, which may result in injuries to the patients or their bed partners. The exact prevalence is unclear, but recent studies have suggested that the prevalence may be around 0.5% in the general population. Management includes general measures to protect the patients as well as drug treatment. In PLMS, the patient has periodic jerky movements of the lower limbs during sleep. This may be asymptomatic or associated with insomnia. Severe cases may warrant drug treatment.",

      "title": "854 Sexsomnia in a Divorce Proceeding and its Custody Implications",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexsomnia is a NREM parasomnia under the subtype of Confusional Arousals, defined as abnormal sexual behaviors emerging from partial arousals during slow-wave sleep. Case reports suggest that is more common in men. Precipitating factors include Obstructive Sleep Apnea, insufficient sleep, alcohol and fatigue/stress and history of NREM parasomnias. Report of case(s) A 37-year-old male with bruxism (using mouth guard) and anxiety for 7 years, who presented to the sleep clinic for a second opinion to discuss concerns around the safety of his children due to his sleep related sexual behavior. Sexsomnia was first noted with the stressors related to becoming a parent (fostering children and having biological children). Sexual behavior reported by the couple was mostly provoked with spouse’s touch during sleep. Behaviors ranging from fondling to aggressive sexual intercourse were reported to occur 1 to 3 times/week. There were no injuries during episodes which only occurred in the bedroom with the spouse and the patient was amnestic of his behavior. Due to marital discord provoked by other stressors, he began to sleep alone in the basement. A video-polysomnogram revealed no parasomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep arousal disorders. Normal REM with atonia was observed. The patient was treated with Duloxetine 20mg for anxiety after the initial sleep visit. His condition contributed to marital separation. In the divorce proceedings, the spouse argued for denial of visitation rights related to his sleep-sexual behaviors noting that the children may be at risk. After separation, his anxiety and stress levels lowered in conjunction with therapy and medication. Follow up after 2 months found the patient asymptomatic. He placed an alarm on his bedroom door, to alert him and others during sleep. There are no published reports to provide a prediction as to whether his condition would-be supporting restrictions in overnight visitation by the foster and biological children. Conclusion In this case, there was a precedent condition (bruxism) and precipitating stress and anxiety, known to provoke NREM parasomnia. The absence of polysomnographic evidence is not unusual. Forensic repercussions, in particular prospective calculations of risk, are poorly described in the literature. Support (if any):",

      "title": "<scp>REM</scp> Sleep Behavior Disorder and Visual Hallucinations in a Pathologically Confirmed Case of Corticobasal Degeneration",
      "abstract": "In autopsy series of patients with parkinsonism, the presence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) or visual hallucinations (VH) has a greater than 90% specificity for α-synuclein pathology.1, 2 Accordingly, these clinical features are often useful when considering the differential diagnosis of atypical parkinsonsim. We report an unusual case of autopsy confirmed corticobasal degeneration (CBD) with clinical evidence of both RBD and VH in the absence of co-existing α-synuclein pathology. The patient was 74 when he presented with a 12-month history of feeling generally slow and unsteady. He had difficulty getting out of bed and getting into and out of his car. He stopped driving because he realized that he was unable to react quickly enough and his wife reported that he was becoming forgetful. He had difficulty getting to sleep and had also developed constipation. His past medical history included type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy and osteoarthrosis of his knees. His medications were metformin, glimepiride, sitagliptin, perindopril and simvastatin. He was a retired engineer who had never smoked tobacco and who drank little alcohol. There was no relevant family history. On examination, he had hypomimia and reduced blink rate. He walked slowly with a stooped posture and no arm swing. There was bilateral bradykinesia and some rigidity but no tremor. Brain MRI was normal apart from mild small vessel disease. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and levodopa-benserazide was started, escalating to 25/100 mg three times daily. At follow-up three months later he noted an improvement in performing daily tasks and cognition. Over the next six months he started to cough and splutter while eating and drinking and his balance worsened, particularly when changing direction. He deteriorated quickly, developing a shuffling gait, difficulty rising from a seated position, and began to topple backwards leading to falls. He had a \"rigid stare\" with slightly reduced vertical eye movements, and was incontinent of urine and feces. There was no further benefit from higher doses of levodopa-benserazide and his overall levodopa responsiveness was considered poor. The clinical diagnosis was revised to progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome. He was evaluated at another hospital three years after his symptoms began. His daily levodopa intake was 600 mg and he required a wheelchair. He was sleeping 6–7 hours with bad dreams, during which he would shout out and have violent limb movements, particularly in the latter part of the night. Visual hallucinations (VH) in which he saw family members were also reported. Examination revealed complete loss of up-gaze, slowness of finger movements without decrement, and generalized limb and axial rigidity. His dose of levodopa was reduced but there is no record of his VH improving. He moved to nursing home care and died age 78 following a lower respiratory tract infection. The disease duration from symptom onset was approximately 4.5 years. On neuropathological examination, there was no evidence of α-synucleinopathy or TDP43 proteinopathy in the brainstem, amygdalae, hippocampi or neocortical regions. Instead, histological examination revealed primary tauopathy with both glial and neuronal inclusions. Neuronal pathology was in the form of neuropil threads, pre-tangles and tangles and the hallmark glial tau pathology was that of astrocytic plaques, confirming the diagnosis of CBD (see Fig. 1). CBD pathology and atrophy were most prominent in the frontal lobe, deep gray nuclei and midbrain. Occasional grains were also noted in the medial temporal lobes and Braak and Braak neurofibrillary tangle tau pathology did not exceed stage II. Aβ pathology was restricted to diffuse deposits in the neocortex and there was also a cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the cerebral and cerebellar leptomeninges and cerebral cortex. VH were recorded in just 5 of 67 patients with autopsy confirmed CBD from three clinicopathological series.1, 3, 4 Concomitant VH and RBD have previously been described in a patient with CBD, however there was co-existing brainstem Lewy body pathology that may have accounted for these features.5 There has been one further report of RBD in a patient with confirmed CBD; this patient also had parkinsonism and a vertical supranuclear gaze palsy but details of other misfolded protein pathology were not included.6 The limitations of this report include the absence of polysomnography to confirm the clinical diagnosis of probable RBD and the possibility that levodopa may have provoked the patient's VH and RBD. Nonetheless, the absence of α-synuclein pathology at autopsy suggests that topographical differences in pathology are more likely responsible, rather than pathophysiological changes specific to misfolded α-synuclein. Recent work implicating changes in brain network connectivity in the pathogenesis of VH7 may explain why several heterogenous regions are associated with VH, such as the brainstem, amygdalae and neocortical areas.8, 9 Complex networks also facilitate REM sleep atonia and involve various brainstem nuclei.10 As such, CBD tau pathology observed in the neocortex and midbrain structures may account for these features in this case.

Most common amongst these is Narcolepsy, a primary disorder of the neural control of wakefulness and sleep. The recent discovery of hypocretin/orexin deficiency as the main cause of narcolepsy will lead to important therapeutic advances for patients with narcolepsy and further to understanding of the control of sleep and wakefulness in general. Importantly, the excessive daytime sleepiness is not due to psychiatric conditions, but rather is always due to sleep deprivation or an underlying diagnosable and treatable sleep disorder.

      "abstract": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a sudden and severe anterograde memory disturbance accompanied by various degrees of retrograde amnesia and sometimes executive dysfunction. TGA affects elderly individuals and men and women equally. During the episode, patients cannot recall novel episodic information and therefore repeatedly ask the same questions. They are not fully oriented to space and time. Diagnostic criteria first established in 1985, and elaborated in 1990, demand that there is no clouding of consciousness, other impairments of cognition, or a history of epilepsy or head trauma. An episode of TGA resolves within 24 h leaving a memory gap for the length of the attack. While in rare cases TGA might happen repeatedly, it mostly occurs as a single attack. TGA is considered a benign disorder as memory deficits resolve completely and do not lead to long-term sequelae. In up to 90% of reported TGA cases, a precipitating event - mainly described as physical or emotional stress - is present. The cause of TGA has been a matter of long-standing debate among researchers. In search of an answer, several possible causes (ischemia, migraine, epileptic seizures, or, more recently, a disturbance of venous hemodynamics) have been hypothesized. However, to date there is no scientific proof of any of these mechanisms. By using diffusion-weighted MRI 24-48 h after a TGA episode, small dot-like lesions have been detected in the hippocampus. This has led to the implication that the selective vulnerability of CA1 neurons to metabolic stress might play a role in the pathophysiology of TGA.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a form of periodic breathing during sleep, is the most common cause of respiratory failure during sleep. It causes a relative lack of breathing and sleeping that bodes disaster for the patient. Alternately breathing and not breathing, the afflicted sleeper struggles to inspire through an obstructed upper airway or, more correctly, an occluded oropharynx. He repeatedly experiences episodic hypoxemia, which, in turn, disrupts his sleep. (This use of the male pronoun is convenient and correct, statistically; OSA is rare in women.) Obstructive sleep apnea is a multisystem disorder involving metabolic, respiratory, and neural abnormalities. The cause of the airway obstruction is multifaceted and includes the following: structural encroachment on the oropharyngeal lumen, subatmospheric intrapharyngeal pressure, and hypotonicity of oropharyngeal muscles. Similarly, secondary disease manifestations appear in multiple systems; respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and hypersomnolence are characteristic of severe OSA, and this complex is usually referred to",

      "abstract": "The fundamental purpose of sleep remains one of the most compelling questions yet to be answered in the area of neuroscience, if not all of biology. A pervasive behavior among members of the animal kingdom, the functional necessity of engaging regularly in sleep is best demonstrated by showing that failing to do so leads to a broad repertoire of pathological outcomes including cognitive, immunological, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes, among others. Indeed, an absolute requirement for sleep has been shown in studies that have demonstrated that continuous total deprivation of sleep for as short a period as 15 days is generally lethal in some species. The most common clinical sleep disorder, insomnia, is both a principal disease (primary insomnia) as well as a co-morbidity of a large number of other ostensibly unrelated diseases including chronic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. From a treatment perspective, restoring normal healthy sleep delivers subsequent benefits in waking cognitive function and mood with the potential for beneficial therapeutic impact on daily functioning across multiple diseases for which restorative healthy sleep is compromised. Our remarkable escalation in understanding the anatomy and physiology of sleep/wake control mechanisms provides new opportunities to modify the neurobiology of sleep and wake-related behaviors in novel and exciting ways. In parallel, expansion of sleep research into novel interfaces between sleep-wake biology and disease states is revealing additional extensive implications of lost sleep. Current investigational and conventional pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep and wake disorders are discussed based on their mechanism of action within the CNS and their effect on sleep and wake. This review of recent sleep biology and sleep pharmacology peers into the future of sleep therapeutics to highlight both mechanistic safety and functional outcomes as key for differentiating and establishing success for the next generation of arousal modifying therapeutics.

      "abstract": "Complex motor behaviors can be a challenge for even a seasoned physician. Opinions may be divided when behaviors occur out of sleep as general tendency is to categorize them as a parasomnia. A 43 y/o female with suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was referred for a sleep study. She had severe OSA and a subsequent PAP titration study was performed. At 6 am, she had an arousal from N2 sleep with abduction of arms followed by writhing in bed. It was followed by flailing of arms in air with deviation of the eyes to the right. Later patient exhibited fast circling movements of the arms with chewing movements. Episode lasted for 25 seconds. Immediately after, patient was able to answer questions appropriately and walk without any difficulty suggesting no confusion. Limited EEG (done with PSG) was mostly obscured by muscle artifact and no clear epileptiform discharges could be discerned. No other abnormal EEG activity was noted during this sleep study prior to this event. She had similar behavior without any post event confusion on her sleep study 12 years ago. Patient demographic, clinical semiology and PSG/EEG features have been proposed to distinguish nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) seizures from parasomnias, validated guidelines are still missing. The short-lasting motor events cannot always be established as epileptic nature, on the basis of one event of clinical phenomena, but the recurrence of these similar observed movements in individuals can be used as an indirect marker of epileptic etiology. Distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from parasomnias is critical from pathophysiological relationship but has treatment implications. This case illustrates importance of reviewing clinical history and behavior semiology that was recorded as well as limitations of the ancillary testing such as polysomnography or EEG monitoring.",

The activation of extrastriate and limbic structures, combined with a deactivation of primary visual and prefrontal cortices, appears to indicate the existence of a closed processing loop during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Slow waves are prominent characteristics of the later stages of nonrapid eye movement sleep and consist of highamplitude delta waves at 1–4 Hz and a slower oscillatory rhythm of less than 1 Hz. Rapid eye movements are some of the most prominent hallmarks of REM sleep and are believed to be related to the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves identified through cellular recordings in animals. Sleep disturbances are a common facet of depression and include problems in sleep continuity, reductions of slow-wave sleep, decreased REM latency, and increased REM density.",

During their active or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep they showed significantly more apneic episodes which were also longer lasting and they were accompanied by bradycardia of a greater severity.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a widespread disorder affecting not only sleep quantity and quality, but also daytime well-being and performance, as well as having a negative impact on physical and mental health. Many people have problems falling asleep and maintaining sleep that do not reach the clinical criteria of insomnia. For all the prevalence of such sleep disorders, specialists often overlook a fundamentally important factor that affects sleep and wakefulness cycle, ease of falling asleep and daytime performance. These are circadian rhythms of the body under the control of the biological clock.This review highlights the specifics of the human biological clock and its relationship to insomnia and complaints of poor sleep. The phenomenon of the human chronotype as a set of individual preferences in sleep-wake rhythm is considered. Late chronotype, tat tends to wake up late and be active in the evening turns out to be the most vulnerable to the appearance of complaints of poor sleep and development of insomnia. This result is typical for different age groups. The reason for problems sleep for the late chronotype is the need to adjust to social demands and to fall asleep and wake up too early relative to the phase of one’s own circadian rhythm.Circadian rhythms may contribute to the formation and maintenance of insomnia. Both chronic and acute insomnia may have a chronobiological component that is not always considered. Late chronotype may be a factor further exacerbating the course of insomnia. The regularity of circadian rhythms may also be impaired in insomnia.The importance of the biological clock in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness also explains the successful approach to insomnia treatment with melatonin, which plays an important signaling role in the circadian regulation of the body.",

      "abstract": "Hypoxia induced by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) leads to the deregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), resulting in an abnormally increased sympathetic activity. Since ANS modulation varies throughout the night, notably for each sleep stage, the hypno-gram and heart rate signals of 81 OSA patients were collected during a polysomnography. They were classified as mild-moderate (n=44) or severe (n=37) based on their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Spectral heart rate variability (HRV) series were extracted by a time-frequency approach. These series were then averaged for each sleep stage, in order to compare the sympathetic modulation of mild-moderate and severe patients at the following phases: rapid eye movement (REM), S1, S2 and SWS (slow wave sleep). According to normalized power at the low-frequency band (LF nu ) values, severe OSA seems to be associated with an increased sympathetic modulation at non-REM sleep. Moreover, a decreased autonomic variability throughout the night may be related to a reduced adaptability of the cardiovascular system, characterizing a more advanced stage of the disease. These results provide further evidence for the role of autonomic alterations induced by hypoxia, suggesting the use of HRV analysis, together with AHI, for the study of OSA severity.",

Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause.

      "abstract": "Study Objectives:Sleep problems are a common phenomenon in most neurological and psychiatric diseases. In Parkinson disease (PD), for instance, sleep problems may be the most common and burdensome non-motor symptoms in addition to the well-described classical motor symptoms. Since sleep disturbances generally become apparent in the disease before motor symptoms emerge, they may represent early diagnostic tools and a means to investigate early mechanisms in PD onset. The sleep disturbance, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), precedes PD in one-third of patients. We therefore investigated sleep changes in marmoset monkeys treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP), the non-human primate model for idiopathic PD.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between sleep and epilepsy is bidirectional. Certain epilepsy syndromes predominantly or exclusively manifest during sleep, with seizures frequently originating from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Interictal epileptiform discharges observed on electroencephalograms are most likely to be activated during the deep NREM sleep stage known as N3. Conversely, epileptiform discharges, anti-seizure medications (ASMs), as well as other anti-seizure therapies can exert detrimental effects on sleep architecture. Moreover, the co-occurrence of sleep disorders has the potential to exacerbate seizure control. Understating the relationship between sleep and epilepsy is crucial for healthcare providers. Addressing and managing sleep-related problems in individuals with epilepsy can potentially contribute to improved seizure control and overall well-being. At the same time, improving seizure control can improve sleep quality and quantity, thus further improving the health of individuals with epilepsy.",

      "title": "Associations of sleep disturbance with ADHD: implications for treatment",
      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly associated with disordered or disturbed sleep. The relationships of ADHD with sleep problems, psychiatric comorbidities and medications are complex and multidirectional. Evidence from published studies comparing sleep in individuals with ADHD with typically developing controls is most concordant for associations of ADHD with: hypopnea/apnea and peripheral limb movements in sleep or nocturnal motricity in polysomnographic studies; increased sleep onset latency and shorter sleep time in actigraphic studies; and bedtime resistance, difficulty with morning awakenings, sleep onset difficulties, sleep-disordered breathing, night awakenings and daytime sleepiness in subjective studies. ADHD is also frequently coincident with sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, peripheral limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome and circadian-rhythm sleep disorders). Psychostimulant medications are associated with disrupted or disturbed sleep, but also 'paradoxically' calm some patients with ADHD for sleep by alleviating their symptoms. Long-acting formulations may have insufficient duration of action, leading to symptom rebound at bedtime. Current guidelines recommend assessment of sleep disturbance during evaluation of ADHD, and before initiation of pharmacotherapy, with healthy sleep practices the first-line option for addressing sleep problems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between ADHD and sleep, and presents a conceptual model of the modes of interaction: ADHD may cause sleep problems as an intrinsic feature of the disorder; sleep problems may cause or mimic ADHD; ADHD and sleep problems may interact, with reciprocal causation and possible involvement of comorbidity; and ADHD and sleep problems may share a common underlying neurological etiology.",

It can be associated with other dramatic symptoms of a psychotic nature likely to cause diagnostic uncertainty. Methods and results: These points are illustrated by the case of a young man with a severe bipolar affective disorder who independently developed terrifying visual, auditory and somatic hallucinatory episodes at sleep onset, associated with a sense of evil influence and presence. The episodes were not obviously related to his psychiatric disorder. Past diagnoses included nightmares and night terrors. Review provided no convincing evidence of various other sleep disorders nor physical conditions in which hallucinatory experiences can occur. A diagnosis of predormital isolated sleep paralysis was made and appropriate treatment recommended. Conclusions: Sleep paralysis, common in the general population, can be associated with dramatic auxiliary symptoms suggestive of a psychotic state. Less common forms are either part of the narcolepsy syndrome or (rarely) they are familial in type. Interestingly, sleep paralysis (especially breathing difficulty) features prominently in the folklore of various countries.",

      "abstract": "In this publication a review is presented based on the findings resulting from sleep-wake investigations searching for sleep disorders associated with insomnia in relatively healthy elderly. 44 Relevant journal articles published between 1980-1998 were found. The four most important sleep disorders which can be accompanied by sleeplessness in relatively healthy elderly people are periodic leg movements disorder (PLM), restless legs syndrome (RLS), REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). Of these disorders, sleep apnea and periodic leg movements occur most frequently, in a quarter of the elderly. The latter, however, seldom complain about sleeplessness. Within the category of older people disorders characterized by movements during sleep increase significantly with age, nightly respiration disorders do not. SAS, PLM and RBD appear most frequently in men and RLS in women. The disorders characterized by movements during sleep (especially RLS and RBD) are often accompanied by sleeplessness. SAS, however, is more closely associated with day-time sleepiness than with sleeplessness. No combination of demographic variables and symptoms allows a reliable prediction of these sleep disorders. Fortunately, these disorders are not a major threat to the health of older people.",

      "title": "Treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated. The authors report no financial or other relationship relevant to the subject of this article.",

      "title": "0653 WORSENING PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE AFTER BRIEF NAPS IN HYPERSOMNOLENT PATIENTS: MSLT NAP CORRELATES",
      "abstract": "Physiologic sleep inertia is operationalized as cognitive impairments upon awakening. Markedly pronounced sleep inertia, or sleep drunkenness, is common in idiopathic hypersomnia and may exist on a continuum with physiologic sleep inertia or may represent a distinct entity. Previous work has demonstrated significant worsening of vigilance on Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) lapses (reaction times >500ms) and reciprocal of reaction time (RRT) following brief naps among hypersomnolent patients, but the MSLT correlates of these changes in vigilance are unknown. Patients undergoing PSG/MSLT (N=118; Age=37.38 ± 14.39; 62.71% women), with diagnoses of Idiopathic hypersomnia (n=37), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (n=29), Narcolepsy Type 1 (n=8) and Type 2 (n=6), and subjective sleepiness with normal MSLT (n=30), were administered PVT before and after MSLT naps 2 and 4. PVT performance was analyzed with paired t-tests, mixed-effects, and general linear models. For nap 2, lapses and RRT demonstrated significant worsening post-nap relative to pre-nap, (10.31 ± 18.56 [pre] vs 13.42 ± 20.65 [post]; t= -2.98, p=0.0035 and 3.24 ± 0.87[pre] vs 3.05 ± 0.91[post]; t=5.06, p= <.0001), respectively. Similar results were seen for nap 4 for lapses (t=-3.35, p=0.0011) and RRT (t=3.24, p=0.0016). Sleep duration on nap 2 was significantly associated with increased lapses (B=.80, S.E.=0.22, p=0.001) and worsened RRT (B=.03, S.E.=0.01, p=0.001) post-nap, but not on nap 4. Sleep efficiency on nap 2 was significantly associated with increased lapses (B=-8.57, S.E.=3.96, p=0.032) and worsened RRT (B=.38, S.E.=.14, p=0.006), but not on nap 4. Nocturnal PSG variables (sleep time, sleep efficiency, %N3 sleep, %REM sleep) and PSG/MSLT-based diagnoses were unrelated to PVT change in performance. Despite the generally short amount of accrued sleep time, psychomotor vigilance worsens immediately upon awakening from a morning MSLT nap in hypersomnolent patients, and this worsening is strongly related to amount of sleep obtained/sleep efficiency. This finding has implications for napping recommendations among those with excessive daytime sleepiness.",

Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

On average, the screaming began 4.8 years after the onset signs and symptoms of Parkinson disease. In many cases, sleep talking started before the onset of Parkinson disease. All patients reported that the screaming disrupted the sleep of their families, and half of the patients reported that the screams disturbed their own sleep. The screams were incorporated into their dreams. Clonazepam was effective to alleviate this screaming in 8 out of 9 cases. We considered this screaming to be caused by similar mechanisms as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder in which muscle atonia characterizing normal REM sleep is absent. The screams were not accompanied by other abnormal behaviors. We postulate that the screaming is a symptom closely related to that of mid or lower brainstem lesion in Parkinson disease because the neural activity of the locus ceruleus or the pudunculopontine nucleus are responsible for muscle atonia in REM sleep.",

Syncopal and psychomotor attacks may overlap in the following context: falls resembling syncope during psychomotor seizures, the so-called \"temporal fainting spells\"; cardiac arrhythmias during psychomotor attacks; psychomotor symptoms such as automatisms and/or \"dreamy states\" that occur during syncopal attacks with transient dysfunction of the limbic system; alternating psychomotor and syncopal attacks in the same patient Symptoms of intermittent vertebrobasilar insufficiency: non-systematic vertigo, brief blurring of consciousness and blackouts may all be misinterpreted as rudimentary psychomotor seizures.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders have been frequently reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, there is insufficient evidence to guide precise recommendations on some diagnostic and treatment strategies. Here, we review clinical studies dealing with sleep abnormalities in PD and present clinical recommendations. Previous studies describing insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, narcolepsy-like episodes, circadian changes, sleep-disordered breathing, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, vivid dreams and restless legs syndrome are evaluated. Longitudinal studies associating sleep disorders with PD onset or clinical deterioration are rare: only one longitudinal study associated daytime sleepiness with PD onset. Evidence suggests that clinical investigations must include direct questioning about depressive symptoms, nocturnal cramps, pain, nocturia and nighttime off periods. A patient interview must be conducted regarding sleep symptoms, including nightmares, abnormal behavior during sleep, snoring, restless legs syndrome and daytime sleepiness. Initial evidence indicates that light therapy improves motor function and depression. Advice on sleep hygiene, the treatment of concomitant depression and the careful use of dopaminergic drugs and hypnosedative agents should be considered. To date, very few controlled studies are available to make a recommendation for the management of sleep-wake disturbances in PD.",

The reasons for this relationship are not completely understood but may involve endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we hypothesized that insomnia symptoms would be associated with reduced endothelial function. Methods: Working adults (n = 496, 67.5% female, 78.6% white, mean age 48.7 [SD, 10.8] years, body mass index 28.2 [SD, 6.7] kg/m 2 , diabetes 5.8%, hypertension 20.0%, hyperlipidemia 17.9%, heart disease 2.6%) enrolled in the Emory-Georgia Tech Predictive Health Institute study completed baseline demographic, clinical, depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7), sleep (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), and noninvasive endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) measures. Insomnia symptoms were defined as subjective sleep latency of 30 minutes or longer, nighttime or early morning awakenings, and/or sleep medication use occurring 3 times or more per week in the past month. Results: Insomnia symptoms were reported by 39.5% of participants. Multivariable regression models showed that insomnia symptoms, age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia were inversely related to FMD. After adjusting for age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia, participants reporting insomnia symptoms had lower FMD than did participants reporting better sleep (adjusted FMD mean, 6.13% [SD, 0.28%] vs 6.83% [SD, 0.26%], P = .035). Conclusion: In this study, insomnia symptoms were associated with reduced FMD. Research examining the therapeutic benefits of treating insomnia on endothelial function and future cardiovascular risk is warranted.",

Rhythmic body movements during sleep are commonly observed in infancy and early childhood, and spontaneous resolution is expected after the age of 4 years. Rarely, the body movements persist until adulthood. Rhythmic body movements characteristically occur during the wake-sleep transition period, rather than during other sleep stages. Some psychiatric diseases can co-occur with sleep-related movement disorders. A relationship between parasomnias and dissociative disorders has been recently reported. Herein we present a 33-year-old male with nocturnal repetitive rolling body movements and daytime fatigue. The patient also had loss of memory of some important events (such as the day his daughter underwent surgery), and reported that he sometimes confused reality with dreams had fantasies during which he experienced his spirit rising above to watch his body and fantasy. Detailed neuropsychological assessment showed that the patient also had a dissociative disorder. Video-polysomnographic recordings showed repetitive, rolling body movements that occurred only during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.",

      "title": "REM SLEEP BEHAVIOUR DISORDER: AN OVERVIEW",
      "abstract": "REM sleep behaviour disorder (RSBD) is a recently described parasomnia characterised by a history of excessive nocturnal motor activity and absence of muscle atonia during REM sleep. Only limited literature is available on this condition. The exact prevalence is unclear, but recent studies suggest it might not be an uncommon condition. The elderly are more often affected and there is a male preponderance. While transient RSBD can be seen after taking certain drugs or during drug withdrawal, the chronic type is usually idiopathic or associated with an underlying degenerative neurological condition. It can result in considerable distress and/or serious injury to the patients or their bed partners. Differential diagnoses include sleep-walking, night terrors, nightmares, nocturnal seizures, obstructive sleep apnoea, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative states and nocturnal confusional states. The dramatic response to clonazepam highlights the importance of recognition and appropriate treatment of this sleep disorder.",

      "abstract": "The defining feature of neurocognitive disorders is a decline in cognitive functioning. Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

The morphology of epileptiform discharges may also be affected by sleep, with a change or breakdown of the generalized pattern in generalized epilepsy, but a better definition of sharp waves in partial epilepsy, during nonREM sleep. One notes a predilection for certain types of epilepsy to occur in sleep, such as benign focal epilepsy of childhood, or to occur shortly after awakening (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). Epilepsy may disrupt the sleep architecture with an increase in light sleep and a decrease in deep sleep, and an increase in awake time after sleep onset. Sleep is an important activator of IEA and is of value both in the routine EEG evaluation of epilepsy as well as in more prolonged studies used in epilepsy monitoring units.",

      "abstract": "In presenting a case of extreme hyposomnia, psychosomatic insomnia is elaborated as a special type of primary insomnia. The case study of a 60 years old man is based on psychiatric examinations, an intersive one-week observation including polygraphic sleep recordings, and on reviewing medical data over a period of 35 years. In this case, the insomnia developed during a life situation with social stress and continued over 30 years with a gradual sleep reduction to 2-4 hours. Our sleep recordings confirmed a total sleep time of nearly 3 hours, a marked rhythmicity of sleep and day-time activities, fragmentation of sleep, and psychogenic extrasystoles, all symptoms having been reported by the subject previously. Autonomic functions indicated a good efficiency of NREM sleep, whereas a first night effect with subsequent adaptation revealed a good regulatory function of the sleep-waking-system. In addition to a detailed documentation of this extraordinary case, an interpretation is undertaken in order to explain, how the insomnia developed and continued. Psychodynamic aspects show a set of characteristics which are most typical for psychosomatic syndroms. The authors expect, that the knowledge about psychosomatic insomnia will be helpful in diagnosis and treatment of severe insomnias.",

      "title": "Maternal Depression, Mothering and Child Development",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "abstract": "Oral parafunction and sleep disorder parasomnia, bruxism involves the dentist and particularly the pediatric dentist to detect in additionto masticatory and occlusal problems, sleep disorders. It is a question of characterizing bruxism in connection with not only dental problems but also sleep disorders. The etiology of bruxism is not formally elucidated, there is however a strong consensus on its multifactorial origin. Bruxism would be caused by central factors (neuropathic or psycho-emotional) involving the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic (ANS) modulated among other things by sleep and the psychic state. In addition, certain local factors can maintain the parafunction: breathing disorders and sleep parasomnia in particular revealing a pattern of intricate cause-consequences. The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between dental and sleep disorder by the same symptom bruxism in children. Bruxism was the reason for consultation of 98 children aged 3-6 years with more or less extensive loss of dental material evolving over several months and repeatedly. The search for self-reported information on behavioral and attention disorders as well as the daytime and nocturnal signs reported by parents suggesting sleep disorders. A polysomnography made, it was possible to confirm the diagnosis and to indicate the severity of the sleep disorder, namelyinsomnia (2%), hypersomnia (4%) circadian rhythm disorders (8%), other parasomnias (16%), and 70% had OSAS with an average AHI of 4.4/h. A statistical association was found between bruxism and OSAS (P&lt;0·001; Chi-square test).",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders is a common problem that patients report to their doctor. They can accompany many mental and somatic disorders or be primary. There are many types of sleep disorders; most commonly, they are associated with problems with falling asleep and maintaining sleep continuity, or more complex disorders, such as parasomnias, breathing disorders and movement disorders associated with sleep. In the following work, we have focused on sleep problems in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). These patients more often than healthy people of the same age complain about sleep disorders and these dis­orders increase with the progress of the disease and the appearance of other symptoms. Depressed mood, chronic fatigue, pain and urinary problems significantly affect the quality of sleep in patients with MS. On the other hand, excessive sleepiness and trouble with falling asleep intensify the feeling of fatigue, which is a major problem and impair cognitive functions. However, sleep-related symptoms are often overlooked during medical visits due to other symptoms of multiple sclerosis, especially those causing motor disability. The treatment of sleep disorders in patients with MS is based on basic methods used in the general population. In the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with multiple sclerosis, appropriate disease modifying therapy is also important.",

      "title": "Sleep polysomnography as a predictor of recurrence in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "Adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) demonstrate certain sleep polysomnographic abnormalities, including sleep continuity disturbances, reduced slow-wave sleep, shortened rapid eye movement (REM) latency, and increased REM density. Findings of sleep EEG studies in depressed children and adolescents have yielded conflicting results, possibly because of methodological variations across the studies. Generally, however, studies have demonstrated that depressed children and adolescents exhibit less sleep continuity and non-REM sleep differences in comparison with control subjects than do adults. Thus, results from adult sleep polysomnography studies cannot necessarily be generalized to children and adolescents. Depressed adults who have reduced REM latency during the symptomatic episode appear more likely to have a relapse once treatment is discontinued than those with normal REM latency. No studies of the relationship between sleep polysomnographic variables and clinical course have been reported in depressed children and adolescents. Data for baseline clinical variables and 3 nights of sleep polysomnography were examined in 113 depressed children (≤ 12 yr; n = 51) and adolescents (≥ 13 yr; n = 62) (56 in-patients and 57 outpatients) where data was available on at least 1 yr of naturalistic follow-up. Subjects came from 2 studies of sleep polysomnography in children and adolescents with MDD. Clinical course was assessed using the Kiddie-Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation (K-LIFE). This interview was used to define recovery from the index episode of MDD and recurrence, a new episode of meeting full criteria for MDD. Clinically, within 1 yr of initial evaluation 102/113 subjects had recovered from their index episode of depression (minimal or no symptoms for 60 d). Of the 102 subjects who recovered, 36 (35.3%) had a recurrence of MDD. The majority of subjects (55%) who had a recurrence were not on medication at the time of recurrence. Subjects who had a recurrence were more likely to report suicidal thoughts or attempts at baseline compared to those without a recurrence (67 vs. 37%; F = 8.77; p = 0.004). On baseline sleep polysomnography, subjects with a later recurrence had decreased sleep efficiency and delayed sleep onset (sleep latency > 10 min). Probability of recurrence at 12 months was 0.39 compared to 0.15 in subjects with non-delayed sleep onset (p = 0.005). Baseline suicidal ideation and sleep dysregulation on sleep polysomnography predicted recurrence in a large sample of depressed children and adolescents. Depression in children and adolescents is frequently a chronic, recurrent illness. Factors that can predict clinical course are important in increasing our understanding of depression in this age group.",

Hypoxia may have direct central effects on neurotransmitters, which in turn will affect hypothalamic-pituitary hormone production. And, sudden arousal from sleep may produce a central stress response leading to hormonal changes. These factors may interact and lead to changes in the central of sleep and endocrine rhythms. We describe Growth hormone and Androgens secretion during sleep with obstructive sleep apnea patients.",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Pain is well known to be a common dominant symptom in people with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Perhaps less well acknowledged by healthcare professionals are fatigue and sleep disturbances in these patients. Individually these symptoms are problematic but when combined their effect and impact on patients' lives is greatly amplified; often leaving people in a vicious cycle whereby being in pain results in poor sleep leading to fatigue the next day, which lowers patients' pain tolerance resulting in a poorer night\"s sleep, more fatigue and increased pain. Pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance greatly reduce quality of life for people with RMDs. Patients have to adapt their daily and leisure activities, or give them up altogether with negative psychological consequences such as anxiety and depression. Patients can end up feeling helpless and sometimes suicidal. Relationships with partners and friends are often altered affecting their sexual and social lives. Major life decisions, such as having a baby, can be put on hold or shelved. People with RMDs may also have to reduce their working hours or stop working, which has financial repercussions for them and their families. This can exacerbate stress, anxiety and depression leading to poorer health outcomes. It is therefore of great importance that healthcare professionals understand the extent to which pain, fatigue and sleep difficulties impact on patients' lives so that priority can be given to addressing these distressing symptoms as part of any management strategy. <h3>Disclosure of Interests:</h3> None declared",

      "title": "Mitochondrial DNA-Associated Leigh Syndrome and NARP",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP (neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa) are part of a continuum of progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormalities of mitochondrial energy generation. Leigh syndrome (or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is characterized by onset of symptoms typically between ages three and 12 months, often following a viral infection. Decompensation (often with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or CSF) during an intercurrent illness is typically associated with psychomotor retardation or regression. Neurologic features include hypotonia, spasticity, movement disorders (including chorea), cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. About 50% of affected individuals die by age three years, most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure. NARP is characterized by proximal neurogenic muscle weakness with sensory neuropathy, ataxia, and pigmentary retinopathy. Onset of symptoms, particularly ataxia and learning difficulties, is often in early childhood. Individuals with NARP can be relatively stable for many years, but may suffer episodic deterioration, often in association with viral illnesses. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome is established clinically in a proband with progressive neurologic disease with motor and intellectual developmental delay, signs and symptoms of brain stem and/or basal ganglia disease, raised lactate concentration in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, and any one of the following: Characteristic features on brain imaging Typical neuropathologic changes Typical neuropathology in a similarly affected sib Identification of a pathogenic variant in one of the 14 mitochondrial genes known to be involved in mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome confirms the diagnosis. The diagnosis of NARP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and identification of a heteroplasmic pathogenic variant in one of the three mitochondrial genes known to be involved in NARP. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive treatment includes use of sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate for acute exacerbations of acidosis and anti-seizure medication for seizures. Dystonia is treated with benzhexol, baclofen, tetrabenazine, and gabapentin alone or in combination, or by injections of botulinum toxin. Anticongestive therapy may be required for cardiomyopathy. Regular nutritional assessment of daily caloric intake and adequacy of diet and psychological support for the affected individual and family are essential. Surveillance: Neurologic, ophthalmologic, and cardiologic evaluations at regular intervals to monitor progression and appearance of new symptoms. Care is frequently coordinated by a biochemical geneticist in North America, and by a metabolic physician/pediatrician elsewhere in the world. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sodium valproate and barbiturates, anesthesia, and dichloroacetate. Genetic counseling Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP are transmitted by maternal inheritance. The father of a proband is not at risk of having the mtDNA pathogenic variant. The mother of a proband usually has the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have symptoms. In most cases, the mother has a much lower proportion of abnormal mtDNA than the proband and usually remains asymptomatic or develops only mild symptoms. Occasionally the mother has a substantial proportion of abnormal mtDNA and develops severe symptoms in adulthood. Offspring of males with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are not at risk; all offspring of females with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are at risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The risk to offspring of a female proband of developing symptoms depends on the tissue distribution and proportion of abnormal mtDNA. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for couples at increased risk of having children with mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome or NARP are possible by analysis of mtDNA extracted from non-cultured fetal cells or from single blastomeres, respectively. However, long-term outcome cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of molecular genetic test results.",

      "abstract": "Patients with idiopathic parkinsonism suffer from a neurodegenerative disorder of the nervous system. Due to a progressive loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) develop problems with motor and non-motor functions. On the motor level the dysfunctions defect the voluntary movements and lead to symptoms like: rigidity, resting tremor and bradykinesia [1]. On the level of cognition PD patients have problems with the executive functions, cognitive flexibility, working memory and control of attention [2]. Furthermore, the speech system gets affected which often leads to dysarthric speech. This hypokinetic dysarthria impacts the phonation, articulation and the respiratory system. The speech deficits include monoloudness, monopitch, reduced stress, imprecise articulation, variability of speech rate, disfluencies and voice tremor [3, 4, 5].PD affects communication as well as other related functions such as cognition, but complex prosodic aspects such as focus marking are less well studied. Prominence marking in German requires changes in intonation and articulation [6]. Speakers use multiple cues in the phonetic domain to regulate prosodic marking [7], e.g. modulation of F0 and syllable duration. Furthermore, there is insufficient literature on the impact of cognition on these phonetic aspects of prominence marking. The aim of this study is to analyse how prosodic prominence correlates with motoric and cognitive abilities in patients with Parkinson’s disease in the complex process of speech production.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a life-long neurological, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder. Most frequent symptoms involve excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted night-time sleep. The estimated prevalence of narcolepsy is 0.05%. Initial symptoms usually start in childhood and young adults. Diagnosis of narcolepsy is often problematic, and it can take up to 20 years between the first observed excessive sleepiness and a fully developed disorder. Both genetic and environmental contribute to narcolepsy onset. A very strong association was observed in the case of human leukocyte DQ antigens, especially DQB1_0602. We distinguish narcolepsy type 1 and 2. Diagnosis of both types is based on the patient’s history, confirmed by multiple sleep latency test (MLST) with preceding polysomnography (PSG). Highly specific findings in these examinations are SOREMPs – occurrence of REM period within 15 minutes after falling asleep. In narcolepsy type 1 cataplexy is present, and CSF hypocretin-1 concentration is undetectable as opposed to narcolepsy type 2. Early diagnosis and implemented treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of patients with narcolepsy. Non-pharmacological treatment such as good sleep habits and daytime naps play an important role in better symptom control. Pharmacological treatment helps to overcome hypersomnia and cataplexy. This review includes the most important clinical features of narcolepsy.",

There has been a lack of clarity regarding the definition of DNS, as many sleep-related symptoms and conditions disrupt sleep quality in narcolepsy (eg, hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, nightmares, restless legs syndrome/periodic leg movements, nocturnal eating, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety). In addition, the intrinsic sleep instability of narcolepsy results in frequent spontaneous wakings and sleep stage transitions, contributing to DNS. Sleep instability likely emerges in the setting of orexin insufficiency/deficiency, but its exact pathophysiology remains unknown. DNS impairs quality of life among people with narcolepsy, and more research is needed to determine its contributions to cardiovascular risk. Multimodal treatment is appropriate for DNS management, including behavioral therapies, counseling on sleep hygiene, and/or medication. There is strong evidence showing improvement in self-reported sleep quality and objective sleep stability measures with sodium oxybate, but rigorous clinical trials with other pharmacotherapies are needed. Treatment may be complicated by comorbidities, concomitant medications, and mood disorders.DNS is a common symptom of narcolepsy deserving consideration in clinical care and future research.Maski K, Mignot E, Plazzi G, Dauvilliers Y.

      "title": "A window into the mind-brain-body interplay: Development of diagnostic, prognostic biomarkers, and rehabilitation strategies in functional motor disorders",
      "abstract": "Background and aims Functional motor disorders (FMD) present a prevalent, yet misunderstood spectrum of neurological conditions characterized by abnormal movements (i.e., functional limb weakness, tremor, dystonia, gait impairments), leading to substantial disability and diminished quality of life. Despite their high prevalence, FMD often face delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment, resulting in significant social and economic burdens. The old concept of psychological factors as the primary cause (conversion disorder) has been abandoned due to the need for more evidence about their causal role. According to a predictive coding account, the emerging idea is that symptoms and disability may depend on dysfunctions of a specific neural system integrating interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Consequently, symptoms are construed as perceptions of the body’s state. Besides the main pathophysiological features (abnormal attentional focus, beliefs/expectations, and sense of agency), the lived experience of symptoms and their resulting disability may depend on an altered integration at the neural level of interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Methods and materials Our proposal aims to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of FMD through a three-stage research approach. Initially, a large cohort study will collect behavioral, neurophysiological, and MRI biomarkers from patients with FMD and healthy controls, employing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to develop a diagnostic algorithm. Subsequently, validation will occur using patients with organic motor disorders. Finally, the algorithm’s prognostic value will be explored post-rehabilitation in one subgroup of patients with FMD. Results Data collection for the present study started in May 2023, and by May 2025, data collection will conclude. Discussion Our approach seeks to enhance early diagnosis and prognostication, improve FMD management, and reduce associated disability and socio-economic costs by identifying disease-specific biomarkers.

Many factors can influence sleep in old age: it is important to inquire after sleeping habits including naps during the day, medication and comorbidity. Treatment depends on the causes. Insomnias should be treated mainly with non-pharmacological means such as cognitive behaviour therapy.Zusammenfassung. Schlafstörungen im Alter sind häufig und haben unterschiedliche Ursachen. Ältere Leute beklagen sich selten darüber, daher muss immer danach gefragt werden. Insomnien, schlafassoziierte Atemstörungen und das Restless-Legs-Syndrom nehmen im Alter zu. Nicht selten sind Schlafstörungen auch erstes Symptom anderer Erkrankungen. Bei Depressionen oder Angsterkrankungen, aber auch bei neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen wie Demenzen oder dem Parkinsonsyndrom können sich Schlafstörungen vor kognitiven Störungen oder motorischen Beschwerden manifestieren. Schlafstörungen können auch Risikofaktor für andere Erkrankungen sein, wie zerebrale Ischämien und Herzrhythmusstörungen. Vieles muss bei der Diagnostik und Therapie berücksichtigt werden: Schlafgewohnheiten nachts und tagsüber, Medikamente und Begleiterkrankungen. Die Behandlung ist abhängig von der Ursache und sollte vor allem bei den Insomnien nicht-medikamentöse Therapien wie kognitive Verhaltenstherapie beinhalten.",

      "abstract": "Many of the congenital neurologic diseases can result in incapacity or death of the animal.Some of them, such as idiopathic epilepsy and hydrocephalus, exhibit breed or familial predisposition and a genetic basis was proved or suggested.Some diseases can be presumptively diagnosed after a detailed signalment (breed predisposition), history (e.g.family history because many of these defects have familial tendencies), and through physical exam; other diagnostic methods (radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance, electrophysiologic tests, etc.) can provide supportive evidence for the congenital defect and help to confirm the diagnosis.Some cases can lead to civil law-suits when the lesions are congenital, but not easily recognizable, or when the lesions are hereditary but tend to became manifest only after some time (more than 12 months after the date of purchase, e.g., after the vice-free guarantee period has expired).Moreover, quite frequently an early diagnosis is not made because there are delays in consulting the veterinarian or the general practitioner veterinarian does not perceive subtle signs.This study was designed to focus on the medico-legal aspects concerning the buying and selling in Italy of dogs and cats affected by congenital and hereditary neurologic diseases that could constitute vice in these animals.While adequate provisions to regulate in detail the various aspects of pet sale have still to be drawn up by legislators, it may be helpful to involve breeders, by obliging them by contract to extend guarantees in the case of hereditary lesions, including neurologic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS), which is one of the leading sleep disorders and can result in death if not diagnosed and treated early, is most often confused with snoring. OSAS disease, the prevalence of which varies between 0.9% and 1.9% in Turkey, is a serious health problem that occurs as a result of complete or partial obstruction of the respiratory tract during sleep, resulting in sleep disruption, poor quality sleep, paralysis and even death in sleep. Polysomnography signal recordings (PSG) obtained from sleep laboratories are used for the diagnosis of OSAS, which is related to factors such as the individual's age, gender, neck diameter, smoking-alcohol consumption, and the occurrence of other sleep disorders. Polysomnography is used in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders such as snoring, sleep apnea, parasomnia (abnormal behaviors during sleep), narcolepsy (sleep attacks that develop during the day) and restless legs syndrome. It allows recording various parameters such as brain waves, eye movements, heart and chest activity measurement, respiratory activities, and the amount of oxygen in the blood with the help of electrodes placed in different parts of the patient's body during night sleep. In this article, the performance of PSG signal data for the diagnosis of sleep apnea was examined on the basis of both signal parameters and the method used. First, feature extraction was made from PSG signals, then the feature vector was classified with Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Logistic Regression (LR).",

      "abstract": "Normal sleep is accompanied by distinct alterations in blood pressure and heart rate. These alterations are dependent upon sleep stage and appear to be mediated primarily by changes in autonomic circulatory control. It has become increasingly clear that sleep does not consist of a homogenous autonomic cardiovascular profile but rather represents a dynamic and organized modulation of neural circulatory control. The spectrum of autonomic regulation during normal sleep includes sympathetic inhibition, bradycardia, and lower blood pressures during synchronized non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, and sympathetic activation with intermittent surges in blood pressure and heart rate during REM sleep. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the normal sleep stage-related changes in sympathetic activity and blood pressure are opposed by chemoreflex-mediated responses to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. These chemoreflex-mediated responses frequently overwhelm the modulatory effects of normal sleep on neural circulatory control.",

      "title": "The mechanism of sleep, dreams, and sleep deficiency",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital function to all species for reinvigorating the mental and physical senses. During sleep, specific synapses become less active to eliminate unneeded memories as other synapses strengthen to enhance memory consolidation. Healthy quality and longevity of sleep can also regulate moods by ridding fatigue and repairing integrity of the medial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connections. External disturbances affect the quality of sleep, and an individual's routine may play a role in the development of sleeping disorders. By irregulating the circadian rhythm and having consistent negative sleeping habits, sleep disorders such as insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea may develop. Eight to nine hours of sleep are recommended to both teenagers and adults, if less is received, difficulty in concentration and interpretation of information may be present, as well as physiological effects such as higher blood pressure caused by the disrupted regulation of stress hormones, which if continued, can make the body more prone to serious health conditions.The science of sleep and dreaming comprises a relevant thesis in modern neuroscience research and issues major comprehensions on the study of human consciousness. Dreams are an integral part of sleep. Sleep and dream cycles vary in phenomenology, characteristics, and under circumstances, interpretation of the individual. Various theories such as Sigmun Freud's Psychodynamic theory, the activation synthesis model, and the cognitive development theory have been created and numerous studies are ongoing as the principal motive of dreams has not yet been concluded. Some theories remain heavily physiological as high difficulty of investigations are discontinued by scientists and deemed unverifiable. The research presented here revolves around the neurology of sleep as to inquire into the physiology and investigations on the purpose of dreams. We thus conclude the current review with a call for further research directed towards the primary purpose of sleep and dream.",

Die exzessive Schläfrigkeit sollte gegenüber Müdigkeit und Energielosigkeit, wie sie meist im Zusammenhang mit intern-medizinischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen auftreten, abgegrenzt werden. Die Hypersomnie tritt in der erwachsenen Bevölkerung mit einer Häufigkeit von 2–5% auf und kann zu Arbeitslosigkeit, Unfällen und neuropsychiatrischen Störungen führen. Zu den häufigsten Ursachen einer Hypersomnie zählen das Schlaf-apnoe Syndrom (SAS), die Narkolepsie, das chronische Schlafmanko (sog. Schlafinsuffizienz) sowie das Restless legs-/periodic limb movements in sleep – Syndrom (RLS/PLMS). Die Verdachtsdiagnose ergibt sich oftmals schon aus dem klinischen Beschwerdebild. Dennoch sind eine Polysomnographie und ein Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) für die definitive Diagnosestellung oft notwendig. Therapeutisch stehen die nasale CPAP-Therapie beim SAS, Stimulantien bei der Narkolepsie, eine Verlängerung der Schlafdauer bei der chronischen Schlafinsuffizienz und Dopaminagonisten beim RLS/PLMS zur Wahl.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although the requirements for sleep do not appear to decline with aging, the ability to sleep and achieve consolidated sleep may decrease in some older adults. Approximately 50% of older adults complain of sleep disturbance. Older adults often take longer to fall asleep, have lower sleep efficiencies, and have more nighttime awakenings. They are also sleepier during the day than younger adults. Compared to elderly men, women are better able to maintain satisfactory sleep with aging. Aging is associated with changes in sleep architecture (Box 14–1). Greater nighttime sleep disturbance may lead to daytime sleepiness and more frequent daytime napping. Significant disturbances may occur during sleep with aging (Table 14–1). Although some of the observed changes can be attributed to normal aging itself (eg, age-related alterations in circadian rhythms), most are due to comorbid medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and primary sleep disorders.",

Patients with this syndrome have uncomfortable sensations in their legs (and sometimes arms or other parts of the body), with moving their legs to relieve this sensations. The symptoms of RLS are usually worse in the evening and at night. The diagnosis of RLS is primarily based on clinical evaluation and clinical history of the patient. International restless leg syndrome group study (IRLSSG) evaluates the symptoms and severity of RLS. RLS can be divided into two groups of primary and secondary. Iron deficiency, Parkinson’s disease, kidney failure, diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and pregnancy may cause RLS. Antinausea, antipsychotic drugs, some antidepressants, and antihistamines may also worsen the symptoms. RLS is also observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which makes the outcomes  worse. COPD is a main preventable health problem that can lead to morbidity and mortality. Thus, RLS in COPD causes excessive daytime hypersomnolence, fatigue, poor quality of life, disability and neuropsychological complications such as social isolation, frequent daytime headaches, anxiety and depression.",

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

Sleep is a state of inactivity accompanied by a loss of awareness and a markedly reduced responsiveness to environmental stimuli. When a recording is made of an electroencephalogram (EEG) and other physiological variables such as muscle activity and eye movements during sleep (a technique called polysomnography) a pattern of sleep consisting of five different stages emerges. This pattern varies from person to person, but usually consists of four or five cycles of quiet sleep alternating with paradoxical (active) sleep, with longer periods of paradoxical sleep in the latter half of the night. A representation of these various stages over time is known as a hypnogram, and one of these derived from a normal control subject is shown in Figure 1. The quiet sleep is divided further into four stages, each with a characteristic EEG appearance, with progressive relaxation of the muscles and slower, more regular breathing as the deeper stages are reached. Most sleep in these deeper stages occurs in the first half of the night.",

      "title": "Alteraciones cognitivas y lingüísticas en la enfermedad de Parkison",
      "abstract": "La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa caracterizada principalmente por sintomas motores (rigidez, bradicinesia, temblor en reposo) que aparece por una perdida de dopamina en el circuito que conecta los ganglios basales con la corteza cerebral y por la aparicion de depositos de Lewy en diferentes regiones cerebrales. Aunque el origen de la EP es parcialmente desconocido, han sido descubiertos algunos genes que estan involucrados en su aparicion, pero que explican solamente un pequeno porcentaje de los casos. En las ultimas decadas, el interes por los sintomas no motores (SNM) de la enfermedad ha ido creciendo progresivamente. El deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL) es uno de estos sintomas que puede aparecer incluso desde los inicios de la enfermedad y en algunos casos, evolucionar hasta la demencia. El perfil cognitivo de estos pacientes suele caracterizarse por dificultades ejecutivas, aunque tambien es frecuente encontrar deficits de memoria, de habilidades visuoespaciales, de procesamiento emocional y del lenguaje.En el caso del lenguaje, las alteraciones pueden afectar tanto al procesamiento de mas alto nivel como la pragmatica o la comprension de oraciones, hasta el procesamiento lexico-semantico. Sin embargo, aun hay controversia acerca del origen de estos deficits. Diferentes estudios han tratado de conocer si el deficit es puramente linguistico o si por el contrario es secundario a las alteraciones cognitivas presentes en los pacientes, o incluso si existe relacion con el trastorno motor y/o los niveles de dopamina cerebral.El objetivo principal de esta Tesis es conocer el perfil cognitivo de un grupo de pacientes con EP sin demencia asi como las alteraciones linguisticas que pueden presentar, principalmente de los verbos.La hipotesis de partida es que los pacientes con EP muestran deficits cognitivos y en el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales en ausencia de demencia objetivados con pruebas neuropsicologicas. En cuanto a los trastornos del lenguaje, la hipotesis principal de este trabajo es que los pacientes con EP sin demencia presentan deficits linguisticos en el procesamiento de los verbos que aumentan con la retirada de la medicacion dopaminergica. Para poner a prueba estas hipotesis, llevamos a cabo 5 estudios distintos. En el primer trabajo participaron 50 pacientes con EP y 42 controles sanos. En el segundo, 40 pacientes con EP y 19 controles, en ambos, los pacientes fueron evaluados con una extensa bateria neuropsicologica y en el segundo se incluyeron mas tareas linguisticas y una de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. En el tercer estudio, una muestra de 49 pacientes con EP y 19 controles realizaron una tarea de denominacion de acciones en la que se controlo el contenido motor de los dibujos que tenian que denominar. En los experimentos cuatro y cinco, 20 pacientes fueron evaluados con la misma tarea de denominacion de acciones (estudio cuatro) y con cuatro tareas de fluidez verbal (estudio cinco), mientras estaban con y sin los efectos de la medicacion dopaminergica.Los resultados encontrados han sido publicados en cinco articulos y pueden resumirse de la siguiente manera:En el primer articulo (Rodriguez-Ferreiro, Cuetos, Herrera, Menendez & Ribacoba, 2010) se encontro que la muestra con EP sin demencia presentaba dificultades en tareas que evaluaban funciones ejecutivas, atencion, orientacion temporal, memoria inmediata, fluidez semantica, denominacion de personajes famosos y denominacion de acciones. En el segundo articulo (Herrera, Cuetos & Rodriguez-Ferreiro, 2011), encontramos diferencias significativas en la fluidez semantica, la fluidez de acciones, la denominacion de acciones, la denominacion de personajes famosos, la atencion y el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. Los analisis de regresion mostraron que la tarea de reconocimiento de expresiones era la que mejor diferenciaba entre el grupo de EP y el grupo control. Ademas la distribucion de este deficit era similar tanto para los pacientes con DCL como para los pacientes con funciones cognitivas normales. Centrandonos en las alteraciones del lenguaje, en el tercer articulo (Herrera, Rodriguez-Ferreiro & Cuetos, 2012) se observo que los pacientes cometen mas errores a la hora de denominar dibujos que tienen un alto contenido motor en comparacion con aquellos de bajo contenido motor, mientras que los controles tenian un rendimiento similar en ambas categorias. Los resultados del cuarto articulo con pacientes con y sin medicacion (Herrera & Cuetos, 2012), mostraron que mientras en los pacientes con medicacion, los tiempos de reaccion (TR) eran similares para ambos tipos de dibujos, en los EP off, los TR eran significativamente mas lentos para los dibujos con un alto contenido motor. Por ultimo, los resultados obtenidos en el quinto estudio (Herrera, Cuetos & Ribacoba, 2012) muestran que los pacientes off medicacion generan significativamente menos palabras en las tareas que dependen de las zonas frontales (fluidez fonologica y de acciones). Y lo mas interesante es que en el caso de la fluidez de acciones, los pacientes off medicacion generaron verbos significativamente mas frecuentes que en on o que los generados por el grupo control.Los resultados sugieren que es posible encontrar deficits cognitivos en pacientes con EP sin demencia o quejas subjetivas de deterioro en los estadios iniciales de la enfermedad. Ademas estas dificultades no solo se relacionan con las tareas ejecutivas, sino que tambien aparecen problemas semanticos. Aparte de los deficits cognitivos, es posible encontrar problemas relacionados con el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales, independientes a la presencia de DCL.En cuanto a los trastornos linguisticos, los EP muestran un deficit especifico en el procesamiento de los verbos evaluado tanto con tareas de denominacion de acciones como de fluidez verbal. En el caso de la denominacion de acciones, el deficit parece tener un origen semantico, pues las dificultades aumentan al denominar acciones con mayor contenido motor que es mas acusado en los pacientes en los que el trastorno motor es mas severo (cuando estan sin medicacion). Estos datos sugieren que las mismas areas encargadas de planificar y ejecutar los movimientos estan implicadas, al menos en parte, en el procesamiento de los verbos de accion. Ademas la dopamina tambien parece jugar un papel importante en la activacion del sistema lexico-semantico de los verbos, pues cuando los pacientes se encuentran sin los efectos de la medicacion, solo pueden acceder a aquellos verbos que tienen mayor frecuencia lexica y por tanto estan mas accesibles.En definitiva, los resultados presentados muestran que los pacientes con EP sin demencia, presentan deficits cognitivos, de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales y dificultades relacionadas con el procesamiento de los verbos.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder described as excessive sleepiness with abnormal sleep pattern characterized by uncontrollable rapid eye movement (REM) attacks, in which the preceding non-REM stage is absent. These attacks can occur at any time of the day and can be accompanied by a loss of muscle tone. A plethora of data indicates that narcolepsy is caused by a lack of orexin, an important neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of the sleep cycle. Normal levels of orexin are needed for the correct function of different processes in the body, including feeding, cardiovascular regulation, emotions, and locomotion. The pathogenesis of narcolepsy has been debated for many years. It has been suggested that genetic, autoimmune, or infectious processes may be involved. An important aspect in the etiology of narcolepsy is some reports demonstrating a correlation between its onset and infections or H1N1 vaccination.",

      "title": "Non‐motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Although still considered a paradigmatic movement disorder, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a broad spectrum of non‐motor symptoms. These include disorders of mood and affect with apathy, anhedonia and depression, cognitive dysfunction and hallucinosis, as well as complex behavioural disorders. Sensory dysfunction with hyposmia or pain is almost universal, as are disturbances of sleep–wake cycle regulation. Autonomic dysfunction including orthostatic hypotension, urogenital dysfunction and constipation is also present to some degree in a majority of patients. Whilst overall non‐motor symptoms become increasingly prevalent with advancing disease, many of them can also antedate the first occurrence of motor signs – most notably depression, hyposmia or rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). Although exact clinicopathological correlations for most of these non‐motor features are still poorly understood, the occurrence of constipation, RBD or hyposmia prior to the onset of clinically overt motor dysfunction would appear consistent with the ascending hypothesis of PD pathology proposed by Braak and colleagues. Screening these early non‐motor features might, therefore, be one approach towards early ‘preclinical’ diagnosis of PD. This review article provides an overview of the clinical spectrum of non‐motor symptoms in PD together with a brief review of treatment options.",

Respiratory dysfunction in sleep is common in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurring at a significantly higher rate than in the general population. Regulation of sleep is mediated by opposing actions of the anterior and posterior/lateral regions of the hypothalamus. Insomnia is characterized as difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, awakening in morning, or non-restorative sleep. The negative effects of shift work include sleepiness and insomnia, reduced alertness, and greater risk of re-injury, overall poor health, low work productivity, and poor quality of life. The sleep diary has been used in the TBI population for assessing sleep quality and quantity, and for identifying factors that may affect sleep and wakefulness. Sleep in TBI represents something of a challenge to investigate because of the broad array of possible diagnoses for the manifested problems.",

Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, and wake bouts during light and dark phases were measured with electroencephalography and electromyography at an early as well as chronic time points after LFP. Moderate TBI caused disturbances in the ability to maintain consolidated wake bouts during the active phase and chronic loss of wakefulness.

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

      "title": "Is ‘Poor Sleep’ Too Vague a Concept for Rational Treatment?",
      "abstract": "Poor sleep is a common complaint, accounting for 4-5% of all general practitioner consultations. Disorders of initiating sleep are overrated by patients compared with disorders of maintaining sleep, despite the greater effect of the latter on daytime performance. There is frequently a discrepancy between subjective observations and objective measurements of sleep. General practitioners should pay attention to sleep disorders lasting more than three weeks and should bear in mind that poor sleep is a symptom, the underlying cause of which needs to be determined. Good coordination of endogenous biorhythms and external life and working circumstances can positively influence sleeping patterns. Sleep onset latency determines the amount of deep sleep and, thus, the duration and stability of core sleep. General practitioners usually prescribe a single type of benzodiazepine drug with a half-life of 5-10 h for sleep disorders. Such drugs cause the patient to fall asleep quickly, to have a considerable period of uninterrupted sleep with little waking and to wake in the morning with a subjective feeling of having slept well. A number of less desirable changes can occur, however, that may produce, for example, anxiety dreams, increased snoring and sleep apnoea periods at night, and weakness of muscles during the day. The third generation of hypnotic agents produce less undesirable changes than the second generation. Zolpidem (an imidazoypridine), one such agent, seems to provide an effective treatment for insomnia without inducing undesirable side-effects.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy and sleep are intimately linked; patients with epilepsy frequently present sleep disorders and alterations in sleep quality and architecture. This, in turn, leads to greater prevalence of psychiatric and cognitive comorbidities and poorer quality of life. Sleep is a physiological process regulated by the circadian rhythm. The sleep–wake cycle occurs as a result of the reciprocal activity of numerous regions and circuits in the brain, via neuromediators. The different stages of sleep also influence the propagation of interictal epileptiform discharges and epileptic seizures. Non-rapid eye movement sleep facilitates their propagation, whereas rapid eye movement sleep suppresses it. This connection is made even more evident by the existence of epileptic syndromes that occur only or mainly during specific stages of the sleep–wake cycle. Antiepileptic drugs also influence this cycle. Better sleep quality may have positive effects on seizure control, and vice versa. New therapeutic targets involve the sleep–wake cycle, with orexin receptor antagonists having been proposed as a potential antiepileptic treatment. However, more research and controlled clinical trials are needed to corroborate these findings. La epilepsia y el sueño están íntimamente relacionados y los pacientes con epilepsia (PCE) presentan con frecuencia trastornos de sueño, alteraciones en la calidad de sueño y de su arquitectura. Todo ello conlleva una mayor prevalencia de comorbilidades psiquiátricas, cognitivas y una peor calidad de vida. El sueño es un proceso fisiológico regulado por el ritmo circadiano. El ciclo sueño/vigilia tiene lugar mediante la actividad recíproca de diversas regiones y circuitos cerebrales a través de neuromediadores. Por otro lado, las distintas fases del sueño influyen en la propagación de descargas epileptiformes intercríticas (DEI) y de crisis epilépticas (CE). El sueño NREM facilita su propagación y el sueño REM la dificulta. Esta conexión se hace todavía más evidente debido a que hay síndromes epilépticos que ocurren sólo o principalmente durante determinadas fases del ciclo sueño/vigilia. Los diferentes tratamientos empleados en epilepsia también influyen en el sueño. Es posible que una mejora en la calidad de sueño tenga repercusiones positivas en el control de las crisis epilépticas y viceversa. se han explorado nuevas dianas terapéuticas implicadas en el ciclo sueño/vigilia proponiendo los antagonistas de la de orexina como potenciales agentes antiepilépticos.

The treatment of sleep disorders caused by co-morbid conditions is discussed under seven categories, including the use of general measures (e.g., sleep hygiene, encouraging patients to develop good sleep habits, medication), treatment of the co-morbid condition, treatment of insomnia, treatment of excessive daytime somnolence, treatment of parasomnias, treatment of sleep-wake schedule disorders, and treatment of secondary or symptomatic restless legs syndrome.",

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

      "title": "[Psychiatric manifestations of autoimmune diseases--diagnostic and therapeutic problems].",
      "abstract": "In autoimmune diseases, also called connective tissue diseases, many systems and organs are involved, including the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system. The frequency of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations varies in certain autoimmune diseases. One of the most common causes of these symptoms are vascular pathologies, including inflammatory and thrombotic, immunologic and atherosclerotic changes. Neuropsychiatric complications may present as a single symptom or might form a syndrome. In a particular patient, a syndrome might change its form in time, presenting itself as a different syndrome. Quite a lot of these symptoms are not a result of a disease itself but its treatment, metabolic abnormalities, arterial hypertension or infection. Steroids play a particular role in the induction of these complications. The role of increasingly used biological agents is uncertain. The most frequent psychiatric manifestations of the connective tissue diseases are: benign behavioural changes, emotional instability and sleep impairment. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are most frequently seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (up to 80% of these patients), particularly with the co-existent antiphospholipidsyndrome. Psychoses with or without seizures are included in the diagnostic criteria of the disease. A separate clinical problem is an induction of a synthesis of autoantiobodies by some drugs, including psychiatric drugs. These antibodies induce clinical symptoms of an autoimmune disease only in some patients, most frequently the symptoms of lupus erythematous, co called: drug induced lupus, including arthralgia, myalgia, fever, skin lesions and serositis. The diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric complications of autoimmune diseases is quite complicated. It is extremely important to distinguish whether a particular symptom is primary to the disease itself or secondary to its treatment. The most important recommendations are treatment of the underlying disease, its exacerbations and chronic phase, and prevention and treatment of vascular problems.",

Sleep plays a pivotal role in one's long-term health but various disorders may limit or prevent high-quality sleep for children and adults. One of these common disorder groups is parasomnias. As there is still much to learn in medicine when it comes to parasomnias and their treatments, it is of utmost importance to understand the processes behind the occurrence of parasomnias and their associated conditions. This review breaks down the most common parasomnias, categorizing them based on the onset of disease during rapid eye movement (REM) or non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages. This includes somnambulism (sleepwalking), confusional arousals, night terrors, REM behavior disorder (RBD), nightmare disorder, and others. It highlights the characteristics of diagnosis for these individual disorders and attempts to evaluate them through an etiological, epidemiological, and pathophysiological lens. This review also presents the current pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for these disorders.",

      "abstract": "The worldwide prevalence of sleep disorders is approximately 50%, with an even higher occurrence in a psychiatric population. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental illness characterized by shifts in mood and activity. The BD syndrome also involves heterogeneous symptomatology, including cognitive dysfunctions and impairments of the autonomic nervous system. Sleep abnormalities are frequently associated with BD and are often a good predictor of a mood swing. Preservation of stable sleep-wake cycles is therefore a key to the maintenance of stability in BD, indicating the crucial role of circadian rhythms in this syndrome. The symptom most widespread in BD is insomnia, followed by excessive daytime sleepiness, nightmares, difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, poor sleep quality, sleep talking, sleep walking, and obstructive sleep apnea. Alterations in the structure or duration of sleep are reported in all phases of BD. Understanding the role of neuroglia in BD and in various aspects of sleep is in nascent state. Contributions of the different types of glial cells to BD and sleep abnormalities are discussed in this paper.",

Based on shared neurobiological mechanisms, a bidirectional link exists between sleep disturbances and depressive disorders. Presence of sleep disturbance is not only associated with increased depression severity but also portends a poorer prognosis with increased suicide risk in patients with depressive disorders. Polysomnographic findings such as reduced slow-wave sleep, decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency and increased REM density are associated with major depression. Comorbid primary sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and circadian rhythm disorders not only increase the risk but also complicate the treatment of major depression. It is imperative to comprehensively assess and treat sleep disturbances, either due to depression or due to co-existing primary sleep disorders, to optimize remission, prevent relapse, and reduce the risk of suicide in patients with depressive disorders. Medications, chronotherapies, and behavioral approaches alone or in combination may prove to be effective in treating sleep disturbances associated with depressive disorders; however, more research is warranted in this area to determine the optimal management strategies. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, a promising treatment for management of insomnia comorbid with major depression, needs wider implementation and more research to establish its efficacy in preventing suicide.",

      "abstract": "In this comment, we explored the link between sleep fragmentation and the cardiovascular risk, considering various sleep disorders and methodologies for assessing sleep fragmentation.It is generally known that sleep deprivation increases the cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic risk.Additionally, some data indicates that prolonged sleep is also associated with such risk. 1 In addition to sleep duration, sleep quality is also essential in the assessment of the CV risk.The continuity of sleep is one of its crucial features that contributes to effective rest and refreshment.Sleep may be interrupted by arousals and awakenings, which can result in prolonged wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO).Therefore, it is important to deter mine the threshold for the number of arousals and awakenings during sleep to consider them a normal phenomenon.According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) definition, an arousal is an abrupt shift in electro encephalography (EEG) frequencies, including alpha, theta and/or frequencies greater than 16 Hz (but not spindles), that lasts at least 3 s, with at least 10 s of stable sleep preceding the change. 2The scoring of arousals during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep requires a concurrent increase in the submental electro myography (EMG) lasting at least 1 s. 2 Arousals, which can be accompanied by respiratory events, periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) or sleep brux ism events, are usually followed by autonomic activation, resulting in increased heart rate and blood pressure.Nevertheless, they can also occur spontaneously or be elicited by pain, light, noise, or a change in temperature.The arousal index (ArI), counted as the number of arousals per sleep hour, is frequently considered to quantify sleep fragmentation. 3 Sleep fragmentation, character ized by repetitive interruptions of sleep, is one of the factors contributing to excessive daytime sleepiness.The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is generally considered an imperfect in dicator of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity.It is strongly believed that oxygen saturation parameters (i.e., the mean oxygen saturation, the oxygen desaturation index (ODI), the nadir oxygen saturation, and the percentage of sleep with oxygen saturation <90%) are more effective predictors of CV complications than the index of respiratory events. 4It is worth noting that",

En outre, 40 patients atteints de MP ayant recu un diagnostic clinique de maladie inflammatoire chronique et 40 patients atteints de MP sans maladie inflammatoire chronique, apparies par sexe et âge, ont subi une videopolysomnographie (v-PSG) afin de determiner la frequence de la DBR. L'apathie a ete evaluee chez 36 patients ayant subi une v-PSG (n=18 patients atteints de MP avec DCI, n=18 patients atteints de la MP), et sa relation avec la depression, avec un large eventail de fonctions neuropsychologiques ainsi qu'avec des symptomes moteurs et non moteurs a ete evaluee. Resultats : la DBR probable a ete associee a un risque de 2,6 de developper des symptomes de CIM dans l'ensemble (p=0,001) et a un risque de 4,9 pour le jeu pathologique (p= 0,049). La RBD confirmee par le VPSG a ete trouvee chez 34/40 (85%) des patients atteints de PD-ICD contre 21/40 (53%) des patients atteints de PD-noICD (p=0,003). L'association etait significative apres ajustement de la duree de la maladie, de l'âge d'apparition, de la gravite et de la dose de traitement (p=0,01) et l'etat de la CIM est associe a un rapport impair de 5,44 pour avoir une DBR. L'apathie etait plus elevee chez les patients atteints de DBR que chez les patients atteints de la MP sans DBR. Apres 11 ajustements en fonction de l'âge, de la duree de la DP, des doses de DRT, des mesures cognitives et de la depression, nous avons constate que les PD-RBD presentent un manque d'initiative (p=0,03) ainsi qu'une tendance a la reduction des interets et a la recherche de nouveaute. L'ampleur de l'effet etait importante (>0,8) ou presque (>0,75) pour ces variables. De plus, l'apathie etait significativement correlee a la mesure du sommeil paradoxal sans atonie. Conclusions : Nous avons montre pour la premiere fois que le RBD est associe a des DCI dans le DP. De plus, les patients RBD sans DAI sont plus apathiques que les patients sans RBD. Un traitement dysfonctionnel de la recompense dans le DP-RBD, resultant peut-etre d'une alteration plus grave de la voie meso-cortico-limbique, peut contribuer a la fois a une apathie accrue et a une frequence accrue des DAI lorsqu'ils sont traites avec des doses plus elevees de DRT.",

      "title": "Melatonin: helping to MEND impaired sleep",
      "abstract": "Many neurodevelopmental disorders adversely affect sleep; children often have difficulty in falling asleep, wake up more often during the night, and sleep less than their typically developing peers. ‘Sleep problems’ were found in 53% of over 300 children with autism, compared with 44% of 63 children with delayed development, and 32% of 163 children with normal (typical) development.1 Sleep problems arise from complex interactions between biological, psychological, social, family and cultural factors. Circadian sleep rhythm disorders (CSRD) may be acute but are more often chronic, and frequently result in associated health problems. CSRDs usually exacerbate any pre-existing learning and behavioural difficulties, and may affect the entire family's whole health and well-being and impair their ability to continue in employment or further education.\n\nThere is considerable pressure for both parents and paediatricians to try and improve a child's disturbed sleep. Management options include behavioural, or pharmacological, or both. Behavioural interventions are probably undervalued, but may be difficult to implement, and may take weeks or months to show any benefit. Conventional medications including hypnotics and sedatives are frequently associated with unacceptable day-time sedation that may adversely affect the child's quality of life. The past 20 years have witnessed the introduction of melatonin which continues to be increasingly prescribed to many children both with and without neurodevelopmental disorders and using a wide range of doses. To many, it is the ubiquitous safe solution to any ‘sleep problem’. The popularity of melatonin reflects the …",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Autonome Störungen sind insbesondere bei neurologischen, internistischen, urologischen und pädiatrischen Patienten häufig. Erkrankungen des autonomen Nervensystems können im peripheren oder zentralen Nervensystem primär (z. B. Primär autonomes Versagen) oder sekundär im Rahmen einer systemischen Erkrankung (z. B. Diabetes mellitus, Morbus Parkinson) entstehen. Die häufigsten autonomen Störungen sind Kreislaufregulationsstörungen und stehen oft im Mittelpunkt der Diagnostik. Diese betreffen primär oder in ihren Auswirkungen fast alle medizinischen Disziplinen. Im neurologischen Krankheitsspektrum stehen insbesondere die Parkinsonsyndrome, die Multisystematrophie und die Small fibre Neuropathien im Focus der Aufmerksamkeit hinsichtlich der Veränderungen der Kreislaufregulation mit orthostatischer Hypotonie oder dem zusätzlichen Vorkommen einer Liegendhypertonie. Sorgfältige Anamnese und apparative Diagnostik sind neben der klinischen Untersuchung unabdingbar. Die weiterführende Diagnostik umfasst neben bedside tests wie den Schellong-Test verschiedene standardisierte Untersuchungsmethoden im autonomen Funktionslabor wie die Kipptischuntersuchung oder die Analyse der Herzfrequenzvariabilität. Die hohe Variabilität des autonomen Nervensystems aber auch der angewandten diagnostischen Methoden und Messplätze macht eine Standardisierung dieser Techniken notwendig. Hierfür stellen Leitlinien, Konsensusempfehlungen, SOPs usw. eine besondere Hilfe dar. In der Therapie werden bei hypotonen Kreislaufregulationsstörungen neben physikalischen Maßnahmen verschiedene Pharmaka erfolgreich eingesetzt, die jedoch nur unzureichend erstattungsfähig sind.",

      "title": "A Parasomnia Overlap Disorder Involving Sleepwalking, Sleep Terrors, and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder in 33 Polysomnographically Confirmed Cases",
      "abstract": "A series of 33 patients with combined (injurious) sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (viz. \"parasomnia overlap disorder\") was gathered over an 8-year period. Patients underwent clinical and polysomnographic evaluations. Mean age was 34 +/- 14 (SD) years; mean age of parasomnia onset was 15 +/- 16 years (range 1-66); 70% (n = 23) were males. An idiopathic subgroup (n = 22) had a significantly earlier mean age of parasomnia onset (9 +/- 7 years) than a symptomatic subgroup (n = 11) (27 +/- 23 years, p = 0.002), whose parasomnia began with either of the following: neurologic disorders, n = 6 [congenital Mobius syndrome, narcolepsy, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor (and treatment), brain trauma, indeterminate disorder (exaggerated startle response/atypical cataplexy)]; nocturnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, n = 1; posttraumatic stress disorder/major depression, n = 1; chronic ethanol/amphetamine abuse and withdrawal, n = 1; or mixed disorders (schizophrenia, brain trauma, substance abuse), n = 2. The rate of DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised) Axis 1 psychiatric disorders was not elevated; group scores on various psychometric tests were not elevated. Forty-five percent (n = 15) had previously received psychologic or psychiatric therapy for their parasomnia, without benefit. Treatment outcome was available for n = 20 patients; 90% (n = 18) had substantial parasomnia control with bedtime clonazepam (n = 13), alprazolam and/or carbamazepine (n = 4), or self-hypnosis (n = 1). Thus, \"parasomnia overlap disorder\" is a treatable condition that emerges in various clinical settings and can be understood within the context of current knowledge on parasomnias and motor control/dyscontrol during sleep.",

Neuropsychological assessments revealed deficits on visual processing tasks. Neuroimaging, electroencephalography and ophthalmological evaluation revealed no abnormalities. The multimodal sensory distortions responded to antipsychotic treatment, paralleling improvement in other schizophrenia psychopathology, over a period of one month.Prominent and persistent multimodal sensory distortions like metamorphopsia and paracousis in the presence of psychotic symptoms warrant a detailed neurological and general medical work-up. These symptoms presenting in the absence of neurological or substance use disorders may be a component of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Position Paper on Patient Sleep During Hospitalization",
      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

Such associated sleep disorders are commonly observed as REM sleep behavior disorder, insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, excessive daytime sleepiness, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements. Melatonin has a wide range of regulatory effects, such as synchronizing circadian rhythm, and is expected to be a potential new circadian treatment of sleep disorders in PD patients. In fact, ongoing clinical trials with melatonin in PD highlight melatonin’s therapeutic effects in this disease. Mechanistically, melatonin plays its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-excitotoxity, anti-synaptic dysfunction and anti-apoptotic activities. In addition, melatonin attenuates the effects of genetic variation in the clock genes of Baml1 and Per1 to restore the circadian rhythm. Together, melatonin exerts various therapeutic effects in PD but their specific mechanisms require further investigations.",

      "abstract": "The main characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are airflow limitation, chronic intermittent hypoxia, or apnea, which may lead to tissue hypoperfusion and recurrent arousal from sleep.These episodes of hypoxia or apnea can lead to tissue inflammation and are causal factors of disturbed sleep in both men and women.Several lines of evidence suggest that sleep patterns differ along the lifespan in both male and female subjects, and this may result from the influence of female gonadotropic hormones on sleep.Compared with men, women have more sleep complaints, as women's sleep is not only influenced by gonadotropins, but also by conditions related to these hormones, such as pregnancy.It is therefore, not surprising that sleep disturbances are seen during menopause too.Factors that may play a role in this type of SDB in women include vasomotor symptoms, changing reproductive hormone levels, circadian rhythm abnormalities, mood disorders, coexistent medical conditions, and lifestyle factors.",

      "title": "Vegetative State from the Perspective of Islamic Law",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The death of the cerebral cortex is a particular type of brain death that occurs after the destruction of the cerebral cortex (the hemispheres of the brain). It is said that the individual has gone through a vegetative state. This cortex is responsible for controlling voluntary activities of the body. This condition is caused by a coma (anesthesia), and sometimes the individual remains in this state for several years. Although the person looks awake, his/her eyes are open and has some involuntary movements, there is no signs of mental and cognitive function. Moreover, the individual is physically in a state of dementia. Coma is a state in which a person cannot be awakened and does not respond to any stimulation including pain. Generally it lasts few days to a few weeks, after which some patients gradually recover, but some permanently lose all brain function (brain death), while others evolve to a vegetative state (VS). Patients in VS are unconscious and unaware of their surroundings, but they continue to have a sleep-wake cycle and can have periods of consciousness. They are able to breathe spontaneously, retain their gag, cough, sucking, and swallowing reflexes. They often look fairly “normal” to families and friends who hope and pray for their full recovery. Laws and regulations in Islamic countries originate from popular jurisprudence. Therefore, by arguing that the well-known principles of Islam are necessarily legitimate, the phenomenon of vegetative state has been recognized. Jurisprudents have conflicting opinions on brain deaths and these perspectives cannot be considered as a widespread legal basis at the level of macro policy for administrative, medical and judicial affairs. In criminal law, maniac has no criminal responsibility because the punishment is not in line with the purpose of punishment. Consequently, restrictions will be imposed on the patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that a person with vegetative state is compatible with the insanity.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Neuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State",
      "abstract": "Consciousness is a multifaceted concept that has two dimensions: arousal, or wakefulness (i.e., level of consciousness), and awareness (i.e., content of consciousness) (Laureys et al., 2004).An accurate and reliable assessment of the arousal and awareness of consciousness in patients with severe brain damage is of greatest importance for the differential diagnosis of low levels consciousness patients and for outcome evaluation.Following coma, some patients permanently lose all brainstem function (brain death), some progress to \"wakeful unawareness\" (vegetative state -VS), whereas others recover typically and progress through different stages before fully or partly recovering consciousness (minimally conscious state -MCS).Patients in VS can open their eyes and exhibit basic orienting responses, but show no conscious, purposeful activity.Reflex and other movements are seen, mediated by brainstem, spinal cord, and brainstem-diencephalic arousal systems (Laureys et al., 2004).VS can occur after patients emerge from an acute catastrophic brain insult causing coma, or can also be seen in degenerative or congenital nervous system disorders.The two common findings are necrosis of the cerebral cortex, thalamus and brainstem (usually after anoxic injury) and diffuse axonal injury (usually after trauma), although other pathological findings can be seen in degenerative and other disorders (Laureys, 2008).The MCS patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for coma or VS because they demonstrate some inconsistent but clear evidence of consciousness (Laureys et al., 2008;Giacino et al., 2002).In the MCS, there is variable impaired function of the cerebral cortex, diencephalons and upper brainstem.This allows occasional conscious behaviours to occur, unlike in VS or coma.Patients may enter the MCS as they emerge from coma or VS, or they can become minimally conscious as a result of acute injury or chronic degenerative diseases.Recent studies suggest a number of potential clinical and rehabilitative applications of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques.Although bedside clinical examination remains the criterion standard for establishing diagnosis, MR may provide an adjunctive diagnostic role when behavioural findings are very limited or ambiguous.The future of diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) envisions a battery of neurobehavioral and neuroimaging techniques (such as structural and functional MR imaging (MRI and www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging -Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience 182 fMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), fiber tracking, positron emission tomography (PET)) that serve as complementary clinical tools that may help differentiate the effects of underarousal, sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, and cognitive disturbance in the search for potential causes of behavioural unresponsiveness. Magnetic Resonance and Magnetization Transfer ImagingThe morphological MRI acquisitions usually include non-contrast-enhanced sagittal T1, axial diffusion, axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial T2-SE, coronal T2 sequences and a 3D T1-weighted volume acquisition.FLAIR and T2-SE sequences permit to detect brain edema, contusion, hematoma, herniation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus.T2 sequences are useful in detecting hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injuries (DAI).The total number of lesions detected by FLAIR and T2 are shown to be inversely correlated with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of traumatic coma patients; while the 3D T1 sequence provides an opportunity to evaluate the brain atrophy during the follow up of these patients.A lot of studies performed on traumatic coma patients with conventional MRI showed that lesions of the pons, midbrain, and basal ganglia were predictive of poor outcome especially when they are bilateral.Despite their encouraging results, these studies fail to explain why some patients in VS or with long-term marked cognitive impairments have no or minimal lesions on conventional MRI examination.This raises the question of the lack of specificity and insufficient sensitivity of conventional MR sequences which fail to reveal lesions such as ischemic axonal injuries.Therefore, it is clear that morphological and conventional MRI alone cannot be considered as a reliable tool to assess consciousness disorders severity or to predict their evolution and outcome (Tshibanda et al., 2009).Several studies investigated patients in VS and in MCS using non-conventional, quantitative and volumetric MR techniques, useful to provide information about the anatomical patterns, the prognosis and the outcome of these patients.Ammermann et al. (2007) have used volumetric analysis of MRI to determine the pattern of lesions in 12 patients with a severe neurological impairment after acute ischemic injury.At the time of scanning, the patients were either in VS or in an early remising state, that is MCS.Lesions were classified as having been present in the gray and/or white matter in four different brain regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital).An additional separate evaluation was performed for the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem.The total clinical follow-up period of all patients from the time of the causative event lasted for at least 5 months.The clinical outcomes were reported according to the Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale (RLACS) as a universal guide to assess a patient's level of functioning.The final RLACS levels were correlated to the MRI lesion size with a Spearman correlation.All patients demonstrated extensive white matter lesions, with the largest lesions observed in the frontal and occipital lobe.A preferential involvement of the white matter located in the periventricular area and in the subcortical regions below the motor and internal temporal cortices was found, in addition to the classifically described lesions of the striatum, motor and occipital cortices.Lesion magnitude showed an association with the severity of the outcome as quantitatively assessed by RLACS.With respect to gray matter lesions, the vulnerability pattern observed included frontal and occipital and in some cases parietal cortical areas, moreover in most cases the thalamus.Additionally, almost all of patients showed lesions of the hippocampus or lesions to the basal ganglia.An association between the extent of the MRI defined lesions located within the white matter and the clinical www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State 183 outcomes of the patients was found.All patients in the most unfavorable class III clinical outcome group (i.e.persistent VS) exhibited white matter lesions exceeding 2/3 of the volume of at least one lobe, most frequently the occipital lobe.Moreover, Juengling et al. ( 2005) investigated 5 patients in persistent VS due to prolonged cerebral hypoxia of non-traumatic origin, using combined Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) of 3D MRI and FDG-PET analysis.In the analysis of the regional distribution of gray matter atrophy, VBM revealed multiple areas of significantly decreased gray matter density at p<.001, corrected for multiple comparisons.Those were localized in multiple cortical areas, in particular including inferior parietal lobe, superior and medial frontal lobe, paracentral lobule, superior and medial temporal lobe, the cingulum, and the fusiform gyrus.Thalamic changes were limited to small voxel clusters in dorso-medial areas.These structural atrophic changes were compared with the local distribution of functional loss as assessed by regional hypometabolism in the FDG-PET group analysis.At the threshold pb0.001 (corrected for multiple comparisons), PET showed a widespread pattern of hypometabolic areas.In particular, the parietal and frontotemporal cortices, the cuneus/precuneus, the cingulum, the frontal medial and precentral gyrus, and the transverse temporal gyrus were involved, additionally the bilateral thalamus (mainly dorsomedial subnucleus).All changes were, similar to the VBM results, nearly symmetrical.Improved understanding of this complex lesion pattern gained by in vivo group analyses like here might help to provide deeper insights into the general pathoanatomy of patients in the persistent VS.Using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and a novel approach to shape analysis applied SIENAX software, Fernandez-Espejo et al. ( 2010) investigated thalamic global and regional changes in a sample of patients in a VS or an MCS.They found that total thalamic volume was significantly lower in patients than in healthy volunteers.Shape analysis revealed significant bilateral regional atrophy in the dorso-medial body in patients compared to controls; this atrophy was more widespread in VS than in MCS patients.Lower thalamic volume was significantly correlated with worsening of Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores.Shape analysis suggested that the dorso-medial nucleus and the internal medullar lamina were the main regions responsible for this correlation.These findings suggest that MCS and VS patients present different patterns of regional thalamic abnormalities.In particular, VS patients showed a more widespread pattern of atrophy than controls, producing differences in global thalamic volume.MCS patients did not show volumetric differences compared to controls, and regionally they showed a less pronounced inward collapse in both the dorsal and ventral areas, with the anterior-ventral body significantly spared.Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that thalamic damage is less common in MCS than in VS patients (Jennett et al., 2001).Another quantitative RM technique is the Magnetization Transfer Imaging (MTI).The MTI relies on the principle that protons bound in structures exhibit T1 relaxation coupling with protons in the aqueous phase.When an off-resonance saturation pulse is applied, it selectively saturates those protons that are bound in macromolecules.These protons subsequently exchange longitudinal magnetization with free water protons, leading to a reduction in the detected signal intensity (Sinson et al., 2001).The MTI may provide a quantitative index of the structural integrity of tissue and might be useful to study the outcome of patients with low levels of consciousness.However, further studies, on larger groups of patients, need to be performed to confirm the usefulness of quantitative MRI in the assessment of the eventual neurological prognosis and outcome of these challenging patients.",

      "abstract": "In humans, the period for optimal mental and physical performance is found during the light period of the day whereas the dark period provides optimal regenerational capacities.A variety of biological parameters follow a circadian rhythm of approximately 24 h according to the earth's rotational period. Other parameters exclusively underlie the ultradian influence of state, i.e.wake state vs. sleep state, or the rhythmic sleep process with cyclically returning stages of NREM 1-4 sleep and REM sleep. Long-term blood pressure and ECG recordings show a circadian pattern of blood pressure and heart rate. At night, blood pressure physiologically decreases by 10-15% which is referred to as dipping. Non-dipping is prognostically adversarial. In addition, the mean heart rate drops at night. Blood pressure and heart rate are modulated according to the sleep stages. At the transition from wake to sleep, blood pressure and heart rate decrease in trend reaching the lowest values during deep sleep. During REM sleep, blood pressure and heart rate exhibit pronounced changes, thereby generating a nightly recurring stress test for the cardiovascular system. Circadian and ultradian rhythms influence endocrine parameters as well as hydromineral balance and renal function. Cortisol secretion exhibits a characteristic circadian rhythm pattern. Adversely, renin secretion for example is strongly related to sleep stage control.",

Two boys had episodes of abnormal behavior in hypnagogic-and occasionally hypnopompic-periods for 1 year from the time they were 1 year and several months old. The episodes consisted of irregular body movements, which could be either gentle or violent but never made the children get out of bed. They lasted from a few seconds to 2 hours and were associated with poor reactivity and amnesia of the events. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed wake-state features, with brief bursts of hypnagogic hypersynchrony, and did not display seizure activity. A distinctive behavior disorder occurring during wake-sleep transitions with a wake EEG pattern has been identified in very early childhood.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’ s disease (PD) is the functional model of hypokinetic extrapyramidal disorders. It is characterized by a massive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (pars compacta) as well as by other neurochemical and anatomical changes. Tremor, akinesia, and rigidity, as well as bradykinesia are the cardinal signs of limb and gait disorders in PD. Limb and posture perturbations may also be associated with specific speech motor and linguistic disorders. The physiological processes associated with the various stages in the motor realization of speech are complex, and the planning, initiation, and execution of motor speech acts require the activation of different, hierarchically organized, neural substrates (e.g., see ref. 2 for a detailed presentation). Speech production is a motor activity and requires the integration and coordination of precise movements of articulators, muscles, and mechanisms (diaphragm, abdomen, thoracic cage, larynx, tongue, lips, lower jaw).",

The large number of parasomnias underscore that sleep is not simply a quiescent state, but can involve complex episodes of movement, ranging from subtle to dramatic and complex. Clinicians should be aware that many pediatric parasomnias are benign, self-limited, and may not persist into late childhood or adolescence. Importantly, parasomnias in childhood often differ in type from adults. Nevertheless, parasomnias across ages can be classified as: 1) disorders of arousal (from non-rapid eye movement, or NREM, sleep); 2) parasomnias usually associated with REM sleep; and 3) other parasomnias. We detail here issues in the clinical diagosis, evaluation, and management of multiple pediatric parasomnias. The further study of parasomnias in children may help elucidate the multi-factorial etiologies of these fascinating conditions, shedding light on the potential genetic bases as well as environmental contributions.",

Dopamine receptor blockers can often eliminate visual hallucinations whether they are caused by schizophrenia or are drug induced. Anatomic lesions in the temporal-parietal region seem to produce formed hallucinations more frequently than lesions elsewhere (5), yet in most cases ofhallucinations no anatomic site can be found. It seems likely that the mechanism of hallucinatory toxicity with propranolol may be related to complex neurotransmitter-related psychotomimetic effects, although a more exact understanding is not currently available.",

SRRMs mostly occurred in consolidated sleep, in association with pathological respiratory events, predominantly longer ones, especially during stage R sleep, and recovered in 1 patient with continuous positive airway pressure therapy.

CSA usually occur during NREM stage and rarely during REM. CSA is important to recognize because of complications ranging from frequent nighttime awakenings,sleepiness to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We present a 40 year old female patient with rare CSA during REM sleep and dream enactment. Report of Case 40yo African American female with history of loud snoring, witnessed sleep apnea, and daytime fatigue. She reported nightmares, sleep talking, and acting out her dreams without injury. Epworth sleepiness score was 5 /24. Her past medical history is significant for depression and anxiety. She has no history of head trauma, no neurologic or cardiovascular disorders. Her medications include fluoxetine and,quetiapine. She denied substance use, narcotic use, or alcohol use. Her level 1 sleep study showed predominantly REM-associated central sleep apneas which is rare. She also was observed to have loss of REM sleep muscle atonia suggestive of REM Behavior disorder. Her sleep architecture was atypical with decreased N3 sleep stage. REM sleep duration was adequate. She was noted to have loss of REM muscle atonia based on AASM guidelins elevated chin EMG, excessive transient muscle activity, and witnessed movement during REM stage via video monitoring. During the study, she had an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 13.1 per hour of sleep, Central apneas were predominantly noted during REM stage, 10 per hour, comprised of 50% of her respiratory events. The minimum SpO2 value with CSA was 94%. She had normal sinus rhythm. Her sleep was fragmented. A total arousals were 28.4/hour,and 7.9/hour were respiratory arousals, and the rest were spontaneous arousals. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 to 60 %. Her room air arterial blood gas was normal with PaC02 of 37 mmHg. MRI of the brain/brainstem was ordered given her atypical REM sleep. She had no acute intracranial abnormalities. There is a non specific finding of a low lying cerebellar tonsils without evidence of Chiari I malformation. Conclusion Our patient has rare idiopathic central apnea in REM stage and is third case reported. She also has loss of muscle atonia during REM with dream enactment which is also rare in her age group. Injury precaution advised.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review The purpose of this article is to provide a contemporary review of sleep issues affecting patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Recent findings Prodromal symptoms of MSA may occur years prior to diagnosis, including autonomic dysfunction such as orthostatic hypotension, urogenital dysfunction, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and stridor. Patients may also develop sleep-related respiratory disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA), and stridor. The development of stridor is associated with a shortened lifespan and sudden death, which may be further accelerated by autonomic instability. MSA appears to follow a ‘prion-like’ disease progression. Summary MSA is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by a combination of autonomic failure and motor symptoms. MSA is often misdiagnosed as the initial presentation mimics other neurodegenerative disorders. There are diagnostic criteria to identify possible, probable, and definite MSA. Prodromal symptoms may occur years prior to diagnosis, including autonomic dysfunction such as orthostatic hypotension, urogenital dysfunction, REM RBD, and stridor. In previous years, treatment consisted of tracheostomy but did not address the component of CSA, which commonly coexisted or developed later because of destruction of medullary chemoreceptors. Positive airway pressure may be as effective as tracheostomy alone in ameliorating obstruction at the vocal cord level.",

      "title": "Sleep Apnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases affecting the respiratory system are usually present during the day and the night; however, sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a disease manifesting only during sleep. It is defined as a cessation (apnea) or a reduction of breathing (hypopnea) of 10 seconds or more during sleep. Each of these apneas or hypopneas is usually terminated when the person awakens for a few seconds. Typically, patients do not remember these transient awakenings. There are two general categories of apnea: central and obstructive. These categories are classified according to the presence or the absence of respiratory effort. Central sleep apnea is a result of the absence of nerve impulses from the brain to the respiratory muscles and therefore occurs in absence of respiratory effort. Obstructive sleep apnea is much more common. This condition is caused by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway (pharynx) during sleep. Therefore, respiratory efforts are still present during apnea and usually increase throughout the apnea. The individual makes larger and larger respiratory efforts until they arouse from sleep apnea and reopen their upper airway so breathing can resume. As will be discussed, some overlap exists between obstructive and central apnea in both disease presentation (so‐called mixed apnea) and in pathogenesis.",

More severe sleep difficulties have been found to be clearly related to psychiatric illness such as depression and phobias, as well as to addiction. Somnipathies can objectively be identified by means of polygraphy. Overall, polysomnographic measures in patients with affective disorders differ most frequently and significantly from those in normal control subjects. Persistent sleep disturbances are associated with significant risk of both relapse and recurrence in mood disorders and an increased risk of suicide. In addition to changes in sleep architecture, patients with major depression show profoundly altered patterns of nocturnal hormone secretion, possibly through mechanisms that link regulation of sleep with neuroendocrine activity. Basic and clinical approaches of sleep research established neurobiological models into the underlying pathophysiology associated with psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Endogenous circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior are ubiquitous among mammals and are regulated by a master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. These intrinsic circadian rhythms are synchronized by light, melatonin, and social or physical activity to the 24-hour external light and dark cycles. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) occur when there is an alteration of the internal circadian timing mechanisms or a misalignment between the timing of sleep and the 24-hour social and physical environments. CRSDs, such as delayed sleep phase, advanced sleep phase and shift work sleep disorder, are often under-recognized, yet should be considered in the differential of patients presenting with symptoms of insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Because behavioral and environmental factors often are involved in the development and maintenance of these disorders, a multimodal treatment approach that combines behavioral and/or pharmacologic approaches is usually required. In addition to good sleep habits, timed exposure to bright light and melatonin can be used for the treatment of CRSD. Rapid advances in understanding the physiologic, cellular, and molecular basis of circadian rhythm and sleep regulation will likely lead to improved diagnostic tools and treatments for CRSDs.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in Parkinson syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract About 90% of neurodegenerative diseases with parkinsonism are associated with sleep disorders including daytime sleepiness, sleep-related breathing disorders and parasomnias. It is hard to define what ratio of insomnia and daytime hypersomnia is caused by the antiparkinsonian treatment, by the somatic and mental-emotional symptoms of the neurodegenerative disease and by the neurodegenerative brain process itself. Recent research suggests that the latter group is more important than expected. In Parkinson syndromes the structures included in sleep regulation--mainly within the brainstem--are also affected resulting in specific sleep disorders being the primary biological symptoms of these diseases. The recently described parasomnia--REM sleep behavior disorder--has a specific significance in this respect: it may prevent by several years a high ratio of the parkinsonian disorders--especially synucleinopathies--offering the possibility of prevention by identifying the affected individuals. There seems to exist a similar although less clarified association between daytime sleepiness and Parkinson disease. Analysing the behavior of the orexin system in neurodegenerative diseases may help to learn more about this, recently described neurohumoral system and may clear the association of narcolepsy with neurodegeneration. By understanding the associations of parkinsonian disorders and sleep disorders new therapeutical strategies may be invented and may offer new aspects to understand the mechanism of them.",

En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

Individuals on a rotating three-shift or similar system work the night shift at the low phase of circadian rhythm. On retiring to bed in the morning they fall asleep rapidly but are prematurely awakened by their circadian rhythm and exhibit severe sleepiness and reduced performance capacity. In connection with the morning shift the circadian psychophysiology makes it difficult to fall asleep as early as needed during the preceding night. Around 0400 to 0500, when the individuals should rise, they have difficulties awakening because of the sleep loss and the circadian rhythm, which at that point is at its lowest. Subsequently, day work is characterized by sleepiness and reduced performance. It should be emphasized that it does not seem possible to improve one's ability to adjust over time, even with permanent night work. Older age and \"morningness\" personality are related to higher than average problems in adjusting.",

That is, the hypnagogic state could be a kind of reluctance to sleep because sleeping means to meet the failing protective object. Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together. The way the container functions is related to the initial experiences of life with the mother.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "abstract": "inal symptoms at the same intensity as before treatment, entailing a return of the same episode and a new episode of illness, respectively [6, 9] . When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

Restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) was diagnosed and treated. Because of persistent EDS , snoring and nycturia, a nocturnal polysomnography ( PSG ) was performed. PSG showed high sleep fragmentation related to a moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment ( CPAP ) was proposed. Because of the persistence of abnormal nocturnal behaviours, characterized by screaming, punching and falling out of bed, a video‐ PSG with CPAP treatment was performed. The recording showed typical chin electromyography ( EMG ) activity increase associated with violent movements during rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep, suggesting REM sleep behaviour disorders ( RBD ). Clinical neurological examination found no parkinsonian syndrome, no dysautonomic sign and no neurological focal sign. Dopamine transporter imaging [123I‐ FP ‐ CIT single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT )] did not find any presynaptic dopaminergic pathways degeneration. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a vascular lesion suggestive of cavernoma located in the pons. The present case illustrates the complexity of sleep disturbance diagnosis with a possible entanglement of aetiologies responsible for nocturnal agitation, and confirms that an isolated pons cavernoma should be considered among the rare causes of RBD .",

Muedigkeit ist eine subjektive Befindlichkeit. Von ihr ist die Leistungsfaehigkeit betroffen. Ursache der Muedigkeit ist Beanspruchung. Beim Autofahren entsteht psychische Muedigkeit aufgrund kognitiver Prozesse. Einen Unfall als Muedigkeitsunfall klassifizieren zu koennen, ist nur moeglich, wenn der Fahrer zugibt, dass er eingeschlafen ist, und wenn die Rekonstruktion der vorangegangenen Fahrt keine andere Ursache plausibel erscheinen laesst, etwa bei einer hohen Lenkzeitueberschreitung eines Lkw-Fahrers. Eine woechentliche Arbeitszeit ueber 60 Stunden, das Vorliegen einer Schlafstoerung, eine schlechte Schlafqualitaet, ein hoher Anteil an Fahrten zwischen Mitternacht und 6 Uhr, weniger als 5 Stunden Nachtschlaf und Schichtarbeit/Nachtarbeit sind Risikofaktoren fuer Muedigkeitsunfaelle. Mit zunehmendem Alter wird das Fahren weniger sicher. Insbesondere im Hochbetagtenbereich spiegelt sich dies auch in der Unfallstatistik wider. Zumindest bis zum Alter von etwa 70 bis 75 Jahren scheinen altersbedingte Beeintraechtigungen noch erfolgreich durch eine angepasste Fahrweise kompensiert zu werden. Dies ist bei der Begutachtung der Fahreignung mit zu ueberpruefen. Es mangelt derzeit an individualisierten Schulungsprogrammen, mit denen gezielt alterskritische Fahraufgaben trainiert und kompensatorische Strategien vermittelt werden. Es fehlen auch Moeglichkeiten, die Fahrtauglichkeit billig, anonym und ohne Konsequenzen ueberpruefen lassen zu koennen. Ruecksichtsloses Fahren stellt genauso wie kooperatives Fahren ein Interaktionsverhalten im Strassenverkehr dar. Ruecksichtslose Fahrer versuchen, ihren eigenen Vorteil durchzusetzen und verstossen damit gegen Regeln, die ein bestimmtes Verhalten vorschreiben oder verbieten. Auf der Opferseite kommt es zu Behinderungen und Gefaehrdungen, die zu Angst und Aerger fuehren. Beim kooperativen Fahren verzichten Fahrer auf ihr eigenes Recht, um einem anderen Fahrer einen Vorteil zu gewaehren. Fuer ruecksichtsloses und kooperatives Verhalten werden unterschiedliche Faktoren und Ursachen benannt. Es wird nach soziodemographischen Merkmalen und Persoenlichkeitscharakteristika von auffaelligen Fahrern gesucht, andere Autoren machen allgemeine soziale und gesellschaftliche Einfluesse verantwortlich und wieder andere sehen ruecksichtloses Fahren als Folge der Kommunikationsbedingungen im Strassenverkehr. Sowohl ruecksichtslose als auch kooperative Interaktionsmuster sind fuer die beteiligten Fahrer und den Gesamtverkehr sicherheitsrelevant. Zur Gesamtaufnahme siehe ITRD D369114. (KfV/K)",

      "title": "300 - Increasing Complexity Awareness of Parkinson Disease Psychosis: Risk Factors, Symptoms, Diagnosing &amp; Management",
      "abstract": "Background: After Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’ disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder globally. Approximately 1 million individuals in the United States (US) have PD; every year 60,000 more Americans are diagnosed. PD is a movement disorder caused by dopamine insufficiency in the substantia nigra. The disease process is complicated by falls, constipation, dysphagia, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and behavioral/cognitive disorders. Upon diagnosis, evidence-based symptom management should include individualized nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions along with lifestyle changes that will promote positive outcomes. More than 50% of persons diagnosed with PD develop psychotic symptoms. Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP) is a non-motor symptom and consists primarily of hallucinations and delusions. PDP is caused by neurotransmitter changes in the brain, some related to long-term use of parkinsonian medications. In many cases, PDP symptoms are mis-diagnosed as a chronic co-morbid condition, such as mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Symptoms run from benign to aggressive. Undiagnosed and untreated symptoms can accelerate. Delirium caused by medications or infections may contribute to psychosis. Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REMS) Disorder associated with PD results in daytime sleepiness and acting out dreams. All symptoms profoundly impact formal and informal care partners. When underlying causes are identified by expert clinicians, symptoms may be reversible. There are many evidence-based paths to follow such as managing polypharmacy, appropriate prescribing patterns, and the effective use of nonpharmacologic interventions. Conclusion: During this symposium the complexities of the disease are addressed including the toll PDP can have on the person living with PD, their care partner(s) and the interdisciplinary health care team. It is imperative clinicians can simultaneously manage the overlapping motor symptoms and PDP to prevent physical and mental disabilities and improve quality of life. After attending this session, clinicians will be able to provide quality care to individuals living with PDP and their care partners.",

This feeling is accompanied by muscle relaxation and slowing of brain activity. Nevertheless, body movements are a feature of normal sleep and when those impair sleep quality and consequent daytime function they are defined as abnormal. The introduction of polysomnography during which muscle activity is monitored by electromyography and videotaping enabled sleep researches to precisely assess the characteristics of normal and abnormal movements, to determine their appearance is at specific sleep stages and to define their severity in regard to sleep quality and their impact on daytime function. Indeed, abnormal movements during sleep became an essential part of the symptomatology of a number of neurodegenerative disorders. Normal and abnormal movement disorder related to sleep onset, particular sleep stages and during awakening from sleep will be described in some detail. Common and rare forms of sleep related movement disorders in children and adults will be reviewed.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "title": "Dynamics of recovery sleep from chronic sleep restriction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep loss is common in our 24/7 society with many people routinely sleeping less than they need. Sleep debt is a term describing the difference between the amount of sleep needed, and the amount of sleep obtained. Sleep debt can accumulate over time, resulting in poor cognitive performance, increased sleepiness, poor mood, and a higher risk for accidents. Over the last 30 years, the sleep field has increasingly focused attention on recovery sleep and the ways we can recover from a sleep debt faster and more effectively. While there are still many unanswered questions and debates about the nature of recovery sleep, such as the exact components of sleep important for recovery of function, the amount of sleep needed to recover and the impacts of prior sleep history on recovery, recent research has revealed several important attributes about recovery sleep: (1) the dynamics of the recovery process is impacted by the type of sleep loss (acute versus chronic), (2) mood, sleepiness, and other aspects of cognitive performance recover at different rates, and (3) the recovery process is complex and dependent on the length of recovery sleep and the number of recovery opportunities available. This review will summarize the current state of the literature on recovery sleep, from specific studies of recovery sleep dynamics to napping, “banking” sleep and shiftwork, and will suggest the next steps for research in this field.

      "title": "The Scoring of Movements in Sleep",
      "abstract": "The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) has separated sleep-related movement disorders into simple, repetitive movement disorders (such as periodic limb movements in sleep [PLMS], sleep bruxism, and rhythmic movement disorder) and parasomnias (such as REM sleep behavior disorder and disorders of partial arousal, e.g., sleep walking, confusional arousals, night terrors). Many of the parasomnias are characterized by complex behaviors in sleep that appear purposeful, goal directed and voluntary but are outside the conscious awareness of the individual and therefore inappropriate. All of the sleep-related movement disorders described here have specific polysomnographic findings. For the purposes of developing and/or revising specifications and polysomnographic scoring rules, the AASM Scoring Manual Task Force on Movements in Sleep reviewed background literature and executed evidence grading of 81 relevant articles obtained by a literature search of published articles between 1966 and 2004. Subsequent evidence grading identified limited evidence for reliability and/or validity for polysomnographic scoring criteria for periodic limb movements in sleep, REM sleep behavior disorder, and sleep bruxism. Published scoring criteria for rhythmic movement disorder, excessive fragmentary myoclonus, and hypnagogic foot tremor/alternating leg muscle activation were empirical and based on descriptive studies. The literature review disclosed no published evidence defining clinical consequences of excessive fragmentary myoclonus or hypnagogic foot tremor/alternating leg muscle activation. Because of limited or absent evidence for reliability and/or validity, a standardized RAND/UCLA consensus process was employed for recommendation of specific rules for the scoring of sleep-associated movements.",

      "abstract": "Premature survivors are at increased risk for impaired neurodevelopmental outcome compared to full terms. These sequelae include cognitive abnormalities, mild fine or gross motor delay, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing losses, impairment increases with decreasing gestational age. Persistence of multiple abnormal neurologic signs in the first 12 to 18 months is ominous. Emergence of other findings (vision impairments, seizures, feeding issues delay of head growth) is associated with poor outcome. MRI is useful in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome at the equivalent of term gestation. Other neonatal complications as; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, poor growth, presence of congenital anomalies are associated with an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Premature survivors are more likely to have specific psychological and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, general anxiety, and depression. Individuals with birth weights below 1500 g are at greater risk for poor academic performance than those born with normal birthweight because of their impaired cognition, neurosensory defects, and behavioral and psychological problems. Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood due to the cognitive recovery over time and lack of accurate predictive assessment tools in early childhood. Survivors of prematures need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental impairment and, if impairment is present, be referred to educational programs and subspecialty care in order to provide the best possible outcome. ELBW infants without evidence of significant neonatal brain injury can recover when exposed to a nurturing home environment and comprehensive early intervention services.",

      "title": "Convulsiones y epilepsia—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Las convulsiones son causadas por un ataque de actividad excesiva en el cerebro. Un niño que tiene una convulsión puede perder el conocimiento (desmayarse) durante un período breve, temblar violentamente con todo su cuerpo, tener movimientos corporales reiterados y poco comunes, sufrir crisis atónicas (episodios de caída), tener convulsiones mientras duerme o tener la mirada perdida.La epilepsia se define como 2 o más convulsiones en las que el niño no tiene fiebre ni ningún otro motivo médico para sufrir una convulsión.Alrededor de 1 de cada 4 niños con trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene convulsiones. Las convulsiones suelen comenzar en la primera infancia o en los primeros años de la adolescencia. Los niños con TEA que tienen un coeficiente intelectual más bajo o que no pueden hablar son los que corren mayor riesgo de tener convulsiones.Con frecuencia los niños con TEA tienen movimientos reiterativos y episodios en los que se quedan mirando el vacío. A menudo un médico puede detectar qué comportamientos reiterativos podrían ser convulsiones. Una prueba llamada electroencefalograma (EEG) puede registrar la actividad eléctrica del cerebro y ayudar a un médico a verificar la presencia de convulsiones. El electroencefalograma puede registrar la ocurrencia de una convulsión solo cuando el equipo de EEG está conectado al niño. No es posible detectar con un EEG las convulsiones que ocurran en otros momentos. A veces es necesario hacer un EEG durante un tiempo prolongado para ver si los movimientos o desmayos son convulsiones.La mayoría de los niños con TEA no necesitan un EEG. Es probable que el médico solicite un EEG si un niño tiene desmayos que el médico crea que son convulsiones o si el niño perdió recientemente destrezas de habla o de otro tipo. El electroencefalograma se hace generalmente cuando el niño está despierto y luego dormido. Hay distintos tipos de EEG; algunos se completan durante una visita más corta al hospital y otros se realizan durante toda la noche en el hospital o en el hogar. El médico decidirá qué tipo de EEG es adecuado para cada niño.En la mayoría de los casos, los medicamentos llamados anticonvulsivos pueden ayudar a controlar las convulsiones. Por lo general estos medicamentos reducen la cantidad de convulsiones, pero no siempre pueden eliminarlas. Algunos niños obtienen resultados anormales en sus EEG, pero no tienen convulsiones evidentes. Aún no está claro si los anticonvulsivos pueden ser útiles en esas situaciones.Uno de 2 tipos específicos de aceite de cannabidiol (conocido como aceite CBD) está actualmente aprobado por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (US Food and Drug Administration) para el tratamiento de convulsiones en niños con 2 tipos de epilepsia grave (los síndromes de Lennox-Gastaut y de Dravet). El aceite de cannabidiol no está aprobado para el manejo del TEA en niños que no padezcan las afecciones específicas que se mencionaron anteriormente.Para obtener más información sobre las convulsiones, comuníquese con la Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsyfoundation.org).La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

      "title": "Sleep disorders in aging and dementia",
      "abstract": "This paper reviews the characteristics of sleep disorders found in people at a greater risk of dementia: the elderly adult, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and those with neurodegenerative diseases. The frequency of sleep architecture modifications and circadian rhythm sleep disturbances increases with age. Although around 40% of older adults complain of poor sleep, true sleep disorders are far less prevalent in healthy older adults and are frequently associated with comorbidities. The sleep disorders observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are often similar to (but more intense than) those found in non-demented elderly people. Poor sleep results in an increased risk of significant morbidities and even mortality in demented patients and constitutes a major source of stress for caregivers. The prevalence of primary sleep disorders such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders (RBDs), restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movements (PLMs) and sleep-disordered breathing increases with age. There are no published data on RLS and PLMs in demented persons but RBDs and sleep apnea syndrome have been studied more extensively. In fact, RBDs are suggestive of Lewy body dementia (LBD) and are predictive for neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) shares common risk factors with AD and may even be an integral part of the pathological process in AD. In MCI patients, the hypotheses in which (i) sleep disorders may represent early predictive factors for progression to dementia and (ii) MCI is symptomatic of a non-diagnosed sleep disorder remain to be elucidated. Guidelines for drug and non-drug treatments of sleep disorders in the elderly and in demented patients are also considered in this review. In healthy but frail elderly people and in early-stage AD patients, sleep should be more thoroughly characterized (notably by using standardized interviews and polysomnographic recording).",

      "title": "Effects of behavioural traits and the endogenous opioid system in neuropathic pain manifestations",
      "abstract": "Introduccion El dolor neuropatico es definido como el dolor que es iniciado o causado por una lesion o disfuncion primaria en el sistema nervioso (Merskey and Bogduk, 1994). El dolor cronico es un trastorno complejo que incluye manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas que muestran una alta variabilidad interindividual dependiente de multiples factores, incluyendo los rasgos de personalidad de los pacientes (Asghari and Nicholas, 2006; La Porta et al., 2016). Dentro de las manifestaciones nociceptivas, el dolor neuropatico, se desarrollan signos sensoriales anormales como dolor espontaneo, alodinia e hiperalgesia (Bridges et al., 2001). El dolor neuropatico esta frecuentemente asociado con desordenes afectivos como ansiedad y depresion. Tambien se ha establecido una relacion entre el dolor y deficits cognitivos como el problemas de memoria y aprendizaje (Kodama et al., 2011; Low et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2011). El sistema opioide endogeno esta altamente relacionado con la modulacion de las funciones fisiologicas que son afectadas por el dolor neuropatico, ademas de su mas conocida funcion que es la induccion de analgesia endogena (Le Merrer et al., 2009).\nObjetivos Los objetivos de este trabajo fueron: validar en ratones, diferentes paradigmas conductuales para medir las manifestaciones emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico inducido por la ligadura parcial del nervio ciatico; evaluar la influencia de rasgos conductuales especificos sobre las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico y explorar la influencia de las preproencefalinas en las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico.\nMetodos y Resultados Primero, modelos clasicos de comportamiento fueron validados para evaluar las manifestaciones emocionales y cognitivas del dolor neuropatico. Despues, evaluamos la influencia de los rasgos especificos de comportamiento, asi como el papel de la preproencefalinas (Penk) en las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico inducido por ligadura parcial del nervio ciatico en ratones. Se observo que era posible detectar las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico dependientes del tiempo a traves de paradigmas clasicos utilizados para evaluar comportamientos como la ansiedad, la depresion y la funcion cognitiva. Se identificaron los genes Pdyn y Gadd45 en amigdala como biomarcadores de la influencia de los rasgos de ansiedad y depresion en las manifestaciones del dolor neuropatico. La delecion de Penk produjo un efecto techo en el desarrollo de ansiedad y deficits cognitivos producidos por el dolor neuropatico. Este efecto techo se relaciono con el mantenimiento de la expresion de Pdyn, KOR, Npas4 y Nr3c1 en la amigdala y con la disminucion en la expresion de Nr3c1 en el hipocampo, respectivamente. \nConclusiones En la presente tesis, a traves de paradigmas clasicos de comportamiento, se detecto la influencia de rasgos especificos de comportamiento y el papel de las preproencefalinas en las manifestaciones nociceptivas, emocionales y cognitivas asociadas a dolor neuropatico. Estas manifestaciones fueron sensibles principalmente a la ansiedad y depresion. Finalmente, se identifico la preproencefalina como un componente esencial para el desarrollo de los cambios fisiologicos y comportamentales inducidos por el dolor neuropatico. \nReferencias Asghari, A., Nicholas, M.K.

Postoperative oozing is also common. Ocular symptoms range from partial to complete loss of vision due to retinal hemorrhages, venous changes, or even papilledema. The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen. The main cause of the hyperviscosity syndrome is increased viscosity of the serum (as in macroglobulinemia or myeloma), although increased numbers of cells (polycythemia or leukemia) or increased resistance of cells",

      "abstract": "Syndrome of dementia, which appears as a result of deterioration of brain structure that is caused by different factors, together with syndrome of psychomotor restlessness, represents one of the most common psychiatric conditions at patients of the geriatric population (older than 75 years). Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

      "abstract": "Continuous polygraphic recordings of six patients with vascular brain stem lesions were evaluated to investigate the relationship between 1) the localization or extent of the lesions and the alteration of the sleep-waking cycle, and 2) the evolution of the clinical condition and the sleep-waking cycle. Absent REM sleep and severely disorganized NREM sleep were associated with extensive pontine lesions involving the pontine tegmentum. In \"locked-in\" syndrome, the neural mechanisms responsible for both REM and NREM sleep continued to function, but the sleep-waking cycle was disturbed and marked by sleep-onset REM periods. Lesions in the lower brain stem resulted in absent slow-wave sleep and sleep-onset REM, suggesting that vascular lesions may involve the neural mechanisms responsible for slow-wave sleep. In general, the acute stage of illness was marked by increased awakenings and time spent awake, absent REM sleep, and little or no slow-wave sleep. These results indicate that continuous polygraphic recordings can reveal severe abnormalities due to vascular lesions of the brain stem whereas the waking EEG can only detect mild abnormalities. Improvement in the organization of the sleep-waking cycle in successive polygraphic examinations is likely to be followed by an improvement of the clinical condition. Continuous polygraphic recording is thus a valuable prognostic indicator for vascular brain stem lesions.",

      "title": "Nerve Cell Death in Degenerative Diseases of the Central Nervous System: Clinical Aspects",
      "abstract": "The origin of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system lies in genetic and acquired disorders. Analysis of the clinical characteristics of diseases affecting specific neuronal systems may help us to understand their pathogenesis. The stereotyped symptomatology characteristic of most degenerative diseases results from neuronal death in specific pathways: pyramidal tract and motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nigrostriatal dopamine system in Parkinson's disease, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord in Friedreich's ataxia, etc. This suggests that these neurons are sensitive to pathological processes that are still unknown. Progression of the disease, whether linear or not, is slow, but it is more rapid than similar effects due to ageing. This indicates either that the environmental cause of degeneration (if it exists) is continuously present or that a vital process has been once and for all disrupted, perhaps at the level of the genome, causing insufficient production of essential proteins, or accumulation of eventually toxic metabolites. Symptoms generally appear during adulthood, i.e. after normal differentiation has taken place, and after a considerable number of neurons have already been damaged. The initiation of neuronal death precedes the appearance of the first symptoms.",

Define-se o delirio, e segundo Carlos Centeno, como estado confusional agudo que deriva de uma disfuncao cerebral orgânica de etiologia multifactorial. Dependendo dos autores, varia de 28% a 85%. O delirio e um dos sintomas mais dificeis de diagnosticar e tratar, e tambem aquele que provoca maior deterioracao da qualidade de vida do doente e da sua relacao com a familia, cuidadores ou equipa de apoio. A sua presenca condiciona maiores dificuldades na avaliacao da dor, de outros sintomas ou problemas, - a obstipacao, a retencao urinaria, febre, a infeccao respiratoria ou urinaria, desidratacao, etc., - pela perturbacao que causa na comunicacao com o doente e por impedir uma participacao nas decisoes que dizem respeito a sua doenca. Apesar de ser uma situacao esperada no final de vida, pode no entanto, ser reversivel ou controlavel em cerca de 25-45% dos casos, pelo que na sua abordagem deve-se ter em conta esta caracteristica, individualizando-se caso a caso, transmitindo a familia a esperanca da reversibilidade. \nNa doenca avancada, o delirio manifesta-se por: perturbacoes cognitivas, disturbios do comportamento psicomotor, com uma instalacao aguda ou subaguda, com flutuacoes durante o dia, agravando-se para a noite, podendo adoptar uma forma hiperactiva (a mais frequente) e uma forma hipoactiva. O delirio, normalmente de etiologia multifactorial, condiciona um conjunto de medidas de intervencao que passam por: terapeutica dirigida a causa, intervencao no comportamento do doente e no ambiente, apoio a familia e o tratamento sintomatico, sobretudo fazendo uso correcto dos varios tipos de neurolepticos, assim como outro tipo de intervencoes farmacologicas.",

      "title": "0617 Working Memory and Psychomotor Vigilance Performance After Brief Naps in Hypersomnolent Patients: MSLT Correlates",
      "abstract": "Physiologic sleep inertia is operationalized as cognitive impairments upon awakening. Markedly pronounced sleep inertia, or sleep drunkenness, is common in idiopathic hypersomnia. Previous work has demonstrated significant worsening of vigilance on Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) lapses (reaction times>500ms), reciprocal of reaction time (RRT) and slowest 10% of RRT associated with nap length and accrued sleep length among hypersomnolent patients during MSLT. A differential sensitivity of various cognitive processes to sleep inertia may be a significant contributing factor to these complaints such as working memory. Patients undergoing PSG/MSLT (N=37; Age=36.42 ± 14.14; 81.09% women), with diagnoses of Idiopathic hypersomnia (n=17), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (n=7), Narcolepsy Type 1 (n=3) and Type 2 (n=2), KLS(n=1) and subjective sleepiness with normal MSLT (n=7) were administered PVT before and after MSLT naps 2 and 4 and 0-back and 3-back N-Back tasks before and after nap 3. Accuracy on the N-Back was defined as correct classification rate of targets and non-targets. PVT and N-back performance was analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests. For Nap 4, lapses, RRT, and S-RRT demonstrated significant worsening post-nap relative to pre-nap, (10.47 ± 19.29(pre) vs 15.01 ± 21.15(post),t=2.02,p=0.05); (3.36±.85(pre) vs 2.93 ± 1.01(post),t=-3.97,p=0.0003); (2.03±.79(pre) vs 1.73±.80(post),t=-3.27,t=0.0018), respectively. Nap 4 sleep time, sleep efficiency and accumulated sleep through 4 naps (except for lapses) was significantly associated with lapses, Mean RRT and Mean S-RRT. Accuracy on the 3-Back demonstrated significant improvement post-nap relative to pre-nap, (.61±.25(pre)vs.71±.21(post),t=3.92,p=.0004), and associated with Nap 3 sleep efficiency (B=-.13,SE=.05,p=.011). Similar results for 0-Back accuracy (.78±.27(pre)vs.88±.18(post),t=3.93,p=.0004), and association with Nap 3 sleep efficiency (B=-.14,SE=.04,p=.0008). Reaction Times(ms) for 3 and 0-back demonstrated similar improvement, (1143.36 ± 452.52(pre)vs.1091.06 ± 470.83(post),t=-2.90,p=.006) and (840.11 ± 366.5(pre)vs 832.15 ± 383.3(post),t=3.93,p=.0004), respectively; with 0-back associated with sleep efficiency (B=-.14,SE=.04,p=.0008). Depreciation of psychomotor vigilance is consistent with previous findings, while improvements in working memory performance suggests discriminating the effects and sensitivities of sleep inertia from benefits of sleep-consolidation requires multiple WM tasks in addition to the N-back.

RLS and sleep deprivation can put you at risk for other health problems, including depression if not treate d. It can occur at any age, though it’s usually more severe in middle age or later. Women are twice as likely as men to have RLS. At least 80 percent of people with RLS have a related condition called periodic limb movement of sleep (PLMS). PLMS causes the legs to twitch or jerk during sleep. It can happen as often as every 15 to 40 seconds and can continue all night long. PLMS can also lead to sleep deprivation.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review In the central nervous system there are many regulatory processes controlling the lower urinary tract. This review considers the possibility that urinary dysfunction may precede diagnosis of neurological disease. Recent findings Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) occur early in multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus, and may present before neurological diagnosis. Some people present with LUTS and subsequently are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or a spinal condition. In male LUTS, the symptoms could reflect early stages of a neurological disease, which has not yet been diagnosed (‘occult neurology’). Key symptoms include erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, enuresis, loss of filling sensation or unexplained stress urinary incontinence. Directed questioning should enquire about visual symptoms, back pain, anosmia, bowel dysfunction and incontinence, or memory loss. Examination features can include resting tremor, ‘croaky’ speech, abnormal gait, orthostatic hypotension, ataxia, or altered perineal sensation. Imaging, such as MRI scan, should only be requested after expert neurological examination, to ensure the correct parts of the central nervous system are scanned with appropriate radiological protocols. Summary Urologists should consider an undiagnosed neurological condition can be present in a few cases. Any finding should be further evaluated by colleagues with relevant expertise.",

      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

      "abstract": "The sleep patterns of two groups of children with autism, one with moderate to severe intellectual handicap, and one with mild handicap to normal IQ level, were compared with those of children without autism. Parents completed 14 day sleep diaries and questionnaires. ILesults suggested that at some stage during childhood, particularly under 8 years of age, the majority of children with autism will experience sleep problems. These problems are likely to be severe in many cases and will generally include one or more of. extreme sleep latencies; lengthy periods of night waking; shortened night sleep; and early morning waking. Such problems may have some specificity for autism as they appear to be rare in non-handicapped children and in children with mild degrees of intellectual handicap. It is likely that sleep problems in early childhood are related to the severe social difl:culties present in autism and the consequent inability of these children to use social cues to synchronise their sleep/wake cycle. Continued sleep dilticulties at older ages and with higher IQ may also be related to arousal and anxiety factors.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatments of Pediatric Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION In a general sense, the operational definition of insomnia in children may be construed as similar to that in adults, i.e., significant difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep and/or non-restorative sleep (early morning awakening is an infrequent complaint in children). However, practically speaking, the most frequent clinical manifestations of childhood insomnia, particularly in younger children, are bedtime refusal or resistance, delayed sleep onset, and/or prolonged night wakings requiring parental intervention. It is estimated that overall 20% to 30% of children in cross-sectional studies are reported to have some significant bedtime problems and/or night wakings (1-7), and a recent study suggests that lifetime prevalence of insomnia in 13 to 16-year-old adolescents approaches 11% (8). These percentages are substantially higher in children with psychiatric comorbidities (9,10) and with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (11). Furthermore, there is clear evidence from both experimental laboratory-based studies and clinical observations that insufficient and poor quality sleep in children results in or exacerbates mood instability and behavioral dysregulation, impacts negatively on neurocognitive functions and academic performance (12-14), and affects caregivers, with significant repercussions on family functioning. Therefore, appropriate and effective management of insomnia in the pediatric population is an important therapeutic goal for mental healthcare providers.",

      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

A wide variety of sleep abnormalities have been reported in the mentally retarded. Some of these sleep disturbances are common to many of the mental retardation syndromes. Other sleep disturbances are associated with specific syndromes. For example, Prader-Willi Syndrome is associatedwith excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and rapid eyemovement (REM) sleep abnormalities, both ofwhich are thought to be due to hypothalamic dysfunction.Mentally retarded childrenwith sleep difficulties aremore likely to show behavioral disturbance compared with those who sleep well (2).",

      "abstract": "Reflex seizures (RS) are epileptic events that are objectively and consistently elicited in response to a specific afferent stimulus or by an activity of the patient. The specific stimulus can be a variety of heterogenous intrinsic or extrinsic factors, ranging from the simple to the complex, such as flashing lights or reading a book. These seizures can take a variety of forms, comprising either general or focal onset, with or without secondary generalization. Reflex epilepsies (RE) are classified as a specific syndrome in which all epileptic seizures are precipitated by sensory stimuli. The few designated RE include idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy, other visual sensitive epilepsies, primary reading epilepsy, and startle epilepsy. RS that occurs within other focal or generalized epilepsy syndromes that are associated with distinct spontaneous seizures are classified by the overarching seizure type. Most patients experience spontaneous seizures along with their provoked events. RS originate from stimulation of functional anatomic networks normally functioning for physiological activities, that overlap or coincide with regions of cortical hyperexcitability. Generalized RS typically occur within the setting of IGEs and should be considered as focal seizures with quick secondary generalization via cortico-cortical or cortico-reticular pathways. In aggregate, activation of a critical neuronal mass, supported and sustained by cortico-subcortical and thalamocortical pathways eventually result in a seizure. Treatment includes antiseizure medication, commonly valproate or levetiracetam, along with lifestyle modifications, and when amenable, surgical intervention. High clinical suspicion and careful history taking must be employed in all epilepsy patients to identify reflex triggers.",

      "abstract": "Every illness represents in some way a threat and increases the sense of vulnerability. The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Epilepsy, cognition, and behavior: The clinical picture",
      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state.

      "title": "Sleep Disorders and Stroke: Pathophysiological Links, Clinical Implications, and Management Strategies",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and stroke are intricately linked through a complex, bidirectional relationship. Sleep disturbances such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, and restless legs syndrome (RLS) not only increase the risk of stroke but also frequently emerge as consequences of cerebrovascular events. OSA, in particular, is associated with a two- to three-fold increased risk of incident stroke, primarily through mechanisms involving intermittent hypoxia, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation. Conversely, stroke can disrupt sleep architecture and trigger or exacerbate sleep disorders, including insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disturbances, and breathing-related sleep disorders. These post-stroke sleep disturbances are common and significantly impair rehabilitation, cognitive recovery, and quality of life, yet they remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. Early identification and management of sleep disorders in stroke patients are essential to optimize recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. Therapeutic strategies include lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, medical devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and emerging alternatives for CPAP-intolerant individuals. Despite growing awareness, significant knowledge gaps persist, particularly regarding non-OSA sleep disorders and their impact on stroke outcomes. Improved diagnostic tools, broader screening protocols, and greater integration of sleep assessments into stroke care are urgently needed. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the interplay between sleep and stroke, emphasizing the importance of personalized, multidisciplinary approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Advancing research in this field holds promise for reducing the global burden of stroke and improving long-term outcomes through targeted sleep interventions.",

Objectives To review the literature regarding the CR dysfunction and its impact on the onset and clinical course of BD. Methods We conducted a MEDLINE search using bipolar disorder, circadian rhythm and sleep as keywords, selecting studies written in English. Results CR dysfunction is a trait marker of BD. It’s known that during depressive episodes insomnia is present, with difficulty falling asleep/ maintaining sleep and early awakening. Regarding mania, decreased need for sleep is a critical marker. During the euthymic period significant alterations in sleep pattern have been described. It’s also known that changes in the sleep pattern occur prior to those in mood patterns, indicating that sleep dysregulation may trigger the onset of mood episodes or relapses. Therefore, CR disruption may be associated with the pathophysiology of BD and some factors have already been identified: irregularity of the sleep-wake rhythm, eveningness chronotype, abnormality of melatonin secretion, vulnerability of clock genes and the irregularity of social zeitgeber. Conclusions Disturbances of sleep are pervasive, and an essential feature of BD, worse during mood episodes, but still present during euthymic periods. It remains to determine whether circadian rhythm dysfunction is a trait marker or mood state dependent. Further studies are warranted to clarify this association.

In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ).

      "abstract": "Abstract Infusions of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) are often cycled at night coinciding with sleep episodes. Adult consumers of HPN are known to experience poor sleep attributed to frequent awakenings and long durations of wakefulness after falling asleep. Consequently, most consumers do not meet recommendations for sleep duration and quality or daytime napping. The primary underlying pathophysiology resulting in sleep problems is nocturia; however, other factors also exist, including disruptions caused by medical equipment (ie, pump alarms), comorbid conditions, dysglycemia, and medication use. Early guidance on sleep is imperative because of the central role of sleep in physical health and wellbeing, including mitigating complications, such as infection risk, gastrointestinal problems, pain sensitivity, and fatigue. Clinicians should routinely inquire about the sleep of their patients and address factors known to perturb sleep. Nonpharmacologic opportunities to mitigate sleep problems include education on healthy sleep practices (ie, sleep hygiene); changes in infusion schedules, volumes, rates, and equipment; and, possibly, behavioral interventions, which have yet to be examined in this population. Addressing comorbid conditions, such as mood disorders, and nutrition deficiencies may also help. Pharmacologic interventions and technological advancement in HPN delivery are also needed. Research on sleep in this population is considered a priority, yet it remains limited at this time.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

      "title": "Beyond the motor impairment in dyskinetic cerebral palsy: neuropsychological and connectome-based approach",
      "abstract": "La paralisis cerebral (PC) se define como un grupo de trastornos del movimiento y/o la postura y de la funcion motora debidos a una lesion, interferencia o anomalia no progresiva en un cerebro inmaduro o en desarrollo. Estos trastornos motores a menudo se acompanan de alteraciones sensoriales, de la percepcion, de la cognicion, de la comunicacion, del comportamiento o de epilepsia, y se ha evidenciado que estos deficits pueden tener un mayor impacto sobre la calidad de vida que el propio deficit motor. Teniendo en cuenta la clasificacion de la PC segun el tipo de afectacion motora se identifica que la PC discinetica es un subtipo poco frecuente (entre el 3% y el 15% de todos los casos) que se caracteriza por patrones anormales de postura y/o movimiento, acompanados de movimientos involuntarios, descontrolados, recurrentes y, ocasionalmente, estereotipados. Este tipo de PC se ha asociado principalmente a procesos de hipoxia-isquemia en bebes nacidos a termino o casi a termino, y a la presencia de ictericia grave. Se ha evidenciado como la PC discinetica es mas incapacitante que otros tipos de PC, no solo por su asociacion con una mayor afectacion motriz sino tambien por una mayor presencia y gravedad de deficits asociados, como una mayor afectacion del habla y de la comunicacion.\nCabe destacar que los estudios que han analizado este tipo de PC son todavia escasos, probablemente debido a su menor frecuencia y mayor gravedad. Especialmente escasos son los estudios cognitivos y de neuroimagen, ya que las pruebas neuropsicologicas requieren de una destreza manual y/o de respuestas verbales y los estudios de neuroimagen implican la adquisicion de secuencias de resonancia magnetica en donde la persona debe permanecer quieta. \nLos estudios cognitivos realizados hasta el momento se focalizan principalmente en el rendimiento intelectual general, y evidencian que entre el 52% y el 65% de los casos presenta discapacidad intelectual. No obstante, cabe destacar que no existe un consenso sobre como evaluar el rendimiento intelectual en esta poblacion, con una gran variabilidad entre estudios. La aplicacion de tests psicometricos que requieren habilidades manipulativas y/o respuestas verbales pueden estar emmascarando e infravalorando el rendimiento intelectual real de estas personas. Los estudios que se focalizan en el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas son escasos y se basan en muestras muy reducidas que a menudo no superan los 8 casos. Por otro lado, los estudios cualitativos de neuroimagen han hallado una afectacion de ganglios basales y talamo. Las primeras evidencias de estudios de resonancia magnetica de difusion apuntan a una afectacion mas extensa, con una mayor afectacion de la sustancia blanca. \nEs por ello que esta tesis tiene como objetivos principales: 1) identificar una medida objetiva de inteligencia adecuada para la gran heterogeneidad que existe en la PC, 2) describir el perfil cognitivo de una muestra relativamente amplia de personas con PC discinetica, y 3) analizar el estado de la sustancia blanca cerebral de esta poblacion mediante la tecnica del conectoma. Para ello se incluyeron en el estudio un total de 52 sujetos con PC discinetica y 52 sujetos control, a quienes se les administro una bateria neuropsicologia que evaluaba el rendimiento cognitivo general (mediante las Matrices progresivas de Raven - version color, el Test de vocabulario en imagenes de Peabody - III y la Escala no verbal de aptitud intelectual de Wechsler) y cinco dominios cognitivos especificos (atencion, visuopercepcion, lenguaje, aprendizaje y memoria y funcion ejecutiva) y se les realizo un estudio de resonancia magnetica estructural. \nLos resultados comparando las diferentes pruebas de inteligencia muestran un mayor potencial de las Matrices progresivas de Raven. Esta prueba demuestra una gran aplicabilidad en la PC, incluso en casos con una grave afectacion motora y pocas habilidades comunicativas. Tambien se evidencia que proporciona informacion completa sobre el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas, tanto visuales como verbales, y que es sensible al estado de la estructura cerebral en fibras de asociacion y de proyeccion y estructuras subcorticales como los ganglios basales y el talamo.\nEn relacion al perfil cognitivo de la PC discinetica, los resultados a nivel grupal han evidenciado un rendimiento cognitivo por debajo del grupo control en todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal. No obstante, estas alteraciones cognitivas se han relacionado con la alteracion motriz, hallandose una afectacion cognitiva mas generalizada a medida que incrementa la gravedad motora. En los casos mas leves, aquellos en los que existe deambulacion autonoma, se ha evidenciado un rendimiento similar al del grupo control en casi todas las funciones evaluadas a excepcion de las funciones visuoperceptivas, atencionales y de la memoria visual. Los casos moderados, en los que se requiere de ayuda para la deambulacion, han mostrado las mismas alteraciones cognitivas y se anaden dificultades en las areas de lenguaje receptivo. En el grupo mas grave, aquellos casos en que no es posible la deambulacion, se observa el mismo rendimiento que con el grupo general (un rendimiento inferior en todas las funciones cognitivas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal).\n En el estudio de neuroimagen realizado en una submuestra de 25 participantes con PC y 24 sujetos control, se ha demostrado una disrupcion de la conectividad cerebral a diferentes niveles (global, regional y a nivel de conexion). Este patron se caracteriza por una disrupcion generalizada de la sustancia blanca cerebral, pero una afectacion mas localizada de la integridad de esta, que incluye areas mas posteriores (parietal, occipital y temporal) y una relativa preservacion de las areas prefrontales. Tambien se evidencia alteracion en la conectividad hipocampal, asi como de estructuras subcorticales (principalmente en putamen y talamo). Por ultimo, se ha hallado una correlacion entre el estado de la sustancia blanca de la circuiteria sensoriomotora y el nivel de gravedad motriz (tanto gruesa como fina) y se ha evidenciado como la red formada por conexiones fronto-estriatales y fronto-parietales juega un papel relevante en el rendimiento cognitivo general de estos sujetos. \nEn el presente trabajo se discuten estos resultados en relacion a la literatura previa tanto en el ambito de la PC como en otras patologias, asi como teniendo en cuenta el desarrollo normativo.",

      "abstract": "El diagnostico de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) se basa en la presencia obligatoria de bradicinesia y al menos uno de \nlos siguientes sintomas: rigidez muscular, temblor en reposo, o inestabilidad postural. Se ha estimado que la duracion \npromedio de la fase prodromica de la EP es de 10 anos antes de su diagnostico. En la fase prodromica pueden \npresentarse algunos trastornos motores leves, imposibilitando integrar el diagnostico en ausencia de otros sintomas. La \nlatencia diagnostica de la EP es el tiempo transcurrido entre la aparicion del primer sintoma motor hasta el diagnostico \nrealizado por un neurologo. Latencias diagnosticas prolongadas se han asociado significativamente con: iniciar la \nsintomatologia motora con rigidez, trastorno de la marcha o bradicinesia, sufrir un mayor numero de sintomas \nprodromicos no motores, sexo masculino, aparicion temprana de sintomas motores (<40 anos), tener un familiar de \nprimer grado con EP y consultas medicas iniciales con medicos no neurologos. Durante la fase prodromica muchos \npacientes tambien pueden padecer uno o varios de los siguientes sintomas no motores: disfuncion olfatoria, trastorno \nconductual del sueno MOR, depresion, estrenimiento, hipotension ortostatica, somnolencia diurna y disfuncion urinaria \no erectil, entre los cuales los cuatro primeros se han asociado con un mayor riesgo de desarrollar la EP, especialmente si \nse padece mas de uno. Sin embargo, no todos los pacientes con EP reportan haber experimentado alguno de los \nsintomas no motores antes del diagnostico. Estudios futuros permitiran determinar si los sintomas no motores podrian \nusarse para acortar la latencia diagnostica de la EP",

      "title": "Differentiating Psychosomatic, Somatopsychic, Multisystem Illnesses and Medical Uncertainty",
      "abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

The clinical features include dysaesthesias and paraesthesias in the legs and sometimes in the arms. occurring at rest, worsening in the evening and night and alleviated by movements. Associated symptoms are insomnia, fatigue, sleepiness, mood and anxiety disorders. The diagnosis is mainly based on clinical features. Neurophysiological investigations, polysomnography and actimeter are used to objectively assess sensory-motor disorders and sleep disturbances. Apart from secondary cases related to neurological or medical diseases, the restless legs syndrome is a primary and idiopathic disorder showing a high rate of familiarity and implying a deficient dopaminergic transmission at spinal level and/or basal ganglia with a selective impairment of D 2 receptors. The additional role of a dysfunction of the brain iron metabolism has been suggested but not defined in detail. Levodopa is an efficacious treatment, but adverse effects, i.e. rebound and augmentation, are frequently described. Dopamine agonists have largely replaced levodopa in moderate to severe restless legs syndrome, while slow-release levodopa is still used in mild cases. Treatment with opiates and gabapentin is proposed for cases not responding to dopamine agonists and/or when pain is the presenting symptom. Iron therapy is recommended only in patients with low level of ferritin.",

Focal slow-wave abnormalities imply a local disturbance of cortical and sometimes adjacent subcortical structures. Generalized intermittent slowing occurs most commonly in diverse encephalopathies.

      "title": "A Case of Transient Global Amnesia due to Marijuana Use",
      "abstract": "Transient amnesia is a temporary version of the amnestic syndrome. The most striking example of transient amnesia is the transient global amnesia (TGA) syndrome which lasts from several to 24 hours, with or without retrograde components of impairment, and any signs of neurological deficit in nature. In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

However, higher levels of deep sleep and/or lower levels of light sleep have been reported in several all-night polysomnography studies in CFS patients. This distribution of Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (NREMS) contrasts with what would be expected if sleep was interrupted by microawakenings, such as in sleep apneas or periodic limb movements, where more light sleep and less deep sleep are commonly observed. This \"paradoxical\" distribution of NREMS could represent a characteristic feature of chronic fatigue and deserved to be investigated.Methods: A retrospective comparison of the NREMS distribution was performed between 28 \"pure\" Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients (without primary sleep or psychiatric disorders), 27 Apneic-Hypopneic patients and 27 Healthy Controls.Results: Data showed CFS patients to have a higher stage 4/stage 2 or stage 4/light sleep ratios than the other two conditions.Conclusion: This sleep pattern is closer to what is observed in cases of infections than to what is seen after sleep fragmentation by primary sleep or in psychiatric disorders. Such a particular sleep pattern could provide insights into the pathophysiology of fatigue.",

It affects 35% of the general population, according to the 1984 report of the National Institutes of Mental Health (1). Insomnia is not defined by total sleep time but by the inability to obtain sleep of sufficient length or quality to produce refreshment the following morning. For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep. Contrary to popular lore, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most frequent causes of insomnia. Insomnias can be divided into two major categories: the primary insomnias and the secondary insomnias. As discussed elsewhere in this volume, primary insomnias are conditions in which the insomnia is the main pathophysiological process, whereas secondary insomnias are conditions where the insomnia is a symptom of another disorder.",

      "title": "Health Effects of Sleep Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Electrical lighting and increasing capital intensiveness have helped undermine the importance that society previously placed on obtaining adequate sleep. Even modest amounts of daily sleep loss accumulate as “sleep debt.” Sleep debt manifests in a myriad of ways, the most common being an increasing tendency to fall asleep, increased risk of accidental injury, impaired mood, and reduced psychomotor performance. Sleep debt can have far reaching consequences, both to an individual in terms of increased cardiovascular risk and to society at large, because of sleepiness-related fatigue and errors. Sleep specialists need to further their understanding of the physiologic and behavioral consequences of total, partial, and selective sleep stage deprivation, because they affect many organ systems. Studies of selective sleep stage deprivation also provide insights into the function of sleep. Evaluating the effects of sleep deprivation must take into account the following factors: (1) the duration of prior sleep, (2) circadian time frame, (3) arousal influences, and (4) subject and test characteristics. Sleep deprivation has been extensively studied in the acute experimental setting. Under extreme conditions, sleep deprivation is associated with mortality in laboratory animals. In the natural human environment, the behavioral consequence of chronic sleep debt in shift work intolerance is well described. The link between electrophysiological sleep disturbance and pathogenesis of disease is less well understood in both acute and chronic states. Additional investigation into the relationship between sleep deprivation and disease mechanisms, such as impaired glucose tolerance, hormonal dysregulation, and cytokine imbalance, will enhance our comprehension of this link.",

La perturbation de la distribution circadienne de la veille et du sommeil est proportionnelle a la gravite des signes cliniques et biologiques.

Une altération de la continuité du sommeil et des anomalies de son architecture ont été objectivées dans cette affection. Une diminution de l'efficacité du sommeil, une augmentation du nombre d'éveils, une diminution du sommeil lent profond et surtout une activité alpha anormale en sommeil lent profond (activité alphadelta) seraient caractéristiques bien que non spécifiques de cette affection. Ces données ont de plus éte confirmées par l'analyse spectrale de l'activité EEG au cours du sommeil en retrouvant une augmentation de la puissance des bandes à hautes fréquences ainsi qu'une diminution de celle à basses fréquences. La présence d'une activité alpha-delta, de micro-éveils et de complexes K-alpha, témoins d'une fragmentation du sommeil, correspondent à une possible intrusion de l'éveil dans le sommeil et peuvent ainsi contribuer à l'altération de la fonction restauratrice du sommeil et ainsi expliquer en partie la symptomatologie diurne de ces patients. Toutefois ces activités alpha anormales ne sont pas spécifiques et sont observées chez des sujets sains privés de sommeil lent profond. Cette fragmentation anormale du sommeil n'est pas à mettre en rapport avec un trouble primaire du sommeil comme le syndrome d'apnées du sommeil et le syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs, bien que ces dermières conditions sont souvent concomitantes. La pathogénie de la fibromyalgie demeure toujours incertaine. Toutefois l'altération du métabolisme de certaines substances dont la sérotonine, la mélatonine et l'hormone de croissance a pu être objectivée. Cette affection est fréquente et apparaît multifactorielle malgré l'existence d'un débat sur les causes de la fibromyalgie, l'implication de facteurs psychologiques (anxiété), environnementaux, génétiques, neurochimiques et de leurs impacts sur la qualité du sommeil. Enfin, il est probable que ceux-ci interviennent à diffèrents niveaux dans la genèse des symptômes de la fibromyalgie.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder that makes an individual responsive to negative stimuli as higher cognitive functions of the brain of the individual like perception, attention, memory related functions, planning, decision making etc. are seriously challenged by the causes like excessive stresses in life, serious illness, loss of self-esteem, certain medications etc. Erroneous information processing in the brain of depressive individuals attaches them to the feelings of loss, sadness and hopelessness. In extremely stressful situation the cognitive functions of the depressive individuals may impaired to such an extent that they may have the feeling of entrapment for which they may take the way of suicidal acts for escape. A number of brain regions that are involved in higher cognitive functions are altered in depression patients, suicidal individuals and in complete suicides. Along with the morphological changes, monoaminergic neurotransmission system is also severely deteriorated in these brain regions indicating their possible involvements in regulating cognitive activities. Monoaminergic dysfunctions may give rise to serious cognitive impairments and deterioration of associated mental functions required for maintaining normal internal homeostasis. Loss of cognitive functions makes an individual incapable to interact properly to various aspects of normal life functions making them depressive and severe depression may be the forerunner of suicidal acts.",

The clinical spectrum of parasomnias encompasses abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming and autonomic nervous system activation. Parasomnia behaviors are to be considered as automatisms, motor acts unconscious and uncontrolled by volition. Parasomnias disrupt sleep and may have adverse health and psychosocial effects. Pathophysiologically these sleep disorders may be explained as dissociations between the three primary states of wakefulness, NREM sleep and REM sleep. In the ICSD-2 many categories of parasomnias are reported. We will describe the main parasomnias arising from NREM as well as REM sleep.",

      "title": "Parkinson’s Disease: A Narrative Review on Potential Molecular Mechanisms of Sleep Disturbances, REM Behavior Disorder, and Melatonin",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. There is a wide range of sleep disturbances in patients with PD, such as insomnia and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (or REM behavior disorder (RBD)). RBD is a sleep disorder in which a patient acts out his/her dreams and includes abnormal behaviors during the REM phase of sleep. On the other hand, melatonin is the principal hormone that is secreted by the pineal gland and significantly modulates the circadian clock and mood state. Furthermore, melatonin has a wide range of regulatory effects and is a safe treatment for sleep disturbances such as RBD in PD. However, the molecular mechanisms of melatonin involved in the treatment or control of RBD are unknown. In this study, we reviewed the pathophysiology of PD and sleep disturbances, including RBD. We also discussed the potential molecular mechanisms of melatonin involved in its therapeutic effect. It was concluded that disruption of crucial neurotransmitter systems that mediate sleep, including norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and GABA, and important neurotransmitter systems that mediate the REM phase, including acetylcholine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, are significantly involved in the induction of sleep disturbances, including RBD in PD. It was also concluded that accumulation of α-synuclein in sleep-related brain regions can disrupt sleep processes and the circadian rhythm. We suggested that new treatment strategies for sleep disturbances in PD may focus on the modulation of α-synuclein aggregation or expression.",

      "title": "Utilizing Multi-Class Classification Methods for Automated Sleep Disorder Prediction",
      "abstract": "Even from infancy, a human’s day-life alternates from a period of wakefulness to a period of sleep at night, during the 24-hour cycle. Sleep is a normal process necessary for human physical and mental health. A lack of sleep makes it difficult to control emotions and behaviour, reduces productivity at work, and can even increase stress or depression. In addition, poor sleep affects health; when sleep is insufficient, the chances of developing serious diseases greatly increase. Researchers in sleep medicine have identified an extensive list of sleep disorders, and thus leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate their analysis and gain a deeper understanding of sleep patterns and related disorders. In this research, we seek a Machine Learning (ML) solution that will allow for efficient classification of unlabeled instances as being Sleep Apnea, Insomnia or Normal (subjects without a specific sleep disorder) by assessing the performance of two well-established strategies for multi-class classification tasks: the One-Vs-All (OVA) and One-Vs-One (OVO). In the context of the specific strategies, two well-known binary classification models were assumed, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Both strategies’ validity was verified upon a dataset of diverse information related to the profiles (anthropometric data, sleep metrics, lifestyle and cardiovascular health factors) of potential patients or individuals not exhibiting any specific sleep disorder. Performance evaluation was carried out by comparing the weighted average results in all involved classes that represent these two specific sleep disorders and no-disorder occurrence; accuracy, kappa score, precision, recall, f-measure, and Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) were recorded and compared to identify an effective and robust model and strategy, both class-wise and on average. The experimental evaluation unveiled that after feature selection, 2-degree polynomial SVM under both strategies was the least complex and most efficient, recording an accuracy of 91.44%, a kappa score of 84.97%, precision, recall and f-measure equal to 0.914, and an AUC of 0.927.",

      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are characterized by undesirable motor, verbal or experiential phenomenon/behaviors occurring in relation to sleep and sleep wake transition phases. They are believed to occur due to incomplete arousal from different sleep states, abnormal intrusions of wakefulness into different stages of sleep as well as de-afferentation of generators of locomotion from generators of sleep. They are classified as sleep wake transition parasomnias, NREM (non-rapid eye movement), REM (rapid eye movement) parasomnias and miscellaneous group.Accurate diagnosis of various parasomnias is important as they are associated with distinct group of predisposing factors.Associated conditions that require different treatment considerations which may be as innocuous as identification and removal of predisposing factors and reassurance. Correct diagnosis also invokes right differential diagnostic considerations and further investigations. Understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, semiological features and natural history of the particular parasomnia aids in counseling the patient and the parents, safety precautions to be undertaken and addressing psychosocial complications which are one of the most distressing factors for the patients. Correct diagnosis can be established fairly accurately based on careful and detailed clinical interview (including account from parents and bed partner), age of onset, time of occurrence, polysomnographic (PSG) studies and rarely an extended montage to study electrographic characteristics for differentiation with an ictal event.",

Problems with sleep organization in elderly patients typically include difficulty falling asleep, less time spent in the deeper stages of sleep, early-morning awakening and less total sleep time. Poor sleep habits such as irregular sleep-wake times and daytime napping may contribute to insomnia. Caffeine, alcohol and some medications can also interfere with sleep. Primary sleep disorders are more common in the elderly than in younger persons. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep and may respond to low doses of antiparkinsonian agents as well as other drugs. Sleep apnea can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness. Evaluation of sleep problems in the elderly includes careful screening for poor sleep habits and other factors that may be contributing to the sleep problem. Formal sleep studies may be needed when a primary sleep disorder is suspected or marked daytime dysfunction is noted. Therapy with a benzodiazepine receptor agonist may be indicated after careful evaluation.",

      "abstract": "AbstractObjective:To describe the clinical features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), evaluate treatment options, and discuss management of patients with comorbid diseases.Data Sources:A MEDLINE search (1977–April 2007) using the terms REM sleep behavior disorder, narcolepsy, parkinsonian disorders, levodopa, dopamine agonists, clonazepam, benzodiazepines, and melatonin was used to retrieve relevant articles. The reference sections of all articles and texts were scanned for additional literature.Study Selection and Data Extraction:All articles published in English were evaluated. There were no specific criteria for inclusion of articles in this review.Data Synthesis:RBD is characterized by enactment of dream content resulting from the loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep. RBD occurs mainly in geriatric patients and in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, especially parkinsonian diseases. The presence of idiopathic RBD may be a sign of an underlying parkinsonian syndrome. Development of RBD may be one of the first manifestations of Parkinson's disease or other parkinsonian syndromes. An acute form of RBD can be drug-induced or occur on drug withdrawal. The potential for injury to the patient and his or her bed partner is as high as 96%. Controlled trials are unavailable for most agents used in the treatment of RBD, although clonazepam is an effective first-line agent and can provide rapid and complete symptom remission based on evidence from 3 large case series. Patients who cannot tolerate clonazepam or who have a suboptimal response may benefit from melatonin alone or as an adjunct. Both drugs are generally well tolerated when taken at bedtime. Management of patients with RBD becomes complicated due to the high incidence of neurologic comorbidity.Conclusions:Clonazepam is the treatment of choice for patients with RBD. The drug is efficacious and has a low incidence of adverse effects. Melatonin is a viable second-line or adjunctive treatment ResumenObjetivo:Describir los hallazgos clínicos del desorden de comportamiento del sueño durante la fase de movimiento rápido del ojo, conocido en el idioma inglés por las siglas REM, evaluar las alternativas de tratamiento, y discutir el manejo de pacientes con enfermedades comórbidas.Fuentes de Información:Se realizó una búsqueda de literatura a través de MEDLINE (1977–abril 2007) utilizando los términos desorden de comportamiento del sueño REM, narcolepsia, desorden de Parkinson, levodopa, agonistas de dopamina, clonazepam, benzodiazepinas, y melatonina. Además, se utilizaron las referencias de todos los artículos y se revisaron otros textos para identificar literatura adicional.Selección de Estudios y Extracción de Infomación:Se revisaron todos los artículos publicados en el idioma inglés. No hubo criterios específicos de inclusión de artículos para este resumen de literatura.Síntesis:El desorden de comportamiento del sueño REM se caracteriza por la dramatización del contenido del sueño que resulta por la pérdida la atonía normal del músculo esqueletal durante REM en el sueño, El desorden de comportamiento del sueño REM ocurre mayormente en pacientes de edad avanzada y en pacientes con enfermedad neurodegenerativa, especialmente parkinsonismo. La presencia de este desorden idiopático podría ser un signo de la presencia del síndrome de parkinson. El desarrollo del desorden de comportamiento del sueño REM podría ser una de las primeras manifestaciones de la enfermedad de Parkinson u otros síndromes de Parkinson. Una forma aguda del desorden de comportamiento del sueño REM puede ser inducida por medicamentos o por la retirada de medicamentos. El potencial de trauma al paciente y a su pareja es hasta de un 96%. No hay estudios clínicos controlados disponibles para la mayoría de los medicamentos utilizados en el tratamiento de este desorden, aunque clonazepam es agente efectivo, de primera línea, con el que se puede obtener remisión completa y rápida de los síntomas basada en evidencia de 3 series grandes de casos. Los pacientes que no toleran el clonazepam o que tienen una respuesta subóptima podrían beneficiarse de melatonina sola o en combinación. Ambos medicamentos son generalmente bien tolerados cuando se administran al acostarse. El manejo de pacientes con el desorden de comportamiento del sueño REM se complica por la alta incidencia de comorbilidades neurológicas. Se discute el manejo de pacientes con desordenes neurológicas coexistiendo con el desorden de comportamiento del sueño REM.Conclusiones:El desorden de comportamiento del sueño REM es potencialmente peligroso ya que el paciente dramatiza sus sueños. Clonazepam es el tratamiento de elección para pacientes con este desorden. Este medicamento es efectivo y tiene una baja incidencia de efectos adversos. Melatonina es una alternativa de segunda línea o podría utilizarse como terapia de combinación. RésuméObjectif:Décrire les caractéristiques cliniques des troubles du comportement en sommeil paradoxal, évaluer les options thérapeutiques, et discuter du traitement des patients en présence de comorbidités.Sources Des Données:Une recherche sous MEDLINE a été effectuée de 1977–avril 2007 en utilisant les mots clés suivants: sommeil paradoxal, troubles du comportement, narcolepsie, syndromes parkinsoniens, lévodopa, agonistes dopaminergiques, clonazépam, benzodiazépines, et mélatonine. De plus, les références de tous les articles et des textes sélectionnés ont été évaluées afin de retracer des références additionnelles.Sélection Des Études et Extraction Des Données:Tous les articles écrits en anglais ont été évalués. Aucun critère spécifique n'a été utilisé pour ¡'inclusion des articles dans cet article de revue.Analyse des Données:Le trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal est caractérisé par des épisodes d'activité motrice vifs et souvent violents apparaissant pendant le sommeil paradoxal. Le patient peut reproduire physiquement un rêve et peut ainsi affliger des blessures à lui-même et à autrui. Le trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal est principalement observé chez les patients âgés et chez ceux ayant des maladies neurodégénératives, spécialement des désordres parkinsoniens. La présence d'un trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal idiopathique pourrait indiquer un syndrome parkinsonien sous-jacent. Le développement d'un trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal peut être une des premières manifestations de la maladie de Parkinson ou d'autres syndromes parkinsoniens. Un épisode aigu de trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal pourrait être précipité par la présence de certains médicaments ou apparaître lors de l'arrêt de médicaments. Le potentiel de blessures chez le patient et autrui est élevé soit environ 96%. Les études cliniques contrôlées ne sont pas disponibles pour la plupart des médicaments utilisés dans le traitement du trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal. Cependant, le clonazépam demeure un médicament de première intention et peut apporter un soulagement rapide et complet des symptômes selon les résultats de 3 grandes études de cas. Les patients ne pouvant tolérer le clonazépam ou manifestent une réponse partielle pourrait bénéficier de-la mélatonine seule ou en association. Les 2 agents sont généralement bien tolérés lorsqu'ils sont administrés au coucher. Le traitement des patients avec un trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal est souvent difficile à traiter compte tenu de l'incidence élevée de comorbidités neurologiques. Les auteurs discutent du traitement des patients avec des désordres neurologiques et présentant une maladie du trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxalConclusions:Le trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal est un désordre du sommeil qui peut s'avérer potentiellement dangereux puisque le patient a souvent le souvenir de la scène rêvée. Le clonazépam demeure le traitement de première intention pour les patients avec un trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal. Ce médicament est efficace avec une incidence d'effets indésirables faible. La mélatonine demeure une option de deuxième intention ou en association de traitement.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Periodic neck myoclonus during Sleep (PNMS) is a movement disorder of sleep characterized by sudden myoclonic flexion or version of the head that manifest during REM and NREM sleep. While its finding has been attributed to a normal physiologic phenomenon, to the best of our knowledge, our case represents the first report of with PNMS attributed to sleep disordered breathing with resolution using CPAP Report of Case A 22 y/o male with no significant clinical history was referred for evaluation of snoring and excessive sleepiness. Nocturnal polysomnogram coupled with expanded EMG montage demonstrates evidence of upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), characterized by frequents respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAS), primarily during REM sleep associated with arousals. The majority of these events resulted in sudden myoclonic movements of the neck and head that were associated with arousals and sleep fragmentation. PNMS manifested in the PSG as a flexion myoclonic motor artifact lasting 200-800 ms during REM sleep with an associated EEG arousal. The overall Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) was12/hr. The subsequent application of CPAP at a setting of 5-6 cm resolved these movements supporting this origin as a phenomenon of sleep-state instability. Conclusion While previous investigators have explained PNMS as an incidental finding or one common in patients with RBD, our case highlights a potential new mechanism for their appearance. This case helps shed more light on the origin of PNMS as a secondary phenomenon related to sleep state instability due to sleep disordered breathing given the temporal association with RERAS and dramatic resolution with CPAP therapy.",

Although sleep disturbances are not primary symptoms of schizophrenia, they are important aspects of schizophrenia. Difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep are frequently encountered in patients with schizophrenia. Many schizophrenics report low subjective sleep quality. Measured by polysomnography, increased sleep latency as well as reduced total sleep time, sleep efficiency, slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep latency (REM latency), are found in most patients with schizophrenia and appear to be an important aspect of the pathophysiology of this disorder. Some literatures suggest that worsening sleep quality precedes schizophrenic exacerbations. Co-morbid sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless legs syndrome (RLS), and sleep-disrupting behaviors associated with schizophrenia may lead to sleep disturbances. Clinicians should screen the patient with sleep complaints for primary sleep disorders like OSA and RLS, and carefully evaluate sleep hygiene behaviors of all patients with schizophrenia who complain of sleep disturbances.",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described. Good sleep should be understood as a substrate for psychological health and a reasonable expectation in later life.",

In contrast, the visual system may be disrupted by various disorders and pathologic processes, which can result in metamorphopsia, transient loss of vision, and positive scotomas. Such disruptions can be secondary to retinal and optic nerve disease, migraines associated with visual auras, and cerebrovascular and neurologic diseases; they can also be side effects of certain drugs. In addition, the visual system may process incoming sensory information in such a way that what is seen is perceived incorrectly, i.e. illusion; or the visual system may produce images of things not really there, i.e. hallucination. Various types of visual phenomena, disturbances, and hallucinations are discussed. The numerous visual presentations need to be differentiated so that appropriate treatment, management, and patient education can be rendered.",

      "title": "The Neuropharmacology of Serotonin and Sleep: an Evaluation",
      "abstract": "Depression is often associated with disruption of the normal sleep cycle. In particular, though patients frequently show disturbances in sleep continuity and a reduction in slow wave sleep, the most commonly observed effects are a shortened latency to the first episode of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep after sleep onset (i.e., a reduced REM latency), and an increase in REM density in the first REM periods during the night (Kupfer, 1982). The administration of antidepressant drugs typically suppresses most measures of REM sleep (see Kupfer, 1982), and it is an issue of general interest whether there is a connection between the pharmacologies of REM suppression and of antidepressant treatment. Several of the antidepressants in past, current, and experimental use are active at serotonin (5HT) synapses. The antidepressant action of such drugs is commonly thought to be associated with their ability to enhance transmission across 5HT synapses (see Willner, 1985). If this is the case and if there is a connection between a drug's effects on sleep and depression, then these agents should have predictable actions on sleep, as should other drugs that affect 5HT synaptic function. The purpose of this review is to evaluate this latter proposition. To this end, a discussion is presented of the effects that each of several classes of agents that modify 5HT transmission has on sleep in mammals. These are broadly classed as agents that decrease or increase synaptic transmission.",

Often it is clear that such symptoms and signs are being manufactured psychologically, either consciously or, more often, by an unconscious process. Such patients are frequently polysymptomatic, and may have a long history of consulting other specialists, particularly abdominal, dental, gynaecological, and otorhinological surgeons. They run the risk of developing secondary abnormalities induced by surgical and other invasive procedures. Psychologically determined symptoms are a very common cause of neurological out-patient referral. Of those with psychogenic disorders, pain is the commonest symptom, followed by motor symptoms, gait disturbances, dizziness, blackouts, sensory symptoms, and visual dysfunction (Lempert et al. 1990). Depressive and anxiety disorders are twice as common in those with psychologically determined disorders and those with emotional disorders have a greater number of somatic symptoms but are unenthusiastic about psychiatric treatment. Clinical syndromes including Briquet’s syndrome, hypochondriasis, conversion disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorders are explained and described. The presentation and characteristics of malingering (a process of deliberate deceit, in which symptoms are fabricated) is described, including Munchausen’s syndrome. In addition, associated psychiatric states and the symptoms and physical signs of psychologically determined disorders are discussed. Finally, the management and prognosis of psychologically determined states are outlined.",

Landolt described it as ?a phenomenon characterized by the relative or complete normalization of EEG findings, compared to the previous ones after the occurrence of psychotic states.? The psychiatric disorders reported are mostly psychoses; however, ?prepsychotic dysphoria?

The pathogenic mechanisms and neurobiological processes that cause this phenomenon have not yet entirely understood. Moreover, there is lack of information on the incidence of this phenomenon.

      "abstract": "Sleep Paralysis (SP) is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon situated at the intersection of neurobiology, psychiatry, genetics, and cultural belief systems. This study offers a comprehensive investigation into SP, integrating findings from neurophysiological, psychological, and sociocultural domains. Neurobiological evidence highlights disruptions during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep cycle—specifically the persistence of REM atonia into wakefulness—as a core mechanism underlying SP, often accompanied by vivid hallucinations and sensory distortions. Psychiatric analyses reveal a strong association between SP and mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, underscoring the influence of emotional trauma on REM regulation. Genetic studies indicate that polymorphisms in circadian rhythm-related genes (e.g., PER, CLOCK, ARNTL2), calcium channel genes (e.g., CACNA1C), and recently, the anti-aging gene Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), may contribute to SP susceptibility through their regulation of sleep-wake cycles and stress responses. Cultural frameworks further shape SP experiences, with interpretations ranging from demonic visitations to ancestral contact, influencing both coping strategies and emotional outcomes. In response to these findings, this paper advocates for a culturally sensitive, biopsychosocial model for SP treatment—one that integrates trauma-informed therapy, genetic profiling, and community-based education. It concludes that SP is not merely a sleep disturbance but a deeply subjective and neurogenetically influenced experience, requiring interdisciplinary approaches for effective understanding and intervention. Future directions include exploring pharmacogenomics, real-time neuroimaging during SP episodes, and culturally informed VR therapies to bridge clinical practice with individual lived experience.",

For example, temporary regressions in sleep development often accompany the achievement of motor and cognitive milestones in the first year of life. Similarly, an increase in nighttime fears and night wakings in toddlers may be a temporary manifestation of developmentally normal separation anxiety peaking during that stage. In addition, sleep problems in the pediatric population must be viewed against a backdrop of the normal developmental trajectory across childhood and developmental norms; i.e., ‘‘normal’’ bedtime behavior, time to sleep onset, and sleep duration are obviously dramatically different in a 6-month old, 6-year old, and 16-year old. Finally, because the developmental continuum includes the transition into adulthood, insights into the prevalence, types, and impact of, as well as risk and protective factors for, sleep problems in childhood have direct relevance in regards to an increased understanding of sleep issues at all life stages. Despite the obvious importance of viewing sleep problems in both children and adults from a developmental perspective, the body of literature in developmental aspects of pediatric sleep research at this juncture is still relatively sparse. For example, there are surprisingly little large-scale epidemiological data currently available, which systematically define normal sleep and wakefulness patterns and sleep duration in the pediatric population. Most of the existing studies have utilized subjective, parentreport, retrospective, cross-sectional surveys in selected populations. Although cross-sectional studies yield important information regarding sleep in discrete age groups, by their nature they neither describe the evolution and persistence of sleep/wake patterns over time, nor do they help to elucidate the complex reciprocal relationship between sleep and cognitive/emotional development from the prenatal period through adolescence. There are even more limited data from studies utilizing more ‘‘objective’’ methods of measuring sleep quality and duration, such as polysomnography and actigraphy; and many of these studies were conducted prior to the establishment of accepted sleep monitoring and scoring standards. There are many potential reasons for this relative knowledge gap. First, as with many behavioral issues in childhood, the patient is rarely the one who presents with a chief complaint of a sleep problem. Thus, parental concerns and subjective observations regarding their child’s sleep patterns and behaviors often define sleep disturbances in the research, as well as in the clinical context. Parental recognition and reporting of sleep problems in children also varies across childhood, with parents of infants and toddlers more likely to be aware of sleep concerns than those of school-aged children and adolescents (and to report them to clinicians and researchers). Furthermore, the very definition of what behaviors constitute a sleep ‘‘problem’’ is often highly subjective and is frequently determined by the amount of disruption caused to parents’ sleep. Culturally based values and beliefs regarding the meaning, importance, and role of sleep in daily life, as well as culturally based differences in sleep practices (e.g., sleeping space and environment, solitary sleep vs. co-sleeping, use of transitional objects) also have a profound effect on how a parent",

      "abstract": "Over a century of work has confirmed crucial links between sleep and epilepsy. Seizures and some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) adversely affect the continuity of sleep. However, sleep is fragmented in the absence of seizures or medication, suggesting that sleep instability may be an inherent component of certain forms of epilepsy. In turn, sleep instability can promote seizures, thus forming a vicious cycle. Sleep deprivation provokes seizures and epileptiform discharges in some people with epilepsy. Synchronized nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep facilitates seizures, whereas desynchronized rapid eye movement (REM) sleep discourages seizure occurrence. The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) is useful in the diagnosis and localization of epilepsy, as new epileptic foci can appear in sleep and REM sleep may demonstrate the narrowest localization of the primary focus. Polysomnography (PSG) with expanded EEG aids in the differentiation of seizures and parasomnias and in the diagnosis of primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, that can exacerbate seizures. Treating sleep apnea may lead to improved seizure control. These observations underscore the importance of sleep in the diagnosis and treatment of people with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "To describe sleep characteristics and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder in patients with Guadeloupean atypical parkinsonism (Gd-PSP), a tauopathy resembling progressive supranuclear palsy that mainly affects the midbrain. It is possibly caused by the ingestion of sour sop (corossol), a tropical fruit containing acetogenins, which are mitochondrial poisons.Sleep interview, motor and cognitive tests, and overnight videopolysomnography.Thirty-six age-, sex-, disease-duration- and disability-matched patients with Gd-PSP (n = 9), progressive supranuclear palsy (a tauopathy, n = 9), Parkinson disease (a synucleinopathy, n = 9) and controls (n = 9).Tertiary-care academic hospital.REM sleep behavior disorder was found in 78% patients with Gd-PSP (43% of patients reported having this disorder several years before the onset of parkinsonism), 44% of patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease, 33% of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, and no controls. The percentage of muscle activity during REM sleep was greater in patients with Gd-PSP than in controls (limb muscle activity, 8.3%+/-8.7% vs 0.1%+/- 0.2%; chin muscle activity, 24.3%+/- 23.7% vs 0.7%+/-2.0%) but similar to that of other patient groups. The latency and percentage of REM sleep were similar in patients with Gd-PSP, patients with Parkinson disease, and controls, whereas patients with progressive supranuclear palsy had delayed and shortened REM sleep.Although Gd-PSP is a tauopathy, most patients experience REM sleep behavior disorder. This suggests that the location of neuronal loss or dysfunction in the midbrain, rather than the protein comprising the histologic lesions (synuclein versus tau aggregation), is responsible for suppressing muscle atonia during REM sleep. Subjects with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder should avoid eating sour sop.",

Report of Case A 64 y/o male, with history of ongoing complex movements occurring during his sleep, with no history of strokes or neurological deficits. Had extensive neurologic workup (all negative) including routine electroencephalogram (EEG), prolonged inpatient EEG (12 hours), and MRI of the brain. Home sleep study showing moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) AHI 24/hour successfully treated with CPAP therapy (residual AHI 1.7/hour) with improved nighttime symptoms initially. Wife recalls events as happening only at night while sleep, as patient often confused upon waking up in the morning, at times appear to sit up and smack his lips. No nighttime hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or acting out dreams were reported. Had two episodes associated with tongue biting and loss of bladder control. Another episode happened after a daytime nap, patient went outside and was mowing his lawn, went “completely blank “, appeared confused. No daytime or nighttime seizures were ever noticed. Patient do not recall any of the above events. Repeat EEG was normal. MRI/MRA of the head /neck showed small tiny focus in left frontoparietal lobe, suggesting remote cortical ischemic injury. Polysomnography (PSG) with seizure montage showed Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) foci recorded in the frontal/frontopolar leads without accompanying body movements. Interictal spike and wave activity seen during stage N2. Initially treated with carbamazepine (had skin reaction) switched to levetiracetam with complete resolution of his symptoms. Conclusion This case illustrates the importance of reviewing the clinical history, behavior semiology, and diagnostic ancillary testing such as polysomnography with EEG monitoring in distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from other nocturnal complex behavior disorders and parasomnias.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia, or if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e. paresis, dystonia, ataxia) which could fully explain the abnormal motor behaviour (Heilman & Rothi, 1985; Roy & Square, 1985; De Renzi, 1989). The praxic disorder may affect various body parts such as the eyes, face, trunk, or limbs, and may involve both sides of the body (i.e. ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e. limb-kinetic apraxia), or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of apraxia of gait.",

Focus is then given to altered mental states where conditions, such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), may cause patients to experience depersonalization, fugue states, and hallucinations.

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Whereas dizziness, vertigo, or imbalance are common in many central disorders, it is often unspecific, and the differential diagnosis is broad. Recurrent dizzy spells unexplained by other central or peripheral vestibular abnormalities and with a history of migraine headaches point towards migraine-associated vertigo or dizziness. Vertebrobasilar stroke is the most frequent cause of acute vestibular syndrome (AVS), defined as acute-onset vertigo or dizziness lasting > 24 hours, accompanied by nausea/vomiting, head-motion intolerance, nystagmus, and gait imbalance, whereas brief attacks of vertigo or dizziness accompanied by other brainstem or cerebellar signs suggest transient ischaemic attacks (TIA). An immediate work-up (including bedside ocular motor tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) in order to identify the underlying cause is mandatory in order to avoid further events. Ataxic movements and gait may be related to cerebellar or afferent deficits. Onset of ataxia may be acute (Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE), alcohol or drug intoxication, cerebellar stroke), subacute (paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, multiple sclerosis (MS)) or slowly progressive (secondary to chronic alcohol consumption, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and sporadic or hereditary ataxia).",

Conversely, REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is usually a secondary disorder, often due to degenerative brain stem disorders or narcolepsy. The case of a hitherto healthy man is presented, who simultaneously developed narcolepsy and RBD as the result of an acute focal inflammatory lesion in the dorsomedial pontine tegmentum in the presence of normal cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels and in the absence of human lymphocyte antigen haplotypes typically associated with narcolepsy and RBD (DQB1*0602, DQB1*05). This first observation of symptomatic narcolepsy with RBD underlines the importance of the mediotegmental pontine area in the pathophysiology of both disorders, even in the absence of a detectable hypocretin deficiency and a genetic predisposition.",

A symmetrically slowed PDR, excessive theta activity, or any delta activity during wakefulness is abnormal and a biomarker of encephalopathy. Low-voltage EEGs have been associated with a variety of neuropathological states but are themselves not abnormal. During non-rapid eye movement sleep, a normal EEG will display progressively greater degrees of background slowing and amplitude enhancement, which may or may not be associated with specific sleep-related transients. In contrast, the EEG during rapid eye movement sleep more closely resembles a waking EEG (“desynchronized”) in amplitude and background frequencies.

[1] have emphasized the high prevalence of hypnagogic and/or hypnopompic hallucinations present respectively in 37 and 12.5% of the 4972 subjects. The rate of hypnagogic hallucinations was related to age. Women were more likely to report such hallucinations. The most frequent type of hallucinations was unexpected, that is kinesthesic (feeling of falling in an abyss) but all types of hallucinations could be present. These hallucinations had no relationship to a specific pathology in more than 50% of the cases but were exclusively present at nighttime. In old age, visual hallucinations are the most frequent. In a cohort of old non-demented subjects, 17.4% of them had hallucinations and behavioural symptoms (anxious agitation or/and irritability). Several neurological pathologies included sleep disorders and hallucinations. Narcolepsy and Parkinson disease (P.D.) will be only considered here. In narcolepsy, with or without cataplexy, hallucinations are now called “secondary” symptom, as they are incidental, reported in 35 to 66% of the patients. Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are most often visual but all types have been described, formed, without whole scenes but terrifying the patient who is often implicated in it and sometimes associated with sleep paralysis, especially during daytime when sleep occurs in REM. Are they pieces of dream? These hallucinations can be differentiated on a phenomenological basis from hallucinations in healthy subjects and from hallucinations in schizophrenia [2]. They have also some differences with hallucinations observed in P.D. [3]. In P.D. hallucinations affected 25% of the patients in long duration disease. They are mainly visual, or with sensation of a presence (person or animal), coexisting with delusions and anxiety. They are rarely only a side- effect of dopaminergic treatment but are often linked to daytime sleepiness with REM sleep attacks, described in this disease and to cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "The Consequences of a Week of Insomnia II: Patients with Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia patients present with a consistent set of complaints that they generally report as secondary to their poor sleep, including increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective overestimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole-body metabolic rate, and longer MSLT latencies. If there is a relationship between the poor sleep and the secondary symptoms, then particularly poor sleep should exacerbate those symptoms. Ten patients with insomnia were identified on the basis of a 2-night screening protocol, then slept in the laboratory for 10 additional nights. On 7 of the nights, the insomnia patients had their wake-after-sleep-onset increased so that their total sleep time was 80% of that on their second screening night, resulting in an average of 254 minutes (of 480 minutes in bed) of sleep. The spectrum of changes seen in these patients with insomnia who had very poor sleep for a week was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation, and not consistent with exacerbation of symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. Specifically, (1) these patients had a reduction as opposed to an increase in the MSLT values, but the MSLT values at the end of the week remained within normal limits; (2) these patients had decreased (as opposed to increased) whole metabolic rate following nights of particularly poor sleep; (3) these patients tended to underestimate (rather than overestimate) their subjective sleep latency while being given particularly poor sleep; and (4) these patients displayed no significant change in body temperature, subjective anxiety, or MMPI scores following particularly poor sleep. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of patients with insomnia, and perhaps the poor sleep itself, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.",

      "title": "Evaluation and management of the non-motor features of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is traditionally viewed as a motor disorder with a characteristic triad of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. There is now increasing awareness that PD is a complex systemic disorder with many nonmotor symptoms (NMS) which include autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, sensory and neuropsychiatric features. NMS become more common in severity and frequency with advancing disease when neuropsychiatric features such as cognitive impairment and psychosis dominate the clinical picture. NMS are strongly correlated with quality of life for patients and their families as well as institutional care placement. Despite their importance, NMS are poorly recognized by clinicians and often undeclared by patients. Use of a validated screening tool NMSQuest followed by specific symptom assessment instruments strengthens the recognition and holistic management of NMS in PD. Some NMS such as mood disturbance, anxiety, pain and insomnia may be improved by optimization of dopaminergic therapy. Conversely, psychosis, excess daytime somnolence or impulse control disorder (ICD) may be triggered by dopaminergic drugs. Other NMS such as dementia and severe depression may be unresponsive to dopaminergic treatment and may reflect perturbations in cholinergic, serotonergic or noradrenergic neurotransmitter function. These symptoms are more challenging to manage but may be ameliorated to some extent by agents such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or antidepressant drugs. This contribution reviews the evidence for the evaluation and management of key NMS in PD (apathy, anxiety, depression, psychosis, dementia, ICD, sleep disturbance, autonomic dysfunction, pain) and highlights the urgent need for both novel therapies and more controlled trials for current therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

OSA juga ditandai dengan rasa kantuk di pagi hari, sering bangun saat tidur, mendengkur, penurunan konsentrasi dan gangguan ingatan. Obstruksi saluran nafas bagian atas tersebut dapat berbentuk parsial(hypopnea) atau komplit(apnea). Kondisi ini dapat terjadi karena beberapa faktor, seperti faktor keturunan, faktor kongenital seperti abnormalitas pada struktur anatomi dan faktor umur, jenis kelamin dan berat badan maupun kondisi medis lainnya. OSA berkontribusi dalam berkembangnya penyakit-penyakit kardiovaskular, seperti hipertensi. Hipertensi adalah gangguan pada pembuluh darah yang didefinisikan apabila tekanan darah sistolik ≥140 mmHg dan / atau tekanan darah diastolik ≥90 mmHg. Secara umum, hipertensi akibat OSA dimulai dari keadaan hipoksemia yang dilanjutkan oleh inflamasi sistemik dan stress oksidatif, disfungsi endotel, aktivitas saraf simpatik dan aktivasi sistem renin-angiotensin-aldosteron, dan kurang tidur yang menghasilkan kontriksi pembuluh darah perifer, peningkatan denyut jantung, dan kekakuan pada pembuluh darah arteri.",

In addition, persistence of muscle tone by electromyographic criteria or excessive muscle twitching during REM sleep or both have been reported in treated and untreated narcoleptic patients. We report that another previously described abnormality of REM sleep, REM sleep behavior disorder, may also be a symptom of narcolepsy. This disorder was found in 10 narcoleptic patients during routine clinical evaluations involving polysomnography and multiple sleep latency tests. During REM sleep, 7 additional narcoleptic patients displayed persistent muscle tone and/or excessive twitching, which we believe to be subclinical components of REM sleep behavior disorder. These 17 patients, diagnosed by established criteria for narcolepsy and for REM sleep behavior disorder, ranged in age from 8 to 74 years. Seventy-one percent were male. Narcolepsy and REM sleep behavior disorder most commonly emerged in tandem. In 3 patients, treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy with stimulants and tricyclics either induced or exacerbated REM sleep behavior disorder.",

In the acute post-concussion state, it is common to feel irritable, more emotional, and to have difficulty falling asleep, which are non-specific symptoms commonly observed in anxiety disorders. Concussion injuries sometimes occur in a psychically charged environment, which may potentiate acute anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. These disorders can then potentiate prolonged post-concussion persistent symptoms. It is important to differentiate between post-concussion anxiety symptoms and the development of an anxiety disorder. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management, as needed, should address the specific anxiety manifestations.",

      "title": "Towards improving the prognosis of stroke through targeting the circadian clock system",
      "abstract": "Rhythmicity of the circadian system is a 24-hour period, driven by transcription-translation feedback loops of circadian clock genes.The central circadian pacemaker in mammals is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which controls peripheral circadian clocks.In general, most physiological processes are regulated by the circadian system, which is modulated by environmental cues such as exposure to light and/or dark, temperature, and the timing of sleep/wake and food intake.The chronic circadian disruption caused by shift work, jetlag, and/or irregular sleep-wake cycles has long-term health consequences.Its dysregulation contributes to the risk of psychiatric disorders, sleep abnormalities, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, cancer, and obesity.A number of neurological conditions may be worsened by changes in the circadian clock via the SCN pacemaker.For stroke, different physiological activities such as sleep/wake cycles are disrupted due to alterations in circadian rhythms.Moreover, the immunological processes that affect the evolution and recovery processes of stroke are regulated by the circadian clock or core-clock genes.Thus, disrupted circadian rhythms may increase the severity and consequences of stroke, while readjustment of circadian clock machinery may accelerate recovery from stroke.In this manuscript, we discuss the relationship between stroke and circadian rhythms, particularly on stroke development and its recovery process.We focus on immunological and/or molecular processes linking stroke and the circadian system and suggest the circadian rhythm as a target for designing effective therapeutic strategies in stroke.",

      "title": "Troubles du sommeil dans la maladie de Parkinson et les autres synucléinopathies",
      "abstract": "Notre premier objectif etait d'explorer des troubles du sommeil peu etudies chez des patients avec synucleinopathies (maladie de Parkinson (MP), demence en corps de Lewy (DCL), demence associee a la maladie de Parkinson (DMP) et atrophie multisystematisee (AMS)): l'insomnie d'une part et les comportements parasomniaques d'autre part. Parmi ces derniers, nous nous sommes surtout interesses aux comportements moteurs anormaux survenant lors du sommeil non-paradoxal (sommeil NREM) chez ces patients. Insomnie : Nos donnees ont montre que les symptomes d'insomnie sont plus frequents chez des patients avec une MP par rapport a des malades atteints d'autres pathologies chroniques. Les symptomes d'insomnie sont correles avec la duree de la MP, mais pas avec les symptomes et signes moteurs ou non-moteurs de la maladie (article 1). Comportements moteurs a partir d'eveils : Les patients avec MP, DCL/DMP et AMS rapportent souvent des comportements a expression motrice, simples et complexes, lies au sommeil, que nous proposons de regrouper sous le terme comportements parasomniaques ( parasomnia behaviors ). Dans tous ces episodes, les patients semblent se comporter comme s'ils etaient en train de vivre leurs reves ou une mise en scene onirique. A la video-polysomnographie, ces episodes surviennent soit dans une periode de sommeil paradoxal stable ou les mecanismes physiologiques d'abolition du tonus musculaire sont deficients, soit lors d'etats intermediaires de conscience entre le sommeil et un reveil qui se produit. Dans ce travail, nous decrivons systematiquement pour la premiere fois les aspects video-polysomnographiques des comportement parasomniaques NREM ( NREM Parasomnia Behaviors, NPBs dans une population selectionnee de patients avec une MP, DCL/DMP et AMS. Par une analyse quantitative du spectre des frequences EEG, nous avons montre que ces phenomenes sont probablement expliques par des mecanismes physiopathologiques differents par rapport aux troubles d'eveil (autrement dits parasomnies NREM) de l'enfance. Les NPBs sembleraient etre des phenomenes plutot rares, d'apparition tardive dans les synucleinopathies (article 3). Nous avons demontre que les comportements moteurs a partir d'eveils NREM etaient plus frequents chez les patients atteints de DCL/DMP que chez ceux atteints de la MP et nous faisons l'hypothese que leur presence soit un indicateur d'evolutivite vers un stade avance de la maladie plutot qu'un marqueur specifique de demence (article 2). D'un point de vue physiopathologique, les comportements observes lors des parasomnies du sommeil paradoxal et non-paradoxal pourraient etre vus comme des fenetres permissives pour l'exploration de l'activite mentale pendant le sommeil. Dans les NPBs cette fenetre serait representee par une defaillance des circuits de l'eveil ( arousal ), de l'attention et de la cognition lors des transitions du sommeil a la veille, tandis que dans le trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal (TCSP), par une defaillance des circuits du controle de l'atonie musculaire. En synthese, les resultats de nos travaux suggerent que l'insomnie et les comportements parasomniaques pourraient representer l'expression clinique d'une alteration fonctionnelle des circuits regulateurs du sommeil et de la veille et du declin cognitif lie a la neurodegenerescence de la MP, la DCL/DMP et l'AMS, leur presence etant un indicateur d'un stade evolutif avance de la maladie. Le TCSP comme modele physiopathologique pour etudier l'akinesie et la bradykinesie : Notre deuxieme objectif a ete la mise en place d'un protocole visant a enregistrer de facon couplee a une videopolysomnographie, les potentiels de champ local des neurones des noyaux sous-thalamiques (NSTs) pendant le sommeil et la veille chez des patients avec un TCSP secondaire a une MP au moyen d'electrodes implantees dans le but d'une stimulation a haute frequence des NSTs. Cette etude est basee sur l'observation que, dans la MP, les mouvements produits en sommeil paradoxal ne sont akinetiques mais proches de la normale. A ce jour, 3 patients ont pu etre recrutes et participer a cette etude (etude Reves Park NST).",

Settling problems, excessive daytime sleepiness, night waking problems, and sleep apnoea are some of the most common sleep problems that adults and children with ID experience. There is considerable evidence to suggest that sleep problems are highly associated with a number of problematic factors in the individuals themselves, their first line carers (i.e. mothers) and their families as a whole. Insufficient sleep has been highly associated with increases in aggression, self injury and property destruction.  Improving sleep and providing successful treatment for individuals with ID can benefit the families and alleviate, if not reverse these trends.  Aims: 1. To assess the efficacy of psychological sleep treatment techniques, such as extinction and sleep hygiene, for severe sleep disorders in adults with ID using a RCT design. 2.

      "abstract": "A patient with a sleep-wake cycle > 24 h recorded his sleep-onset and wake times for 4 years. During this time the patient found himself unable to maintain a 24-h sleep-wake schedule. The lengths of his sleep-wake periods (subjective days) and his sleep periods were highly variable. Nonetheless, there were certain unexpected regularities in his sleep-wake data, corresponding to fixed clock hours. Across the 4-year period, there were certain clock hours during which sleep onset and waking were likely to occur and certain clock hours that may be considered forbidden zones for sleep, during which the patient rarely either began or ended a sleep period. It is possible that the unexpected regularities resulted from partial entrainment to external cues or from some residual influence of an endogenous ultradian-regulating mechanism.",

Akinetic mutism is a condition characterized by a lack of spontaneous movements and little or no vocalization. Somnambulism include performing of complex motor activity in an automatic manner during deep sleep, without any awareness of its execution. The locked-in syndrome is a state with quadriplegia coexisting with cranial nerves palsies and mutism, but with fully preserved consciousness. Psychogenic coma is a condition in which the patient has preserved level of consciousness and awareness, but does not communicate with theenvironment and does not exhibit the external manifestations of consciousness.

Parasonmias appear in the process of falling asleep, at the time of sleep stage changes, and upon awakening. They are common for both healthy children and those with neurological and psychiatric disorders. Brief descriptions of clinical pictures of several groups of parasomnias and their polysomnographic characteristics are presented. Instances of stereotyped rhythmic movements (e.g. head rocking), paroxysmal somatic and behavioral episodes (night terrors and nightmares), \"static\" phenomena (sleep with open eyes, strange body positions), as well as somnambulism are specifically described. Common features of parasomnias as a group have been identified (the \"Parasomnia syndrome\"). It was found that sleep architecture frequently normalizes after a parasomnia episode, whereas parasomnias are self-liquidated after sleep matures (self-cure). The significance of gender differences in parasomnias have been reviewed. Possible compensatory physiological functions of parasomnias acting as \"switches\" or \"stabilizers\" of sleep stages to \"off-set\" deviated or immature sleep-wake mechanisms were discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fact: Actually, inadequate or poor-quality sleep can affect you in many different ways, both psychologically and physically. So much is this the case that often this explanation of your difficulties gets overlooked instead of being dealt with. Many people know they do not sleep well, although many do not ask for help and soldier on as best they can. Others are less aware that their sleep is unsatisfactory and that they could benefit if their sleep was improved. Ideally, a person’s sleep at night should be both long enough (adequate sleep) and also of sufficiently good quality to restore them, so that they feel well and can function properly during the day. Good-quality sleep means that sleep is sound and unbroken. In addition, sleep quality can be impaired (also called ‘fragmented’ sleep) by very brief arousals without you consciously waking up. This happens particularly in later life and in various sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (see Chapter 9), causing daytime sleepiness.",

      "abstract": "Most psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, or neurotic disorders are associated with sleep disorders of various kinds, among which insomnia is most prevalent and important in psychiatric practice. Almost all patients suffering from major depression complain of insomnia. Pharmacological treatment of insomnia associated with major depression shortens the duration to achieve remission of depression. Insomnia has been recently reported to be a risk factor for depression. Hypersomnia is also a major sleep problem in patient suffering from depression. There have been no clinical guide to treat the symptoms of hypersomnia in depression, but some clinical trials treating them with NDRI or adjunctive administration of psychostimulants. In patients with schizophrenia, insomnia is often an early indicator of the aggravation of psychotic symptoms. Electroencephalographic sleep studies have also revealed sleep abnormalities characteristic to mood disorders, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. A shortened REM sleep latency has been regarded as a biological marker of depression. Reduced amount of deep Non-REM sleep has been reported to be correlated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Recently, REM sleep abnormalities were found in teenagers having post-traumatic stress disorder after a boat accident. Although these facts indicate that insomnia plays an important role in the development of psychiatric disorders, there are few hypotheses explaining the cause and effect of insomnia in these disorders. Here, we reviewed recent articles on insomnia and hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorders together with their clinical managements.",

L’association avec les troubles du sommeil est décrite chez 25 % à 50 % des enfants et chez plus de la moitié des adultes présentant un TDA/H. La question de cette comorbidité pose question. En effet, Il n’est pas clair à l’heure actuelle si les troubles du sommeil sont intrinsèques au TDA/H ou s’ils se produisent à la suite d’un trouble primaire du sommeil sous-jacent. En effet, il est décrit des symptômes de « type TDA/H » dans certains troubles du sommeil primaires tels que les troubles respiratoires du sommeil, les mouvements périodiques des membres pendant le sommeil et le syndrome des jambes sans repos. De plus, la somnolence diurne excessive (l’un des symptômes de la narcolepsie et l’hypersomnie idiopathique) peut « mimer » des symptômes de TDA/H. Dès lors, la similitude de certains symptômes peut conduire à des erreurs diagnostiques entre troubles primaires du sommeil et TDA/H. Ainsi, nous nous proposons lors de ce symposium de faire un point sur les liens entre troubles du sommeil et TDA/H chez l’adulte : – en effectuant tout d’abord une revue de la littérature explorant la comorbidité entre ces différents troubles. Puis en présentant ensuite deux études originales sur ce thème en population adulte : – explorant d’une part, la comorbidité des hypersomnies (hypersomnie idiopathique et narcolepsie) chez les adultes TDA/H et la comorbidité TDA/H chez des adultes hypersomniaques ; – d’autre part, en explorant la somnolence diurne excessive objective par un test de maintien de l’éveil en population adulte TDA/H et l’impact de cette somnolence sur les performances de conduite des sujets (sur simulateur de conduite).",

      "title": "Primera convulsión en apirexia",
      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC. Sin embargo, en la mayor parte de los casos las crisis no provocadas se presentan en ninos en los cuales no LOS EXPERTOS RESPONDEN Arch Pediatr Urug 2002; 73(4): 233-235",

      "title": "Central s sleep a apnoea, p pathogenesis a and ttreatment: a an o overview and p perspective",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of reported sleep disturbances in a general popula- tion is high. Many of the complaints are the result of sleep-related breathing dis- orders, due mainly to the occurrence of obstructive and central apnoeas. Obstructive sleep apnoea is a fully described and well-recognized entity. Central sleep apnoea (CSA) however, has been poorly studied. There is accumulating evidence that central sleep apnoea should be considered as the end of a spectrum. Instability in the breathing pattern is the main under- lying mechanism and is due to the interaction of many factors. Breathing during sleep is dependent on metabolic control and the activity of the respiratory muscles. Decreased chemical drive and/or failing respiratory muscle function are associated with CSA and usually also with ongoing hypoventilation during wakefulness, char- acterized by chronic daytime hypercapnia. Central respiratory drive can also be inhibited by upper airway reflexes. Mostly, however, CSA occurs as the hallmark of unstable breathing during sleep brought about by an overall increase in loop gain (especially in light sleep stages) and the unmasking of a CO 2 threshold. Arousal following central apnoeas acts as an amplification of the instability. Micro electroencephographic (EEG) arousals are often observed as a consequence of CSA. They are responsible for sleep fragmentation and hypersomnolence during the day. The daytime hypersomnolence and complaints of awakenings during sleep in patients with CSA can be striking. CSA can occur in specific pathologies, such as chronic heart failure and (post-traumatic) brain lesions, that are associated with irregular breathing. Treatment strategies are remarkably few in number. Use of nasal ventilation and the inhalation of CO 2 are mainly of theoretical interest, since patients do not often tolerate these more invasive therapies. Drug treatment, especially with aceta- zolamide, is easier to perform. Stimulation of upper airway reflexes, by less inva- sive methods, seems to be promising for the near future.",

These episodes of hypoxia or apnea can lead to tissue inflammation, and are causal factors of disturbed sleep in both men and women. Several lines of evidence suggest that sleep patterns differ along the lifespan in both male and female subjects, and this may result from the influence of female gonadotropic hormones on sleep. Compared to men, women have more sleep complaints, as women's sleep is not only influenced by gonadotropins, but also by conditions related to these hormones, such as pregnancy. It is therefore not surprising that sleep disturbances are seen during menopause, too. Factors that may play a role in this type of SDB in women include vasomotor symptoms, changing reproductive hormone levels, circadian rhythm abnormalities, mood disorders, coexistent medical conditions, and lifestyle factors.",

The sleep's two primary phases that most people experience is REM, and NREM. We spend between 75 and 80 percent of our sleep time during the NREM phase and the remaining part in the REM phase. Unwanted psychological effects like sadness, nervousness, hostility, poor mental health and disorders of hyperactivity and attention deficiency have been linked to poor quality of sleep. The cardiac system is essential for controlling pressure and pulse throughout various phases of sleep. In the early phases of NREM, heart rate and blood pressure are higher, while cerebellar blood flow is decreasing. Studies have revealed connections between the disorders the coronary artery, hypertension, and sleep quality. Because Sleep-related autonomic dysregulation disturbs sympatho-vagal balance, The progression of these diseases might be influenced by it. Furthermore, a number of sleep problems have an additional effect on cardiovascular health. Older adults experiencing insomnia face an increased chance of getting cardiovascular conditions. Heart conditions are also linked to syndrome of restless legs (RLS), obstructive sleep apnoea, and narcolepsy. What we know about the long-lasting consequences of inadequate sleeping on heart wellness is still lacking, even though 84 Various categories of sleep disorders have been recognized. To investigate these connections and broaden our knowledge of this subject more research is required. In light of these findings, our recommendations highlight how important it is for medical experts and practitioners to share information, and increase patient awareness on good sleep hygiene. Healthcare professionals can help reduce the total burden of heart disease by disseminating information on the value of sleep quality and how it affects cardiovascular health. the prompt detection and treating sleep disturbances is critical to enhancing cardiovascular outcomes.",

The disturbance of circadian rhythms is one of the core factors in the genesis of the most affective disorders including depression, which indicates the role of the internal biological clock in the pathophysiology of affective disorders. The episodes of depression, mania or hypomania may result from the disturbances in endogenous biological timing. In this review, we have summarized the literature data obtained in animal models or in the patients with affective pathology, in which the connection between the function of sleep and depression was demonstrated. Specifically, we highlight the mechanisms underlying sleep dysfunction during depression (imbalance of circadian rhythms, melatonin metabolism and mechanisms of neuroinflammatory dysregulation) and provide an evidence for the link between sleep function and depression (sleep disturbances during depressive episodes, the effects of pharmacotherapy, chronotherapy, the effect of sleep deprivation, comorbidity of obstructive sleep apnea and depression).",

Mit dieser Ausnahme sind die Spezifitäten aller bisherigen klinischen prodromalen Marker gering.

      "abstract": "We report two cases of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), comparing the clinical and laboratory features of these predominant neurological patients and reporting their different outcome. NMO - a severe demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system - primarily affects the spinal cord and optic nerves, resulting in longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and/or optic neuritis. Our patients had a late pSS diagnosis, due to the absence of sicca syndrome and specific Sjögren serology in the early stages of their diseases, when the neurological symptoms prevailed. Many NMO patients have an accompanying autoimmune disease, most commonly Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus or a related profile of non-organ-specific autoantibodies. Neurologic involvement occurs in approximately 20% of patients with pSS, usually preceding the diagnosis (in 75-80% of the cases) [1,2]. The frequency of both neurologic manifestations (revealing pSS) and negative autoimmune serology, especially in the event of CNS involvement, could explain why underlying pSS is misdiagnosed [3,4]. Screening for pSS should be systematically performed in cases of acute or chronic myelopathy and/or cranial nerve involvement, mainly because these patients have a severe outcome. The presence of the anti-aquaporin4 antibodies, besides anti-Ro and anti-La, in both reported cases, is intriguing and raises the question of whether we are facing two distinct diseases or the NMO is just complicating an unusually less expressive Sjögren's syndrome subtype.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sleep disturbance was identified as one of the main characteristics and biological markers of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. Sleep initiation, sleep maintenance and terminal insomnia with unrefreshed sleep and disturbing dreams have been consistently reported in the studies of adults with MDD. Hypersomnia has been reported in a subset of adult depressives. Although sleep disturbances may be present throughout all phases of a depressive disorder, they are most severe during an acute episode. Patients with depression who report sleep disturbances are more likely to attempt suicide than those who do not report difficulties with their sleep. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep to such a degree that patients may have vegetative symptoms of depression. Thus, it is important when assessing a depressed patient with sleep difficulties to consider a thorough sleep assessment to rule out a physiological cause of vegetative symptoms of depression and insomnia. Those with depression who also exhibit sleep disturbance can benefit from behavioral and relaxation training (1).",

      "abstract": "In 10 female patients (age 2-26 years) with clinical evidence of Rett Syndrome (RS), unusual and prominent rhythmical theta activity (4-5/sec or 5-6/sec) proved to be the outstanding EEG feature. This pattern was present in waking state and/or sleep. When it was noted in the waking state, the localization (vertex, central region and vicinity) and blocking responses to active or passive movements suggested a slow equivalent of Rolandic mu rhythm (in two patients associated with a posterior 10-12/sec alpha rhythm). In sleep, rhythmical theta activity was either Rolandic or more diffuse, sometimes independently occurring with central spikes. The prominent rhythmical 4-5/sec or 5-6/sec activity and its relationship to Rolandic mu rhythm suggest a dysfunction of the motor cortex in RS. This would be congruent with the frequent observation of central spikes. EEG evidence of motor cortex dysfunction might be helpful in the understanding of this enigmatic disorder and conducive to the following hypothesis: RS is characterized by motor cortical dyscontrol due to primary frontal lobe dysfunction. The usefulness of EEG, however, is limited to insights into the (secondary) motor-cortex dysfunction.",

The alteration of consciousness during epileptic seizures is discussed with respect to these findings: Alterations of consciousness during epileptic seizures may be produced by subcortical, i.e., reticular formation, and/or cortical dysfunction followed by excessive, hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. An impairment of consciousness during absence seizures may be due mainly to cortical dysfunction; during complex partial seizures (CPS), it may be due to dysfunctional subcortical neuronal structures. The mechanisms underlying an alteration of consciousness are defined as causing “irritative” functional disturbances and/or as having “inhibitory” effects on consciousness‐related structures.",

      "abstract": "Sleep bruxism (SB) is reported by 8% of the adult population and is mainly associated with rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) characterized by repetitive jaw muscle contractions (3 bursts or more at a frequency of 1 Hz). The consequences of SB may include tooth destruction, jaw pain, headaches, or the limitation of mandibular movement, as well as tooth-grinding sounds that disrupt the sleep of bed partners. SB is probably an extreme manifestation of a masticatory muscle activity occurring during the sleep of most normal subjects, since RMMA is observed in 60% of normal sleepers in the absence of grinding sounds. The pathophysiology of SB is becoming clearer, and there is an abundance of evidence outlining the neurophysiology and neurochemistry of rhythmic jaw movements (RJM) in relation to chewing, swallowing, and breathing. The sleep literature provides much evidence describing the mechanisms involved in the reduction of muscle tone, from sleep onset to the atonia that characterizes rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Several brainstem structures ( e.g., reticular pontis oralis, pontis caudalis, parvocellularis) and neurochemicals ( e.g., serotonin, dopamine, gamma aminobutyric acid [GABA], noradrenaline) are involved in both the genesis of RJM and the modulation of muscle tone during sleep. It remains unknown why a high percentage of normal subjects present RMMA during sleep and why this activity is three times more frequent and higher in amplitude in SB patients. It is also unclear why RMMA during sleep is characterized by co-activation of both jaw-opening and jaw-closing muscles instead of the alternating jaw-opening and jaw-closing muscle activity pattern typical of chewing. The final section of this review proposes that RMMA during sleep has a role in lubricating the upper alimentary tract and increasing airway patency. The review concludes with an outline of questions for future research.",

However, some women experience severe physical and/or psychological symptoms before menstruation, which, if left untreated, can lead to a reduced quality of life. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) remain unclear. Despite the fact that PMS etiology remains unknown, there are some theories and studies supporting them that inappropriate inflammatory response and oxidative stress may be considered as the causes of occurrence of PMS. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be nonspecific and individual for each specific woman, the diagnosis is made only on the basis of symptoms, pathognomonic hormonal disorders do not exist. Rarely, the symptoms are expressed to an extreme degree and disrupt the ability to work and the rhythm of a woman’s life, then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) should be assumed, which is often underestimated, and the patient should be recommended to record her symptoms for ≥2 cycles. Usually, the treatment of premenstrual syndrome involves a combination of various methods in order to determine the most effective in each individual case: treatment includes lifestyle changes, micronutrient support, herbal medicine, pharmacotherapy. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives are first line for PMS and PMDD. Herbal medicines are used as maintenance therapy. Transdermal estradiol and cyclical gestogens in phase 2 of the menstrual cycle can be used as second line hormonal therapy.",

      "abstract": "Article Abstract Sleep disorders can be divided into those producing insomnia, those causing daytime sleepiness, and those disrupting sleep. Transient insomnia is extremely common, afflicting up to 80% of the population. Chronic insomnia affects 15% of the population. Benzodiazepines are frequently used to treat insomnia; however, there may be a withdrawal syndrome with rapid eye movement (REM) rebound. Two newer benzodiazepine-like agents, zolpidem and zaleplon, have fewer side effects, yet good efficacy. Other agents for insomnia include sedating antidepressants and over-the-counter sleep products (sedating antihistamines). Nonpharmacologic behavioral methods may also have therapeutic benefit. An understanding of the electrophysiologic and neurochemical correlates of the stages of sleep is useful in defining and understanding sleep disorders. Excessive daytime sleepiness is often associated with obstructive sleep apnea or depression. Medications, including amphetamines, may be used to induce daytime alertness. Parasomnias include disorders of arousal and of REM sleep. Chronic medical illnesses can become symptomatic during specific sleep stages. Many medications affect sleep stages and can thus cause sleep disorders or exacerbate the effect of chronic illnesses on sleep. Conversely, medications may be used therapeutically for specific sleep disorders. For example, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder may be treated with dopamine agonists. An understanding of the disorders of sleep and the effects of medications is required for the appropriate use of medications affecting sleep.",

Therefore, the identification of pre-existing risk factors and early diagnostic biomarkers is of high medical relevance. However, no objective biomarker has yet progressed into clinical practice. Sleep disturbances represent commonly reported complaints in PTSD patients. In particular, changes in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) properties are frequently observed in PTSD patients. Here, we examined in a mouse model of PTSD whether (1) mice developed REMS alterations after trauma and (2) whether REMS architecture before and/or shortly after trauma predicted the development of PTSD-like symptoms. We monitored sleep-wake behavior via combined EEG/EMG recordings immediately before (24 h pre), immediately after (0-48 h post) and two months after exposure to an electric foot shock in male C57BL/6N mice (n=15). PTSD-like symptoms, including hyperarousal, contextual and generalized fear, were assessed one month post-trauma. Shocked mice showed early-onset and sustained elevation of REMS compared to non-shocked controls. In addition, REMS architecture before trauma was correlated with the intensity of acoustic startle responses, but not contextual fear, one month after trauma. Our data suggest REMS as prognostic (pre-trauma) and symptomatic (post-trauma) marker of PTSD-like symptoms in mice. Translated to the situation in humans, REMS may constitute a viable, objective and non-invasive biomarker in PTSD and other trauma-related psychiatric disorders, which could guide pharmacological interventions in humans at high risk.",

Tal es el caso de la aparicion de periodos de somnolencia durante las jornadas laborales, lo cual se ha convertido en una causa importante de accidentes automovilisticos, industriales y medicos. La somnolencia es causada por el ritmo circadiano y la privacion del sueno, es un estado fisiologico donde el tiempo de respuesta es mas lento que los niveles normales, los principales sintomas de somnolencia son la falta de capacidad de concentracion, atencion, vigilancia y dificultades para mantenerse despierto (Abbood, et al., 2014). En esta tesis se presenta el desarrollo de un sistema de asistencia no intrusivo para la deteccion de somnolencia en tiempo real, que alerta al usuario si es necesario, con el objetivo de reducir el numero de accidentes causados por somnolencia. El dispositivo desarrollado esta basado en el monitoreo de ritmo cardiaco debido a que el sistema nervioso autonomo afecta el latido del corazon de una persona con somnolencia (Bader, 2002). En este proyecto se realizaron estudios aplicando la metodologia seis sigma para el desarrollo de productos, basandose en una muestra de 20 usuarios, monitoreando su ritmo cardiaco a lo largo de sus actividades diarias para determinar sus rangos de vigilia y sueno, posteriormente se realizaron pruebas con un simulador de manejo activando un sistema de asistencia cuando su estado de alerta disminuia drasticamente. Como sistema de asistencia se incorporo una alarma sonora para recuperar el estado de alerta del usuario, debido a los efectos del sonido en las primeras etapas del sueno. Se identificaron variaciones importantes en el ritmo cardiaco que pueden ser utilizadas para la estandarizacion del monitoreo de somnolencia, manteniendo la medicion del estado de alerta, sin importar los rangos de ritmo cardiaco de cada persona.",

      "abstract": "Disturbed sleep is a common subjective complaint among individuals with anxiety disorders. Sleep deprivation increases general and specific anxiety symptoms among healthy individuals. The amygdala is critical for regulating anxiety and also involved in mediating the effects of emotions on sleep. Neuropeptide S (NPS) and NPS receptors (NPSR) are reported as a novel endogenous arousal and anxiolytic system, but it is unclear yet whether this system is involved in anxiety-like behavior and sleep caused by sleep deprivation, and how it plays anxiolytic effect underlying the comorbid condition. In the present study, we demonstrate that paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) induced by modified multiple platform method (MMPM) for 24 h caused anxiety-like behavior, a prolonged sleep latency and subsequent paradoxical sleep (PS) rebound accompanied by an increase in electroencephalogram (EEG) theta (4.5-8.5 Hz) activities across light and dark phase in rats. The increase of PS after PSD was due to an increase of episode number during light phase and both episode number and duration during dark phase. Central action of NPS (1 nmol) attenuated PSD-induced anxiety-like behavior, and altered PSD-induced sleep-wake disturbances through increasing wakefulness, and suppressing PS and EEG theta activities. The reduction in PS time following NPS administration during light phase was because of a decreased episode number. Furthermore, sleep amount in 24 h in PSD rats given NPS was lesser than that given saline. PSD significantly enhanced NPSR mRNA expression level in the amygdala. NPS remarkably increased the number of Fos-ir neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the central amygdala (CeA) and medial amygdala (MeA). The majority of Fos-ir neurons induced by NPS also expressed NPSR. These results suggest that NPSR upregulation in the amygdala is presumably related to the PSD-induced anxiety-like behavior and sleep disturbances, and that NPS counteracts PSD-induced anxiety-like behavior and sleep disturbances possibly through activating the neurons bearing NPSR in the amygdala. In addition, the little sleep increase in PSD rats treated with NPS suggests that NPS can function as an anxiolytic without causing a subsequent sleep rebound.",

Postpartum depression is associated with anxiety, mood swings, tiredness, feeling scared all the time, trouble sleeping or sleeping, weight loss, stress eating, losing interest, sudden weight gain, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions, fatigue and several other issues. It can happen during pregnancy as well as after giving birth. Some women experience baby blues while some experience postpartum depression. Women feel depressed and sadly most of the time. Depression can make it difficult for mother to take care of herself and the child. Various lifestyle choices also need to be mentioned while talking about factors causing PPD. Some factors affecting PPD are lack of physical activity and exercise, bad eating habits, disturbed sleep cycle etc. it may include hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, risk factors, psychological stress. One of the chief factors affecting postpartum depression is the sleep cycle. It is seen that less sleep is brought near to postnatal depression. Exercise, psychosocial support, physical stretching or working activity can decrease symptoms of depression. Exercise causes the release of mood-boosting hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which elevates the mood. Low esteem caused by depression can be decreased by an elevated mood. Exercise can also increase endogenous endorphins and opioids which gives a positive mood. It also increases problem solving capacity and confidence. The most common management methods used for managing depression are psychological support, professional help, interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive therapy.",

However, there are some disorders which are only found in infancy, as in the four conditions which we review below. In spite of great variation between individuals, the general way in which the wakefulness-sleep states mature during the first months of life is well known. In general the physiological patterns of REM and NREM are in general the same in children as in adults. However, the pathological patterns are similar, but there are major differences between them. These differences are mainly physiological, behavioural, parent-child relationship and specific disorders. We shall see that the central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome of infants is not the same as that of adults. The sleep apnea syndrome of the newborn is different to the apneas seen in older children. Benign neonatal myoclonia of sleep are not present in adults, and finally the sudden death of an infant is not like the unexplained nocturnal sudden death or sinus arrest linked to paradoxical sleep in adults.",

The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "Dear Editor-in-ChiefSeveral scholars pointed out the relationship between the function of muscle and teeth (1). The effects of breathing on facial growth and occlusion of the bite have been identified in various papers (2, 3). A breathing disorder occurs after upper airway blockage during sleep, it has not only nighttime symptoms such as snoring or apnea but also daytime symptoms such as behavioral disorder, excessive daytime sleepiness, concentration issue, memory, and cognitive function. Sleep is a physiological phenomenon essential for performing basic human functions and is important for normal growth and development, and for maintaining emotional health and immunity. Among various sleep disorders, Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common medical problem for children (4). Among the sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea has been reported in Korean children and adolescents based on polysomnography, relative to other sleep disorders. Sleep-disordered breathing can be prevented myofunctional therapy, the neuromuscular toning and re-education of oral, facial, and pharyngeal muscles (lips, tongue, cheeks, face, and throat) through a series of activities which helps normalize the developing or developed, head and neck structures and function, with orthodontic treatment (5,6). A recent research literature review shows myofunctional therapy for those whose tongues block their airway during sleep can reduce these choking events by approximately 50% in adults and 62% in children and those lowest blood oxygen saturations, snoring, and sleepiness outcomes improve in adults (7).We now have the evidence-based studies to validate the success of treating patients collaboratively with a variety of disorders (e.g., orthodontic disorders, sleep apnea, orofacial pain) but, until recently, there were not enough studies using oral appliance and myofunctional therapy of Korean children and adolescents. Since cephalometric radiography was introduced by Broadbent to evaluate the craniofacial morphology, as recently reported (8), to evaluate the size of the airways and tongue in patients with sleep apnea, it is widely used, but, not be evaluated in three dimensions.Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a useful nondestructive method for 3D reconstruction that can be used to visualize and measure the morphological structures of hard and soft tissue on face. 3D models reconstructed from CBCT and tomographic images can display the precise anatomical structure of Oropharyngeal space. In addition, CBCT is useful for establishing realtime clinical diagnoses of patients and treatment plans (9). Programs that accurately measure complex structures of 3D models mathematically are available, but no studies have attempted to measure the Oropharyngeal space area using CBCT technology. So, our study was conducted to evaluate three dimensional changes after Myobrace (Myofunctional Research Co, Australia) appliance treatment for the children with OSAS symptoms (Fig. 1, 2). Our study confirmed the increase of oropharyneal airway dimension using Myobrace (Fig. 3). We excluded the sleep symptoms of the participating patients.Although the majority of childhood obstructive sleep apnea is due to hypertrophy of adnexaadenoid, there is no correlation between the magnitude of hypertrophy and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. …",

Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses together with sleep disorders and astheno-neurotic syndrome [3]. Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

      "abstract": "In a general sense, insomnia suggests inadequate sleep quality or quantity when one has an adequate opportunity to sleep. When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society. This chapter will provide an overview of current perspectives on the causes, consequences, and associations of insomnia.ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND PATHOGENESIS",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, and disabling neurological disorder. The incidence of PD increases with age, and therefore the disease is predominantly observed in later life. The prevalence of PD is estimated at 1% in individuals aged 60 years and over, 2–3% in those aged 65 years and over, and 10% in those aged 80 years and over (de Rijk et al., 1997). In clinical practice, PD is classified as a movement disorder and is characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, and gait dysfunction. However, there are a large number of non-motor symptoms observed in PD, including neuropsychiatric complications, sleep disorders, fatigue, sensory symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and gastrointestinal symptoms (Chaudhuri et al., 2011).",

      "title": "Role of serotonin in modulating the development and function of adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb",
      "abstract": "The neuromodulatory transmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is synthesized by neurons located in the brainstem, which project more or less densely to the entire central nervous system (Charnay and Leger, 2010). Serotonin regulates a variety of physiological functions, including food intake, reward, reproduction, sleep-wake cycle, memory, cognition, emotion, and mood (Charnay and Leger, 2010). Consistently, dysfunctions of the serotonergic system are involved in the development or progression of mental disorders including autism, insomnia, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease (Charnay and Leger 2010). Many of these diseases (e.g., autism, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease) present with concomitant impairment of olfaction (and memory), often accompanied by a reduced volume of the olfactory bulb (OB; Figure 1A) and hippocampus. These functional impairments may result from distorted adult neurogenesis in the respective neurogenic niches, as OB and hippocampal dentate gyrus are the two major areas of the adult mammalian brain where adult-born cells are generated throughout life. A wide range of studies documents the involvement of adult-born cells in short- and long-term olfactory memory; perceptual, associative, and fear learning, etc. (summarized in Lepousez et al., 2015; Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020).Figure 1: Region-specific effects of serotonergic signaling on adult neurogenesis.(A) Scheme of the mouse head showing the location of the nasal cavity, olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb (OB), and the cortex. (B) Magnification of the area, delineated by the broken line in A, showing olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs, orange) within the olfactory epithelium projecting to the OB and terminating in the glomeruli. Adult-born cells (green) arrive in the OB after migration along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) from the subventricular zone (SVZ). Serotonergic fibers (red) originate from the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei in the brain stem and target adult-born cells in the SVZ (1), RMS (2), and OB (3). OC: olfactory cortex; LV: lateral ventricle. (C) Upper panel: close-up of the three framed areas in B. Left: In the SVZ, radial glia-like cells (B cells) give rise to transient amplifying cells (C cells), which then generate neuroblasts (A cells). Middle: in the RMS, neuroblasts migrate along the glial sheets to the OB. After arrival, they switch to radial migration. Right: In the OB, neuroblasts mature to become granule (GCs) and juxtaglomerular (JGCs) cells. EPL: External plexiform layer; GCL: granule cell layer; GL: glomerular layer; MCL: mitral cell layer; ONL: olfactory nerve layer. Lower panel: serotonin (5-HT) receptors involved in serotonergic signaling in the respective region.Interestingly, adult neurogenesis and olfactory memory are positively modulated by fluoxetine, an antidepressant drug and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Siopi et al., 2016). Cumulative evidence points towards a specific role for serotonin in adult neurogenesis, as it has been shown that serotonin modulates the fate and functional state of adult-born cells throughout the entire life. Serotonergic projections innervate both the hippocampus and OB (Charnay and Leger, 2010), as well as their respective neurogenic niches, the subgranular zone and subventricular zone (SVZ) (Soumier et al., 2010; Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2017). Serotonergic fibers innervating the OB originate from the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei and primarily innervate the superficial glomerular layer of the OB (Figure 1B and C), with sparser innervation of granule and mitral cell layers (Petzold et al., 2009; Fletcher and Chen, 2010). Interestingly, the serotonergic innervation of the glomerular layer of the bulb is not homogeneous, as the density and thickness of innervating serotonergic fibers vary between adjacent glomeruli. Within the neurogenic niche in the SVZ, serotonergic inputs run along the wall of the lateral ventricle (Tong et al., 2014). Here, the radial glia-like cells (B cells) give rise to transient amplifying cells (C cells), which then generate neuroblasts (Figure 1C). Serotonin promotes the proliferation of B and C cells in the SVZ (Brezun and Daszuta, 1999; Soumier et al., 2010; Tong et al., 2014). The thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is often used for identification of newborn cells, as it incorporates into the DNA of dividing cells and can later be visualized using immunohistochemistry. Lesioning serotonergic terminals or inhibition of serotonin synthesis leads to a substantial decrease in the number of BrdU-positive (BrdU+) adult-born cells in the SVZ (Brezun and Daszuta, 1999), while an infusion of the serotonin-releasing drug fenfluramine into the lateral ventricle of adult mice significantly increases the number of BrdU+ adult-born cells and doublecortin-positive neuroblasts in the SVZ (Tong et al., 2014). Consistently, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptor agonists increased, while 5-HT2C receptor antagonists decreased cell proliferation in the SVZ of adult mice (Tong et al., 2014). Besides, serotonin application induced depolarising inward currents in B cells, which were partially blocked by 5-HT2C or 5-HT5A receptor antagonists. The co-application of 5-HT2C and 5-HT5A receptor antagonists completely abolished serotonin-induced currents in B cells (Tong et al., 2014). Collectively, these data highlight the importance of serotonin in controlling proliferation and neurogenesis in the SVZ. After leaving the SVZ, adult-born cells - called neuroblasts at this developmental stage - migrate along the RMS towards the OB (Figure 1B and C). Migrating neuroblasts express Ca2+-permeable 5-HT3A receptors and serotonergic fibers, projecting along the RMS, have been shown to control velocity and directionality of neuroblast migration in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2017). Moreover, a constitutive 5-HT3A receptor knockout presented with thinner RMS, smaller OB, and reduced density of parvalbumin- and calretinin-positive interneurons in the granule cell and the external plexiform layers (see Figure 1C for a schematic illustration of the OB layers). Upon arrival in the OB, neuroblasts change from tangential to radial migration (Figure 1B and C) and move towards the OB surface to become GABAergic interneurons in the granule or glomerular cell layers. Ninety percent of these cells become granule cells, while 5–10% migrate into the glomerular layer to become periglomerular or to a lesser extent short axon cells (Lepousez et al., 2015). The latter are collectively referred to as juxtaglomerular cells (JGCs). During the pre-integration phase, i.e. after arrival to the glomerular layer but before the integration into the local circuit (Liang et al., 2016), functional properties of adult-born JGCs differ from those of resident cells. Thus, adult-born JGCs show lower spontaneous ongoing activity, higher odor sensitivity, greater responsiveness to a larger number of odorants, and increased structural plasticity. When adult-born JGCs mature (approximately at 7–8 weeks after birth), their spontaneous and odor-evoked activities and structural plasticity become more similar to those of resident juxtaglomerular cells (Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020). However, many adult-born cells do not survive the maturation process and undergo apoptosis ~15–45 days after their birth. Interestingly, daily treatment with the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin significantly increased BrdU+ cell survival in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus while the same treatment decreased survival of BrdU+ granule cells in the OB (Soumier et al., 2010). Taken together, these observations suggest that starting from their generation in the respective neurogenic niche and until their full maturation, the development of adult-born hippocampal and OB interneurons is controlled by the serotonergic inputs. But do adult-born cells preserve their privileged serotonergic inputs beyond their maturation, i.e. at times, when their functional properties are supposed to align with those of surrounding resident cells? Our data obtained in mature adult-born JGCs (Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020) suggest that this might be the case: after application of the nonselective 5-HT2/5-HT7 receptor antagonist methysergide onto the OB surface of awake mice, we observed a significant and selective decrease in the ongoing activity of mature (> 8 week-old) adult-born JGCs. Surprisingly, the same treatment did not influence resident cells. This suggests that despite their abundance in the glomerular layer, serotonergic fibers preferentially target adult-born cells. What could be the functional role of this privileged connection? Serotonergic projections to the OB were shown to play a key role in selective filtering or attenuation of sensory inputs. Indeed, inhibition of serotonin receptors in general, and 5-HT2C receptors in particular enhanced odor-evoked responses in axons of olfactory sensory neurons projecting from the nose to OB glomeruli, whereas activation of 5-HT2C receptors inhibited these responses (Petzold et al., 2009). This effect was shown to be mediated through presynaptic GABAB receptors and was similar across all examined odorants and glomeruli, with stronger responses being affected to a greater extent than weaker responses. The authors suggested that this effect could be mediated by a subpopulation of GABAergic JGCs that express 5-HT2C receptors and respond to activation or inhibition of 5-HT2C receptors with a respective increase or decrease in odor-evoked Ca2+ signaling (Petzold et al., 2009). In addition to suppressing transmitter release from presynaptic terminals, GABAergic JGCs also contact and inhibit the postsynaptic targets of olfactory sensory neurons - mitral/tufted cells. Interestingly, not all JGCs analyzed by Petzold et al. (2009) were serotonin-responsive, suggesting that this property might be restricted to mature adult-born cells, as described above (Fomin-Thunemann et al., 2020). By controlling their ongoing spontaneous activity (Fomin-Thunemann et al. 2020), serotonergic inputs likely contribute to tonic presynaptic inhibition in the glomerular layer of the OB. Interestingly, serotonin-mediated reduction of sensory-evoked responses was also reported for visual and auditory systems (Petzold et al., 2009), suggesting that the ability of sensory gain control represents a general property of serotonergic inputs. Serotonergic raphe neurons are active during awake resting states, including grooming and rhythmic movements, but not during attentive states of sensory acquisition or sleep (Jacobs and Fornal, 1991; Petzold et al., 2009). Thus, depending on the internal state of the animal and external - environmental - stimuli, serotonergic projections from the brainstem, targeting mature adult-born cells, might influence the strength of the perceived sensory stimulus. Serotonin-responsive adult-born JGCs therefore might serve as coincidence detectors between the internal state of the animal (e.g., arousal, attention, expectation) and sensory inputs from the environment. In this scenario, activation of serotonergic inputs would help to filter irrelevant information, adjust the gain of the system to odor detection/perception, and to maintain responses of mitral/tufted cells within a normal dynamic range. Moreover, the overall reduction of sensory-driven responses during wakefulness might help to reduce the system's noise and to select salient information important to learn or memorize. In the olfactory system, serotonergic signaling was shown to play an important role in the formation of short-term memory and associative conditioning (Fletcher and Chen, 2010). For instance, in neonatal rats, odor-preference learning was impaired when serotonergic inputs were depleted. In adult rats, reducing or blocking serotonergic signaling impeded discrimination of previously learned odorants as well as learning of new tasks (Fletcher and Chen, 2010). In conclusion, serotonergic inputs support major steps of adult neurogenesis in both neurogenic niches of the mammalian brain, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Moreover, even after full integration of adult-born cells into the surrounding neural circuitry and maturation therein, serotonergic inputs convey unique functional properties to adult-born cells, enabling them to play a distinctive role in integrating environmental stimuli in a brain state-specific manner.

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in pregnancy: Why and how should we manage them?",
      "abstract": "Maternal sleep quality worsens during pregnancy, already from the first trimester on and especially in the third trimester.1, 2 Nevertheless, the sleep quality is often ignored by both physicians as well as by women themselves as sleep quality is generally assumed to improve after delivery. However, sleep disturbances may continue during postpartum period or even become chronic. The most important sleep disturbances during pregnancy are primary insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS).2, 3 Sleep disturbances typically cause sleep fragmentation and deterioration of sleep architecture leading to sleep loss and daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties and increase risk for accidents.2, 3 The algorithm of the diagnose and treatments of the most important sleep disturbances in pregnancy is illustrated in Figure 1. Primary insomnia includes both initiation insomnia, which shows as difficulties to fall asleep, and maintenance insomnia, which includes nightly awakenings and too early morning awakenings (being unable to fall asleep again). The etiology of primary insomnia during pregnancy is multifactorial, and might be associated with physical (hyperemesis, nocturia, joint and back pain, heartburn, nasal congestion, thermoregulatory problems, contractions, fetal movements, uncomfortable or unusual sleeping positions, dreams and nightmares) and mental (especially depression and anxiety) causes. Poor sleep quality has shown to be associated with the increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, prolonged labor and increased risk of cesarean section.2, 3 Constant snoring is a typical feature of SDB, which includes sleep apnea and partial upper airway obstruction. In pregnant women, SDB is often caused by partial upper airway obstruction rather than of episodes of frank obstructive apnea.2 Gestational weight gain and estrogen-induced hyperemia, mucosal edema and mucus hypersecretion lead to the narrowing of upper airways exacerbating the risk for SDB. However, progesterone-induced stimulation of breathing, sleeping in lateral position, and decrease in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (during which breathing is more unstable) may protect against SDB. Furthermore, micrognatia and loose throat and larynx are important risk factors for SDB. In addition to snoring, other typical symptoms are headache and dry month in the morning and daytime sleepiness (most typically irresistible falling asleep when inactive). SDB has shown to be in association with increased risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, cesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.2, 4 RLS is a nocturnal neurosensory movement disorder, which is connected with dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the etiology is still unclear, RLS may be idiopathic, genetic, or linked to various disorders, especially iron deficiency. RLS is characterized by unpleasant irritation, creeping, crawling, burning, pins-and-needles or itching sensations, most commonly in the legs. The sensations occur at rest and worsen towards the evening and night. Also smoking, use of caffeine, some medications or alcohol may initiate or exacerbate the symptoms. Transient RLS in previous pregnancies is associated with an elevated risk of new transient symptoms in future pregnancies, as well as with an increased risk for future development of chronic idiopathic RLS.2, 5 An association between RLS and hypertensive pregnancy disorders has been shown.2 Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are known risk factors for anxiety/depression both during pregnancy and postpartum period.1, 2, 6 Sleep disturbances often herald mood disturbances, and pregnant and postpartum women with mood symptoms typically suffer from sleep disturbances, especially from primary insomnia which may increase recurrence of a preexisting mental illness.6 Detection of the origin of the symptoms is the crucial first step in the management of maternal sleep disturbances. For the diagnosis of primary insomnia, questionnaires are feasible and sufficiently adequate tools in clinical practice. Because of the mismatch between subjective symptoms and objectively measured sleep quality, polysomnography, which measures sleep stages, is rarely needed.2 Of note is, that the patient may express having \"worse sleep quality\" or \"insomnia symptoms\", which may not stem from primary insomnia, but are secondary for instance for SDB (maintenance insomnia), RLS (initiation insomnia) or mental symptoms (initiation and maintenance insomnia). If SDB is suspected, ambulatory sleep polygraphy, which measures breathing and blood oxygen level is nessessary.2 In RLS, type and occurrence time of the symptoms and relief of the symptoms by movement, such as walking or stretching the limbs, are diagnostic. As iron deficiency may induce RLS, measurement of serum hemoglobin and ferritin (+C-reactive protein) is essential.5 To detect mental problems, especially depression and anxiety, structural questionnaires can be used.2 Good sleep hygiene is the basis of the treatment of all sleep disturbances. It includes convenient temperature in bedroom, reduced late fluid intake to prevent nocturia, suitable diet in case of gastro-esophageal reflux, massage in case of muscular pain and use of comfortable mattress and pillows. For primary insomnia non-pharmacologic treatments, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, is recommended and effective. It can be carried out as individual or group therapy. Additionally, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise are safe and effective. In case of severe or persistent insomnia, a short-term use of sedatives (including sedative antihistamines), sleeping pills (especially benzodiazepine–like drugs) or low dose antidepressants (with sedative properties) can be prescribed after risks and benefits consideration. However, all these drugs pass the placenta and although no teratogenic effects has been shown, they may be harmful for fetus and new-born. A long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills should not be offered, since they often leads to noxious effects, like deterioration of sleep architecture and dependence on medication. Melatonin or herbal preparations, like valerian, are not recommended for treatment of insomnia during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of safety and efficacy data. In cases of insomnia due to aggravating of mood symptoms, antidepressants, especially serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be warranted.2 The gold standard treatment for SDB is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and it is shown to be safe and effective also during pregnancy. After the diagnosis of SDB, CPAP treatment should be initiated without a delay. Positional treatment, especially lateral sleep posture, is recommendable. In general rule, surgical procedures should not be performed during pregnancy for the treatment of SDB. Local nasal congestive and corticosteroid treatments reduce nasal mucosal edema and thus improve nasal ventilation. In addition, treating respiratory infections effectively and gastro-esophageal reflux with tilted position of the upper body while in bed or proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are also important.2 For the treatment of RLS, per oral iron supplementation (accompanied with C-vitamin for better iron absorption; serum ferritin level <75 μg/L) is recommended. However, in severe RLS (and with serum ferritin level <30 μg/L), oral iron is often insufficient or has a too slow effect and thus intravenous iron, safe also during pregnancy, may be needed. In addition, folate supplementation is favorable for RLS and it is also advisable during the periconception and early pregnancy period for fetal development. In addition, the use of magnesium may be beneficial, although the efficacy data is insufficient. Furthermore, relaxation procedures, walking, stretching, massage, use of compression stockings while sleeping or a warm bath before going to bed may also relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, pramipexole, levodopamin/carbidopamin, opioids, bensodiazepins or gabapentin beyond the first trimester may be needed under a consultation of a neurologist, with the lowest efficient dose, although all these medications may induce risks and side-effects for fetus and new-born.2, 5 Although sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, the sleep quality is not systematically assessed during pregnancy follow-ups. Furthermore, the research evaluating the reasons and consequences of maternal sleep disturbances and the safety and efficacy of the treatments are scant. Good sleep quality is, nevertheless, essential for good quality of life and good health state and thus additional research in the field is indispensable.",

Moreover, such children are at great risk for retardation of mental development; metabolic, cardiovascular, and malignant diseases; and many other health problems at a later age. Early and late complications of preterm birth depend significantly on the gestational age at birth and the intrauterine development conditions of the fetus. Due to the more severe and complicated course of perinatal pathologies, premature babies with fetal growth retardation syndrome constitute a larger risk group. Approximately 50–70% of these children receive long-term treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit after birth. Furthermore, 70% of them face behavioral and memory problems in later life. While the pathologies of the neonatal period in children born prematurely are mainly related to respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and nutritional problems, the complications of premature birth are manifested in children’s early age, preschool, school, adolescence, and other developmental periods.",

      "title": "Sleep deprivation: Impact on cognitive performance.",
      "abstract": "Today, prolonged wakefulness is a widespread phenomenon. Nevertheless, in the field of sleep and wakefulness, several unanswered questions remain. Prolonged wakefulness can be due to acute total sleep deprivation (SD) or to chronic partial sleep restriction. Although the latter is more common in everyday life, the effects of total SD have been examined more thoroughly. Both total and partial SD induce adverse changes in cognitive performance. First and foremost, total SD impairs attention and working memory, but it also affects other functions, such as long-term memory and decision-making. Partial SD is found to influence attention, especially vigilance. Studies on its effects on more demanding cognitive functions are lacking. Coping with SD depends on several factors, especially aging and gender. Also interindividual differences in responses are substantial. In addition to coping with SD, recovering from it also deserves attention. Cognitive recovery processes, although insufficiently studied, seem to be more demanding in partial sleep restriction than in total SD.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s diseases, occuring most often between the ages of 50 and 60 years, on average at the age 58 years is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system of global importance and serious consequences for public health. Its main symptoms are tremor at rest muscle stiffness and bradykinesia, i.e. slowness of movement (the so-called parkinsonian triad). Atrophic lessons of substantia nigra, located in the midbrain, responsible for the production of dopamine, contribute to the onset of symptoms of the disease. Patients with Parkinson’s diseases suffer from a variety of extra-motor symptoms often psychiatric disorders, especially panic or generalized anxiety. The author presents the case of 63 years old man diagnosed with Parkinson’s diseases 4 years ago, with quite a significant severity in the last 2 years. Left limb weakness (upper and lower) deepened and general slowing of movement developed then restless legs syndrome developed fully (specific sensations in the area of the feet and lower legs in the evening and night hours, temporarily decreasing when moving, walking, stretching the muscles). For about 6 months he have had attacks of anxiety and anxiety as well as a fully developed generalized anxiety disorder. The combination of levodopa and carbidopa and pregabalin was used, resulting in a reduction of slowness and stiffness as well as a significant reduction in anxiety and anxiety after approximately 8 weeks.",

      "abstract": "Increased daytime napping, early morning awakening, frequent nocturnal sleep interruptions, and lowered amplitude and phase advance of the circadian sleep-wake rhythm are characteristic features of sleep-waking and chronobiological changes associated with aging. Especially in elderly patients with dementia, severely fragmented sleep-waking patterns are observed frequently and are associated with disorganized circadian rhythm of various physiological functions. Functional and/or organic deterioration of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), decreased exposure to time cues such as insufficient social interaction and reduced environmental light, lowered sensitivity of sensory organs to time cues, and reduced ability of peripheral effector organs to express circadian rhythms may cause these chronobiological changes. In many cases of dementia, the usual treatments for insomnia do not work well, and the development of an effective therapy is an important concern for health care practitioner and researchers. Recent therapeutical trials of supplementary administration of artificial bright light and the pineal hormone melatonin, a potent synchronizer for mammalian circadian rhythm, have indicated that these treatments are useful tools for demented elderly insomniacs. Both bright light and melatonin simultaneously ameliorate disorganized thermoregulatory and neuroendocrine systems associated with disrupted sleep-waking times, suggesting a new, potent therapeutic means for insomnia in the demented elderly. Future studies should address the most effective therapeutic design and the most suitable types of symptoms for treatment and investigate the use of these tools in preventive applications in persons in early stages of dementia.

Sleep disturbances influence many behavioral and physiologic processes, leading to health complications including death. On the other hand, sleep improvement can beneficially influence the course of healing of many disorders and can be a prognostic of health recovery. The factors influencing sleep have different biological and chemical origins. They are classical hormones, hypothalamic releasing and inhibitory hormones, neuropeptides, peptides and others as cytokines, prostaglandins, oleamid, adenosine, nitric oxide. These factors regulate most physiologic processes and are likely elements integrating sleep with physiology and physiology with sleep in health and disorders.",

Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

This is favourably influenced by rehabilitation. Diaschisis most commonly manifests itself by such neurological signs as impaired consciousness or cognitive impairments including dementia, dyspraxias, dystaxias, dysphasias, incoordination and sensory neglect. The nature of diaschisis has been demonstrated by widespread depressions of local cerebral blood flow and metabolism extending far beyond the anatomical lesion. Recovery of function is associated with recovery of local perfusion and metabolism. [Neurol Res 1993; 15: 362-366]",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease affecting up to 3% of the global population over 65 years of age. Currently, the underlying physiological aetiology of PD is unknown. However, the diagnosed disorder shares many common non-motor symptoms associated with ageing-related neurodegenerative disease progression, such as neuroinflammation, microglial activation, neuronal mitochondrial impairment, and chronic autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Clinical PD has been linked to many interrelated biological and molecular processes, such as escalating proinflammatory immune responses, mitochondrial impairment, lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP) availability, increasing release of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired blood brain barrier integrity, chronic activation of microglia, and damage to dopaminergic neurons consistently associated with motor and cognitive decline. Prodromal PD has also been associated with orthostatic hypotension and many other age-related impairments, such as sleep disruption, impaired gut microbiome, and constipation. Thus, this review aimed to present evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction, including elevated oxidative stress, ROS, and impaired cellular energy production, with the overactivation and escalation of a microglial-mediated proinflammatory immune response as naturally occurring and damaging interlinked bidirectional and self-perpetuating cycles that share common pathological processes in ageing and PD. We propose that both chronic inflammation, microglial activation, and neuronal mitochondrial impairment should be considered as concurrently influencing each other along a continuum rather than as separate and isolated linear metabolic events that affect specific aspects of neural processing and brain function.",

      "abstract": "Future sleep research in affective illness will probably continue the current evolution beyond cross-sectional to longitudinal studies, and beyond a largely descriptive emphasis to the testing of specific hypotheses and predictions derived from models of the pathophysiology of depression. These models are and will be variously neurochemical, chronobiological, genetic, and developmental in nature. Adequate testing of these models and predictions from them will require the use of pharmacologic and naturalistic probes and the use of sophisticated CNS imaging techniques. These probes will help further characterize the physiology of depression under conditions of disequilibrium or perturbation, such as following sleep deprivation, REM deprivation, phase advancement of the major sleep period, or the administration of antidepressant drugs with specific monoaminergic activity. Concurrently, if one is to understand further whether the sleep abnormalities of depression are part of a larger circadian rhythm disturbance, investigations will necessarily include 24-h measures of sleep-wake activity, psychomotor activity, and probably core body temperature rhythm under constant routine conditions. A complementary point of view would suggest that more intensive investigative efforts be focused on the first 100 min of sleep at night, since it is the first NREM-REM cycle that seems to show the greatest and most specific deviation in depressed patients from normal controls. Efforts to characterize further this part of the 24-h cycle, with respect to age- and gender-related variance as well as responses to physiologic, hormonal, pharmacologic, and naturalistic probes, are strongly warranted.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability (1, 2). Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, are very common following traumatic brain injury and have been reported in frequencies from 40% (3) to as high as 84% (4). Sleep disruption can be related to the TBI itself but may also be secondary to neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression) or neuromuscular (e.g., pain) conditions associated with TBI or to the pharmacological management of the injury and its consequences. Post-TBI insomnia has been associated with numerous negative outcomes including daytime fatigue, tiredness, difficulty functioning: impaired performance at work, memory problems, mood problems, greater functional disability, reduced participation in activities of daily living, less social and recreational activity, less employment potential, increased caregiver burden, greater sexual dysfunction, and also lower ratings of health, poor subjective wellbeing. These negative consequences can hamper the person’s reintegration into the community, adjustment after injury, and overall QOL. (5) The connection between depression and insomnia has not been investigated within the post TBI population to a great extent. For the general population, clinically significant insomnia is often associated with the presence of an emotional disorder (6). Fichtenberg et al. (2002) (7), in his study established that the strongest relationship with the diagnosis of insomnia belonged to depression. Given the high prevalence of depression during the first 2 years following TBI (8), a link between depression and insomnia among TBI patients makes innate sense. The present study aims at assessing role of sertralline in post TBI insomnia associated with depression.",

Both reduced speed and saccades seen during SPEM, also known as saccadic pursuit (SP), have been studied in PD. A comprehensive literature review analyzed 26 studies of SPEM and PD. It appears that a greater proportion of PD patients have SPEM abnormalities consisting of reduced SPEM gain and/or SP compared to the normal population. It is not clear whether SPEM abnormalities are present early in the disease or begin sometime during disease progression. SPEM abnormalities may be correlated with disease severity but do not fluctuate or respond to dopaminergic medication in the same manner as other motor symptoms in PD. SPEM in PD is composed of normal SPEM interspersed with SP composed of both catch up and anticipatory saccades. This differs from other neurodegenerative disorders and may be related to an inability to inhibit extraneous saccades or to increased distraction reflecting executive dysfunction. Because the basal ganglia are involved in SPEM physiology, degeneration of the SNr neurons in PD may explain abnormal SPEM in this disorder. Since dementia, aging and medication effects influence SPEM, they should be controlled for in future studies of SPEM in PD. SP is easily detected on clinical exam and may be a biomarker for the disease or for disease progression. Oculomotor testing can be an important part of the Parkinson's exam.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has well-known associations with sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoventilation. These disorders naturally follow from the progressive muscle weakness that is the hallmark of DMD. New data is emerging on the prevalence of other polysomnographic features affecting patients with DMD, particularly as they relate to the phenotype of the sleep disorders unique to DMD. We report on a patient with REM sleep without atonia (RWA) in DMD. Report of Cases: A 13-year-old male with DMD was referred for a polysomnogram (PSG) due to new-onset snoring, but there was no history to suggest dream enactment behavior. He was not taking any CNS-acting medication such as serotonergic or sedative-hypnotic medications. Neurologic examination was notable for diffuse symmetric muscle weakness requiring the use of a wheelchair. PSG revealed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with an apnea-hypopnea index of 3/hr overall and 5/hr during REM sleep, a respiratory disturbance index of 9/hr with minimum O saturation of 84%, and evidence of RWA in three 30-second epochs meeting AASM scoring criteria. Dream-enactment behavior was absent during the PSG and historically. Conclusion We report on a previously unrecognized finding of RWA the setting of DMD. While sleep studies are routinely performed in DMD due to the significant association with sleep-disordered breathing and REM-related hypoventilation, the presence of RWA was unusual. The finding of RWA in the setting of a dystrophinopathy prompts important questions. While it is unlikely that RWA is an emerging sign of an ⍺-synucleinopathy in the setting of DMD, its presence in a young teenager raises the possibility of hypocretin deficiency in the setting of DMD, as is the case with myotonic dystrophy type 1 reflecting impaired hypocretin neurotransmission. However, a more attractive explanation is that RWA may promote a protective effect against sleep apnea in patients with vulnerability to REM-related hypoventilation. Our data suggest a potential protective role conferred by the preservation of muscle tone in the setting of sleep apnea in neuromuscular conditions. Support (If Any) None",

The newly developed and validated Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS),10,11⇓ the first specific instrument designed to measure sleep disturbances in PD, aims to provide a bedside/clinical holistic measure of the nocturnal symptom complex of PD in a semi-quantitative manner.\n\nThe gold standards for physiologic measurement of sleep and sleep parameters are polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT). However, these tests measure sleep architecture, require measurements in specialized sleep laboratories, and are relatively expensive. Furthermore, they may not provide information on causes of sleep disabilities such as nocturnal tremor, nocturia, or akinesia.

      "abstract": "Assessment of motor development is an important part of the study of the neuropsychic development of children, which is carried out by a pediatrician during preventive examinations. To identify the causes of motor disorders, in addition to studying the anamnesis, it is necessary to conduct a physical examination of the child with the appointment of additional research methods. It is important to remember that developmental delay does not always indicate the presence of any disease but requires dynamic monitoring. However, if they progress, then these patients are more likely to be diagnosed with specific neuromuscular disorders. In this case, the pediatrician should pay attention to the neurological status of the child, assess visual acuity and hearing. At the same time, one should not forget that motor disorders are often combined with a general developmental delay (mental retardation) of the child. Fasciculation of the tongue, loss of motor skills, organomegaly, coarsening of facial features, increased levels of creatine phosphokinase (more than 3 times higher than normal), respiratory failure, in the presence of general weakness, a sharp deterioration in the child’s condition, accompanied by lethargy, vomiting, development of convulsive syndrome, disorders detected on MRI of the brain, are alarming symptoms that require urgent intervention by specialists (neurologist, genetics). Also, some hereditary (chromosomal and monogenic) diseases are often combined with the development of motor disorders. The best results are achieved if the early diagnosis of diseases accompanied by movement disorders is carried out using an interdisciplinary approach.",

There was no childhood or family history of parasomnia. The events had gradually become more frequent over the years, occurring in the first half of the night within 2 h of sleep onset. There were no triggers, and she had partial amnesia for the events. A diagnosis of adult-onset sleep terrors was made on clinical grounds and supported polysomnographically. Seizures and periodic limb movements were excluded as triggering factors. There was some mild sleep disordered breathing (predominantly non-desaturating hypopnea with a propensity for REM sleep of debatable significance). Imaging of the brain and spine and neurophysiological investigations ruled out lesions, entrapments, or neuropathies as possible causes of pain. Treatment (clonazepam, paroxetine, or gabapentin) was poorly tolerated and made no difference to the nocturnal episodes, while trazodone worsened them. This is the first report of hypnopompic psychic pain in association with a NREM parasomnia. We hypothesize that the pain may represent a sensory hallucination analogous to the more commonly recognized visual NREM parasomnia-associated hypnopompic visual hallucinations and that, as such, it may arise during arousal of the sensory neocortex as confabulatory response.",

      "title": "The Psychoneurobiology of Insomnia: Hyperarousal and REM Sleep Instability",
      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia (insomnia disorder—ID) afflicts up to 10% of the adult population, increases with age and affects more women than men. ID is associated with significant daytime impairments and an increased risk for developing major somatic and mental disorders, especially depression and anxiety disorders. Almost all insomnia models assume persistent hyperarousal on cognitive, emotional, cortical and physiological levels as a central pathophysiological component. The marked discrepancy between only minor objective alterations in polysomnographic parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is still puzzling. We and others have proposed that alterations in the microstructure of sleep, especially in REM sleep (REM sleep instability), may explain this discrepancy and be at the core of the experience of fragmented and poor sleep in ID. The REM sleep instability concept is based on evidence showing REM time to be related to subjective wake time in insomnia as well as increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients compared to good-sleeper controls. Our own work showed that ID patients awoken from REM sleep more frequently reported the perception of having been awake than good sleepers as well as having had more negative ideations. The continuous measurement of event-related potentials throughout the whole night demonstrated reduced P2 amplitudes specifically during phasic REM sleep in insomnia, which points to a mismatch negativity in ID reflecting automatic change detection in the auditory system and a concomitant orienting response. REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep and thus might be particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal, resulting in a more conscious-like wake experience reflecting pre-sleep concerns of patients with ID, i.e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, thus leading to the subjective over-estimation of nocturnal waking time and the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Chronic REM sleep instability might also lead to a dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas activated during REM sleep. Along with a postulated weakened functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, this might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression and anxiety.",

Over-the-counter medications, the first line of defense, have little impact on sleep beyond placebo effects. Ironically, antihistamines in them can increase daytime drowsiness and may enhance the person's belief that sleep is getting worse. When these drugs fail, the chronic sufferer often turns to the physician, who is expected to be ready with medically proved answers. Twenty-seven million prescriptions were written for hypnotics in 1976. Barbiturates, accounting for 20% of these prescriptions, lead to a predictable cycle of dependence, tolerance, and escalating doses. These medications also disrupt the sleep structure. Rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) are suppressed, and the EEG shows increased β activity. Physical and psychological dependence, withdrawal reactions, and \"REM rebound\" reactions (severe nightmares and sleep more disturbed than before taking medication) often accompany attempts to stop using these drugs.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

Moreover, active cortical inhibition suffers particularly, and external inhibition is more pronounced. Upon \"return\" from this state of \"inhibition\" to the customary, real age or condition, one observes steady inhibition and, in some cases, positive induction. This confirms the presence of cortical inhibition in an arbitrarily induced condition of age or fatigue.

      "abstract": "In this review, we discuss dementia, depression, olfactory disturbance, sleep disorders and autonomic dysfunction as nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD). PD with dementia (PDD) is defined as onset of dementia more than 1 year after the onset of parkinsonism. If dementia precedes or occurs less than 1 year after the onset of parkinsonism, a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is made. There is essentially no difference in the pathology of PDD and DLB at autopsy, indicating that Braak's hypothesis, which is extracted from PD/PDD and excluding DLB, may be bias. REM-related behavioral disorder (RBD) or depression, the main locus of which is the brain stem, could precede or occur after the onset of PD or DLB, indicating a descending and ascending path of Lewy body (LB) pathology. A disturbance in olfaction usually precedes the onset of PD. Recent data indicate that severe olfactory dysfunction in PD is an indication of a high probability of mental decline. These clinical observations and our pathological reports support the presence of an olfactory-amygdala extension path of LB pathology in addition to Braak's hypothesis. Our pathological studies of consecutive autopsy cases showed that the involvement of autonomic ganglia was more frequent than that of the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that initial the stage of LB pathology in Braak's hypothesis should be modified.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by loss of the muscle atonia of REM sleep, with release of complex and violent behaviors that are often attempted dream-enactments. This study reviewed the literature on RBD with regard to potentially lethal behavior. A total of 39-41 clinical cases of RBD associated with potentially lethal behaviors to self and/or others were found, involving a child and adults of all age groups, that manifested as choking/headlock (n = 22-24), defenestration/near-defenestration (n = 7), and diving from bed (n = 10). A total of 80.8% (n = 21) were males; 19.2% (n = 5) were females; mean age was 65.6 +/- (SD) 13.8 years (range: 27-81 years, and a child). (Gender/age data were not listed in the remaining cases.) An etiologic association of RBD with a neurologic disorder (or with pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders, n = 4) was present in 21-23 patients. Thus, RBD carries well-documented, potential forensic consequences during RBD episodes that could possibly have been misinterpreted as suicidal or homicidal behavior.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

      "abstract": "Chronic primary insomnia (CPI) is the most prevalent sleep disorder worldwide. CPI manifests as difficulties in sleep onset, maintaining sleep, prolonged sleep latency, and daytime impairment and is often accompanied by cognitive problems such as poor academic performance, poor attention, and decreased memory. The most popular explanation of insomnia is hyperarousal or increased activities of neurons. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep detected by polysomnography (PSG) exhibits a positive relationship with brain homeostasis and can be helpful for optimally preparing an organism for emotional and social function. Limited work has been performed to explore brain function of insomnia patients in combination with PSG analysis.We observed increased ALFF within areas related to hyperarousal such as the midbrain and bilateral extra-nucleus, whereas decreased ALFF was observed within areas associated with memory and attention involving the parietal and occipital lobule and others. Furthermore, the altered ALFF was associated with the duration of insomnia, sleep efficiency, duration of REM, latency of RME and ratio of REM.In this study, we recruited twenty-five CPI patients and twenty-five normal sleep (NS) volunteers as a control group to investigate the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and the correlation between those altered ALFF regions through resting-state fMRI and PSG data.These findings suggest that hyperarousal reflected by ALFF abnormality within brain areas related to cognition and emotion in insomnia associated with REM sleep.",

      "title": "Night Shift Naps Improve Patient and Workforce Safety",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the body’s natural response to sleep loss.1 Interruption in the quantity or quality of sleep affects fatigue,2 which in turn disrupts physical and cognitive functioning. Fatigue not only impairs attention to detail, ability to remain focused, information processing/judgment, and problem-solving, but also memory, reaction time, motivation, communication, mood, and empathy.3–5Many factors contribute to fatigue. Topping the list are staffing and workload demands, scheduling (ie, shift length, rotations, consecutive and overtime shifts), and personal issues such as habits and family responsibilities.2,6 In particular, extended shifts (&gt; 8 hours) have been associated with greater fatigue, drowsiness at work, and need for recovery.7,8 Fatigued nurses are at higher risk of making errors6,9,10 (risk increases 3-fold if shifts are &gt; 12.5 hours),11 burnout,12 and work-related injuries and accidents.10 Patient satisfaction also suffers.12 In another systematic review of 21 studies,8 as shift lengthened, adverse outcomes for patients increased (eg, hypoglycemic events, pneumonia, death), and nurses experienced more occupational injuries such as needle stick and musculoskeletal injuries, health complaints, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes or near crashes.8 In an attempt to assess a countermeasure for fatigue, the PICO (patient/problem, intervention, comparison, outcome) question of interest for this evidence synthesis was, What effect do strategic naps have on sleep and cognitive/psychomotor outcomes of nurses?The search strategy involved CINAHL and MEDLINE. Key words were fatigue, nurses, health care workers, hospitals, and napping. The search was limited to the past 10 years.Ten original research studies were retrieved (Table 1): 3 qualitative, 1 participatory action, 2 descriptive, 1 quasi-experimental, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 1 systematic review. All studies examined the effects of naps on hospital nurses working the night shift, except for the systematic review, which related to shift workers across industries. In most instances, a single nap was studied, but researchers in one study22 examined nightly naps over 3 consecutive nights. Length of naps varied from 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes to 1, 2, and 3 hours. Nap times were highly variable from midnight to 1 am, 2 am to 3 am, and 4 am to 4:30 am.As outlined in Table 1, quantitative and qualitative studies validated that strategic naps rejuvenate nurses. More than 50% of nurses who napped in one study13 could sleep (albeit lightly). Sleep latency, or time to fall asleep, was shortest for nurses who napped from 2 am to 3 am.16 But some nurses had difficulty calming down and unplugging because they wanted to stay informed as patient care was top priority.21 If unable to nap, nurses reported that 4 am to 6 am was the most difficult period for drowsiness.18Nappers reported feeling “energized” and “refreshed,”13,18,21 and sleep inertia (ie, drowsiness and impaired cognitive/psychomotor performance upon awakening) occurred less often.13,18 Another study demonstrated physiological signs of reduced tension from sleeping, including changes in bispectral measures, body temperature, heart rate variability, and activity level.15 Sleep outcomes from napping included less subjective and behavioral signs of sleepiness, and increased vigor.16,19,22 Scott et al19 found that the amount of sleep on workdays improved by 50 minutes on average, and sleep quality improved significantly at 12 weeks. Compared with those who did not nap, nappers also experienced fewer performance lapses, better probed memory recall, faster reaction times, less drowsy driving and better driving performance, faster psychomotor skills during intravenous catheter insertion, and fewer errors or near errors.16,19,22 Intercepted or discovered errors increased because of higher alertness.Most of the evidence for strategic napping to combat detrimental effects of fatigue is level C evidence (Table 2). Strategic naps were rejuvenating with favorable cognitive and psychomotor functions, which led to fewer errors. The timing and duration of naps are important. Naps that occur after the middle of the night (but before 4 am)18,24 promoted better sleep quality and were associated with greater physiological benefit and psychomotor performance. Naps should also not last more than 1 hour25 to prevent sleep inertia, or 30 minutes should be allowed for recovery.18,22Several implications must be considered when developing strategic napping programs. Educating nurses about the effects of fatigue and good self-care—including taking naps before working a night shift or a prolonged stretch—is essential.2 The need for this education to be a higher priority was demonstrated by a recent survey24 where most nurse leaders indicated that their facilities did not educate either managers or staff on risk management issues related to fatigue.26A second consideration relates to assessing the conduciveness of the environment for sleeping. Good quality sleep is more likely if nurses can take a duty-free break with uninterrupted coverage of their responsibilities.2 Nurses in a qualitative study18 provided many reasons for their inabilities to nap— from understaffing to unstable patients. When staffing is an issue, Geiger-Brown et al13 advocated that naps should be offered to nurses with (1) self-perceived sleepiness or shiftwork sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea, insomnia), (2) commutes more than 20 minutes or on rural roads, and (3) rotating (vs fixed) shifts, especially those working their first shift or more than 3 in a row.In addition to acuity and staffing issues, Fallis et al18 reported other barriers to napping. These barriers centered on lack of comfortable spaces, interruptions due to shared space, and fear of sleep inertia. In a recent survey of critical care managers, only 11% reported that a specific nap room was available.27 In another study,20 nurses were challenged by the lack of a predefined nap time and consistent ability to take time to rest. Because of these challenges, nurses have shared preferences such as desire for a staff-exclusive area close to the unit (but separate from break rooms) that offers low lighting, pillows and blankets, timers, and either beds, couches, stretchers, or reclining chairs.18,21 Eye masks and ear plugs also may be helpful.2To compound these challenges, cultural barriers exist. Nurse managers in one study18 were surprised by the ease of implementing a napping program, but they stated that the professional/organizational culture and staff’s perceptual dissonance about the adequacy of staffing affected their ability to take restful breaks. Indeed, staff nurses and managers themselves have alluded to lack of support for napping from managers and senior leaders.18,27 Many nurses are reticent to take naps5 and feel guilty if they do.21 In a current survey, Steege et al26 found that although most nurse leaders recognized fatigue as a significant practice concern with negative consequences, most believed that stigma surrounds acknowledging fatigue because it is “part of the culture of nursing.” Thus, leaders concluded that these social norms have slowed the triggering of organizational priorities toward developing fatigue-management policies that include napping, as advocated for by the American Nurses Association.28Fatigue. Errors. Burnout. Occupational injuries. Adverse outcomes for patients. Drowsy driving. Health complaints. Workplace accidents. Mortality. Patient dissatisfaction. Motor vehicle crashes.

      "abstract": "The functions of sleep include consolidating memories and learning, protection, and recuperation. Two processes regulate the sleep– wake cycle: the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which acts as a self-sustained ‘master clock’; and the ‘homeostatic process’, which tracks the need for sleep. Numerous neurotransmitters mediate the sleep-wake cycle, including melatonin, orexin and melaninconcentrating hormone (MCH). Insomnia can be either primary (not associated with another condition) or secondary to another disease. Optimizing management of the many concurrent disorders associated with insomnia is the first line of therapy, before resorting to hypnotics. With an increasing number of available treatments for insomnia, prescribers need to remain cognisant of the effects of drugs on sleep architecture. However, hypnotics are an addition to, rather than a replacement for, good sleep hygiene, and are indicated for short periods only. Around one person in every 2000 suffers from narcolepsy. Current treatments for narcolepsy may be ineffective on some symptoms, and can cause side-effects. New approaches could transform the management of this distressing disease.",

Beide Erkrankungen haben gemeinsame Symptome wie kognitive Einschränkungen und Veränderungen von Schlafstruktur und Qualität. Wenn sich die Demenz einmal manifestiert hat, können Schlafstörungen wie obstruktive Schlafapnoe, Restless-legs-Syndrom und Parasomnien die Symptomatik verstärken. Die Schlafstruktur zeigt eine Verminderung von langsamwelligem Schlaf und häufiges nächtliches Erwachen mit längeren Wachzeiten. Schlaf ermöglicht es, mittels Aktivierung des glymphatischen Systems Aß- und Tau-Proteine, die sich im Wachen angesammelt haben, aus dem ZNS auszuschleusen. Wegen der bidirektionalen Interaktionen ist es erforderlich, Schlafstörungen vermehrte Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken und sie früh zu diagnostizieren und zu behandeln, um einer Verschlimmerung einer existierenden oder sich entwickelnden Demenz vorzubeugen. Eine Anzahl von subjektiven Fragebögen und objektiven Instrumenten wie Polysomnografie und Aktigrafie stehen für die Diagnostik zur Verfügung. Begleitende Schlafstörungen sollten immer mit behandelt werden (z. B. nasale Überdrucktherapie bei Schlafapnoe). Prävention oder Behandlung sollten immer Verhaltenstherapien wie körperliche Aktivierung, soziale Interaktion und ausreichende Exposition gegenüber Tageslicht beinhalten. Einige Antidepressiva, Melatonin, neue duale Orexinrezeptorantagonisten (in Deutschland nicht zugelassen) und wenige Hypnotika können zur Behandlung empfohlen werden.

      "title": "The Evolution-Driven Signature of Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Evolutionarily based cellular vulnerability can explain clinical and pathological involvement of various structures in Parkinson's disease (PD).Neurons in PD-prone structures share similar features, including long and highly branched axons, spontaneous pacemaker spiking, and elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress. In humans, the metabolic demands in these cells are higher than in other species, due to human longevity and exceptionally large number of synapses per neuron.Neurons displaying vulnerability in PD share strikingly similar cellular phenotypes across various brain structures beyond the substantia nigra pars compacta, including the dorsal vagal motor nucleus, amygdala, locus coeruleus, pedunculopontine nucleus, raphe nuclei, diverse skin, and retinal or heart autonomic ganglia.These structures remain largely unchanged throughout evolution, and there is a mismatch between their relatively evolutionary conservation and the marked expansion of the human telencephalon.In PD, there are numerous clinical repercussions: gait automatization and subconscious blindsight are compromised; imprecise neuromodulatory tuning leads to emotional, autonomic, and sleep–wake dysregulation; ontogenetically primitive behaviours such as rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder re-emerge.Our model bridges from hierarchical concepts to evolutionarily driven connectomics and accounts for the variability and synchronicity of various clinical symptoms across anatomically separated networks. In this review, we approach Parkinson's disease (PD) in the context of an evolutionary mismatch of central nervous system functions. The neurons at risk have hyperbranched axons, extensive transmitter release sites, display spontaneous spiking, and elevated mitochondrial stress. They function in networks largely unchanged throughout vertebrate evolution, but now connecting to the expanded human cortex. Their breakdown is favoured by longevity. At the cellular level, mitochondrial dysfunction starts at the synapses, then involves axons and cell bodies. At the behavioural level, network dysfunctions provoke the core motor syndrome of parkinsonism including freezing and failed gait automatization, and non-motor deficits including inactive blindsight and autonomic dysregulation. The proposed evolutionary re-interpretation of PD-prone cellular phenotypes and of prototypical clinical symptoms allows a new conceptual framework for future research.

The proposed evolutionary re-interpretation of PD-prone cellular phenotypes and of prototypical clinical symptoms allows a new conceptual framework for future research. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease in humans. Age is the principal risk factor, with incidence rising exponentially above 60 years [1.de Lau L.M. Breteler M.M. Epidemiology of Parkinson's disease.Lancet Neurol. 2006; 5: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar]. In a previous Personal View paper, we reviewed anatomical and physiological differences between the PD-susceptible structures in the human brain and their counterparts in other mammals [2.Diederich N.J. et al.Parkinson's disease: is it a consequence of human brain evolution?.Mov. Disord. 2019; 34: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. In this review, we first explore the reasons for focal vulnerability of certain cell types. A unifying pattern of high energy demands at multiple levels crystallizes, based on salient studies that will be discussed in detail. We extend the review beyond the commonly accepted focus on dopaminergic cells by showing that there is also involvement of serotonergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic neurons, all originating in the brainstem or the basal ganglia (BG). With this novel system approach, we link vulnerable networks within an argument related to evolution, based on works of comparative anatomy and clinical neurology. With the input of behavioural evolutionary sciences, we re-interpret key clinical PD syndromes as manifestations of dysfunctional or maladaptive archaic networks. We argue that the structures at risk modulate automated behaviours in response to environmental challenges, and we give salient clinical examples supporting this hypothesis. However, we draw attention to the fact that the available literature does not link this re-interpretation to all PD symptoms, especially when it comes to those appearing lately in the course of the disease. As the arguments develop, we hope to cement the concept that there may be an evolutionary mismatch within the human brain due to the dichotomy between areas (specifically the telencephalon) where cellular numbers and network complexity have increased markedly and areas of the brain that have largely remained static in terms of these indices. These data are closely linked to selective vulnerability of certain cell types and to the evolutionary rooting of PD syndromes. In 1997, Parent [3.Parent A. The brain in evolution and involution.Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 651-667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] stated that 'structures that appear early in the evolution are among the first to undergo involution in ageing diseases' and 'the neurodegenerative processes at play specifically target the most phylogenetically ancient components of the brain, including the SN.' But how? Based on immunohistochemical findings, Parent and co-workers suspected that characteristics of the axon are a key to understanding the degenerative process of human PD [4.Parent A. et al.Organization of the basal ganglia: the importance of axonal collateralization.Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar]. Indeed, the human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) projections have highly branched terminal regions with an extraordinary number of synaptic release sites. For one dopaminergic neuron reaching out to the human striatum this number has been estimated to be between 1 × 106 and 2.4 × 106, with highest values in neurons originating in the lateral part of the SNc [5.Bolam J.P. Pissadaki E.K. Living on the edge with too many mouths to feed: why dopamine neurons die?.Mov. Disord. 2012; 27: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 6.Redgrave P. et al.Goal-directed and habitual control in the basal ganglia: implications for Parkinson's disease.Nat. Rev.

In order to maintain the connections, axons develop a high degree of arborization: they become hyperbranched. Although these data suggest primarily an unfavourable ratio of SNc neurons to striatal and suprastriatal cortical neurons, it could also be that the degree of hyperbranchism as well as the number of synapses that one single SNc axon has to form in the human striatum goes up in a secondary, compensatory way when other SNc neurons succumb to the disease process or to old age. Anyhow, it has been estimated that the energy cost of axon potential propagation and synaptic release increases exponentially with hyperbranchism [8.Pissadaki E.K. Bolam J.P. The energy cost of action potential propagation in dopamine neurons: clues to susceptibility in Parkinson's disease.Front. Comput. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar] (Figure 1). When taking into account that the length of a single SNc dopamine (DA) neuron exceeds 4 m, it is instantly obvious that the bioenergetic demands associated with such abundant vesicular transmitter release are likely to be daunting [9.Attwell D. Laughlin S.B. An energy budget for signaling in the grey matter of the brain.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2011; 21: 1133-1145Crossref Scopus (1690) Google Scholar,10.Sengupta B. et al.Information and efficiency in the nervous system – a synthesis.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2013; 9e1003157Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. Other neurons at risk in PD also have highly branched axons with thousands of transmitter release sites at telencephalic targets, although quantitative estimations as in the case of dopaminergic neuron are currently lacking. For instance, serotonergic neurons from the raphe nuclei have long and highly branched axons that innervate forebrain areas including the striatum [11.Deneris E. Gaspar P. Serotonin neuron development: shaping molecular and structural identities.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. Dev. Biol. 2018; 7https://doi.org/10.1002/wdev.301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar]. Pedunculopontine cholinergic neurons, locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons, and lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons, all have long, highly branched axons that innervate the telencephalon (see [12.Uchihara T. et al.Propagation of Aβ, tau and α-synuclein pathology between experimental models and human reality: prions, propagons and propaganda.Acta Neuropathol. 2016; 131: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 13.Mena-Segovia J.

Imaging. 2011; 38: 576-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar] and Figure 2). Of note, the evolutionarily well-conserved melanopsin-containing ganglion cells in the retina also widely innervate various brain structures, including not only their primary target the suprachiasmatic nucleus but also the superior colliculus (SC) and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus [17.Berson D.M. et al.Phototransduction by retinal ganglion cells that set the circadian clock.Science. 2002; 295: 1070-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar,18.Hattar S. et al.Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells: architecture, projections, and intrinsic photosensitivity.Science. 2002; 295: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar]. Beyond this undeniable energy challenge, it has to be questioned how subtle gauging or calibration can be maintained in highly branched systems and how precise feedback should function. Adequate feedback seems to be maintained in early human life, but this is no more the case in PD, as clinically confirmed by less adequate tuning of movements, emotional expressions, and reactions [19.Bowers D. et al.Startling facts about emotion in Parkinson's disease: blunted reactivity to aversive stimuli.Brain. 2006; 129: 3356-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar]. While efficiently adaptive to development, hyperbranching is at risk for breakdown with age, causing reversion to slower, coarser, and less adaptive behaviours, all characteristic features of PD (see Box 1 on other contributing, deleterious evolutionary mechanisms).Figure 2Hyperbranchism of Different Neuronal Networks at Risk for Involvement in Parkinson's Disease (PD).Show full caption(A) Wide-ranging axonal arborization of a GPi neuron (from [15.Parent M.

In this perspective the BGs have undergone what is called 'exaptation'. This is where an 'ancestral core unit is co-opted for multiple functions'. By changing the input and output targets, these loops simultaneously process different modalities and impact different physiological functions [72.Grillner S. Manira A.E. Current principles of motor control, with special reference to vertebrate locomotion.Physiol. Rev. 2020; 100: 271-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar]. One set of circuits thus handles emotional, cognitive, and motor functions in parallel, despite increasing complexity of the information input. Can exaptation also increase the vulnerability to the ageing process? Does it lead to higher vulnerability to genetic mutations and environmental toxins? In particular, does human 'frequent reliance on habitual performance' [7.Hernandez L.F. et al.Dopaminergic vulnerability in Parkinson disease: the cost of humans' habitual performance.Trends Neurosci. 2019; 42: 375-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar] strain such systems?Antagonistic PleiotropyAntagonistic pleiotropy has been proposed to explain cognitive decline in old age [156.Magalhães J.P. Sandberg A. Cognitive aging as an extension of brain development: a model linking learning, brain plasticity, and neurodegeneration.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar]. The cellular phenotype of PD-prone neurons – pacemaker status, hyperbranching axons – functions well during young age, but succumbs later on. As human SNc dopaminergic neurons have to service larger striatal territories, they are able to transitorily – but not permanently – compensate efficiently by producing higher amounts of dopamine than, for instance, mouse neurons [157.Burbulla L.F. et al.Dopamine oxidation mediates mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.Science. 2017; 357: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar]. Later on, this same mechanism enhances cellular vulnerability by a human-specific and time-dependent pathological cascade starting with increased mitochondrial oxidant stress and resulting, among others, in lysosomal dysfunction and aSyn accumulation [157.Burbulla L.F. et al.Dopamine oxidation mediates mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.Science. 2017; 357: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar].Evolutionarily Imposed Trade-offsFar outreaching, energy-greedy neuronal networks may have been optimal for development during early life, but may become deleterious in late life. This dilemma has been crisply described as 'a tangle of trade-offs: energy versus function' [158.Maklakov A.A. Chapman T. Evolution of ageing as a tangle of trade-offs: energy versus function.Proc. Biol. Sci. 2019; 286: 20191604Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. In the nervous system the energy demands are enormous: with 2% of body volume the human brain consumes 20% of energy, with synapses requiring the highest portion (Figure 1). Among the energy trade-offs posited to explain telencephalization in humans, the 'expensive tissue' hypothesis has been among the most popular, as it proposes an evolutionary trade-off between the size of the human brain and the size of the human digestive tract, which has become considerably smaller than for a primate of human body size [159.Aiello L.C. Wheeler P. The expensive-tissue hypothesis: the brain and the digestive system in human and primate evolution.Curr. Anthropol. 1995; 36: 199-221Crossref Google Scholar,160.Navarrete A. et al.Energetics and the evolution of human brain size.Nature. 2011; 480: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. Despite better digestibility of current human food, this places a burden on PD-prone enteric neurons. Other functional trade-offs directly challenge the BG. Among them, bipedal locomotion has to be mentioned. When comparing with quadrupedal walking in chimpanzees, human bipedalism is 75% less costly and attributable to extension of the hip and hindlimb [161.Sockol M.D. et al.Chimpanzee locomotor energetics and the origin of human bipedalism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12265-12269Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar].

However, at the BG level, it demands higher organizational complexity when coordinating forward locomotion. Examination of the somatodendritic region of at-risk neurons gives additional insight into the factors that might drive vulnerability. The dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tier of the SNc are slow, autonomous pacemakers with broad action potentials and large oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration [20.Surmeier D.J. et al.Dopaminergic modulation of striatal networks in health and Parkinson's disease.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 29: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,21.Surmeier D.J. et al.Parkinson's disease is not simply a prion disorder.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 9799-9807Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar]. While facilitating the pacemaking process, the Ca2+ oscillations also drive mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, by loading juxtaposed mitochondria with Ca2+. This feed-forward bioenergetic control mechanism appears to be phylogenetically old, as it is present in muscle as well [22.Balaban R.S. Domestication of the cardiac mitochondrion for energy conversion.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2009; 46: 832-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar]. The mechanism ensures that sustained synaptically driven activity in dopaminergic neurons does not fail because of ATP depletion. This is critical in the BG because even short periods of inactivity in dopaminergic neurons would cause suppression in ongoing goal-directed movements, with possibly dire consequences to the organism's survival. Similarly, noninterrupted activity is crucial for other systems, including those maintaining circadian rhythms, preparedness in the form of arousal changes, and fight and flee responses or active avoidance behaviour [13.Mena-Segovia J. Bolam J.P. Rethinking the pedunculopontine nucleus: from cellular organization to function.Neuron. 2017; 94: 7-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,23.Hormigo S. et al.Circuits that mediate expression of signalled active avoidance converge in the pedunculopontine tegmentum.J. Neurosci. 2019; 39: 4576-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. The feed-forward bioenergetic control system comes at a cost, however, when the induced oxidant stress diminishes the function of mitochondrial Complex I and increases mitochondrial damage and mitophagy [24.Grünewald A. et al.Mitochondrial DNA depletion in respiratory chain-deficient Parkinson disease neurons.Ann. Neurol. 2016; 79: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. When reaching a critical tipping point, PD-vulnerable neurons (at different sites) go over a bioenergetic 'cliff', become senescent, and die. In this context, it has to be mentioned that in the healthy condition the basal rate of oxidative phosphorylation in dopaminergic SNc neurons is already at the near maximal rate sustainable by the mitochondrial network and that the most actively involved mitochondria are located at the most extended arborizations",

Some are psychoform (e.g., one dissociative agent hearing another dissociative agent speak), others are somatoform, or sensory and motor (e.g., being analgesic while another dissociative agent is in pain). Somatoform and psychoform dissociative symptoms often occur together. Somatoform dissociative symptoms are characteristic of dissociative disorders and proportional to their complexity. The disorders include ICD-10's Dissociative Disorders of Movement and Sensation, inadequately renamed in ICD-11 Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder. Sensory and motor dissociative disorders are categorized in DSM-5 as Conversion Disorder. This is confusing, because the symptoms involve dissociation, not conversion of something mental into something physical. PTSD, which can be seen as a simple dissociative disorder, is associated with marked somatoform dissociation. Adverse events, particularly chronic interpersonal abuse and neglect, and the motivational conflicts this adversity typically implies, constitute an important causal factor of somatoform dissociation.",

      "abstract": "It was in the second half of the twentieth century that Sleep Medicine was recognized as an immensely respected field of clinical research. As a result, past few decades have seen this field making some giant strides towards a better understanding of the neurochemical mechanisms that regulate the state of sleep and wakefulness. This involves a complex interplay of neuronal systems, neurotransmitters and some special nuclei located in the brain. Major wakefulness promoting nuclei being the orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamic region and the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) while the sleep-promoting nucleus being ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). Sleep-related complaints are one of the common complaints encountered by the physicians and the psychiatrists. As, long-standing sleep disturbances can have far-reaching implications on an individual’s physical, mental and social wellbeing, the importance of drugs affecting sleep and wakefulness could not be stressed upon anymore. Broadly, the sleep disorders are classified as insomnia, hypersomnia, and parasomnia and the presently available drugs work either by acting on the sleep-promoting GABAergic system like benzodiazepines, barbiturates etc. or by interacting with wakefulness promoting system like histaminergic system, 5- hydroxtryptaminergic system, orexinergic system etc. There are drugs which interact with other mechanisms which modulate arousal, like melatonin receptor agonists which promote sleep and adenosine receptor antagonists which promote wakefulness. This review article tries to have an overview of the available drugs for use in pathological states of sleep and wakefulness with a special emphasis on the commonly prescribed drugs and the recently approved one’s.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) is a relatively rare but probably underestimated disorder, where affected patients exhibit nocturnal eating episodes with impaired consciousness and subsequent amnesia. SRED has originally been classified as NREM (non-rapid eye movement) parasomnia, with an obviously high number of concomitant sleep disorders. We suggest that SRED may represent a heterogenous disease, based on accumulating data in recent studies. Some SRED patients may be better classified as sleep-related movement disorders with an underlying dopaminergic dysfunction. Hypnotic drugs may play a crucial role in triggering amnestic SRED in both parasomnic and sleep-related movement-disordered SRED.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Attention is a fundamental behavior. It comprises different processes and is integrally involved in diverse cognitive functions. Attention encompasses generalized activation of the cognitive processes of orienting, filtering, and selecting inputs; preparing for action; and maintaining thought on a stimulus, mental activity, or goal. Attention, a vital foundation for higher cognitive functions, maintains a coherent stream of thought. The ability to sustain attention, or vigilance, is necessary for complex behaviors, such as understanding and remembering a story. Therefore, attention must be tested first, before other cognitive functions. An inattentive patient’s failure to perform calculations sheds no light on arithmetic skills. Rather, attentional dysfunction is a central feature of syndromes due to diffuse cerebral dysfunction such as delirium, as well as syndromes due to focal cerebral damage such as the neglect syndrome. In addition, attentional dysfunction often accompanies other cognitive impairments in such common neurological.",

      "abstract": "During its pre-motor stage, Parkinson’s disease (PD) presents itself with a multitude of non-motor symptoms with different degrees of specificity and sensitivity. The most important among them are REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and olfactory dysfunction. RBD is a parasomnia characterized by the loss of REM sleep muscle atonia and dream-enacting behaviors. Olfactory dysfunction in individuals with prodromal PD is usually described as hyposmia (reduced sense of smell) or anosmia (complete loss of olfactory function). These symptoms can precede the full expression of motor symptoms by decades. A close comprehension of these symptoms and the underlying mechanisms may enable early screening as well as interventions to improve patients’ quality of life. Therefore, these symptoms have unmatched potential for identifying PD patients in prodromal stages, not only allowing early diagnosis but potentially opening a window for early, possibly disease-modifying intervention. However, they come with certain challenges. This review addresses some of the key opportunities and pitfalls of both RBD and olfactory dysfunction as early markers of PD.",

      "abstract": "AbstractNarcolepsy is a neurological disorder affecting the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. It is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and other rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-associated manifestations (eg, hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The recognition of this disorder is usually delayed by 10 to 15 years, largely because of its protean manifestations, insidious nature, and lack of physician awareness. Delayed diagnosis is associated with poor quality of life, depression, and increased likelihood of accidents. Health care providers should include narcolepsy in the differential diagnosis of patients with excessive sleepiness, chronic fatigue, sleep-disordered breathing, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Narcolepsy is a lifelong disorder that often requires pharmacological treatments, which may include wake-promoting stimulants for excessive sleepiness and γ-hydroxybutyrate (sodium oxybate) and antidepressants for REM sleep-associated manifestations. This article presents a case of a 47-year-old man with long-standing sleepiness and cataplexy who was eventually diagnosed with narcolepsy 30 years after the first onset of symptoms. The presenting manifestations of narcolepsy, diagnostic criteria, and its management are also discussed.Keywords: narcolepsyhypersomniasleepinesscataplexyREM sleep",

This has potentially serious consequences for the individual, employers, and society as a whole. Apnea refers to short spells when breathing stops. In obstructive sleep apnea, the throat constricts during sleep, preventing breathing; the apnea episode often ends with a loud snore and/or gasp. Such an event is sufficient to open the throat muscles to allow breathing, and the patient usually falls asleep again so quickly that the event is not remembered. This cycle repeats itself throughout the night as the muscles relax and the throat blocks again, and the frequency of the episode is used to determine the severity of the syndrome.",

Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

      "abstract": "markdownabstractAcross the world, people continue to live longer, resulting in increasing numbers of older people. Age-related functional deficiencies, such as problems in gait and daily functioning, will therefore become a major issue for society. People with problems in gait and daily functioning are at high risk to lose independence, which will eventually lead to institutionalization. Furthermore, poor gait and daily functioning are strong risk factors of various morbidities, such as falling, and even death. \r\nHowever, little remains known on the underlying processes leading to problems in gait and daily functioning. Both gait and daily functioning are complex processes, requiring integration of input from various systems, such as the proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual system. The nervous system has a central role in this integration, with the peripheral nervous system conducting the information, which is subsequently processed by the brain. \r\nDeficiencies of the nervous system, particularly the brain, may therefore have a large impact on gait and daily functioning. With aging and various neurological diseases, such as dementia and Parkinson’s disease, pathology accumulates in the brain. Brain pathology may be visualized as structural brain changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and as microstructural brain changes with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Both structural and microstructural brain changes are known to strongly affect brain functioning, as measured by cognition. However, much less is known on how this loss of brain functioning affects gait and daily functioning.",

These differences have been shown to be reliable in large numbers of patients during the past five years and appear to extend to differences in sleep between depressive pseudodementia and dementia with secondary depression.

      "title": "Troubles du comportement en sommeil paradoxal idiopathiques et associés à la maladie de Parkinson : analyse comportementale et neurophysiologique du traitement des informations visuelles",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) has been recognized formally as a parasomnia in 1986 by Carlos Schenck. RBD is characterized by loss of normal muscle atonia during rapid eye movement sleep, associated with motor activity from simple jerks to elaborate, often violent, behaviors. This motor activity occurs while dreaming, and has been described as “acting out dreams”. RBD are frequent in Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD patients with RBD show more severe cognitive disorders and have a higher risk of developing dementia than patients without RBD. When isolated and with no identified pathological etiology, RBD are considered as “idiopathic” (iRBD). This “idiopathic” form has been questioned due to the presence of markers of neurodegeneration (cognitive disorders, structural and functional cerebral abnormalities) in iRBD patients. A quite large number of iRBD patients will eventually develop parkinsonism and/or dementia after several years. A recent study reports a delayed emergence of parkinsonism/dementia in 81 % of iRBD patients with a mean interval of 14 years from onset of RBD. These data has leaded to consider RBD as a symptom of the PD “pre-motor” stage. This classic progression of PD staging (pre-clinic, pre-motor, motor, dementia) is not found in every PD patient. It would rather reveal a specific PD sub-type characterized by many non-motor symptoms preceding parkinsonism and with a higher risk of early dementia. Cognitive disorders would be one of these non-motor symptoms, especially affecting visual perception. The goal of this doctoral dissertation was to study the relationship between RBD, visual perception disorders and PD. The first study aimed at identifying the nature of visual perception disorders in iRBD patients, based on specific assessments of visuo-spatial functions. The results showed a deficit of the intermediate stage of visual perception in iRBD patients. PD patients had a similar deficit which was more severe when associated with RBD. The second study focused on the analysis of the possible cerebral dysfunction underlying this visual perception deficit in iRBD patients. This study was based on the recording of the Ncl (negativity associated with closure), a cognitive event-related potential indexing the ability to recognize an object even partially occulted, mainly based on the intermediate stage of object processing. The results showed no Ncl component in iRBD patients. This is in line with a cerebral dysfunction located in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), a region belonging to the ventral visual pathway. The third study examined the cognitive profile of treatment-naive PD patients, first at the time of diagnosis and then one year later. Previous published data demonstrated that the presence of RBD is associated with more severe cognitive disorders in treated PD patients. Based on the first assessments of our group of treatment-naive patients, we examined whether these differences already exist at the time of diagnosis. The objective of the second evaluation session was to determine whether PD patients with RBD had a higher risk of early severe cognitive impairments than non-RBD patients. At the first session, 17 of the 57 patients (30%) met the criteria for RBD. At that time, RBD was not found to be associated with cognitive decline. We did not find clinical differences related to PD or others sleep disorders between RBD and non-RBD PD patients. Some yet isolated results might reflect a trend towards a potential decline in RBD patients. At the second session, only RBD patients but not non-RBD patients showed a cognitive slowing. RBD patients may also have a trend toward apathy. A longer follow-up study is needed to confirm this trend. [...]",

      "title": "A cognitive model of recurrent nightmares",
      "abstract": "Nightmares are a prevalent mental disorder resulting in disturbed sleep, distress, and impairment in daily functioning. Elaborating on previous theoretical models for anxiety disorders, sleep disorders and dreaming, this study introduces a cognitive model of recurrent nightmares, the central element of which concerns representation of the nightmare’s repetitive storyline in the memory as a script. It is suggested that activation of this script during REM sleep results in a replay of the nightmare, and that activation occurs through perceived similarity between dream elements and the nightmare script. The model proposes a central role for cognitive processes in the persistence of nightmares over time. The success of cognitive-behavioural treatments is explained and clinical implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders including insomnia, sleep apnea and circadian rhytym disruption are common among older adults. We prospectively examined the association between objectively measured sleep disorders and subsequent cognitive function and diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. We studied 1309 women (mean age, 82.3 ± 3.2) who were enrolled in an ongoing prospective study and completed several days of wrist actigraphy and a subset (N = 298) with overnight polysomnography (PSG). Approximately 5 years later, we assessed cognitive outcomes including a neuropsychological test battery and adjudicated clinical cognitive status (normal, MCI or dementia). Sleep parameters of interest included: apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) score ≥ 15 events/hr to define sleep disordered breathing (SDB); sleep fragmentation, as manifested by greater nighttime wakefulness after onset (WASO); total sleep time (TST); and circadian rhythm acrophase shift. Women with SDB had more than twice the odds of developing MCI/dementia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28 - 4.25) compared to women without SDB. Increased risk of MCI/dementia (adjusted OR = 1.71, 95% CI, 1.22-2.45) was also observed for women with a delayed acrophase (>1 SDfrom mean) when compared to those with average acrophase timing. Women with greater nighttime wakefulness had greater likelihood of impaired performance on a test of global cognition (adjusted OR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.16- 4.87), verbal fluency (adjusted OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.10- 4.28) and delayed verbal recall (adjusted OR = 1.83, 95% CI 0.94,-3.54). TST was not associated with cognitive impairment. Sleep disturbances are associated with increased risk of developing cognitive impairment 5-years later in older women. These findings suggest that older adults should be monitored for sleep disturbances and that interventions designed to improve sleep need to be investigated with particular attention to cognitive outcomes.",

The alertness deficit is caused by the displacement of work to the circadian phase which is least conducive to alert behaviour, by extension of the time spent awake and by the reduction of sleep length (due to circadian interference with sleep). Sleepiness will be extreme when the three causes are operative simultaneously. The three factors may be used quantitatively to predict sleepiness.",

The most commonly reported sleep disorders were sleep fragmentation (52.5%), vocalisation (60%), REM sleep behaviour disorder (47.5%), and nocturnal stridor (19%). Except for sleep fragmentation, the incidence of these disorders was significantly higher than in PD. Sleep problems tended to be associated with more severe motor symptoms, longer disease duration, depression, and longer duration of levodopa treatment. Half of patients with MSA with sleep disorders complained of daytime somnolence compared with 30% of patients with PD. Daytime somnolence was significantly associated with disease severity in MSA. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study shows that sleep disorders are more common in patients with MSA than in those with PD after the same duration of the disease, reflecting the more diffuse underlying pathological process in MSA.",

The patient in this chapter is experiencing two nonmotor symptoms—pain and insomnia.

The most common cause for insomnia is untreated or undertreated nocturnal parkinsonism, which is very responsive to levodopa therapy. If a medical condition requiring further evaluation is excluded and a temporal relationship between pain and the medication schedule is recognized, the emphasis should be on adjusting dopaminergic medication accordingly.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with severe disability and adverse effects on life quality. In PD, motor dysfunction can occur, such as quiescence, muscle stiffness, and postural instability. PD is also associated with autonomic nervous dysfunction, sleep disorders, psychiatric symptoms, and other non-motor symptoms. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compact (SNPC), Lewy body, and neuroinflammation are the main pathological features of PD. The death or dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons in the dense part of the substantia nigra leads to dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia and motor dysfunction. The formation of the Lewy body is associated with the misfolding of α-synuclein, which becomes insoluble and abnormally aggregated. Astrocytes and microglia mainly cause neuroinflammation, and the activation of a variety of pro-inflammatory transcription factors and regulatory proteins leads to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. At present, PD is mainly treated with drugs that increase dopamine concentration or directly stimulate dopamine receptors. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a family of cellular signaling proteins strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. FGF and its receptor (FGFR) play an essential role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system as well as in neuroinflammation and have been shown to improve the survival rate of dopaminergic neurons. This paper summarized the mechanism of FGF and its receptors in the pathological process of PD and related signaling pathways, involving the development and protection of dopaminergic neurons in SNPC, α-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. It provides a reference for developing drugs to slow down or prevent the potential of PD.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

Major determinants are development and aging as well as alterations following injury and compensatory brain reorganization. While during early development haptic perception is refined due to maturation and experience, haptic perception during aging deteriorates due to many factors, not all of them fully understood. Besides these lifespan factors, it is common wisdom that haptic perception and skills in general improve through practice (Fig. 1), see also [1]. Perceptual learning involves relatively long-lasting changes to an organism's perceptual system that improve its ability to respond to its environment and are caused by this environment.

      "abstract": "The word “apnea” means literally \"without breath\", and thus “sleep apnea” means not breathing while sleeping. Normally, during sleep we do not have pauses in-between breaths. Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

      "title": "The effect of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs on sleep of schizophrenic patients",
      "abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia commonly report problems related to disturbed sleep, most often presenting as difficulties with sleep onset latency (SOL) or with sleep maintenance, whereas others have identified disrupted circadian sleep control such as phase delay and even free running cycles. Several studies have evaluated objective measures of sleep abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia by means of polysomnographic techniques. While the majority of published reports are associated with substantial methodological problems that confound interpretation of the data presented, some consistent patterns of findings can be observed across a number of studies examining sleep physiology in schizophrenic patients. The most consistently reported findings have included prolonged SOL and increased wake time after sleep onset (WASO). Additionally, some studies reported diminished slow-wave sleep (SWS) time in patients with schizophrenia as compared to healthy controls, and other studies noted short REM latency (REM-L). However, the latter two findings were not as consistently replicated across studies. Considerable progress has been made in recent years in delineating neurobiological mechanisms involved in the regulation of sleep and wake states as well the coordination of transitions within sleep from one state to another (e.g., regulating transitions from non-REM to REM sleep stages). In addition to the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems glutamate and GABA, monoamine neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), acetylcholine (ACh) and histamine have all been demonstrated to play important roles in the sleep state regulation process. Antipsychotic drugs, including both the typical and atypical antipsychotic classes, have all been shown to produce prominent inhibitory effects at DA D2 receptor sites. Additionally, to varying degrees, different antipsychotic drugs produce modulatory effects on 5-HT, NE, ACh and histaminergic receptors, thereby providing a strong rationale for anticipating prominent effects of antipsychotic drugs on sleep physiology when administered to patients with schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders as well as to healthy control subjects. A number of studies have reported data on effects of antipsychotic drugs on sleep measures in patients with psychiatric disorders and in healthy control groups. Many of the published reports are noted to have significant methodological limitations, making interpretation of the findings tenuous in some cases. Nevertheless, some consistent patterns of findings have been reported to date. In general, administration of typical antipsychotic drugs has been noted to result in improved sleep continuity, as characterized by increased total sleep time, increased sleep efficiency and decreased SOL and WASO. In these studies, SWS was generally not altered but REM-L was occasionally increased. In studies examining effects of the atypical antipsychotic drugs, generally similar patterns of improvement of sleep continuity measures have been reported across the various agents in this class, but some differences have been noted in terms of effects on SWS and on parameters of REM activity. Differences in effects of various atypical antipsychotic drugs on sleep may be explained by their differing pharmacological mechanisms of action. Substantial limitations are noted in terms of the studies of effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs on sleep. For several of the drugs in this class, no published studies have characterized their effects in the clinical populations in which they are used most extensively. Thus, there is a need for much further work in this area of great clinical importance.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is often related with sleep disorders. In clinical practice insomnia is a common feature in schizophrenia. Difficulty falling asleep, maintaining or achieving a restful sleep is associated with symptoms severity and has been listed as a prodromal symptom of psychotic relapse. Sleep disturbances in schizophrenia may arise during the acute phase of illness and persists in many cases in chronic phase.The authors intend to review the main sleep disturbances observed in schizophrenia, the possible pathophysiological mechanisms, their clinical impact, and the effects of antipsychotic medication on sleep architecture.This study was carried out a systematic search of published literature from January 1965 to May 2010, through PubMed, using the following key words: sleep, REM sleep, NREM sleep, schizophrenia, polysomnography, actigraphy and antipsychotics.Most changes found in objective studies using the polysomnography, in patients with schizophrenia are: reduction of total sleep time, decrease in slow wave sleep, REM latency and sleep efficiency. Studies using actigraphy also reveal that these patients experience changes in circadian rhythm sleep disorders, specifically the irregular type and phase advance. Although some sleep disorders improve with antipsychotic treatment, in many cases, even during the remission of the disease, sleep continues fragmented , suggesting that there are physiopathologic mechanisms involved in sleep disturbance in these patients.Privation of adequate and restful sleep has a negative impact on rehabilitation strategies, quality of life of patients with schizophrenia, and may contribute to worsening of cognitive deficits.",

This occurs despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep to occur and is associated with impairment of daytime function. Patients with insomnia may describe frequent extended periods of wakefulness during the sleep period or persistent morning awakenings that are earlier than desired (terminal insomnia). Insomnia can be divided on the basis of its duration into transient or short-term (lasting only a few days to three to four weeks) or chronic (persisting for more than one to three months). This chapter on pharmacologic therapy of sleep disturbance will be limited to the treatment of chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of Review: Sleep disorders are among the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recent longitudinal studies of sleep in PD have utilized validated sleep questionnaires and video-polysomnography performed over multiple time points. This review summarizes existing longitudinal studies focusing on the prevalence, associations, and changes of sleep disorders in PD over time, as well as the methodologies used in these studies. Recent Findings: Fifty-three longitudinal studies of sleep in PD were identified: excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless legs syndrome, and shift work disorder were studied in addition to other studies that had focused on either multiple sleep disorders or broadly on sleep disorders as a whole. The prevalence of sleep disorders increases over time and are associated particularly with non-motor features of disease. RBD is now considered an established prodromal feature of PD, but other sleep disorders do not clearly increase risk of subsequent PD. Further work is necessary to determine if treatment of sleep disorders in PD alters disease symptom and their progression or reduces PD risk. Summary: Longitudinal studies of sleep in PD have demonstrated a high prevalence of sleep disorders that are associated with non-motor features of PD which can increase over time. More work is necessary to determine if treatment of sleep disorders can alter the course of PD.",

Primary and secondary insomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RDB), central sleep apnea, restless legs, and nocturnal akinesia are common sleep disturbances in PD. Prodromal presence of RBD is associated with a more severe motor and non-motor PD subtype implying a significant disease-modifying effect of this parasomnia. Other disease-modifying mechanisms of sleep disturbances in PD include impaired glymphatic clearance, endoplasmic reticulum stress, nocturnal brain deoxygenation and inflammatory processes among others. Impairments of neural circuit switching and imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations are likely responsible for episodic sleep disturbances, in particular RBD. As neural circuits may predict patterns of α-synuclein propagation in the nervous system, impairments of such circuits are of high relevance for PD pathophysiology. Future research is needed to determine whether appropriate treatment for disturbed sleep might slow progression of PD.",

A highly differenciated diagnostic effort is required as sleep in children is extremely variable between individuals, undergoes a constant matural development and depends of cultural influences on sleep behavior. The pathogenesis is predominantely due to environmental variables, especially to the child-parent interaction. Besides somatic diseases, as Sleep Related Breathing Disorders, Restless legs syndrome and nocturnal seizures play an etiologic role. Psychological and somatic factors in the development of sleep disorders have in common that they exercise a serious negative impact on cognitive daytime functioning and behavior. In this paper the interdependence of somatic and psychological factors and the relations between disturbed nighttime sleep and impaired daytime functioning will be discussed. Especially in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder these relations can be demonstrated. Conclusions are drawn for a specific, stepwise diagnostic approach in childrens sleep disorders.\r\nKeywords: sleep disorders - sleep-wake rhythm - Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder -\r\nRestless legs syndrome - sleep apnea",

      "abstract": "Absent or markedly reduced REM sleep with cessation of dream recall has been documented in numerous neurological disorders associated with subcortical dementia including Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and Huntington's chorea. This report concerns a 69 year old Parkinsonian patient who experienced complete cessation of dreaming since the onset of motor disability 13 years ago. Long term treatment with levodopa and dopamine (DA) receptor agonists (bromocriptine and pergolide mesylate) did not affect dream recall. However, dreaming was restored after the patient received three treatment sessions with AC pulsed picotesla range electromagnetic fields (EMFs) applied extracranial over three successive days. Six months later, during which time the patient received 3 additional treatment sessions with EMFs, he reported dreaming vividly with intense colored visual imagery almost every night with some of the dreams having sexual content. In addition, he began to experience hypnagogic imagery prior to the onset of sleep. Cessation of dream recall has been associated with right hemispheric dysfunction and its restoration by treatment with EMFs points to right hemispheric activation, which is supported by improvement in this patient's visual memory known to be subserved by the right temporal lobe. Moreover, since DA neurons activate REM sleep mechanisms and facilitate dream recall, it appears that application of EMFs enhanced DA activity in the mesolimbic system which has been implicated in dream recall. Also, since administration of pineal melatonin has been reported to induce vivid dreams with intense colored visual imagery in normal subjects and narcoleptic patients, it is suggested that enhanced nocturnal melatonin secretion was associated with restoration of dream recall in this patient. These findings demonstrate that unlike chronic levodopa therapy, intermittent pulsed applications of AC picotesla EMFs may induce in Parkinsonism reactivation of reticular-limbic-pineal systems involved in the generation of dreaming.",

The sleep and wake cycles are controlled by the pacemaker activity of the superchiasmic nucleus in the hypothalamus but can be disrupted by diseases of the nervous system causing disordered sleep. A lack of sleep has been associated with an increase in all–cause mortality. Likewise, sleep disturbances and sleep disorders may disrupt neuronal pathways and have an impact on neurological diseases. Sleep deprivation studies in normal subjects demonstrate that a lack of sleep can cause attention and working memory impairment. Moreover, if untreated sleep disturbances and sleep disorders such as Obstructive Sleep Apnoe (OSA) can also lead to cognitive impairment. Poor sleep and sleep disorders may present a significant risk factor for the development of dementia. In this review, the underlying mechanisms and the role of sleep and sleep disorders in the development of neurocognitive disorders (dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)) and, how the presence of sleep disorders could direct the process of diagnosis and management of neurocognitive disorders will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Perspectivesver long periods oftime, months and years, arterial Pco2 and P02 are closely regulated, but over shorter periods, constancy of arterial blood gas tensions is perhaps an impractical or even an undesirable objective.It is now appreciated that fluctuation within limits is an inherent feature ofnormal function and that there are cycles of activity and rest that modify re- spiratory regulation as well as other regulatory processes (1, 2).Many of these cycles, like the sleep-waking cycle, are circadian, with a period of -24 h, and seem to be keyed to the revolution of the earth.Sleep, like breathing, seems to be essential to health, and adverse physiological and psychological consequences occur with sleep deprivation (3, 4).However, the need to adjust breathing to physiological requirements during both sleep and wakefulness complicates the task of the respiratory control system because sleep alters the response characteristics of the respiratory con- troller and the performance of the respiratory muscles.There may be a hierarchy of neurological organization that governs physiological regulations that determines priorities and arbitrates among conflicting demands as activity levels change.In some individuals with the sleep apnea syndrome, adequate sleep and sufficiently stable breathing, both necessary to prevent dangerous fluctuations in blood gas tensions, seem to be in- compatible (5,6).Sleep is interspersed with periods when airflow stops and profound hypoxemia develops.Sometimes it seems as if death is averted only by arousal and the termination of sleep.While the biochemical basis of neither sleep nor breathing are known, much has been learned in recent years about sleep and about the mechanisms by which it affects respiratory control.Several effective methods of treatment of the sleep apnea syn- drome have been developed based on our understanding of the effects of sleep on breathing.Breathing during sleep.Neither sleep nor wakefulness are uniform states.Even in awake individuals, cyclic changes in breathing with both long and short periods can be obvious at altitude and can be discerned at sea level by sophisticated math-",

Patients affected, however, uncommonly can present RBD as the first clinical manifestation of MS without other neurologic deficits.

Multiple system atrophy is a complex syndrome, in which patients exhibit a variety of signs and symptoms, including parkinsonism, ataxia and autonomic dysfunction. It can be difficult to separate MSA from the other parkinsonian syndromes but if ocular signs and symptoms are present, they may aid differential diagnosis. Typical ocular features of MSA include blepharospasm, excessive square-wave jerks, mild to moderate hypometria of saccades, impaired vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR), nystagmus and impaired event-related evoked potentials. Less typical features include slowing of saccadic eye movements, the presence of vertical gaze palsy, visual hallucinations and an impaired electroretinogram (ERG). Aspects of primary vision such as visual acuity, colour vision or visual fields are usually unaffected. Management of the disease to deal with problems of walking, movement, daily tasks and speech problems is important in MSA. Optometrists can work in collaboration with the patient and health-care providers to identify and manage the patient's visual deficits. A more specific role for the optometrist is to correct vision to prevent falls and to monitor the anterior eye to prevent dry eye and control blepharospasm.",

      "title": "The biological basis of injury and neuroprotection in the fetal and neonatal brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract A compromised intrauterine environment that delivers low levels of oxygen and/or nutrients, or is infected or inflammatory, can result in fetal brain injury, abnormal brain development and in cases of chronic compromise, intrauterine growth restriction. Preterm birth can also be associated with injury to the developing brain and affect the normal trajectory of brain growth. This review will focus on the effects that episodes of perinatal hypoxia (acute, chronic, associated with inflammation or as an antecedent of preterm birth) can have on the developing brain. In animal models of these conditions we have found that relatively brief (acute) periods of fetal hypoxemia can have significant effects on the fetal brain, for example death of susceptible neuronal populations (cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex) and cerebral white matter damage. Chronic placental insufficiency which includes fetal hypoxemia, nutrient restriction and altered endocrine status can result in fetal growth restriction and long‐term deficits in neural connectivity in addition to altered postnatal function, for example in the auditory and visual systems. Maternal/fetal inflammation can result in fetal brain damage, particularly but not exclusively in the white matter; injury is more pronounced when associated with fetal hypoxemia. In the baboon, in which the normal trajectory of growth is affected by preterm birth, there is a direct correlation between a higher flux in oxygen saturation and a greater extent of neuropathological damage. Currently, the only established therapy for neonatal encephalopathy in full term neonates is moderate hypothermia although this only offers some protection to moderately but not severely affected brains. There is no accepted therapy for injured preterm brains. Consequently the search for more efficacious treatments continues; we discuss neuroprotective agents (erythropoietin, N‐acetyl cysteine, melatonin, creatine, neurosteroids) which we have trialed in appropriate animal models. The possibility of combining hypothermia with such agents or growth factors is now being considered. A deeper understanding of causal pathways in brain injury is essential for the development of efficacious strategies for neuroprotection.",

Sleep is further characterized by changes in cerebral activity across the sleep-wake cycle. At a global level, brain activity decreases from waking to non-REM (NREM) sleep and returns back to waking levels during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Like sleep, memory is not a unitary system. In fact, there are several different classification schemes for human memory. In the context of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, an important distinction is usually drawn between declarative and non-declarative memory systems. Age-related cognitive decline is characterized by healthy and pathological processes in adult brain development. In this context, an important distinction is drawn between normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and depression are associated with disturbances of both sleep and memory.",

      "abstract": "Relatively little is known about the neurobiology of insomnia, despite its wide prevalence and broad medical impact. Although much is still to be learned about the pathophysiology of the disorder, identification, systematic assessment, and appropriate treatment are clearly beneficial to patients. Recent research, using quantitative EEG, polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and neuroimaging techniques, suggests that some broad areas can be identified as possible pathophysiological models. Sleep-wake homeostat model hypothesizes a failure in homeostatic regulation of sleep, an attenuated increase in sleep drive with time awake, and/or defective sensing of sleep need. Circadian clock model hypothesizes a dysfunctional circadian clock, resulting in changes in the timing of sleep-wake propensity that are incompatible with normal sleep. Intrinsic sleep-wake state mechanism model suggests that abnormal function of insomnia comprises the systems responsible for expression of the sleep states themselves. Extrinsic over-ride mechanism (stress-response) model suggests that insomnia reflects the consequences of overactivity of one of the systems considered extrinsic to normal sleep-wake control. Many current therapies for insomnia are based on these physiological models. Several attempts have been made to create a physiological model that would explain this disorder and could be used as a foundation for treatment. However, it appeared that no model can fully explain and clarify all aspects of insomnia. Future research should be necessary to expand our knowledge on the biological dimensions of insomnia.",

Failure to accomplish this program results in feeling of unrefreshing sleep and tiredness in the morning. The program core is constructed by genetic factors but regulated by circadian rhythm and duration and intensity of day time brain activity. Many environmental factors modulate sleep, including stress, health status and ingestion of vigilance-affecting nutrients or medicines (e.g. caffeine). Acute sleep loss results in compromised cognitive performance, memory deficits, depressive mood and involuntary sleep episodes during the day. Moreover, prolonged sleep curtailment has many adverse health effects, as evidenced by both epidemiological and experimental studies. These effects include increased risk for depression, type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to voluntary restriction of sleep, shift work, irregular working hours, jet lag and stress are important factors that induce curtailed or bad quality sleep and/or insomnia. This review covers the current theories on the function of normal sleep and describes current knowledge on the physiologic effects of sleep loss. It provides insights into the basic mechanisms of the regulation of wakefulness and sleep creating a theoretical background for understanding different disturbances of sleep.",

Whether these decrements are caused by short sleep duration or extended wakefulness is unknown. In this study, healthy volunteers were randomized into either a chronically sleep-restricted or control protocol while living on a 20-h “day,” thus enabling short sleep without extended wakefulness. We demonstrate that chronic insufficient sleep, even without extended wakefulness, leads to neurobehavioral performance decrements at all times of the day, even when the circadian system is promoting arousal. These findings have implications for the understanding of basic physiology, the substantial population who chronically obtains insufficient sleep, and all of us who depend on sleep-restricted individuals working in safety-sensitive occupations.",

The risk of developing these diseases increases significantly with age: Parkinson's disease affects 1% of the population over 65 years of age, rising to 2% for those over 80 years. Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that often impairs motor skills and speech of the patient. PD is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia) and in extreme cases, loss of physical movement (akinesia). In particular, PD is due to a loss of dopaminergic neurons (related to the neurotransmitter dopamine), and subcortical neurons in the brain. Replacement therapy with dopaminergic drugs (levodopa, pramipexole) effectively reverses all the symptoms and signs of the disease. After a changeable period of time, however, this excellent initial response to dopaminergic treatment is complicated by the appearance of disorders known as motor response complications (MRC). These complications are divided into two main categories: (i) fluctuations in motor response and (ii) the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements known as levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) (Konitsiotis, 2005). Generally, motor fluctuations appear first as a shortening of the initially soft and lasting dopaminergic response. For patients with advanced PD, a few hours after the administration of medication the patient begins to notice the reappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease. This is known as end of dose deterioration or This may happen several times a day, so the patient can actually spend several hours per day in an state. During the short visit with the neurologist, the patient may appear to be well and thus the neurologist misses the symptoms related to wearing off. As a result, changes in the recent drug treatment availability do not take place in time. It is now well known that early treatment of wearing-off fluctuations delay the onset of more severe complications in the future, as well as the appearance of LID. Therefore any strategy that can detect early changes associated with wearing off would provide a valuable clinical tool that would allow early treatment interventions.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep medicine is an increasingly important specialty as the adverse health consequences of disturbed sleep are recognised by patients and physicians, and the current classification of sleep disorders, as recognised by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), is summarised. Two primary sleep disorders, narcolepsy with cataplexy and the disorders of arousal, a symptomatic cluster that includes sleepwalking, confusional arousal and sleep terrors, are reviewed in greater detail. Both disorders can be summarised as being caused by inappropriate switching between the states of vigilance, although they are very different in age of onset, severity and impact on health. In narcolepsy the boundary between sleep and wakefulness is uncontrolled but in the disorders of arousal the boundary between states of sleep is affected. These two disorders also have a genetic predisposition suggesting that advances in knowledge of the relevant mutations could eventually translate into better understanding of the possible mechanisms and hence lead to improved treatments. Key Concepts: The disorders of sleep are primary, for example as a result of pathology in the mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness, or secondary, for example resulting from a medical condition. Apnoea, interruptions of breathing lasting longer than 10 s that result in arousal from sleep, is the principal presenting condition at sleep clinics. Polysomnography is used to record physiological parameters such as respiration rate, heart rate and blood oxygen level simultaneously with data allowing the stage of sleep or wakefulness to be defined. Basic research into the neurophysiology, molecular genetics and neurochemistry of sleep and wakefulness has been critical for understanding the causes of many sleep disorders. The classification of sleep disorders is continuously evolving and being refined as new disorders are recognised in the clinic and neurophysiological and neurochemical pathologies are better understood.",

Ferrotherapy is recommended up to achieve ferritin serum levels greater than 45 mcg/mL. There is not convincingly effective treatment for sleep-related rhythmic movements of sleep. Bruxism may respond to injections of botulinum toxin in the masticatory muscles. Also, dental devices and intraoral splints may be necessary to protect the teeth.

They failed to mention that a shortened REM sleep latency could result from chronic REM sleep deprivation due to REM sleep-related hypoventilation. If episodes of hypoventilation are more frequent or more severe in REM sleep, then the associated arousals will interrupt and reduce the amount of REM sleep. An SOREMP is one typical effect of REM sleep deprivation. We have previously reported a case in which hypoventilation did not result in apneic events but did produce severe oxygen desaturation associated with the hypoventilation during REM sleep. 2 This patient had SOREMPs (REM latencies of one and 11 minutes) on each of two nocturnal sleep recordings.

Sometimes somnolence is one of the manifestations of a pathological process, and in others it is the major and dominant symptom bringing the patient to the doctor. Our experience in the study of hypersomnia (we have observed 120 patients in recent years) demonstrates that physicians have inadequate familiarity with this problem. Sometimes somnolence is regarded not as the result of pathology, but as a manifestation of excessive fatigue. There is inadequate differentiation of the forms of hypersomnic disorders. One of the causes of these errors is the absence of a logical classification. The most thorough classification is that of A. Epshtein, (1) etiological in nature: 1) random sleep disorders; 2) secondary sleep disorders; 3) constitutional neuropathic; 4) reactive; 5) symptomatic; 6) essential disorders; and 7) sleep disorders associated with psychosis.

Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders(CRSWDs) refer to the inconsistency between the human body's circadian behavioral activities and the needs of social life. Common classifications classify it as Delayed sleep phase type (DSP), Advanced sleep phase type (ASP), Free-running type and Irregular sleep-wake type. The potential pathogenesis of CRSWDs is closely related to human clock genes. Emens et al reported finding that N24H sleep-wake disorder is an important milestone in etiology. Light is the stronges inducement of circadian rhythm. CRSWDs may due to the long-term lack of light and other external timing factors, leading to circadian rhythm disorders and sleep homeostasis imbalance rather than being driven by a disorder of the central circadian clock. Regular exposure to strong light is often used to treat CRSWDs. This paper briefly introduces the historical background of understanding circadian rhythm, and then the common pathogenesis and mechanism of sleep wake disorder with different circadian rhythms and the corresponding treatment were discussed.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia and daytime sleepiness are common complaints in Parkinson disease (PD), but the main causes remain unclear. We examined the potential impact of both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD on sleep problems.Patients with PD (n = 128) were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Fatigue Severity Scale, Survey of Autonomic Symptoms, and the 39-item Parkinson Disease Questionnaire. A subset of subjects (n = 38, 30%) also completed nocturnal polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).Multivariate stepwise logistic regression models revealed that subjective insomnia was independently associated with depressed mood (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.01-3.19]), autonomic symptoms (1.77 [1.08-2.90]), fatigue (1.19 [1.02-1.38]), and age (0.61 [0.39-0.96]). Subjective daytime sleepiness was associated with dosage of dopaminergic medication (1.74 [1.08-2.80]) and fatigue (1.14 [1.02-1.28]). On polysomnography, longer sleep latency correlated with autonomic symptoms (rho = 0.40, p = 0.01) and part I (non-motor symptoms) of the Unified PD Rating Scale (rho = 0.38, p = 0.02). Decreased sleep efficiency correlated with autonomic symptoms (rho = -0.42, p < 0.0001). However, no significant difference emerged on polysomnography and MSLTs between patients with or without insomnia or daytime sleepiness. Higher rates of apneic events did predict shorter sleep latencies on the MSLTs.Non-motor symptoms appear to be associated with subjective insomnia, whereas fatigue and dopaminergic medication are associated with subjective daytime sleepiness. Objective sleep laboratory data provided little insight into complaints of insomnia and sleepiness, though obstructive sleep apnea predicted worsened sleepiness when measured objectively.",

Sleep problems are frequently reported by parents of children with autism with prevalence estimates of 44-83% for sleep disorders in this population. To better understand sleep in autism, we surveyed sleep problems in 210 children with autism using a Likert-based questionnaire for parent report. The most frequently reported sleep problems included difficulty in falling asleep, restless sleep, not falling asleep in own bed, and frequent wakenings. Least frequently reported sleep problems were sleep walking, morning headaches, crying during sleep, apnea, and nightmares. When surveys were divided into mental retardation (MR)/not MR categories, no significant differences were identified in frequencies of reported sleep problems except for waking at night which occurred much more frequently in the MR group. There was also no difference in sleep problems related to age of the child other than nocturnal enuresis. An association was noted between certain medical problems and sleep problems. Vision problems, upper respiratory problems, and runny nose were associated with decreased nighttime sleep. Vision problems, poor appetite, and poor growth were associated with increased nighttime waking. Poor appetite and poor growth were associated with decreased willingness to fall asleep. This study confirms a high prevalence of sleep problems reported by parents of children with autism and points to the need for more systematic research as an initial step in developing treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common chronic sensory-motor neurological disorder that remains a clinical diagnosis. Most RLS patients present with sleep complaints in the form of initiation and/or maintenance insomnia as RLS has a circadian rhythmicity. An increased number of periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) is a supportive criterion in the diagnosis of RLS. Abnormalities in the central dopaminergic and iron systems are involved in the physiopathology of RLS. There is a higher prevalence of RLS and PLMS in sleep-disordered breathing patients, particularly those with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the most common sleep disorder in western societies. The complex mechanisms underlying the association between OSA, RLS and PLMS remain unclear. Untreated OSA can lead to adverse cardiovascular consequences due to cardio-metabolic dysfunction. It remains controversial whether RLS could further adversely impact the cardiovascular consequences of OSA. The PLMS do not have an additive effect on the hypersomnia experienced by some sleep-disordered breathing patients. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective therapy for OSA. The presence of PLMS during CPAP treatment could be a marker of an incomplete resolution of sleep-disordered breathing in the form of increased upper airway resistance syndrome, despite treatment. Dopaminergic agonists are the preferred agent for the treatment of RLS, and are indicated when RLS symptoms are frequent and affect quality of life. PLMS and RLS do not seem to contribute to the residual hypersomnia that can be observed in some sleep-disordered breathing patients despite adequate compliance and effective CPAP therapy.",

      "abstract": "Periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) are repetitive jerks of the lower limbs. Their occurrence can be isolated or part of various sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome (RLS), narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnoea. Dopamine agonists are very effective in suppressing PLMS in RLS from the first night of administration. PLMS are often associated with cortical and autonomic arousals and may contribute to sleep disruption. Herein, a case of association between PLMS, Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) and severe insomnia is described. Repeated polysomnographic studies demonstrated a clear synchronisation between PLMS and hyperventilation episodes, and the complete recovery of CSR, sleep quality and PLMS during nocturnal ventilation. In the same patient, pharmacological treatment with a dopamine agonist was ineffective on both PLMS and CSR. These results suggest that periodic leg movements during sleep coupled with central breathing events, similar to those observed in conjunction with obstructive events, may have a different origin in terms of neurotransmitter and pathway implicated, compared with periodic leg movements during sleep in restless legs syndrome, and are resolved by treatment of the respiratory abnormalities.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations of diurnal variation of mood and early morning awakening in depression have been incorporated into established diagnostic systems, as has the seasonal modifier defining winter depression (seasonal affective disorder, SAD). Many circadian rhythms measured in depressive patients are abnormal: earlier in timing, diminished in amplitude, or of greater variability. Whether these disturbances are of etiological significance for the role of circadian rhythms in mood disorders, or a consequence of altered behavior can only be dissected out with stringent protocols (eg, constant routine or forced desynchrony). These protocols quantify contributions of the circadian pacemaker and a homeostatic sleep process impacting on mood, energy, appetite, and sleep. Future studies will elucidate any allelic mutations in \"circadian clock\" -related or \"sleep\"-related genes in depression. With respect to treatment, antidepressants and mood stabilizers have no consistent effect on circadian rhythmicity. The most rapid antidepressant modality known so far is nonpharmacological: total or partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night. The disadvantage of sleep deprivation, that most patients relapse after recovery sleep, can be prevented by coadministration of lithium, pindolol, serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors, bright light, or a subsequent phase-advance procedure. Phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle alone also has rapid effects on depressed mood, which lasts longer than sleep deprivation. Light is the treatment of choice for SAD and may prove to be useful for nonseasonal depression, alone or as an adjunct to medication. Chronobiological concepts emphasize the important role of zeitgebers to stabilize phase, light being the most important, but dark (and rest) periods, regularity of social schedules and meal times, and use of melatonin or its analogues should also be considered. Advances in chronobiology continue to contribute novel treatments for affective disorders.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes a range of conditions characterized by abnormalities in the frequency and/or depth of breathing during sleep. Cessations in breathing rhythm (apneas) are momentary and often cyclical, while reductions in breath amplitude (hypopneas) may be momentary or sustained (Dempsey et al., 2010). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome (HS), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, central sleep apnea (CSA), upper airway resistance syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) are the primary sleep-related respiratory disorders. Although CSA is accompanied by alterations in neural input, the obstruction characteristic of OSA, the most common form of SDB, is also neurally mediated (Veasey, 2009). Intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep characteristic of OSA result from collapse of the upper airway. The concomitant disruption of normal ventilation and sleep architecture is typically associated with snoring, repeated arousals from sleep, and daytime sleepiness (Bradley & Floras, 2003; Lattimore et al, 2003; Quan & Gersh, 2004; Shamsuzzaman et al; 2003;). Prevalence studies indicate that SDB, and particularly OSA, are common problems worldwide, affecting millions of individuals. However, OSA is also considered to be largely undiagnosed (Young et al, 1993; Young et al, 2002; Lavie, 2007). In the United States, for example, the estimated proportions of adults with OSA who are not diagnosed range from 60% to 80%, with an even greater under diagnosis suspected for children (Carter III, 2008). The increasing prevalence can be intuitively associated with the global obesity epidemic; however, a reverse association has also been postulated based on emerging evidence that OSA promotes weight gain (Carter III, 2008). The clinical relevance of OSA was thought for years to be limited to what was considered a benign but often annoying manifestation as snoring, ranging to the possibly serious consequences of daytime sleepiness affecting cognitive function and work performance, mental state, and driving ability. OSA is now known to be a risk factor for other serious conditions, and has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Bradley & Floras, 2009; Devulapally et al., 2009; Lattimore et al, 2003; Lopez-Jiminez et al., 2008). Cardiac arrhythmias are common in OSA, and the potential link between tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias and adverse outcomes in OSA patients continues to be an important area of research (Chan & Wilcox, 2010; Verrier & Josephson, 2009). However, the complex cascade of events triggered by OSA, the difficulty in determining",

      "abstract": "In patients with depression, characteristic changes of sleep electroencephalogram and nocturnal hormone secretion occur including rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disinhibition, reduced non-REM sleep and impaired sleep continuity. Neuropeptides are common regulators of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and nocturnal hormone secretion and changes in their activity appear to contribute to the aberrances of sleep in affective disorders. A reciprocal interaction of the sleep-promoting growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which promotes wakefulness and REM sleep, plays a key role in sleep regulation, at least in male subjects. Also galanin and ghrelin promote sleep in men. Neuropeptide Y is involved in the timing of sleep onset. The effects of peptides of sleep are influenced by the time of administration, age, gender and depression. In healthy subjects and in remitted depressed patients motoric memory learning is consolidated during sleep. This effect is absent in depressed patients who are at least 30 years old, and is probably related to elevated glucocorticoid levels.",

A peculiar sleep state, characterized by the concomitant appearance of a low‐voltage mixed frequency EEG, rapid eye movements (REMs) and tonic EMG in mental muscles, repeatedly appeared during nocturnal sleep in all of the 12 patients with degenerative diseases involving the brain stem and it was called stage 1‐REM after Tachibana et al. 32 In 8 of the 12 patients, delirious or oneiric behavior appeared during, or soon after, the episodes of stage 1‐REM. Inner experiences reported by one of the subjects well corresponded to his behavior during the episode of stage 1‐REM. Stage 1‐REM was not observed during nocturnal sleep of the patients with LCCA. These results indicate that a degenerative lesion in the brain stem induced stage 1‐REM and delirious behavior during nocturnal sleep through abolishing muscle atonia of REM sleep and causing dissociation of the functional components characterizing REM sleep.",

Current first-line treatments include psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Despite significant success, a number of patients do not benefit sufficiently. Progress is limited by an incomplete understanding of the ­neurobiology of insomnia and hypersomnia. This work summarizes current concepts of the regulation of arousal and sleep and its modulation through noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS), including transcranial magnetic, current, and auditory stimulation. Particularly, we suggest: (1) characterization of patients with sleep problems – across diagnostic entities of mental disorders – based on specific alterations of sleep, including alterations of sleep slow waves, sleep spindles, cross-frequency coupling of brain oscillations, local sleep-wake regulation, and REM sleep and (2) targeting these with specific NIBS techniques. While evidence is accumulating that the modulation of specific alterations of sleep through NIBS is feasible, it remains to be tested whether this translates to clinically relevant effects and new treatment developments.",

      "abstract": "The term \"sleep experiences\", coined by Watson (2001), denotes an array of unusual nocturnal consciousness phenomena; for example, nightmares, vivid or recurrent dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations, dreams of falling or flying, confusional arousals, and lucid dreams. Excluding the latter, these experiences reflect a single factor of atypical oneiric cognitions (\"general sleep experiences\"). The current study is an opinionated mini-review on the associations of this factor—measured with the Iowa sleep experiences survey (ISES, Watson, 2001)—with psychopathological symptoms and stress. Findings support a strong relation between psychological distress and general sleep experiences. It is suggested that that they should be viewed as a sleep disturbance; they seem to represent involuntary intrusions of wakefulness into sleep, resulting in aroused sleep. These intrusions may stem from excessively thin boundaries between consciousness states (e.g., \"transliminality\"), or, conversely, they may follow an attempt at disconnecting mental elements (e.g., dissociation), which paradoxically results in a \"rebound effect\". The extent to which unusual dreaming is experienced as intrusive, rather than controlled, may explain why general sleep experiences are related to psychopathology, whereas lucid dreams are related to psychological resilience. In conclusion, the exploration of the interplay between psychopathology and sleep should be expanded from focusing almost exclusively on quantitative aspects (e.g., sleep efficiency, latency) to including qualitative conscious experiences which may reflect poor sleep quality. Taking into account nocturnal consciousness—including unusual dreaming and permeable sleep-wake boundaries—may unveil rich information on night-time emotional states and broaden our definition of poor sleep quality.",

The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure.

Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

Patients usually present around 5 years of age with infrequent nocturnal unilateral motor seizures that progress within 1 to 2 years to a severe epileptic encephalopathy with frequent seizures of different types, marked neurocognitive regression, and an almost continuous spike-wave EEG pattern during slow-wave sleep. The pathophysiology of continuous spike and waves during sleep is not completely understood, but the corticothalamic neuronal network involved in physiologic oscillating patterns of sleep is thought to be switched into a pathologic discharging mode. Early developmental injury and/or genetic predisposition may play a role in the potentiation of age-related hyperexcitability in the immature brain. A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to electrical status epilepticus during sleep may provide additional therapeutic targets that can improve the outcome of seizures, EEG pattern, and cognitive development in patients with continuous spike and waves during sleep.",

It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

      "title": "Pharmacologic management of daytime sleepiness.",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal sleep-wake patterns are becoming increasingly pervasive in modern society. The major causes of excessive daytime sleepiness include pathologic abnormalities of the central nervous system, such as narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia; deficiencies in quality or quantity of sleep, such as those caused by sleep apnea and poor sleep hygiene; disturbances to the body's natural circadian rhythm, such as those caused by shift work or jet lag; and drugs, which can increase sleepiness either therapeutically or as a side effect. Determining the cause of daytime sleepiness is the first step in treating it. Setting appropriate and realistic treatment goals with the patient and initiating treatment are the next steps. Although the medications available to improve daytime wakefulness (e.g., amphetamines, methylphenidate, pemoline, and modafinil) are effective, they are not a substitute for sleep. Finally, timely follow-up is necessary to monitor treatment adherence, response, and side effects.",

      "title": "The Renin–Angiotensin System Modulates Dopaminergic Neurotransmission: A New Player on the Scene",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an extrapyramidal disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration in several regions of the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. It has become a major health problem, affecting 1% of the world population over 60 years old and 3% of people beyond 80 years. The main histological findings are intracellular Lewy bodies composed of misfolded α-synuclein protein aggregates and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system. Neuroinflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium homeostasis, abnormal protein degradation, and synaptic pathobiology have been put forward as mechanisms leading to cell death, α-synuclein deposition, or both. A progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra late in the neurodegeneration leads to developing motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is involved in regulating blood pressure and body fluid balance, also plays other important functions in the brain. The RAS is involved in the autocrine and paracrine regulation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic synapses. Dopamine depletion, as in PD, increases angiotensin II expression, which stimulates or inhibits dopamine synthesis and is released via AT1 or AT2 receptors. Furthermore, angiotensin II AT1 receptors inhibit D1 receptor activation allosterically. Therefore, the RAS may have an important modulating role in the flow of information from the brain cortex to the basal ganglia. High angiotensin II levels might even aggravate neurodegeneration, activating the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex, which leads to increased reactive oxygen species production.",

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a relatively common sleep disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of upper airway obstruction while sleeping, which can result in hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation. Even though the nature of RBD and OSA is different, OSA may sometimes be accompanied by RBD symptoms. Accordingly, it is reasonable to distinguish these 2 sleep disorders in people with dream enactment behaviors. Although RBD and OSA share similar sleep phenomena, their association has yet to be elucidated. Herein we draw attention to various RBD-mimicking conditions, RBD combined with OSA, and the relationship between RBD and OSA. Furthermore, the clinical implications of OSA in neurodegeneration and the optimized management of RBD combined with OSA are also discussed in this review.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is typically well-recognized by its characteristic motor symptoms (e.g., bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor). The cognitive symptoms of PD are increasingly being acknowledged by clinicians and researchers alike. However, PD also involves a host of emotional and communicative changes which can cause major disruptions to social functioning. These include problems producing emotional facial expressions (i.e., facial masking) and emotional speech (i.e., dysarthria), as well as difficulties recognizing the verbal and non-verbal emotional cues of others. These social symptoms of PD can result in severe negative social consequences, including stigma, dehumanization, and loneliness, which might affect quality of life to an even greater extent than more well-recognized motor or cognitive symptoms. It is therefore imperative that researchers and clinicians become aware of these potential social symptoms and their negative effects, in order to properly investigate and manage the socioemotional aspects of PD. The present review provides an examination of the current research surrounding some of the most common social symptoms of PD and their related social consequences, and argues that proactively and adequately addressing these issues might improve disease outcomes.",

      "title": "Micturition reflex epilepsy with tonic seizures – A rare semiology with insights from magnetoencephalography",
      "abstract": "Reflex epilepsy is a condition, wherein epileptic seizures are triggered by specific stimuli such as flashing lights, music, reading etc. Stimuli may be exogenous (sensory) or endogenous (e.g.: praxis induced, solving calculations). Very rarely, the act of urination can set off seizures and this may often be confused with micturition syncope, when loss of consciousness occurs early. Our patient is a 5-year-old boy who was born to non-consanguineous parents by normal delivery. He had a smooth perinatal transit and an unremarkable first year of life. He had delay in acquisition of language milestones and began to speak bi-syllables by 2.5 years of life. Development in other domains was relatively normal. At the age of 4 years, he was noticed to have brief episodes of posturing of his upper limbs with up-rolling of eyes during sleep. These events lasted for a few seconds and occurred 5–6 times during the night. The child was treated with sodium valproate (SVA) and levetiracetam (LEV) at weight appropriate doses elsewhere. Despite good compliance, he continued to suffer from daily nocturnal brief tonic seizures. About 4 months into the illness, he developed another symptom. When the child commences to urinate, he loses consciousness and slumps to the floor. His mother reported that his limbs appeared to be tightly held in extension and his eyes looked to the right. This phenomenon occurred when child urinated in both sitting and standing position. The possibilities considered were micturition induced reflex seizures vs. micturition syncope. In view of pre-existing developmental delay and co-existing nocturnal seizures, the former differential diagnosis appeared to be more likely. His scalp EEG showed a posterior dominant rhythm of 4−5 Hz. He had frequent spikes in the right temporal (F8, T4) and frontocentral (FC) regions (F4,C4) and rare spikes in the left FC leads (F3,C3). To precisely characterize the nature of his symptoms, he underwent video-EEG telemetry. A total of 6 stereotyped events were recorded, all during micturition. Within a few seconds of starting to urinate, the child had slow neck flexion, looked to the right side with eye version to the right and had posturing of his upper limbs (right in extension and left in flexion). Its counterpart ictal EEG showed low amplitude fast activity in the midline centroparietal leads which increased in amplitude and culminated into bilateral centroparietal slowing towards the end of the attack. He regained consciousness 10 s after the cessation of ictal activity (Fig. 2). EKG recording during the ictus did not show any alteration in rhythm. It is likely that these seizures were originating from near the midline, possibly from the left hemisphere. Given that the micturition centers are also in the mesial frontal regions, this finding is not surprising. MRI done with a 3 T scanner was normal and PET-MRI did not show any areas of focal hypometabolism (Fig. 1a, ). Interictal MEG showed equivalent current dipoles clustered in the left midline posterior parietal region just above the corpus callosum (Fig. 1b). Though this is an interictal finding, it appears to be concordant with the hypothesis generated from VEEG. LEV was tapered and was prescribed lamotrigine (3 mg/kg) along with SVA (25 mg/kg). There was complete cessation of both reflex and non-reflex nocturnal seizures for the past 9 months.Fig. 2Clinical semiology and ictal EEG.Show full captiona. Clinical semiology b.

Micturition is a complex physiological process which is controlled by the spinal cord, brainstem and the cortex. The higher centers for micturition lie in the pons, periaqueductal grey, mesial frontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortex. Though the exact mechanism of reflex seizures during urination has not been elucidated, one might intuitively assume that mesial frontal activation could set off seizures in susceptible individuals.

Kato K. et al.Micturition induced seizures: ictal EEG and subtraction ictal SPECT findings.Epilepsy Res. 2007; 73: 119-121https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2006.09.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar] observed changes in the mesial frontal region in the ictal PET scan. Clinical semiology was also suggestive of ictal onset from the left supplementary motor area. Only a handful of cases have been reported in literature, whose clinical features have been reviewed [[2]Jang H.-J. Kwon M.J. Cho K.-O. Central Regulation of Micturition and Its Association With Epilepsy.Int Neurourol J. 2018; 22: 2-8https://doi.org/10.5213/inj.1836040.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar]. Interestingly most patients have co-existing neuro-developmental issues. Seizure onset though commonly is seen in the midline in EEGs, case reports have mentioned other areas of EEG changes namely frontotemporal and occipital regions. Semiology and ictal EEG similar to our patient has been reported from another center in southern India [[3]Rathore C. Teaching Video NeuroImage: Electroclinical characteristics of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Neurology. 2008; 70: 20https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000312283.88683.0dCrossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. In another study, urodynamic testing during the ictus identified detrusor over activity [[4]Seth J.H. McLaughlin C. Eriksson S. Fowler C.J. Walker M.C. Panicker J.N. Blackouts in the toilet: a case of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Pract Neurol. 2014; 14: 261-263https://doi.org/10.1136/practneurol-2013-000733Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. To the best of our knowledge, no MEG data in this type of reflex epilepsy is currently available in literature. The MEG cluster has localized to the midline left parietal region, which is posterior to the 'known micturition center' in the frontal region. The interictal MEG corresponds fairly to the region ictal EEG onset. It may only be hypothesized that this region is closely networked with the frontal micturition center. This case highlights an unusual semiology of asymmetric tonic seizures during micturition in a child with mild developmental delay and normal imaging. Overall, VEEG and MEG has suggested the role of midline structures possibly in the left parietal region. The importance of video-telemetry is emphasized, as it can help differentiate between epileptic seizures vs non-epileptic conditions. Lamotrigine and valproate combination resulted in sustained seizure freedom for 9 months. Further studies are required to elucidate treatment algorithms for these patients, but may be cumbersome as this condition is exceedingly rare.",

      "title": "Spastic Hypertonia and Movement Disorders: Pathophysiology, Clinical Presentation, and Quantification",
      "abstract": "A delayed consequence of a lesion affecting the upper motor neuron pathways is the appearance of some forms of motor overactivity, including spasticity. Many of these are caused by hyperexcitability of spinal reflexes, such as stretch reflexes (spasticity, tendon hyperreflexia) or flexor withdrawal reflexes (flexor spasms), and are elicited at rest by sensory stimulation. Spastic co‐contraction is probably attributable to failure of reciprocal inhibition; it occurs only during active voluntary movement and constrains such movement. The basic underlying mechanism of these changes is not clear, although a change in the balance between the inhibitory and excitatory supraspinal upper motor neuron pathways toward net excitation most likely contributes. Increased intrinsic excitability of the alpha motor neurons is another possible factor. Spastic dystonia is most often seen as the presence of tonic muscle contraction in the absence of voluntary movement or spinal reflex activation, and the underlying mechanisms are obscure. Prolonged shortening of tissues, either because of weakness or muscle contraction, leads to stiffness of the soft tissues, which contributes to hypertonia and is thus self‐perpetuating, and ultimately to contracture with fixed shortening. Some of these forms of motor overactivity produce involuntary movements (hyperkinetic), eg, flexor spasms, whereas others impair movement (hypokinetic), either voluntary movement, eg, spastic co‐contraction, or passive movement, eg, spasticity. Quantification has mostly focused on hypertonia, that is, increased resistance at rest to passive movement. In the upper motor neuron syndrome, hypertonia could be caused by a combination of spasticity, spastic dystonia, and soft tissue stiffness (rheologic changes). Some measures, such as the Ashworth or Modified Ashworth Scales, quantify hypertonia but are very poor at distinguishing between spasticity and soft tissue stiffness. Another, the Tardieu Scale, is better at making this distinction, but quantification of the spasticity portion of hypertonia remains difficult, at least in a clinical setting.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is most frequently associated with characteristic motor symptoms that are known to arise with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. However, patients with this disease also experience a multitude of non‐motor symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, apathy, anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, dementia, olfactory dysfunction, pain, sweating and constipation, some of which can be at least as debilitating as the movement disorders and have a major impact on patients’ quality of life. Many of these non‐motor symptoms may be evident prior to the onset of motor dysfunction. The neuropathology of PD has shown that complex, interconnected neuronal systems, regulated by a number of different neurotransmitters in addition to dopamine, are involved in the aetiology of motor and non‐motor symptoms. This review focuses on the non‐dopaminergic neurotransmission systems associated with PD with particular reference to the effect that their modulation and interaction with dopamine has on the non‐motor symptoms of the disease. PD treatments that focus on the dopaminergic system alone are unable to alleviate both motor and non‐motor symptoms, particularly those that develop at early stages of the disease. The development of agents that interact with several of the affected neurotransmission systems could prove invaluable for the treatment of this disease.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "title": "Conversion disorder: understanding the pathogenic links between emotion and motor systems in the brain",
      "abstract": "When neurology and psychiatry moved apart from each other around the turn of the 20th century, casualties included the many patients with unexplained neurological disorders. Many labels have been applied to these patients. Some are descriptive (functional disorders, medically unexplained symptoms), while others refer to a presumed aetiology (psychogenic, hysteria, non-organic) or putative mechanism (dissociative or conversion disorder). Whatever is the label, for some physicians these patients are among the most interesting and challenging in the clinic. For others they are frustrating, using much time and resources for an often disappointing outcome.\n\nWhether you are an enthusiast or nihilist, it is clear that that neither neurology nor psychiatry alone have succeeded in sufficiently advancing our neurobiological understanding or management of these disorders. The slow progress is in stark contrast to the scale of the problem. Medically unexplained neurological symptoms account for ∼30% of referred neurology out-patients (Carson et al. , 2000; Stone et al. , 2009). Conversion disorder alone, explicitly associated with psychological stressors at the outset, accounts for ∼5% of referrals and is a stable, accurate diagnosis (Perkin, 1989; Stone et al. , 2005, 2009).\n\nPsychogenic movement disorders are common in neurological practice, including tremor, dystonia, gait change and paralysis. Diagnostic criteria emphasize clinical observations such as inconsistency, distractibility and false neurological signs (Fahn and Williams, 1988). These can be both sensitive and specific, at least in the context of a movement disorder clinic (Shill and Gerber, 2006). Physiological criteria have also been developed, such as coherence of tremor oscillations distinguishing psychogenic from organic syndromes (McAuley and Rothwell, 2004). The emphasis in this ‘neurological’ approach is on the physical examination, supplemented by physiological tests. The psychological aspects of the disease take second place, e.g. requiring ‘obvious’ but not specified psychiatric or emotional disturbance (Fahn and Williams, 1988 …",

As disorders of arousal (DOA) or REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) can be difficult to capture in the sleep laboratory and may need to be diagnosed in large communities, new home diagnostic devices are being developed, including actigraphy, EEG headbands, as well as 2D infrared and 3D time of flight home cameras (often with automatic analysis). Traditional video-polysomnographic diagnostic criteria for RBD and DOA are becoming more accurate, and deep learning methods are beginning to accurately classify abnormal polysomnographic signals in these disorders. Big data from vast collections of clinical, cognitive, brain imaging, DNA and polysomnography data have provided new information on the factors that are associated with parasomnia and, in the case of RBD, may predict the individual risk of conversion to an overt neurodegenerative disease. Dream engineering, including targeted reactivation of memory during sleep, combined with image repetition therapy and lucid dreaming, is helping to alleviate nightmares in patients. On a political level, RBD has brought together specialists in abnormal movements and sleep neurologists, and research into nightmares and sleep-wake dissociations has brought together sleep and consciousness scientists.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

It becomes more fragmented as we age, with more night‐time awakenings and greater tendency for daytime sleep. The magnitude of disordered sleep among individuals affected by dementia has been clearly demonstrated, and disturbed sleep is a major clinical problem in dementia. Comorbid insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such A lzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders. How and when sleep problems manifest themselves can depend on the type of dementia involved as well as the stage of the dementia. However, differences in sleep pattern presentation show more variation during the initial stages of dementias than they do during the later stages.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder in which a person frequently stops breathing during his or her sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is the average number of disordered breathing events per hour. OSA syndrome is defined as an AHI of 5 or greater with associated symptoms (e.g.: excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or impaired cognition) or an AHI of 15 or greater, regardless of associated symptoms.",

These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

Bis zu 80% dieser Patienten sind nach einer Erkrankungsdauer von 10 Jahren betroffen und bis zu 90% leiden zusätzlich unter mindestens einem neuropsychiatrischen Symptom. Literatursuche über PubMed. Patienten mit Parkinson Demenz (PD) weisen eine andere Ausprägung der kognitiven Defizite auf als Patienten mit anderen Demenzformen. Primär sind bei der PD die exekutive Funktion und visuell-räumliche Erkennung, aber auch Aufmerksamkeit und Gedächtnis betroffen. Gerade auch bei Patienten mit PD manifestieren sich neuropsychiatrische Symptome wie Delir, optische Halluzinationen, Angst, Stimmungsschwankungen und Verkennungen. Symptomatische Ursachen wie eine Infektion, Dehydrierung, Elektrolytstörung oder Änderungen der eingenommenen Medikamente sollten als diagnostische Maßnahmen und zu therapeutischen Zwecken als erstes überprüft werden. Zur weiteren differenzialdiagnostischen Einordnung sollte eine körperliche Untersuchung, eine orientierende kognitive Testung und ein kranielles MRT erfolgen. Bei klinischer Unsicherheit können weitere diagnostische Maßnahmen wie eine Elektroencephalografie, Lumbalpunktion und nuklearmedizinische Untersuchungen für jeden Patienten individuell diskutiert werden. Patienten mit IPS sollten regelmäßig hinsichtlich kognitiver Beeinträchtigungen untersucht werden, um bei Zeichen einer möglichen Demenzerkrankung weitere diagnostische und therapeutische Maßnahmen frühzeitig einzuleiten. Weiterhin sollte bei diesen Patienten verstärkt auf neuropsychiatrische Symptome geachtet werden. Rivastigmin als Acetylcholinesterase-Hemmer, Neuroleptika wie Clozapin und Quetiapin sowie neuropsychologische Trainingsverfahren sind die im Vordergrund stehenden Therapieoptionen zur Behandlung der kognitiven Defizite, der Psychose und der Verhaltensauffälligkeiten.",

Sleep deprivation is seen in several psychiatric disorders, and there may be a cause or effect relationship. Sleep-deprived individuals may have trouble making decisions, solving problems, controlling their emotions and behavior, and coping with stress or change. We report a case who started having sleep deprivation over 15 days following a stressor, which resulted in an acute psychosis-like condition with associated disorientation and perplexity. However, the patient responded to benzodiazepine medication given for the restoration of her sleep cycle and did not require any antipsychotics.

      "title": "Disrupted Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Schizophrenia and Their Interaction With Dopamine Signaling",
      "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is a common feature of schizophrenia, and is associated with symptom severity and patient quality of life. It is commonly manifested as disturbances to the sleep/wake cycle, with sleep abnormalities occurring in up to 80% of patients, making it one of the most common symptoms of this disorder. Severe circadian misalignment has also been reported, including non-24 h periods and phase advances and delays. In parallel, there are alterations to physiological circadian parameters such as body temperature and rhythmic hormone production. At the molecular level, alterations in the rhythmic expression of core clock genes indicate a dysfunctional circadian clock. Furthermore, genetic association studies have demonstrated that mutations in several clock genes are associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia. Collectively, the evidence strongly suggests that sleep and circadian disruption is not only a symptom of schizophrenia but also plays an important causal role in this disorder. The alterations in dopamine signaling that occur in schizophrenia are likely to be central to this role. Dopamine is well-documented to be involved in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, in which it acts to promote wakefulness, such that elevated dopamine levels can disturb sleep. There is also evidence for the influence of dopamine on the circadian clock, such as through entrainment of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and dopamine signaling itself is under circadian control. Therefore dopamine is closely linked with sleep and the circadian system; it appears that they have a complex, bidirectional relationship in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, such that disturbances to one exacerbate abnormalities in the other. This review will provide an overview of the evidence for a role of SCRD in schizophrenia, and examine the interplay of this with altered dopamine signaling. We will assess the evidence to suggest common underlying mechanisms in the regulation of sleep/circadian rhythms and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Improvements in sleep are associated with improvements in symptoms, along with quality of life measures such as cognitive ability and employability. Therefore the circadian system holds valuable potential as a new therapeutic target for this disorder.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

Loss of consciousness is associated with lesions that disrupt neuronal systems in the brainstem and diencephalon that mediate arousal or thalamocortical or corticocortical systems that mediate awareness.

The final diagnoses were recorded according to the Diagnostic Classification System of the Association of Sleep Disorders Centers. The most common major diagnoses in the elderly group were sleep apnea syndrome (39 percent) and periodic movements‐restless legs syndrome (18 percent). These syndromes showed a significantly greater prevalence in the older than in the younger patients (p &lt; .001), and were found in 68 percent of the elderly group. The elderly manifested more objective signs of sleep disturbance, including more wake time after sleep onset, and more frequent and longer awakenings; moreover, fewer of them experienced stage‐4 sleep. The diagnostic findings seemed to indicate that complaints about sleep‐wake functioning in many elderly patients may be a result of specific pathologic sleep disturbances.",

      "abstract": "SummaryThe amount of tension in the muscular skeleton system is dependent on personality, physical constitution, longlasting recurrent or actual psychosomatic problems and learned behavior. Muscular tension becomes a coping mechanism to deal with somato-psychical and social difficulties. The literature shows possible biochemical correlations with states of depression, and also an impaired serotonin metabolism. However, not all patients suffer from depression. Further, a depressive, depressive-hypochondric state, and/or state of anxiety can be a consequence of fibromyalgia pain. Impaired non-REM sleep and a disturbed system of pain-modulation in the middle brain and brain stem, and a decreased tolerance of frustration, as well as frustrated aggression are assumed to be responsible for muscle contraction.In about 90% of the patients with fibromyalgia, psychoneuroses of different kinds have been found in which an impaired self- as well as an insufficient body awareness (partly as a consequence of the lasting pain) nearly always play a role. There are also significantly more life events and more problems compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Four different strategies exist for therapy: 1) administration of antidepressive drugs; 2) relaxation: a) using drug therapy with benzodiazepines or meprobamate; b) with passive or, preferably, active physical therapy, resulting in physical strengthening, and leading also to an improved self-confidence c) autogenic training. 3) antirheumatic drug (for pain relief); 4) cognitive psychotherapy, individual and/or group, with the aim of cognitive reorientation, and fostering adequate strategies to cope with pain and problems.",

La majorite des travaux portant sur l'effet du vieillissement normal sur la MP met en evidence une atteinte objective precoce qui se voit exacerbee par le vieillissement pathologique, tel qu'observe chez les personnes âgees en phase preclinique et clinique de la demence, comme le trouble cognitif leger (TCL) et la maladie d'Alzheimer (MA), respectivement. Toutefois, on possede peu d'informations quant a son integrite dans d'autres populations cliniques a risque de developper une maladie neurodegenerative, notamment dans le trouble cognitif leger non amnesique (TCLna) et le trouble comportemental en sommeil paradoxal idiopathique (TCSPi). Ce travail doctoral vise donc a caracteriser plus amplement la performance de la MP chez des patients atteints de differents sous-types de TCL, en s'interessant plus particulierement a celle observee dans les cas presentant un TCSPi. La premiere etude comprend deux objectifs principaux, soit (1) de comparer la performance entre differents profils cognitifs lies au vieillissement normal et pathologique (TCL, MA) sur la tâche de l'enveloppe et (2) d'investiguer la valeur discriminante de celle-ci pour des fins d'utilisation clinique. L'echantillon se compose de 49 temoins, de 41 patients MA et de 64 individus TCL amnesique et non amnesique d'etiologies mixtes (idiopathique, n = 17; TCSPi, n = 20; maladie de Parkinson, n = 27). Les resultats mettent en evidence un gradient d'atteintes de la MP, avec les patients MA presentant des difficultes significatives dans les composantes prospective et retrospective de la tâche, suivi des individus TCLa ayant un patron similaire, mais moins severe que les patients MA et enfin les individus TCLna manifestant une difficulte isolee dans la composante retrospective. La correlation elevee entre la performance a la tâche de l'enveloppe et le fonctionnement mnesique suggere que les individus presentant une memoire episodique retrospective limitee sont plus vulnerables a l'echec. Par ailleurs, les analyses revelent que la tâche de l'enveloppe est tres sensible et specifique pour discriminer les patients MA des temoins alors qu'elle s'avere peu sensible (mais tres specifique) chez les TCLa et les TCLna. Dans l'ensemble, l'etude suggere la presence de patrons distincts pour chacun des sous-types de TCL et fournit des donnees interessantes pour promouvoir l'utilisation de cette epreuve par les cliniciens desirant rapidement evaluer la MP dans leur pratique. Depuis quelques annees, il y a un interet accru a identifier des marqueurs predictifs de neurodegenerescence, notamment dans les synucleinopathies, comme la maladie de Parkinson (PD) et la demence a corps de Lewy (DCL). Le declin cognitif associe au TCL et au TCSPi sont parmi les facteurs de risque importants pour le developpement de ces maladies neurodegeneratives. A notre connaissance, les seuls travaux anterieurs a examiner le trouble de la MP dans les synucleinopathies ont ete effectues chez des patients avec une PD sans demence (avec ou sans TCL), d'ou l'interet d'etudier plus precisement le fonctionnement de la MP dans le TCSPi. Dans la deuxieme etude, 38 individus TCSPi, dont 25 sans TCL (TCSPi-nTCL) et 13 avec TCL (TCSPi-TCL), sont compares a 20 temoins sur trois epreuves evaluant la MP : un questionnaire d'autoevaluation, la tâche de l'enveloppe et une epreuve experimentale de saillance. Les resultats ne montrent aucune difference significative entre les trois groupes quant aux plaintes autorapportees et a la performance sur la tâche de l'enveloppe. Toutefois, l'epreuve experimentale a mis en evidence un trouble de la MP dans le TCSPi, caracterise par des difficultes a detecter des indices prospectifs saillants et non saillants comparativement aux temoins. Seule la condition non saillante permet de differencier la performance entre les TCSPi-nTCL et les TCSPi-TCL, ce qui semble attribuable a une dysfonction executive plus marquee chez ces derniers. En depit de ses limites, ce projet doctoral apporte une comprehension plus eclairee sur des themes de recherche negliges par la communaute scientifique. La premiere etude fournit des preuves assez robustes concernant l'utilisation de la tâche de l'enveloppe dans la MA alors qu'elle devrait etre probablement accompagnee d'autres epreuves cliniques dans le TCL. La deuxieme etude stimule l'interet d'explorer davantage la nature des deficits de la MP dans le TCSPi afin d'accumuler des preuves convaincantes en vue de les considerer comme un nouveau marqueur predictif du processus neurodegeneratif.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : memoire prospective, trouble cognitif leger, maladie d'Alzheimer, trouble comportemental en sommeil paradoxal, fonctions executives",

Although one most commonly associates a sleep disturbance with a complaint of insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal events occurring during sleep at night are also frequent complaints. Approximately 10% of the population has a complaint of insomnia that occurs every night for 2 weeks or more,1 whereas up to 30% of people have some sleep disturbance a few nights every month. Up to 10% of the population has significant daytime tiredness and sleepiness and nearly everyone has had some type of abnormal intrusion into sleep such as nightmares, sleepwalking, or some other psychological or physiological intrusion into sleep. However, despite the prevalence in society of sleep disorders, the majority of patients do not present for treatment. About 28% have insomnia associated with a mental disorder.2 Yet, only 5-6% of people will seek a physician in order to address their sleep problem.3 Over 70% of those with insomnia have never discussed the sleep problem with a physician and the majority resort to over-the-counter medications or self-remedies in order to alleviate the sleep disturbance.",

It has been established that factors of higher risk of the transformation of a menopausal preneurosis-like condition into a neurosis-like one in women with a history of complete or partial castration are as follows: older (over 45 years) age by the time of surgical intervention, complete castration, a combination of the previous operation and attendant additional hazards (psychogenias and somatogenias) as well as the occurrence of the menopause before the operation. In the pubertal period behavioural deviations and neuropsychic disturbances usually reach a degree of obvious pathology (psychopathies, psychogenias) in cases where a long-standing psychotraumatic situation is combined with unfavourable biological factors such as minimum brain deficit, severe and prolonged debilitating somatic disease, a shain of infections, and pathological heredity.",

Circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep pressure are the determining factors in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Fluctuations in hormone levels are largely determined by circadian rhythms. The central biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is synchronized with external signals, and largely determines the daily rhythms of hormone secretion. Many hormones can affect respiratory function during sleep, exacerbating sleep apnea when their secretion is excessive or deficient. Sleep disorders can occur in a number of neuroendocrine diseases, worsening the quality of life of patients and, in some cases, contributing to the development of life-threatening complications. Screening for sleep disorders, in particular the active detection of sleep apnea in acromegaly, hypothyroidism and hypercorticism, can significantly reduce the risk of complications with timely treatment.",

      "title": "Restless legs",
      "abstract": "Sleep problems have been making a lot of news. Some sleep experts suggest that most Americans do not get as much sleep as they need. Lack of sleep, or lack of good quality sleep, affects the way we think, our relations with others, and our general health. There are many reasons and causes for poor sleep, including outside causes (loud noises) and internal causes (pain, stress, breathing trouble, or brain injury). Some sleep problems occur with body movements that are not under the person’s control. One such problem is called restless legs syndrome (RLS). As the name implies, people with this problem have an irresistible urge to move due to uncomfortable feelings in their legs. They get some relief from the discomfort by moving, walking or stretching. The problem is worse at night or when the person tries to rest, which therefore makes sleeping difficult. RLS is common, but often not recognized. It may affect as many as 8 to 10% of the population. More information about restless legs can be found on the next page (About Restless Legs Syndrome).\n\nFortunately, there are medications to treat the uncomfortable feelings in RLS, although they do not cure the problem. Many of the medicines used for RLS symptoms are also used in Parkinson disease (PD), a common neurological condition with shaking, slow movements, and a shuffling slow walk. Interestingly, people with PD also have sleep problems. One of the medications used for PD is cabergoline. In this issue of Neurology , a group of German researchers studied cabergoline to treat people with RLS.1\n\nStiasny-Kolster et al.1 studied the effectiveness …",

      "title": "Does Recurrent Isolated Sleep Paralysis Involve More Than Cognitive Neurosciences",
      "abstract": "Isolated sleep paralysis (ISP) is a poorly understood phenomenon that has attracted increased attention in recent years both in the medical com- munity (Dahlitz & Parkes, 1993; Hishikawa & Shimizu, 1995) and in psy- chological research (Fukuda et al., 1987, 1991; Fukuda, 1993; Takeuchi et al., 1994; Wing et al., 1994 ). Although the occurrence of ISP is relatively common, recurrent ISP (RISP) is a rarer variant of sleep paralysis character- ized by frequent episodes or a complex of sequential episodes whose total du- ration may exceed 1 hour, and particularly by the range and sense of per- ceived reality of the subjective phenomena experienced during episodes. Although such phenomena are usually categorized as hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, there is at present no integrated model that ade- quately explains the ensemble of physiological, neurological, cognitive, and psychological components of RISP. As researchers who experience RISP, in this paper we attempt to synthesize information on RISP gathered from vari- ous sources and to conjecture possible connections between RISP and other as yet poorly understood phenomena at different levels: at a neurophysiolog- ical level, with anxiety disorders (Suarez, 1991; Paradis et al., 1997 ), the Pe- riodic Paralyses (Stedwell et al., 1992 ), and with Sudden Unexplained Noc- turnal Death Syndrome (SUNDS) (Nimmanit et al., 1991; Randall, 1992; Adler, 1995 ); at a neurocognitive level, with lucid dreaming (LaBerge, 1985); and finally, at a level that examines the possibility of the manifesta- tion of paranormal phenomena during RISP episodes, with Out-of-Body Ex- periences (OBE) (Tart,1968; Osis, 1981) and with Near-Death-Experiences (NDE) (Moody, 1976; Ring, 1979). Finally, we performed a statistical analy- sis on RISP by use of a sample of 250 direct or indirect respondents to a mes- sage posted initially by one of the authors on the sleep web site of the Uni- versity of California in Los Angeles (UCLA). 1 Preliminary results indicate that over 90% of respondents experience intense fear during their RISP episodes, about 50% have invoked a paranormal or supernatural explanation, and that a typical RISP episode may be described as consisting of three main phases. We conclude with a brief description of possible strategies to cope with RISP.",

Most AD patients showed significant alternation of sleep structure as well as cognitive deficit. Typical findings of sleep architecture in AD patients include lower sleep efficiency, higher stage 1 percentage, and greater frequency of arousals. The slowing of EEG activity is also noted. Abnormalities in REM sleep are of particular interest in AD because the cholinergic system is related to both REM sleep and AD. Several parameters representing REM sleep structure such as REM latency, the amount of REM sleep, and REM density are change in patients with AD. Especially, measurements of EEG slowing during tonic REM sleep can be used as an EEG marker for early detection of possible AD. In addition, a structural defect in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is suggested to cause various chronobiological alternations in AD. Most of alternations related to sleep make sleep disturbances common and disruptive symptoms of AD. In this article, the author reviewed the alternation of sleep structure and circadian rhythm in AD patients.",

Thirteen of these attacks arose from sleep. Seven attacks were reported after waking in the morning or shortly before going to sleep. The beginnings of sleep-related attacks were distributed arbitrarily between different non-REM sleep stages. No association of CH attacks with REM or sleep disordered breathing was observed. Increased heart rate temporally associated with transition from one sleep state to another was observed before patients awoke with headache. Total sleep time, total wake time, arousal index and distribution of non-REM sleep stages were different between chronic and episodic CH.CH attacks are not associated with REM sleep. Brain regions involved in sleep stage transition might be involved in pathophysiology of CH. Differences in sleep characteristics between subgroups might indicate adaptation processes or underlying pathophysiology.",

      "abstract": "Patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) scarcely complain primarily of insomnia. However, sleep disturbance is very common in this population as shown by epidemiological and polysomnographic studies. Clinical psychiatrists have to check for sleep disruptions through a careful medical history of the patient. Special attention will be paid to patients with checking of washing rituals who can delay their sleep during endless compulsive activities. To what extent these sleep problems are related to the pathophysiology of OCD or simply a consequence of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms remains to be addressed in future studies. In OCD, despite initial confusing findings, there is no specific alteration of the sleep structure. However, impaired sleep continuity, intrusion of wake during sleep, and reduction of sleep duration are constantly observed. Endocrine functions are also strongly modified during sleep of OCD sufferers. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol are significantly elevated whereas sleep onset-related GH secretion is blunted in patients compared with healthy controls. Clinical experience suggests that the improvement of OCD is strongly linked to the decrease of sleep alterations but the specific impact of insomnia on the course of the illness and the quality of life (QOL) of patients has not been investigated precisely. Neurobiology shows that sleep regulation and OCD pathophysiology share common serotoninergic mechanisms, suggesting that their relationship is not fortuitous. Prescription of serotonin-acting antidepressant for OCD has to be reassessed to prevent further alteration of sleep structure. Actually, antidepressants active on OCD stimulate vigilance and could disrupt sleep continuity. From a therapeutic point of view, we need to determine the reciprocal effects of specific treatments (ODC or sleep focused) on the evolution of the other variables. It is likely that sleep care should facilitate OCD treatment and reciprocally.",

      "abstract": "After only Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. The incidence of this disease increases with age, especially for those above 70 years old. There are many risk factors that are well-established in the contribution to the development of PD, such as age, gender, ethnicity, rapid eye movement sleep disorder, high consumption of dairy products, traumatic brain injury, genetics, and pesticides/herbicides. Interestingly, smoking, consumption of caffeine, and physical activities are the protective factors of PD. A deficiency of dopamine in the substantia nigra of the brainstem is the main pathology. This, subsequently, alters the neurotransmitter, causing an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signals. In addition, genetics is also involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. As a result, patients exhibit characteristic motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, bradykinesia, and postural instability, along with non-motor symptoms, including dementia, urinary incontinence, sleeping disturbances, and orthostatic hypotension. PD may resemble other diseases; therefore, it is important to pay attention to the diagnosis criteria. Parkinson’s disease dementia can share common features with AD; this can include behavioral as well as psychiatric symptoms, in addition to the pathology being protein aggregate accumulation in the brain. For PD management, the administration of pharmacological treatment depends on the motor symptoms experienced by the patients. Non-pharmacological treatment plays a role as adjuvant therapy, while surgical management is indicated in chronic cases. This paper aims to review the etiology, risk factors, protective factors, pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, associated conditions, and management of PD.",

This is to a great extent due to a decreased brain plasticity affecting the formation of memory traces for different sensory stimuli essential for different cognitive operations of the brain. Furthermore, MMN can serve as a measure of recovery or neural reorganization in different neurological disorders. For example, the recovery from aphasic symptoms after stroke was associated with the enhancement of MMN. MMN has also been useful in determining neural plastic changes of the auditory system associated with cochlear implantation.",

      "title": "Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus",
      "abstract": "An impairment of eye movements, or nystagmus, is seen in many diseases of the central nervous system, in particular those affecting the brainstem and cerebellum, as well as in those of the vestibular system. The key to diagnosis is a systematic clinical examination of the different types of eye movements, including: eye position, range of eye movements, smooth pursuit, saccades, gaze-holding function and optokinetic nystagmus, as well as testing for the different types of nystagmus (e.g., central fixation nystagmus or peripheral vestibular nystagmus). Depending on the time course of the signs and symptoms, eye movements often indicate a specific underlying cause (e.g., stroke or neurodegenerative or metabolic disorders). A detailed knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of eye movements enables the physician to localize the disturbance to a specific area in the brainstem (midbrain, pons or medulla) or cerebellum (in particular the flocculus). For example, isolated dysfunction of vertical eye movements is due to a midbrain lesion affecting the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, with impaired vertical saccades only, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal or the posterior commissure; common causes with an acute onset are an infarction or bleeding in the upper midbrain or in patients with chronic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C). Isolated dysfunction of horizontal saccades is due to a pontine lesion affecting the paramedian pontine reticular formation due, for instance, to brainstem bleeding, glioma or Gaucher disease type 3; an impairment of horizontal and vertical saccades is found in later stages of PSP, NP-C and Gaucher disease type 3. Gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN) in all directions indicates a cerebellar dysfunction and can have multiple causes such as drugs, in particular antiepileptics, chronic alcohol abuse, neurodegenerative cerebellar disorders or cerebellar ataxias; purely vertical GEN is due to a midbrain lesion, while purely horizontal GEN is due to a pontomedullary lesion. The pathognomonic clinical sign of internuclear ophthalmoplegia is an impaired adduction while testing horizontal saccades on the side of the lesion in the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fascicule. The most common pathological types of central nystagmus are downbeat nystagmus (DBN) and upbeat nystagmus (UBN). DBN is generally due to cerebellar dysfunction affecting the flocculus bilaterally (e.g., due to a neurodegenerative disease). Treatment options exist for a few disorders: miglustat for NP-C and aminopyridines for DBN and UBN. It is therefore particularly important to identify treatable cases with these conditions.",

      "title": "Confusional status epilepticus in elderly",
      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

      "abstract": "Biological, environmental, behavioral, and social factors can influence sleep and lead to sleep disorders or diseases. Sleep disorders are common, numerous, and heterogeneous in terms of their etiology, pathogenesis, and symptomatology. The management of sleep–wake circadian disorders (SWCDs) includes education on sleep hygiene, behavioral strategies, psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly), instrument-based treatments (i.e., positive airway pressure therapy, hypoglossal nerve stimulation), and pharmacotherapy. Depending on the disease, therapy varies and is executed sequentially or can be a combination of several forms of therapy. Drugs used for SWCDs include traditional sleep- or wake-promoting agents and chronotherapeutic agents. Recently, novel medications, which more precisely act on specific neurochemical systems (i.e., the orexin system) important for sleep and waking, are also increasingly being used. In this review, the pharmacotherapy of common sleep disorders (insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorder, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders) embedded in the overall therapeutic concept of each disorder is presented. There is also an outlook on possible future pharmacotherapies.",

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly. Furthermore, prevalence and incidence, definition and causes of voice disorders in elderly are shown by presenting results of the recent researches. This paper also describes diagnostic procedures and current treatments for voice disorders in elderly and addresses its efficiency.",

Cet etat est une caracteristique commune a l'exposition a l'altitude et au syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS), bien que celle-ci soit continue dans le premier cas et intermittente et nocturne dans le second.L'hypoxie d'altitude entraine une alteration des performances cognitives et motrices. La reduction de la performance a l'exercice en altitude a longtemps ete attribuee a une alteration du metabolisme musculaire du fait d'une reduction de l'apport en oxygene. Les perturbations cerebrales induites par l'hypoxie pourraient egalement avoir un role majeur dans cette limitation.Le SAOS, veritable enjeu de sante publique, est associe a des troubles cognitifs pouvant ainsi influencer le fonctionnement quotidien des patients souffrant de ce syndrome et resulter en une somnolence diurne excessive, une baisse de la qualite de vie ou encore une reduction de la productivite au travail et des performances scolaires. Le fait que ces alterations cerebrales puissent influencer les capacites motrices et a l'effort des patients atteints d’apnees obstructives du sommeil reste en revanche a investiguer.Au cours de ce travail de these, nous nous sommes interesses a deux modeles d’exposition hypoxique et a leurs consequences cerebrales et neuromusculaires. Nous avons tout d’abord etudie l'effet d'une exposition a l'hypoxie d'altitude aigue (quelques heures) et prolongee (plusieurs jours) sur la fonction neuromusculaire et ses repercussions a l'exercice chez le sujet sain. Nous avons ensuite etudie l'influence du modele d'hypoxie intermittente associe au SAOS sur la fonction neuromusculaire et la tolerance a l'exercice de ces patients. Nous avons ainsi cherche a caracteriser les alterations cerebrales a l'exercice en lien avec ce syndrome et leur reversibilite suite a un traitement en ventilation par pression positive continue.Chez le sujet sain, nous avons demontre que la performance a l'exercice impliquant une masse musculaire reduite (flechisseurs du coude) n'etait pas limitee par une fatigue centrale accrue apres 1 et 5 jours d'exposition a une altitude de 4350 m. Nous avons mis en evidence que la dysfonction musculaire (force et endurance reduites) observee chez le patient SAOS est associee a un deficit d'activation supraspinal et une augmentation de l'inhibition intracorticale. De plus, nos resultats suggerent qu'une alteration de la reponse cerebrovasculaire a l'exercice puissent impacter negativement la tolerance a l'exercice des patients souffrant d'un SAOS severe. Ces alterations neuromusculaires et cerebrovasculaires n'etaient pas corrigees apres un traitement de huit semaines par ventilation nocturne en pression positive continue soulignant la nature persistante de ces alterations cerebrales.",

      "abstract": "The term 'stereotypies' encompasses a diverse range of movements, behaviours, and/or vocalizations that are repetitive, lack clear function, and sometimes appear to have a negative impact upon an individual's life. This review aims to describe motor stereotypies.This study reviewed the current literature on the nature, aetiology, and treatment of motor stereotypies.Motor stereotypies occur commonly but not exclusively in autistic spectrum disorders. Similar movements are also found in otherwise healthy children and those suffering sensory impairment, social isolation, or severe intellectual disabilities; they may be persistent over time. Although often difficult, it is possible to define and differentiate stereotypies from other movement disorders such as tics through features of the history, such as earlier onset and examination, together with the presence or absence of associated neurological impairment or developmental difficulties. Co-occurrence with other disorders affecting frontostriatal brain systems, including attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and tic disorders, is common.The underlying function of motor stereotypies remains unclear but may include the maintenance of arousal levels. A neurogenetic aetiology is proposed but requires further study. When treatment is sought, there are both pharmacological and behavioural options. Behavioural treatments for motor stereotypies may in time be shown to be most effective; however, they are difficult to implement in children younger than 7 years old.",

      "title": "Action myoclonus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and other cerebellar myoclonic syndromes.",
      "abstract": "Action myoclonus, reviewed in this chapter, is the term applied to arrhythmic muscular jerking induced by voluntary movement. It is made worse by attempts at precise or coordinated movement (intention myoclonus) and may also be provoked by certain sensory stimuli. The effective stimuli for action myoclonus is probably feedback from muscle afferents, although it may be initiated by corollary discharge from motor cortex to reticular formation before or at the onset of voluntary movement. The condition is usually associated with diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although action myoclonus may be limited to one limb in some cases of focal cerebral damage. It is caused by hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus), or both. No consistent pathological change has been reported in autopsied cases of action myoclonus. The underlying disorder appears to be a loss of inhibitory mechanisms involving serotonin and possibly GABA as transmitter agents. The term PME is used for the association of myoclonus with degenerative changes in the nervous system which are commonly diffuse but may predominate in certain systems. There may or may not be associated tonic-clonic seizures, other manifestations of epilepsy, or dementia. Those cases of PME associated with Lafora inclusion bodies and cerebral storage diseases can be distinguished from the system degenerations. Systems which may be involved in the latter group include cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar pathways, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers. Confronted with this diversity of pathological change, it seems unnecessary to make any clinical distinction between Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome (Baltic myoclonus) because cerebellar signs are found in patients described under both headings. Additional systems may be involved in individuals or families who are otherwise typical. All three names could well be joined in an eponymous title (Unverricht-Lundborg-Hunt disease) or the condition simply known as the systems degeneration type of PME, as Halliday (43) suggested. The cause of the condition (or spectrum of conditions) is at present unknown. Action myoclonus usually responds to sodium valproate or clonazepam, and some individuals, particularly those with posthypoxic myoclonus, improve with the administration of serotonin precursors.",

      "title": "Anxiety disorders in Parkinson's disease.",
      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders frequently occur in association with PD and may be important causes of morbidity. Actual prevalence rates are uncertain, but estimates suggest that up to 40% of patients with PD experience substantial anxiety. This percentage is greater than expected, particularly for an elderly population. In addition, the age at onset of anxiety in PD (and particularly panic disorder) is later than would be expected from current information regarding the natural course of anxiety disorders. Virtually all of the types of anxiety disorders have been described in PD, but panic disorder, GAD, and social phobia appear to be the ones most commonly encountered. Although most patients with motor fluctuations experience greater anxiety during the \"off\" phase, this is not a universal phenomenon. Anxiety frequently develops before the motor features do, suggesting that anxiety may not represent psychological and social difficulties in adapting to the illness but rather may be linked to specific neurobiologic processes that occur in PD. Most evidence points to disturbances in central noradrenergic systems, but other neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, dopamine) may be involved as well. Studies suggest that right hemispheric disturbances may be particularly important for the genesis of anxiety, especially panic and OCD. Whether antiparkinsonian medications themselves contribute to anxiety needs clarification. Anxiety and depression frequently coexist in PD. It remains to be determined whether anxiety in patients with PD reflects one of the following pathologies: (a) an underlying depressive mood disorder, (b) a particular subtype of depression (atypical depression, anxious or agitated depression), or (c) an independent psychiatric disturbance. The relationship between anxiety and dementia in PD is not clear, but current evidence suggests that cognitive dysfunction is not related to the presence of anxiety symptoms in this disorder. The optimal pharmacologic treatment for anxiety in patients with PD has not been established, nor has the effect of PD surgery on anxiety symptoms.",

      "title": "Visual trails: When perceptual continuity breaks down",
      "abstract": "“Visual trailing” is a transient but dramatic disturbance of visual motion perception of unknown origin: the subject perceives a series of discrete stationary images trailing in the wake of otherwise normally moving objects. Although this phenomenon is most frequently encountered after ingestion of prescription and/or illicit drugs (i.e. Lysergic Acid Diethylamid or LSD), it has also occasionally been reported following brain damage or neurological disorders. Visual trails, because of their discrete and repetitive nature, may represent the perceptual manifestation of an underlying periodic neural process. This periodicity could arise outside of the visual system altogether (e.g. eye movements, motor tremor), or may be the result of faulty motion computation mechanisms (e.g. motion smear suppression), or finally, may point to a more general oscillatory process that affects, among other things, the motion perception system. However, only qualitative case reports exist in the literature, and a quantitative account of visual trails is currently lacking. We report our attempt to collect both qualitative and quantitative data on this phenomenon by means of an online survey. We simulated visual trails in a short movie and varied the interval between successive persisting images of moving objects (10 intervals between 25 and 250 ms); then we instructed past users of LSD (as assessed via a questionnaire) to report which sequence best corresponded to their experience of visual trails. Although the survey is still ongoing, we present results from more than 200 responses. Participants consistently selected a time interval between images of 60 ms on average, corresponding to an underlying periodicity in the 15–20 Hz (beta) range. This is but a preliminary step, and we suggest key experiments that should help identify the oscillatory underpinnings of this rare disturbance, and eventually lead to important insights into how our brains update conscious visual perception in time.",

      "abstract": ": Introduction: Parkinson’s disease is a neurological disorder characterized by tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Impairment of motor skills and cognition compromise the patient’s diet, nutrition and ability to maintain proper oral hygiene. As a result dental caries and edentulism seem to be a direct impending predicament. It is important to understand that people with parkinson’s disease start experiencing symptoms later in the course of the disease because a significant amount of the substantia nigra neurons have already been lost or impaired. Lewy bodies (accumulation of abnormal alphasynuclein) are found in substantia nigra neurons of PD patients. In addition to movement-related (motor) symptoms, Parkinson’s symptoms may be unrelated to movement (non-motor). People with Parkinson’s disease are often more impacted by their non-motor symptoms than motor symptoms such as apathy, depression, constipation, sleep behavior disorders, loss of sense of smell and cognitive impairment. Prosthodontics management of patients with parkinson’s disease require diligent handling.Objectives and Methods: A patient with a history of Parkinsons disease for the past 5 years (under medication) visited Saveetha dental college with the chief complaint of broken prosthesis. High impact resin was chosen to be material of choice for this patient due to its high flexural strength. So the prosthetic phase was modified and a drug delivery denture was fabricated to meet the demands of this patient. Results: Drug delivering partial denture was fabricated to meet the esthetic demands of the patient as well as to deliver the extended release formulation of the drug for managing the motor fluctuations.Key words: Parkinson’s disease, Tab.

The obtained results show that the patients with apnea syndrome sleep very badly, and consequently, shortened sleep latency and frequent body movements, along with apneas, are regarded as the leading polysomnographic symptoms. Vigilance profile during sleep, that is, interchange and frequency of each of sleep stages (I, II, III, IV, REM) are similar in both tested groups. The suppression of restitutive stages of sleep (III, IV, REM) is considered to be a dominant characteristic of vigilance during sleep in obese persons and obese persons with manifest apnea syndrome. Relatively prolonged sleep latency in obese persons without manifest apnea syndrome indicates, however, restitutively higher quality of their nocturnal sleep. Contrary to the patients with apnea syndrome, they do not suffer from excessive evening somnolence, so that their daily alertness and sleep vigilance during night are of a better quality, although the lack of deep and REM sleep is observed in them as well.",

Older adults have increased prevalence of various primary sleep disorders, including restless leg syndrome, insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, circadian rhythm disturbances and periodic limb syndrome. Challenges in identifying, diagnosing, and treating sleep disorders in older adults with dementia also exist, which further complicates the management of sleep disorders in these patients.

Both patients ate at night small amounts of easily consumed foods which they went to fetch in the kitchen as often as five times per night. Their behaviour was calm and aimed. Usually they did not remember the nocturnal eating. Polysomnographic examination in both patients revealed poor sleep with frequent changes of the sleep stages, with frequent awakenings, in both patients incl. even awakening from deep NREM sleep.

      "title": "Extraocular features of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: A scoping review",
      "abstract": "Background: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare inherited mitochondrial disease that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in optic nerve damage and vision loss. Systemic involvement has been reported in several LHON cases, referred to as LHON+ disorders. However, the causes and presentations of such conditions have been poorly studied. It is suggested that 90% of mitochondrial dysfunction is caused by one of three primary point mutations in mitochondrial DNA that affect respiratory complex I (referred to as mtDNA LHON), with unresolved cases of LHON being caused by other variants, known as autosomal recessive LHON. The cardiac, musculoskeletal, neurological, and auditory systems are commonly affected in LHON. For example, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death have been linked to specific mutations. Neurological effects &amp;ndash; such as dystonia, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, and ataxia &amp;ndash; as well as hearing loss, have also been observed in patients with specific mitochondrial mutations. These findings highlight the need for a more comprehensive evaluation beyond standard ophthalmic assessments. LHON is typically diagnosed based on a combination of ophthalmic imaging, patient age and gender, clinical course (bilateral, rapidly progressive, and sequential visual loss), family history, maternal inheritance, and fundus appearance. However, the advent of genetic testing has significantly expanded the recognized phenotype. In terms of treatment, idebenone is the only FDA-approved therapy for LHON; however, intravitreal gene therapy yields promising improvement, especially for the most common m.11778G&gt;A mutation, which accounts for 70% of causative mutations. At present, these therapies are confined to ocular treatment. Objective: This review highlights the importance of recognizing systemic manifestations of LHON, which are frequently overlooked in clinical practice. Conclusion: Early detection of these systemic manifestations, especially in cardiac and neurological systems, could help with prompt intervention and improve patient outcomes. Further research into gene therapy and mitochondrial replacement techniques holds promising potential for developing more effective treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as excessive daytime sleepiness, 'sleep attacks', insomnia, restless legs syndrome and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, are common and provide a challenge to treatment. These sleep symptoms are also described in patients suffering from the sleep/wake disorder, narcolepsy. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) narcolepsy criteria uses a number of markers for diagnosis, of which lack or deficiency of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels is a key marker. Hypocretin neurons prominently located in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical nucleus have been proposed to interact with mechanisms involving sleep and arousal. Low hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF have been shown to correlate with hypothalamic hypocretin cell loss in narcolepsy and other forms of hypersomnia; therefore, it has been proposed that degenerative damage to hypocretin neurons (such as in PD) may be detected by low CSF hypocretin-1 concentrations, and may also explain the sleep symptoms experienced by some PD patients. To date, there is mixed conflicting data describing hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF of patients with parkinsonism associated with sleep symptoms, with most studies showing no significant decrease when compared with controls. However, hypocretin-1 CSF deficiency has been shown in some studies to be more prominent in PD patients with sleep symptoms versus those without. Notably, the hypocretin system has been shown not to be selectively disrupted, with one study showing melanin concentrating hormone cell loss in the same patients with hypocretin loss. It is likely that hypocretin deficiency in PD patients occurs secondary to collateral damage caused by the neurodegenerative process involving the hypothalamus. Awareness of narcoleptic events in PD is important for driving related advice, in addition to the possible use of dopamine D3 receptor active agonists.",

      "title": "0670 Does Restless Legs Syndrome Impact Cognitive Function via Sleep Quality in Adults with Parkinson’s Disease?",
      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sleep disorder that results in sleep dysfunction. Sleep disruption can have profound negative consequences in adults with Parkinson’s disease (PD), potentially including cognitive dysfunction. The current study explored the possibility that persons with PD who have RLS experience more sleep dysfunction and cognitive impairment, and that the symptoms of RLS may be indirectly linked with cognitive deficit through a pathway involving sleep. Participants (N=79) with idiopathic PD completed six questionnaires evaluating RLS, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, global cognitive function, sleep apnea risk, and depression. Participants were further examined for body composition (BMI) and motor symptom severity (MDS-UPDRS Part III). Persons with RLS (n = 25) had significantly worse cognitive function (p = 0.035, d = -0.56) and sleep quality (p < 0.0001, d = -1.19), and more daytime sleepiness (p = 0.009, d = 0.67), and had a greater risk of sleep apnea (p = 0.036) than those without RLS (n = 54). The presence of RLS was significantly correlated with worse sleep quality (r = -0.501), more daytime sleepiness (r = 0.298), worse cognitive impairment (r = -0.296), and higher risk for OSA (r = 0.236). Cognitive function was not significantly correlated with sleep quality (r = 0.113), daytime sleepiness (r = -0.001), or sleep apnea risk (r = -0.029). The association between RLS and cognition was not attenuated by controlling for sleep quality or daytime sleepiness. This study is unique as it is the first to consider the possibility that RLS in PD may be associated with cognitive deficits through a pathway involving sleep quality. Persons with RLS and PD demonstrate greater deficits in both sleep quality and cognitive function than individuals without RLS; however, the impairment in cognitive function among those with PD and RLS is not seemingly accounted for by impairment in sleep quality.

Only the parasomnias have been studied as such in the newborn period. The parasomnias that occur in this age group are infant sleep apnea, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, sudden infant death syndrome, and benign neonatal sleep myoclonus. Infant sleep apnea includes three entities: (1) apnea of prematurity, (2), apparent life threatening episodes with apnea and (3) obstructive sleep apnea. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome can be associated with other autonomic system illness, such as Hirschsprung disease (Haddad syndrome) and neuroblastoma. The implementation of the supine sleep position and smoking free homes has diminished the frequency of sudden infant death syndrome. Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus should be considered in all newborns with a normal exam between the episodes when they always occur during sleep. This entity may be mistaken for status epilepticus, because it is associated with increases in heart rate. Benzodiazepines prolongs the duration of the episodes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neglect is the failure to report, respond, or orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite a brain lesion, when this failure cannot be attributed to either sensory or motor defects (Heilman, 1979). Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep-wake disturbances are common in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in movement disorders, affecting quality of life. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a tauopathy characterized by tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to degeneration of cortical and subcortical brain structures, particularly the midbrain. Sleep abnormalities in PSP include REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless leg syndrome (RLS), periodic leg movement in sleep (PLMS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/central sleep apnea (CSA), insomnia, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Anti-IgLON5 disease, first described in 2014, is a recently recognized neurological condition. Unlike other tauopathies like PSP and corticobasal syndrome (CBS), anti-IgLON5 features distinct tau deposition patterns. Polysomnography with synchronized audiovisual recording is crucial for diagnosis, showing characteristic sleep patterns like “undifferentiated-NREM (UN-NREM)” and “poorly-structured N2 (P-SN2)”. Report of case We present a 62-year-old patient with symptoms starting in 2021, including hyperexplexia to sounds, rapid movements of the right upper limb, and delayed speech latency. In 2022, anxiety, restlessness, weight loss, and thoughts of doom emerged, along with a festinating gait and axial flexion posture. By 2023, the patient developed perseverative thoughts, compulsive guttural sounds, bilateral tremors, and sleep disturbances, including long daytime naps. Behavioral disinhibition, topographic disorientation, and emotional lability were also noted. In mid-2024, the patient exhibited nighttime leg movements, gait instability, progressive dysphagia, increased irritability, and a suicide attempt, leading to admission in the psychiatric unit. Due to dysautonomia, the patient was transferred to neurology, where polysomnography was conducted. Polysomnography findings revealed severely disrupted sleep architecture: prolonged wakefulness (327.5 minutes), predominance of light sleep (Stage N1, 85.1%), and a significant reduction in Stage N2 (10.0%) and REM sleep (4.9%). These findings indicate profound sleep fragmentation and loss of restorative sleep stages. Conclusion Due to the lack of financial resources from both the patient and the hospital, as well as the absence of necessary supplies for cerebrospinal fluid measurements to detect anti-IgLON5 autoantibodies, a definitive diagnosis could not be established. The treatment was symptom-directed.

      "abstract": "Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common non-motor feature of Parkinson’s disease that may cause unexplained falls, syncope, lightheadedness, cognitive impairment, dyspnea, fatigue, blurred vision, shoulder, neck, or low-back pain upon standing. Blood pressure (BP) measurements supine and after 3 minutes upon standing screen for OH at bedside. The medical history and cardiovascular autonomic function tests ultimately distinguish neurogenic OH, which is due to impaired sympathetic nerve activity, from non-neurogenic causes of OH, such as hypovolemia and BP lowering drugs. The correction of non-neurogenic causes and exacerbating factors, lifestyle changes and non-pharmacological measures are the cornerstone of OH treatment. If these measures fail, pharmacological interventions (sympathomimetic agents and/or fludrocortisone) should be introduced stepwise depending on the severity of symptoms. About 50% of patients with neurogenic OH also suffer from supine and nocturnal hypertension, which should be monitored for with in-office, home and 24 h-ambulatory BP measurements. Behavioral measures help prevent supine hypertension, which is eventually treated with non-pharmacological measures and bedtime administration of short-acting anti-hypertensive drugs in severe cases. If left untreated, OH impacts on activity of daily living and increases the risk of syncope and falls. Supine hypertension is asymptomatic, but often limits an effective treatment of OH, increases the risk of hypertensive emergencies and, combined with OH, facilitates end-organ damage. A timely management of both OH and supine hypertension ameliorates quality of life and prevents short and long-term complications in patients with Parkinson’s disease.",

      "abstract": "Key-words Disease name and synonyms Definition Abstract The syndrome of continuous spike and waves discharges during slow sleep (CSWSS) is a rare form of age-related epilepsy. Onset occurs between ages 3 and 7 years, and rarely before 2 years. In the absence of brain lesions, CSWSS syndrome occurs in normally developing children. Partial or generalized seizures are rare and occur while the child is falling asleep. Cognitive functions are subsequently altered and behavioural disorders are often seen. The initial neuropsychological deficits affecting a specific cognitive function such as language, gesture or constructive abilities, attention span or behaviour control are often wrongly attributed to psychological problems. The best known cognitive deficit is aphasia. Acquired epileptic aphasia, the Landau and Kleffner syndrome, has been named after the authors who described it in 1957. EEG anomalies are always present. During wakefulness, EEG recordings show focal paroxysmal spike and wave discharges. During slow sleep, spikes and waves become generalized and continuous, occupying over 85% of sleep. There are no concomitant motor seizures, but cognitive impairments progress. With antiepileptic drugs, the EEG becomes normal and neuropsychological status improves with antiepileptic drugs. Epileptic seizures always disappear with adolescence but neuropsychological sequelae may persist. There is no specific treatment with durable effects on the seizures and neuropsychological disorders. Management of CSWSS syndrome requires teams specialized in pediatric epilepsy and neuropsychology.",

Clinicians should also be aware of conditions that commonly occur in conjunction with this illness, including sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, depressive and anxiety disorders, and chronic fatigue.

      "abstract": "<italic>Life’s Rewards: Linking Dopamine, Incentive Learning, Schizophrenia, and the Mind</italic> explains how increased brain dopamine produces reward-related incentive learning, the acquisition by neutral stimuli of increased ability to elicit approach and other responses. Dopamine decreases may produce inverse incentive learning, the loss by stimuli of the ability to elicit approach and other responses. Incentive learning is gradually lost when dopamine receptors are blocked. The brain has multiple memory systems defined as “declarative” and “non-declarative;” incentive learning produces one form of non-declarative memory. People with schizophrenia have hyperdopaminergia, possibly producing excessive incentive learning. Delusions may rely on declarative memory to interpret the world as it appears with excessive incentive learning. Parkinson’s disease, associated with dopamine loss, may involve a loss of incentive learning and increased inverse incentive learning. Drugs of abuse activate dopaminergic neurotransmission, leading to incentive learning about drug-associated stimuli. After withdrawal symptoms have been alleviated by detoxification treatment, drug-associated conditioned incentive stimuli will retain their ability to elicit responses until they are repeatedly experienced in the absence of primary drug rewards. Incentive learning may involve the action of dopamine at dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons that have recently had glutamatergic input from assemblies of cortical neurons activated by environmental and proprioceptive stimuli. Glutamate initiates a wave of phosphorylation normally followed by a wave of phosphatase activity. If dopaminergic neurons fire, stimulation of D1 receptors prolongs the wave of phosphorylation, allowing glutamate synaptic strengthening. Activity in dopaminergic neurons in humans appears to affect mental experience.",

The term “dyskinesia” is often used to encompass complex involuntary movements that do not fit into another category of involuntary movements. Focal dyskinesia is commonly seen in the lips and tongue (orolingual dyskinesia or oral dyskinesia). Drug side effects are the most common cause of generalized dyskinesia, usually those that influence dopamine such as L-dopa and neuroleptics (drug-induced dyskinesia, tardive dyskinesia). Motor stereotypies are repetitive occurrences of the same movements; movements commonly encountered in this condition range from simple movements like shaking arms and nodding to complex movements. Motor stereotypies are commonly observed in children with Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome and other automatisms, and mental retardation. In adults, stereotyped movements are seen in cases of severe infectious encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis (e.g., limbic encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases involving the frontal lobe, and neurodegenerative diseases like frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Tics are irregular, typically brisk movements ranging from shock-like simple movements resembling myoclonus (simple tic) to complex movements (complex tic). Patients with tics tend to repeat certain movements like blinking or grimacing, but in the patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, tics appear as a variety of movements including vocalization (vocal tic). These patients can stop the movements for several seconds, but it is often followed by rebound; they often feel an urge to move before a bout of tics and feel release after the bout.",

      "title": "Waking up to the importance of sleeping well for cardiovascular health",
      "abstract": "The potentially adverse impact of poor sleep quality, insomnia, and other sleep disorders on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been the subject of increasing exploration over the past decade. Obstructive sleep apnea has been the most extensively studied sleep disorder in relation to hypertension, and is thought to be causally related through mechanisms including heightened sympathetic nervous system activity and vascular endothelial dysfunction that are triggered by sleep-disordered breathing.1 A growing body of research evidence has also revealed relationships between insomnia and CVD. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and is defined by subjective reports of difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking too early.2 With insomnia, both sleep quality and duration are often impaired. Although a diagnosis of insomnia disorder may be based on self-report alone, objectively assessed insomnia features using polysomnography reveals longer sleep onset latency, more frequent nocturnal awakenings, and prolonged periods of wakefulness during the sleep period relative to normal sleepers.3 Observational studies employing objective sleep measures show that individuals with insomnia are more likely to have CVD, even after controlling for comorbid sleep disorders, and other potentially confounding comorbidities.4 Short sleep duration has also been associated with an increased risk of heart disease, higher blood pressure (BP), metabolic syndrome, greater coronary calcification, and higher levels of stress hormones.5 An important pathway through which sleep may affect CVD risk is through its relationship with BP, with substantial support for an association between insomnia and incident hypertension.6, 7 For example, in a prospective study of 786 men and women from the Penn State Cohort, those with chronic insomnia, determined by polysomnographic study and subjective reports of sleep problems persisting for over a year, were at over twice the risk of developing hypertension over a 7.5-year follow-up period. Furthermore, chronic insomnia coupled with short sleep duration (<6 hours) was associated with a fourfold increased risk of developing hypertension.8 Other studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, have reported similar observations, reinforcing the perspective that insomnia, when coupled with short sleep duration, may be especially hazardous in terms of its association with hypertension and CVD.9-11 Poor sleep quality is a widespread problem, commonly reported by patients with a variety of medical and mental health conditions,12, 13 as well as among those with diagnosed sleep disorders. However, the potentially broad impact of poor self-reported sleep quality on CVD risk has received relatively little attention. In the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Hypertension, Lo and colleagues report14 an informative meta-analysis examining the association between subjective sleep quality and BP. The authors include data from studies based on over 45 000 participants spanning five continents and provide formal analyses of studies that assessed subjective sleep quality using the well-established and validated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.15, 16 Their analyses showed that poor subjective sleep quality was associated with higher BP and an increased likelihood of hypertension. The impact of poor sleep quality is perhaps likely to be most conspicuously reflected in BP during the nighttime sleep period. Ambulatory BP monitoring studies have established that BP typically exhibits a circadian rhythm characterized by a fall in pressure during the nighttime sleep period. Relative to daytime pressure, a nighttime dip in BP of ≥10% is considered normal and individuals with this level of BP dipping are referred to as BP dippers, whereas a nighttime BP dip of <10% describes nondippers.17 Lo and colleagues found that in the subset of studies in their meta-analysis, which used both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and ambulatory BP monitoring, BP dippers were characterized by better sleep quality than nondippers. Other studies, using subjective as well as objective measures of sleep quality derived from polysomnography and actigraphy, also have shown poor sleep quality to be associated with a blunting of the normal nighttime dip in BP.18-22 The nondipping circadian BP profile is associated with target organ damage, including cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease23, 24 and is a strong prognostic indicator of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for both patients with and those without hypertension.23, 25-28 This evidence underscores the importance of BP measured during the nighttime sleep period, reflecting its greater prognostic significance than clinic BP, or ambulatory BP assessed during the daytime.29 Nonetheless, the physiological mechanisms accounting for blunted nighttime BP dipping and elevated nighttime BP are not well understood.30 Sympathetic nervous system activity normally shows a substantial decline from daytime waking activities to nighttime sleep, but the magnitude of this decline is attenuated in the context of a nondipping nighttime BP profile.21, 31, 32 Heightened nighttime sympathetic nervous system activity would favor peripheral vascular constriction, resulting in abnormally elevated systemic vascular resistance during the sleep period.33 The contribution of vascular disease to a blunted nighttime BP dip is supported by observations that a nondipping circadian BP profile is approximately twice as common in patients with coronary heart disease compared with age-matched healthy controls.34, 35 Blunted BP dipping has also been associated with impaired vascular endothelial function in women with untreated hypertension.35 As might be anticipated, in a study of men and women with hypertension, the hemodynamic mechanism related to a nondipping BP profile was a failure for systemic vascular resistance to show a normal decline during the nighttime sleep period.37 In view of the well-established pathophysiologic significance of elevated systemic vascular resistance in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension,38 coupled with the prognostic significance of elevated nighttime BP, it is not difficult to appreciate the potential importance that sleep quality may have in the pathogenesis of hypertensive heart disease. The available evidence therefore clearly implicates poor sleep quality and insomnia as risk factors in the cause of hypertension. It also suggests that in the context of high BP and hypertension, poor sleep quality may exacerbate hypertension by promoting target organ damage and increasing the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. However, the critical question of whether poor sleep quality is a modifiable risk factor for hypertension and CVD remains unanswered. In 2016, the American Heart Association published a scientific statement calling for research aimed at better understanding the association between sleep duration, sleep quality, and insomnia with CVD.39 Despite the wealth of available evidence, it is almost all observational, and the existence of a causal relationship between insomnia and CVD remains conjecture rather than inference. However, there is some preliminary evidence suggesting that sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for hypertension. In a pilot study of 22 adults with high BP, who slept <7 h/d, 13 were randomized to a 6-week intervention designed to extend the sleep period and 9 to a control condition.40 Those in the sleep-extension group showed a postintervention increase in sleep duration of 35 minutes following the intervention, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in 24-hour BP, whereas no significant changes occurred in the control group. We now need more well-designed randomized controlled trials to test the broad hypothesis that improving sleep quality in individuals with insomnia or subjectively reported sleep problems will reduce the risk of developing hypertension, as well as help control BP in those with hypertension, ultimately reducing the risk of adverse clinical events. Examining the effects of pharmacological treatments to improve sleep would be of interest, but interventions using cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia may be especially informative. Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia is safe and effective and is the current gold standard for insomnia treatment.41 Therefore, it is ideally suited for intervention trials in healthy individuals and in patients with hypertension and/or other medical and psychiatric comorbidities.

      "abstract": "Menurut Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (DSMIV), insomnia merupakan suatu keluhan yang dialami pasien berupa kesulitan dalam memulai tidur, mempertahankan kondisi tidur (tidak terbangun), atau tidur yang tidak menyegarkan selama 1 bulan atau lebih. Pada umumnya sekitar 35% orang dewasa mengalami insomnia selama satu tahun, setengahnya merupakan insomnia berat. Perbandingan terjadinya insomnia pada wanita dan pria adalah 1,5:1. Saat seseorang bepergian jauh juga akan meningkatkan resiko terjadinya gangguan tidur karena adanya perbedaan waktu antara daerah yang satu dengan lainnya. Hal ini sering disebut sebagai jet lag. Pada intinya, jet lag merupakan akibat dari ketidaksesuaian yang terjadi setelah melewati daerah dengan waktu yang terlalu cepat. Jet lag memiliki ciri ketidaksesuaian yang sementara antara endogen sirkardian tidur/bangun dan lingkungan fisik eksternal yang mengarah pada perubahan waktu. Hal ini dapat di terapi dengan mengatur kembali ritme sirkardian baik itu dengan mengatur ulang ritme tidur seseorang maupun dengan terapi farmakologis lain yang sesuai.",

However, it remains unknown whether sleep terrors occur only from NREM sleep. We evaluated 3 cases of a sleep terrors-like parasomnia that occurred exclusively during arousals from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These parasomnia events occurred at REM sleep-wake transitions, manifesting with screaming or crying, similar to sleep terrors, without alertness or clear orientation. The patients were all young-adult females without notable medical conditions. REM sleep behavior disorder and nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy were not detected based on their video-polysomnographic findings. These 3 cases should be provisionally diagnosed as \"Parasomnia, Unspecified\" according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition; however, the phenomenological diagnosis is proposed to be \"Disorders of Arousal from REM Sleep.\" Our reported cases indicate that sleep terrors may also arise from REM sleep.Futenma K, Inoue Y, Saso A, Takaesu Y, Yamashiro Y, Matsuura M.

Sleep state can be helpful to distinguish FNSD from other neurological disorders. Pseudo-cataplexy, a form of “psychogenic” narcolepsy, “pseudo-parasomnia” and PNES can have a similar presentation. PNES and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently share previously experienced psychological trauma, and therefore the sleep abnormalities found in PTSD may be similarly present in PNES. Future research should use EEG monitoring to evaluate the sleep physiology of patients with FNSD such as PNES, as insights into sleep abnormalities may enable further understanding of the etiology and manifestations of PNES.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV) (1), a delusion is a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes. Hallucination is a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception, but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ. The person may or may not have insight in that he or she is having a hallucination. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are the cardinal features of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are disturbances of usual sleep patterns or behaviors caused by deregulation of neuronal synchronicity and of the balance of the neurotransmitter system involved in sleep regulation. Insomnia and hypersomnia are frequent sleep disorders, and these are most often treated pharmacologically with hypnotics and wake-promoting compounds. These compounds act on classical neurotransmitter systems, such as benzodiazepines on gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors, and amphetamine-like stimulants on monoaminergic terminals to modulate neurotransmission. In addition, acetylcholine, amino acids, lipids and proteins (cytokines) and peptides, are known to significantly modulate sleep, and thus, are possibly involved in the pathophysiology of some sleep disorders. Due to recent developments in molecular biological techniques, many neuropeptides have been newly identified, and some are found to significantly modulate sleep. Recent discoveries also include the finding that the impairment of hypocretin/orexin neurotransmission (a recently isolated hypothalamic neuropeptide and receptor system), is the major pathophysiology of narcolepsy with cataplexy. A hypocretin replacement therapy is anticipated to reverse the disease symptoms in humans. In this article, we will review the history of neuropeptide research, sleep modulatory effects of various neuropeptides, and the general strategies for the pharmacological therapeutics targeting the peptidergic systems by referring to hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy as an immediate example.",

      "title": "Out-of-body experiences in relation to lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis: a theoretical review and conceptual model",
      "abstract": "Out-of body experiences (OBEs) are characterized by the subjective experience of being located outside the physical body. Evidence supports that OBEs triggered by electrical stimulation and epileptic seizures are associated with disrupted brain activity in a distributed network centred at the temporo-parietal junction and the resulting multisensory disruption of body representation. However, little is known about the neurophysiology of spontaneous OBEs, which are often reported by healthy individuals as occurring during states of reduced vigilance, particularly in proximity to or during sleep (sleep-related OBEs). A sleep phenomenon that has been linked to this particular kind of OBE is lucid dreaming, i.e., the realization of being in a dream state. Thus, both lucid dreams and sleep-related OBEs are characterized by the conscious awareness of not being in a standard waking state at the moment of the experience. In this paper, we review the current state of research on sleep-related OBEs and hypothesize that these phenomena, along with certain types of lucid dreams, are more likely to occur during direct transitions from wakefulness to REM sleep (sleep-onset REM periods). Based on this hypothesis, we propose a new conceptual model that potentially describes the relationship between OBEs and sleep states. The model sheds light on the phenomenological differences between sleep-related OBEs and similar states of consciousness, such as lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis, and explores the potential polysomnographic features underlying sleep-related OBEs. Subsequently, we apply the predictive coding framework to suggest that sleep-related OBEs form part of a broader spectrum of experiences, proposing a connecting link between OBEs occurring in a sleep state and OBEs reported during wakefulness. We conclude by discussing experimental options for testing this model.",

      "abstract": "The nerve center responsible for controlling our circadian rhythm is located in a cluster of cells known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. Various physiological functions such as sleep, arousal, blood pressure, body temperature, and hormone secretion are regulated in a 24-hour rhythm by this circuit. Somatic cells of other organs have a peripheral clock gene and by synchronizing the rhythm of the central and peripheral clocks, it is possible to live a healthy life. Due to aging and degenerative disease, circadian rhythm gradually collapses. Factors that can contribute to this include reduced expression of the time gene associated with photo stimulation, a reduction in neurotransmitter levels, and reduced melatonin production. Biological clocks play an important role in our emotions, cognitive function, and behavior. Sleep disorders and metabolic disease related to the circadian rhythm affect metabolic and endocrine activities via the autonomic nervous system and the intestinal bacterial flora. Shift work disorder is associated with insomnia and excessive drowsiness as individuals often work during their sleeping hours. Now time management is placed at the center of our society, and it is important to evaluate the medical risk of engaging in shift work. In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the stereotypical behaviors may be associated with time. In some patients, multiple timed behaviors occupy a considerable part of the patient's daily life. Stereotypical behaviors in FTD are often considered in contrast to obsessive-compulsive disease (OCD). Studies of OCD have found a close correlation between clinical symptoms, cognitive function, and brain function.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome presents with neuromuscular, autonomic, and mental status changes. Severe cases of serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, are characterized by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushing), and altered mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). These more severe cases may come to the clinician's attention on an emergency basis. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome should be considered in a patient presenting with any combination of clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, and/or tremor. Serotonin syndrome is associated with the use of one or more serotonergic agents. Severe cases generally occur with combinations of serotonergic drugs, most commonly including a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Excessive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the central nervous system has been implicated. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to developing serotonin toxicity, based on their use of various medications or other substances with serotonergic properties. When evaluating a patient with clinical features of neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation, and/or altered mental state, prompt identification and management are critical, and treatment considerations are often complex.",

      "abstract": "Background: Rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder (RBD) is a rapid eye movement parasomnia, which in its symptomatic type could be induced by the introduction or the discontinuation of several drugs and substances. No references for antiepileptic drugs and especially for lamotrigine are known regarding pharmacologically induced RBD. Case Report: We report a case of a 68-year-old man already suffering from RBD, who developed very brief episodes of epigastric discomfort followed by impaired consciousness and was given a diagnosis of epilepsy. Lamotrigine was started at 25 mg/d, reached a maximum of 100 mg/d after 2 months and was retained at this dose for 1 more month. During this period there was a slight decrease in the episodes of impaired consciousness and no appreciable changes in the frequency and intensity of RBD symptomatology. Immediately following the abrupt discontinuation of lamotrigine, RBD symptomatology was severely aggravated, with dreams becoming more vivid and frightening and occurring almost every night. RBD symptomatology gradually subsided over 2 months, reaching levels comparable to those before lamotrigine. The impaired consciousness episodes remained unaffected and were considered to be nonepileptic. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine may worsen symptoms of comorbid idiopathic RBD.",

      "title": "Spinal reflex organization in early development: Electrophysiological measures and proposed motor pathways",
      "abstract": "The delay in developmental milestones in cerebral palsy (CP) is presumed to result from a nonprogressive insult to the developing central nervous system (CNS). In CP, the site(s), type, duration, and magnitude of CNS insult(s) may never be defined, and a single focus of damage may not be revealed by standard brain imaging methods. The neurological examination (i.e., assessment of reflexes, tone, and motor coordination) generally does not define the insult with precision, nor can it predict the delays in motor skill development. The CNS damage may only be suspected from the medical history during the prenatal or perinatal period; confirmation of CNS insult may be deferred until the child misses developmental milestones in the first few months or years of life. In CP, patterns of motor incoordination and delay emerge gradually over time during development. While the original CNS injury is presumed to be a nonprogressive insult to higher motor centers (e.g., cerebral motor cortex), the damage probably causes significant modulation of functional neural connections during maturation of the brain and spinal cord. Such aberrant communication in motor pathways may be caused by, or result in, motor incoordination. In turn, repetition of uncoordinated movements may reinforce aberrant neural connections with, or at, the spinal cord. In this paper, we review neural responses to stimulation of sensory and motor systems and compare data for healthy neonates and children, and children and adults with CP. Age-related differences are identified in measured onset latencies of responses, computed central conduction delays, and relative levels of excitatory drive. Differences in muscle responses are shown among subject groups for myotatic reflex activation of agonist, antagonist, and more distant limb muscles. From these data, inferences have been made that, in CP, impairments in CNS circuitry may include descending corticospinal pathways and/or spinal reflex pathways (e.g., “reciprocal excitation”). Data from a number of investigators support the theory that changes in spinal reflex pathways are likely to play a fundamental role in the development of motor control.

This paper described the relationship between several medical agents (neuroleptics, anti-depressants, anti-anxietics, anti-convulsants, psychostimulants, and drugs other than CNS-effective agents) and those effect on sleep and sleep stages. In the medicated patients, medical drugs are mainly responsible for their insomnia. However, it is sometimes difficult to find these drugs. The pathological sleep (i.e., delirium) are often developed following the drug-induced insomnia. Medication against insomnia (i.e., benzodiazepines) often exacerbates the pathological sleep. Therefore, common types of insomnia, drug-induced insomnia and pathological sleep should carefully be discriminated. Drug-induced rhythm-disorders and drug-induced sleep apnea remain to be studied. Future studies may clarify the effects of several drugs on these two disorders.",

The main motor symptoms of PD are on the one hand hypokinetic signs, such as bradykinesia, akinesia, rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes, and on the other hand hyperkinetic signs, such as tremor, (see Chapter 21; ref. 1). Cognitive deficits in nondemented PD patients comprise deficits in sensitivity to reward (2), deficits in procedural and habit learning (3), and deficits in switching arbitrarily from one behavioral activity to another, possibly owing to a deficit in attentional set shifting (4). It has even been argued that PD patients are deficient in so-called executive functions of human mind (5,6). \"Executive function is a neuropsychological construct that has been used to capture the highest order of cognitive abilities,\" e.g., flexibility of thought in the generation of solutions to novel problems (7,8). The reason why the cognitive aspects are not well perceived may be that in humans, the cognitive functions in PD are mainly unconscious; they are thus not experienced and cannot be explicitely communicated. Another reason that renders analysis of PD symptoms so difficult is that the diseased human brain is able to use (cortical) loops to bypass or compensate for basal ganglia (BG) dysfunctions, however, with the disadvantage of a loss of parallel processing and reduced velocity.",

Insomnia changes the nature of dreams, both indirectly through emotional hyperactivation characteristic of insomnia, and as a result of frequent awakenings. However, frequent recurring unpleasant and frightening dreams can themselves increase the frequency of nocturnal awakenings and worsen the quality of sleep. The comorbidity of insomnia and nightmares should be taken into account when choosing a therapeutic approach in this category of patients. Priority are drugs that do not cause nightmares as a side effect, as well as psychotherapy.Исследования показывают высокую частоту коморбидности инсомнии и ночных кошмаров (НК), которые отягощают и приводят к хронизации друг друга. Механизмы их взаимовлияния различны: инсомния меняет характер сновидений как опосредованно через характерную для нее эмоциональную гиперактивацию, так и вследствие частых пробуждений. Вместе с тем частые повторяющиеся неприятные и устрашающие сновидения могут сами по себе увеличивать частоту ночных пробуждений и ухудшить качество сна. Коморбидность инсомнии и НК должна учитываться при выборе терапевтической тактики у данной категории пациентов. Приоритетными являются препараты, не вызывающие в качестве побочного эффекта НК, а также психотерапия.",

Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

      "abstract": "Besides sleep apnea, the main disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness include narcolepsy and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy is characterized by periods of irresistible sleepiness and sleep attacks of brief duration and, most often, by one or more of the auxiliary symptoms: cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnogogic hallucinations. Generally, sleepiness and sleep attacks in hypersomnia are of longer duration and are more resistible than in narcolepsy; also, the auxiliary symptoms are absent. There are three types of hypersomnia: idiopathic, secondary, and periodic. Nocturnal sleep is typically disrupted in narcolepsy, whereas in idiopathic hypersomnia it is prolonged and in secondary hypersomnia it is variable. The exact causes of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are unknown; however, there is evidence for genetic predisposition for either disorder. In secondary hypersomnia causative factors include: neurologic, such as head injuries, cerebrovascular insufficiency, and brain tumors; general medical, such as metabolic disorders, various intoxications, and conditions leading to brain hypoxia; and psychiatric, most notably depression. Although the cause of periodic hypersomnia is unclear, most research supports the notion of underlying organic disease. Often, the evaluation of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness can be completed in the office setting, based on the sleep history and a thorough neurologic, general medical, and psychiatric assessment. Whenever indicated, ancillary laboratory studies, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans, should be performed. Sleep laboratory recordings generally are not necessary unless there is suspicion of sleep apnea or narcolepsy in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

However, advances in histology have led to the recognition of pathological changes in regions far more widespread than recognized even a decade ago, and there is every reason to believe that more surprises are in store in the near future. The correlations between pathology and clinical phenomena have yet to be made for most brain regions, leaving our understanding of the mechanisms of the clinical features of the disease incomplete. The behavioral and nonmotor aspects of PD are particularly difficult to understand because of the major overlap among problems due to neuronal degeneration, psychological responses to progressive disability, iatrogenic complications, and the secondary effects of primary disorders, such as excessive daytime somnolence due to sleep disorder.",

      "abstract": "[Wide variety of the movements (from the physiologic body position changes to different pathologic events) can be seen during the sleep period. The most important types of these movements are the sleep related events (from the parasomnias to the restless leg related movements), the movement disorders and the epilepsy related events. To differentiate between these events is required special skill, which is based on appropriate characterisation of the events (for example timing, repetition, pattern), the polysomnographic and video-EEG examination and validated questionnaires (FLEP scale). The appropriate differential diagnostics and therapy must be based on the knowledge of the relationship of the sleep architecture and movement events. This review would like to provide guideline for the understanding and recognizing the nature of the sleep related movements.]",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONBruxism is psychopathophysiological disorder of orofacial muscle activity which is defined by American Academy of Orofacial Pain as a diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional activity including clenching, bracing, gnashing, and grinding of the teeth.1 The excessive and frequent nocturnal bruxist activity, unlike physiological muscular activity during sleep, results in non-physiological wear (attrition) of occlusal surfaces.2,3In multifactorial and often controversial bruxism etiology, peripheral (morphological) and central (physchological and pathophysiological) etiological factors can be distinguished.4 The most common morphological factors, such as occlusion (in particular occlusal discrepancies), along with the anatomy of the orofacial system have been considered more traditional than evidence based medicine and dentistry bruxism causative factors.4,5Bruxism is related to great number of pathophysiological factors. During sleep, sudden awakening or change in intensity of sleep may occur. That is arousal response. Then, generalized change of body activity occurs: higher heart rate, changes in breathing rhythm, peripheral vasoconstriction and muscular hyperactivity, including bruxism.6 Changes of the central neurotransmitter system in the nigrostriatal projection can cause the muscular activity disorders. Drug therapy can also induce bruxism: L-dopa, neuroleptics and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Numerous substances such as amphetamines, amphetamine-like substances, nicotine and alcohol can play major role in the etiology of bruxism, which has been particularly explained by effects via dopamine system.7Behavioral disorders and affective psychological factors, anxiety being one of the most prominent together with emotional stress, caused by sociological and psychological factors, can induce bruxism.8Dentistry and alcohol consumingAlcoholism is progressive mental disease with social and health consequences. The addiction to alcohol is more difficult to observe in early stages of alcoholism due to some traditional reasons related to alcohol consuming, which can have adverse side effects in dental treatment. Alcohol consumption leads to great number of systemic disorders, such as malnutrition and hypovitaminosis, neurological disorders, pathological changes in the digestive, cardiovascular and respiratory system.9,10Besides the poor oral hygiene, consumption of alcohol may cause oral diseases, periodontal diseases and premature tooth loss. Alcoholics are exposed to higher risk of orofacial trauma (for example, jaw fractures), fractures and even losing the removable dentures while under the influence of alcohol.11The aim of this paper is to give case report on Michigan splint treatment of very severe bruxism in female patient who was under psychiatric therapy due to alcohol consuming, which caused psychoorganic syndrome.CASE REPORTA previously treated 62 year old psychiatric female patient was referred to the Prosthodontic Department, School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb for prosthodontic treatment. She exhibited pronounced teeth abrasion.Psychiatric treatmentTaking her case history with the assistance of her son and from the available medical records of her previous psychiatric treatments, we found out that she had been an alcoholic for many years (F 10.2 diagnosis by the International Classification of Diseases - ICD) and subsequently developed pyschoorganic syndrome with characteristics of depression (F 10.7 diagnosis by the ICD). Although she has had the alcohol addiction problem for many years, her psychiatric treatment started in 2001. She was hospitalized for three months at the alcoholism ward and discharged in better health condition with recommendation to take 20 mg of fluoxetine in the morning and 3x5 mg of diazepam. In the same year, she was coming regularly for check-up in the Psychiatric patient clinic accompanied by her son who reported her abstinence from alcohol, but also less communication and more passiveness in behavior. …",

      "abstract": "Insomnia impairs daytime functioning or causes clinically significant daytime distress. The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms vary moment-to-moment within a day. One factor that may influence these variations is chronotype. Evening chronotypes prefer to engage in activities (e.g., sleep, physical and social activity) later in the day, and evening chronotype is implicated in psychopathology, including anxiety-related disorders. However, it is unknown whether chronotype influences diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and whether these effects are amplified in individuals with a probable anxiety-related disorder. We examined the diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and daily activities in morning and evening chronotypes with and without probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a community sample of adults (N = 410). Evening chronotypes reported higher anxiety symptoms, particularly in the evening hours, and lower engagement in daily activities, predominantly in the morning hours. Evening chronotypes with probable GAD or OCD reported worse anxiety symptoms in the evening. Our findings indicate that anxiety symptoms and engagement in daily activities fluctuate considerably across the day, and these patterns differ depending on chronotype. Evening chronotypes have more anxiety symptoms in the evening, despite preferring this time of day. Personalized treatment approaches that consider chronotype and target certain times of day may be efficient in alleviating peaks in anxiety symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) can be conceptualized as a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and other accompanying symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairments. The etiology of FMS remains unknown, being one of the most accepted hypothesis the presence of central sensitization to pain and impairments in endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms. The history of the development of FMS concept reveals how other symptoms -apart from pain- has become also relevant in FMS diagnosis and treatment.&#x0D; The central symptom of FMS is pain. FMS patients generally report high levels of clinical pain, which are related to greater impairments in health related quality of life, cognitive abilities and disease course. Fatigue and sleeping difficulties are also common symptoms of FMS. Fatigue have shown positive associations with pain, stiffness, sleep problems, increased body mass index, FMS severity, tenderness, disability, cognitive complaints, anxiety and depression. The majority of FMS patients report poor sleep quality, take longer to fall asleep, generally wake up during the night, sleep fewer hours, and usually wake up unrefreshed. Emotional disturbances (i.e., depression, anxiety) are also frequent in FMS. In fact, depression and anxiety disorders have showed a negative impact on the clinical course and work capacity of FMS patients. Cognitive impairments are also a relevant symptom in FMS. The most common complaints among FMS patients are executive function deficits, attention problems, forgetfulness, concentration difficulties, and mental slowness. Regarding the most frequent treatments for FMS, these can be classified as non-psychological and psychological. The former includes analgesic drugs, adjuvant drugs (i.e., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, etc.), nerve blocks, electrostimulation at different levels, infiltrations, etc. The psychological therapies with the most evidence are cognitive-behavioral, acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness.&#x0D; FMS is associated with a severe reduction of health related quality of life and psychosocial impairments. It is necessary to take all FMS symptoms and its relations into account in order to provide a more tailored and effective treatment, as well as, to improve the health related quality of life of FMS patients.",

Their general occurrence is reflected in phrases like “it makes me sick” and “to sweat with fear”. In some groups of people these autonomic disturbances are not confined to stressful situations but become more general and frequent and so more disabling. For instance, in patients with affective illnesses, symptoms of autonomic origin are common and are relieved by successful treatment of the underlying illness. Again, there is a group of patients who complain of these symptoms but who show little affective disorder. In these patients the autonomic symptoms are provoked by specific situations which are not particularly stressful to normal people, e.g. nausea occurs when eating in company or diarrhoea when travelling; outside these specific situations symptoms do not occur. Although these patients may complain of some anxiety, the physical symptom is the major complaint and the anxiety is often attributed to this.",

Aims A systematic exploration of circadian time patterns in individuals with schizophrenia with recurrent sleep disruption. Method We examined the relationship between sleep–wake activity, recorded actigraphically over 6 weeks, along with ambient light exposure and simultaneous circadian clock timing, by collecting weekly 48 h profiles of a urinary metabolite of melatonin in 20 out-patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy control individuals matched for age, gender and being unemployed. Results Significant sleep/circadian disruption occurred in all the participants with schizophrenia. Half these individuals showed severe circadian misalignment ranging from phase-advance/delay to non-24 h periods in sleep–wake and melatonin cycles, and the other half showed patterns from excessive sleep to highly irregular and fragmented sleep epochs but with normally timed melatonin production. Conclusions Severe circadian sleep/wake disruptions exist despite stability in mood, mental state and newer antipsychotic treatment. They cannot be explained by the individuals' level of everyday function.",

      "title": "Psychophysiological Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Of all the forms of chronic insomnia, perhaps the most insidious is Psychophysiologic insomnia, also called Primary Insomnia in the DSM-IV. This sleep disorder is a final common pathway for many people who initially develop sleeplessness in the context of acute stressors (e.g., pain, job loss), but then acquire a form of \"learned\" sleeplessness as they become increasingly overconcerned about their unsatisfying sleep patterns. Patients report reduced total sleep time, with increased sleep latency (greater than 30 min), or increased wakeafter sleep onset time, though these findings are not always corroborated on PSG studies. Patients with this form of chronic insomnia are often vexed by its seemingly unpredictable nature from night to night, but to be diagnosed symptoms must be present on three or more nights per week, for more than 1 month (DSM-IV) or 6 months (ICSD-2). The essential feature of this form of insomnia is a pattern of sleep disturbance that evolves over time as a result of psychological distress that triggers unhelpful behaviors and physiological arousal. This chapter will summarize the current understanding of the development of this disorder, and the clinical approaches that may be useful to resolve it.",

All patients underwent evaluations by specialists in sleep medicine to confirm RBD, and behavioral neurology or movement disorders to confirm the subsequent neurodegenerative syndrome.Clinical criteria were met by 27 patients who experienced isolated RBD for at least 15 years before evolving into PD, PD dementia (PDD), DLB, or MSA. The interval between RBD and subsequent neurologic syndrome ranged up to 50 years, with the median interval 25 years. At initial presentation, primary motor symptoms occurred in 13 patients: 9 with PD, 3 with PD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 1 with PDD. Primary cognitive symptoms occurred in 13 patients: 10 with probable DLB and 3 with MCI. One patient presented with primary autonomic symptoms, diagnosed as MSA. At most recent follow-up, 63% of patients progressed to develop dementia (PDD or DLB). Concomitant autonomic dysfunction was confirmed in 74% of all patients.These cases illustrate that the alpha-synuclein pathogenic process may start decades before the first symptoms of PD, DLB, or MSA. A long-duration preclinical phase has important implications for epidemiologic studies and future interventions designed to slow or halt the neurodegenerative process.",

Most SRVAs are not due to sleep pathology. Many are work-related. Non-sleeping rest is no substitute for sleep. Sleep does not occur spontaneously without warning, and is preceded by feelings of increasing sleepiness of which drivers are quite aware. Driving impairment is usually worse than is realised by the sleepy driver. The best countermeasure is sleep, or even a short nap. Even more effective is the combination of a nap with caffeine.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

The impaired ventilatory responses permit the development of hypoventilation during sleep and of sleep-related hypoxemia in patients with hypoxic chronic emphysema post TB sequela and kyphoscoliosis. In all these conditions, the hypoxia is most marked in REM sleep, when the ventilatory responses are at their lowest. The impaired ventilatory responses during sleep may accompanied by a decrease in the response of the upper airway opening muscles to chemostimulation during sleep and both factors may be important in the initiation and continuation of apneas.",

Als gevolg van een prikkel worden vanuit een zenuwcel blaasjes met neurotransmitter geleegd in de ruimte tussen de zenuwcellen, de zogenaamde synapsspleet. Door het selektief binden van de vrijgekomen neurotransmitter aan een receptor van een aanliggende zenuwcel, wordt een elektrische of chemische verandering in deze ontvangende zenuwcel teweeggebracht en daarmee de prikkel overgedragen. Afwijkingen in het dopaminerge neurotransmissie systeem (DNS) in de hersenen liggen ten grondslag aan het optreden van een aantal neurologische en psychiatrische aandoeningen zoals de ziekte van Parkinson en schizofrenie. Zo wordt de ziekte van Parkinson gekenmerkt door een sterk verlaagde aktiviteit van het DNS ten gevolge van het voortschrijdend afsterven van dopamine bevattende neuronen in bepaalde hersengebieden die betrokken zijn bij de regulatie van de motoriek. De oorzaak van het afsterven van deze neuronen is nog onbekend. Bij schizofrenie daarentegen wordt een verhoogde aktiviteit van het DNS in de hersenen als mogelijke oorzaak gezien. Antipsychotische middelen ontlenen dan ook hun therapeutische werking aan de blokkade van dopamine receptoren. Om een beter inzicht te krijgen in het DNS, kan gebruik gemaakt worden van positron emissie tomografie (PET) en daartoe geschikte radiofarmaca.",

Recent Canadian data highlights an increased risk among women for insomnia, more daytime sleepiness, and elevated rates of sleep-related conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), REM sleep behaviour disorder, and restless leg syndrome. The etiology of poor sleep in this population is multi-factorial. While vasomotor symptoms (VMS) such as hot flashes and night sweats contribute to sleep disturbance, other contributing factors include hormonal changes, comorbidities, chronic pain, and age-related changes in circadian rhythm. A range of helpful options are available, including lifestyle and behavioural approaches and pharmacotherapy, which can ameliorate sleep quality to improve the lives of women during this important transition and thereafter.",

      "abstract": "Of 842 consecutive patients with movement disorders seen over a 71 month period, 28 (3.3%) were diagnosed as having a documented or clinically established psychogenic movement disorder. Tremor was most common (50%) followed by dystonia, myoclonus, and parkinsonism. Clinical descriptions of various types are reviewed. Clinical characteristics common in these patients included distractability (86%), abrupt onset (54%), and selective disabilities (39%). Distractability seems to be most important in tremor and least important in dystonia. Other diagnostic clues included entrainment of tremor to the frequency of repetitive movements of another limb, fatigue of tremor, stimulus sensitivity, and previous history of psychogenic illness. On examination, 71% had other psychogenic features. Over 60% had a clear history of a precipitating event and secondary gain and 50% had a psychiatric diagnosis (usually depression). Twenty five per cent of patients presented with combined psychogenic movement disorder and organic movement disorder; 35% resolved and this subgroup had a shorter duration of disease than those who are unresolved. Psychogenic movement disorder represents an uncommon diagnosis among patients with movement disorders. The ability to make a diagnosis rests on the presence of a multitude of clinical clues and therapeutic action should be taken as early as possible.",

Os pacientes foram submetidos a reavaliação cognitiva seguindo os critérios propostos pelo algoritmo nível 2 de Dubois, 2007 e DP-CCL MDS, 2013.Resultados: Na etapa II foram avaliados 55% dos pacientes da etapa I. O tempo médio entre as duas avaliações foi de 105,8 meses.A amostra II foi composta por pacientes mais idosos (p<0.001),com menor escolaridade (p<0.001),usando antidepressivos com maior frequência (p=0.001),com sintomas mais graves (p<0.001),em estágios mais avançados da doença (p<0.001) e com desempenho inferior nos escores totais de MEEM e MDRS.Houve predominância de mulheres e menor escolaridade entre os pacientes que faleceram (X²(1)= 2,88, p = 0,009).O uso de antidepressivos e o tempo de sono REM, na valiação inicial, foi proporcionalmente maior entre os pacientes que sobreviveram (X²(1)= 4,597; p= 0,032).Menor declínio cognitivo mensurado pela MDRS mostrou associação com menor dose diária equivalente de levodopa (ρ=0,604; p<0,001).Maior declínio cognitivo no MEEM foi relacionado a maior sonolência diurna medida pela escala de Epworth (ρ=0,414, p=0,009) e menor proporção de sono N1 (ρ= -0,404, p=0,012).O maior declínio no domínio de memória em MDRS foi relacionado a menor porcentagem de sono total despendido na fase N1 (ρ= -0,364, p= 0,025) e como total de minutos em sono REM (ρ= -0,395, p= 0,25).A sobrevida geral da amostra foi de 79% em 62 meses.Pacientes com DDP tem o risco relativo para óbito aumentado em 4,74 vezes, com homens tendo 73% menor risco relativo de morte.Conclusão: Pacientes com DP apresentam evolução mais favorável quando foram associados a serem mais jovens, ter maior escolaridade, usar doses equivalentes menores de levodopa e ter menos sonolência diurna.",

For those with PD, sleep is frequently disordered and this affects the waking day, including control of parkinsonism. Insomnia is a common problem in the general population and increases with aging. When we are young, we typically have no trouble getting adequate sleep. Teenagers left undisturbed on a Saturday morning will sleep till noon. As we age, getting to sleep or staying asleep often becomes increasingly difficult. Sometimes this relates to life stressors; lying in bed ruminating about the day’s events is a frequent cause of insomnia. Depression is a common human affliction and insomnia may be one symptom.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia.

      "title": "Birth transitions: Pathophysiology, the onset of consciousness and possible implications for neonatal maladjustment syndrome in the foal",
      "abstract": "Neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS), also known as hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, perinatal asphyxia syndrome and neonatal encephalopathy 1, 2, is reportedly the most common problem observed in neonatal foals during the first 72 h after birth 2. Neurological signs of NMS can range from subtle to severe and may include convulsions/seizures, weakness and behavioural abnormalities 3. While in severe cases an early death is likely, recovery is possible with human intervention, especially in less severe cases 1, 4. Neonatal maladjustment syndrome is mainly attributed to cerebral hypoxia and ischaemia leading to neuronal cell death shortly before, during or after birth 1, 2, 4. Signs of central nervous system (CNS) disease in equine neonatal patients have been attributed to hypoxic encephalopathy in 92% of cases, of which 59% experienced dystocia or premature placental separation 5. Other possible causes may include post natal persistence of or reversion to an inhibited fetal state of cerebral cortical function 2 and meningitis, congenital lesions, CNS haemorrhage or oedema, metabolic insults, sepsis, endotoxins, and in utero infections 6. Thus, NMS appears to represent a number of different but related conditions that reflect untoward responses to the exceptional physiological challenges that precede, accompany and follow expulsion from the uterus at birth. In line with the distinction made by Aleman et al. 2, the focus of this editorial will be the impact of variations in the oxygen status of the foal 7 and their suggestion that a fetal state of inhibited cerebral cortical function may be retained or return after birth 2. Although the latter area is of more contemporary interest 2, 8, both merit consideration because their effects may interact. The first area relates to established pathophysiological causes of impaired perinatal oxygen status and its various impacts on metabolic and other processes that support neonatal heat production 7. The second area concerns less well-recognised changes in the physiological environment of the brain during the transition of the young from the intrauterine to the extrauterine environment, in particular the impact of that on post natal levels of arousal and the onset of consciousness 9-11. Hindrances to the successful completion of this transition in brain function would jeopardise the newborn's capacity to interact with its physical environment and mother in ways that otherwise promote its survival and well-being. Finally, in addition to emphasising the above 2 areas, consideration will be limited to mild cases of NMS where brain function is only temporarily affected and is therefore reversibly inhibited. The well demonstrated prenatal increase in fetal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) activity is important for integrating 4 key processes. They are the onset of labour, an acceleration of fetal tissue maturation just before birth, the timely onset of colostrum/milk production by the mother, and a physiologically generated impetus to engage in mother–young bonding 12. All of these processes are crucial for neonatal survival, which is jeopardised if one or more of them is impaired. Moreover, superimposed on these processes may be negative impacts of pathophysiological and related conditions that arise as a result of placental insufficiency, intrapartum hypoxia, dystocia, premature birth, starvation of the newborn and maternal underfeeding. Each one of these has been discussed in detail elsewhere 7, 12, 13 and has been identified as relevant to some manifestations of NMS 1-4. Hypothermia is often observed shortly after outdoor births of ungulate young, is a common outcome of perinatal pathophysiology, may often be severe and predisposes the newborn to death or debility (Table 1). Importantly, in the context of managing impaired newborns, hypothermia of as little as 2–3°C is anticipated to result in some dulling of consciousness, and this in its turn may contribute to the reduced behavioural responsiveness of chilled newborns to their mothers 7. Hypothermia occurs in healthy vigorous newborns that mount full heat production responses to ambient cold that is so severe that heat loss still exceeds heat production. In contrast, hypoxia associated with placental insufficiency or dystocia can inhibit heat production sufficiently to cause hypothermia even at mild ambient temperatures. This inhibition is associated with various consequences of anaerobic metabolism as indicated by elevated concentrations of plasma lactate and hydrogen ions and evidence of metabolic and respiratory acidosis 14-16, and it is rarely associated with cerebral lesions 17, 18. The newborn may also be predisposed to hypothermia by immature shivering and nonshivering thermogenic mechanisms and/or by reduced energy reserves available to fuel heat production 13, 17, 19. Moreover, such immature newborns may be further disadvantaged by high rates of heat loss due to a high surface area to body weight ratio. Immaturity of other organ systems may also adversely affect their survival. Practically, however, normothermia can usually be restored and maintained by initially keeping most such newborns at air temperatures near the upper limit of their species-specific thermoneutral range 7, 12. Chronic fetal hypoxia Fetal undernutrition Fetal growth retardation Hypothermia Low birthweight Failure to suck due to weakness, competition, inadequate mothering Deficient production of colostrum/milk Hypoglycaemia Inhibited heat production Hypothermia in cold conditions Cerebral compromise in warm environments Infection Immature thermogenic mechanisms Reduced thyroidal and adrenocortical support of post natal metabolic activity Restricted placental size Fetal growth retardation Reduced deposition of fetal fat reserves Inadequate maternal udder development and colostrum/milk production Inhibition of or impaired heat production Excessive heat loss Hypoglycaemia Hypothermia Infection Energy-rich nutrients are required to fuel heat production and these are derived from body energy reserves deposited before birth and from colostrum/milk drunk after birth 19-21. Starvation or inadequate colostrum/milk intakes lead to hypoglycaemia as body energy reserves become depleted, and the onset of hypoglycaemia in such newborns may be more rapid in intensive care units because the warm conditions would usually inhibit shivering and its glucose-sparing effects 19. Severe hypoglycaemia in warm conditions will eventually lead to cerebral compromise as indicated by seizure activity, while in cold conditions it will inhibit heat production and usually lead to hypothermia 7, 19. In addition, it is well known that starvation deprives newborns of immunoglobulins and thus predisposes them to infections that can result in a variety of debilitating, often fatal, conditions 7. The routine intensive management of NMS foals is obviously directed at specifically minimising such problems. Interestingly, the volumes of colostrum required to meet the newborn's energy needs 19 will substantially exceed the minimum necessary to provide sufficient immunoglobulins for reasonable protection against many neonatal infections. As already mentioned, NMS is commonly associated with encephalopathy due to cerebral hypoxia and ischaemia shortly before, during or after birth. However, it has been suggested that in some mild cases of NMS, where a normal birth has apparently occurred and the NMS newborns have recovered quickly and fully from the condition, other factors may be at play 2. In particular these may include a post natal persistence of fetal physiological conditions linked to aberrant activity of the fetal HPA axis and/or elevated pregnane concentrations 2. This intriguing suggestion raises the possibility that factors other than hypoxia may impair or delay the onset of consciousness after birth of some NMS foals. If so, this would reduce their capacity to engage in survival-critical volitional behaviour, and this would be the case whether they were kept outdoors or indoors in a stall or a neonatal care unit. It also emphasises the value of developing interventions that would help caregivers to more effectively manage this transitional period in such foals. Integrated analyses of the literature suggest that ungulate fetuses, which are neurologically mature at birth, are actively maintained in sleep-like, unconscious states despite the fact that their brains have attained the capacity for conscious perception before birth 9-11, 22. Maintenance of such unconscious states is apparently due to the combined neuroinhibitory effects of high circulating and cerebral concentrations of adenosine, allopregnanolone, pregnanolone and prostaglandin D2 acting together with a placental neuroinhibitory peptide, warmth, buoyancy and cushioned tactile stimulation 9-11 (Table 2). Therefore, conscious perception is not anticipated to occur until shortly after birth in these species. Potent neuroinhibitor promoting sleep and unconsciousness Responds rapidly due to very short biological half-life Demonstrated inhibition of cerebral cortical electrical activity Placental and fetal tissues including the brain High circulating levels in fetus Production varies with fetal oxygen status – elevated in hypoxia, reduced in normoxia Allopregnanolone Pregnanolone Neuroactive steroidal metabolites of progesterone Act via GABAA receptors to bring about sedative/hypnotic and anaesthetic effects Produced by the fetal brain and the placenta from progesterone and cholesterol High circulating levels in fetus Elevated during stress and hypoxia Produced by the fetal brain Present in cerebrospinal fluid in fetal sheep during late pregnancy These observations raise the question of how the post natal onset of consciousness is achieved in healthy newborns. Key factors are considered to include a reduction in cerebral cortical inhibition by factors that are unique to life in utero, as well as to an increase in cerebral cortical activation associated with birth 9, 10. Thus, a marked elevation of tissue oxygen concentrations in response to the onset of successful breathing after birth and the loss of the placenta as a source of circulating adenosine are both considered to lead to a rapid decrease in circulating and cerebral adenosine concentrations and to a decrease in an overriding adenosine inhibition of cerebral cortical function 9. Loss of the placenta at birth would also contribute by removing a significant source of allopregnanolone, pregnanolone and their precursors, and the only source of the placental peptide neuroinhibitor. The rapid post natal removal of this neuroinhibition, especially that due to adenosine, is presumed to allow a suite of activators of cerebral cortical function to operate. The combined effect of these activators is presumed to be sufficient to overcome residual but declining inhibitory effects of the neuroactive steroids which persist for some time after the rapid decline in the overriding adenosine inhibition has occurred 9, 23. Activators of arousal observed in newborns include high circulating levels of 17β-oestradiol, which is mostly of placental origin, and stimulation of the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system by strong intrapartum tactile stimulation and hypoxia and by post partum exposure to cold ambient conditions 24, 25. The neuroactive steroid 17β-oestradiol has rapid-onset excitatory effects in a variety of brain areas 26, 27. The locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system extends noradrenergic nerves widely throughout the brain and has major roles in stimulating arousal and alert vigilance 28. In addition, neurons of the locus coeruleus project to the olfactory bulb so that activation of this nucleus may facilitate teat-seeking and bonding in neonatal animals 29, 30. With the successful onset of breathing after birth, 17β-oestradiol and noradrenaline presumably act together with cold stimulation of cutaneous thermoreceptors, and with tactile stimulation through contact with hard surfaces and maternal licking, to promote the first appearance of consciousness 9, 10. Arousal is observed in the normal healthy newborn within minutes of birth and accompanies the onset of breathing 31. This is followed by volitional behaviours suggestive of some level of conscious perception, such as interactions with the dam, standing successfully and then teat seeking. Arousal and the associated onset of breathing are essential for survival; in their absence the newborn will rapidly become hypoxic/hypercapnic and die 31. In addition, behaviours of the newborn that contribute to mother–young bonding and help to secure adequate colostrum/milk intake are equally important when human intervention is not possible 7, 19. Behaviours associated with survival become possible by the time of birth in precocial young because their neurological apparatus has developed sufficiently to process sensory inputs from the environment, allowing them to find the dam and a teat, or even to seek shelter in cold conditions 31. Such behaviours, which may initially reflect innate drives, are indicative of arousal and the onset of consciousness. Factors associated with hypothermia that adversely affect this process and thereby threaten newborn survival include the pathophysiological states listed in Table 1. Relationships between these factors and associated key features of NMS foals have been summarised in Figure 1. Clearly, NMS foals are usually managed clinically in ways designed to minimise these problems 2. The point here, of course, is to clarify whether or not a possible delay in the progression from prenatal unconsciousness to post natal consciousness occurs independently of hypoxia in some NMS foals, a condition that would manifest functionally as retention of an inhibited state of fetal cerebral cortical activity as suggested by Aleman et al. 2. Such a demonstration is made somewhat more complex because persistent hypoxia also delays the usually rapid post natal reduction in adenosine inhibition of cerebral cortical activity 9, 11. Intersection between some key features of neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) foals and hypoxia, hypothermia, starvation, hypoglycaemia and state of consciousness. See text for details. For example, many of the foals showing clinical signs of CNS impairment are likely to have experienced one or both of 2 forms of hypoxic insult. They are chronic hypoxia caused by placental insufficiency associated with a small placental size or other placental impairments that reduce its oxygen transfer capacity over an extended period, and acute hypoxia during birth resulting from dystocia and/or premature separation of the placenta. Interestingly, 12 of the 32 NMS foals observed by Aleman et al. 2 were reported to have had a clinical history of acute hypoxia of these types. Nevertheless, the aetiology of hypoxic influences on the state of consciousness and on commonly observed behaviour in NMS foals, such as lack of affinity for the mare, absence of sucking and weakness 4, is likely to be quite complex. This is because such influences probably involve at least 2 factors acting separately or together. First, where neonatal breathing is not compromised, persistent inhibitory effects of prepartum or intrapartum hypoxia on heat-producing mechanisms would often lead to hypothermia which has the capacity to dull consciousness due to its specific thermal effects on cerebral metabolic rate 7. Of course, providing sufficient thermal support to maintain normothermia would rule out this possibility. The second factor is a subtle involvement of hypoxia in some mild cases of NMS which appear to manifest as a post partum continuation of an inhibited fetal cerebral cortical status, or a reversion to such a state after apparently normal post natal arousal and activity have occurred 2. This might arise if respiratory function remained suboptimal from birth or if such suboptimal function appeared after a successful post partum onset of optimal function. In either case, the potent neuroinhibitory effects of adenosine and/or the pregnane steroid metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone might be anticipated to persist straight after birth or return later, because their concentrations are reported to increase during hypoxia and other stressful situations 11, 32. If this did occur, such inhibition might override activation of cerebral cortical activity resulting from 17β-oestradiol, noradrenaline, strong tactile stimulation and, if thermal support is not provided, by cold exposure. This possibility could be ruled out and/or managed by continuous monitoring of oxygen status and, if required, by providing respiratory support. A third possibility, which accords with the proposal of Aleman et al. 2, is that a post natal persistence or return of a fetal state of cerebral cortical inhibition may occur in normoxic NMS foals. Of the 32 NMS foals in their study, there was no clinical history of hypoxia in 12. However, clarifying the aetiology of NMS in 6 of these was somewhat complicated by other clinically significant factors, whereas the remaining 6 foals apparently exhibited none 2. It is understood of course that heterogeneity of study groups is usual when they are made up of clinical cases acquired serendipitously. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the group of 32 NMS foals provides interesting information 2. First, the plasma neuroactive steroid concentrations exhibited far greater ranges in the NMS foals than in healthy ones. This presumably reflected their heterogeneity and raises the possibility that some of the subgroups considered above might be found to have significantly different hormone profiles once they have been identified and studied in sufficient numbers. Second, progesterone, as a precursor of allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, has neuroinhibitory actions 8, 9, 11 and is therefore of particular interest here because, to the present authors' knowledge, none of the other steroids reported to be significantly elevated in NMS foals 2 have documented neuroinhibitory actions. The elevated plasma concentrations of progesterone are consistent with dulled consciousness 33-35, but the exceptionally low, and therefore unreported 2 concentrations of allopregnanolone are not. Third, although the mechanisms remain elusive at present 2, the significantly higher mean plasma concentrations of pregnenolone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and epitestosterone, as well as progesterone, do indicate different patterns of steroidogenesis and/or clearance, and support the view of Aleman et al. 2 that after further investigation and validation such hormone profiles might become useful aids to diagnosing some types of NMS. Fourth, the behavioural evidence of cerebral cortical inhibition in NMS foals 2, considered in the context of an apparent requirement for the withdrawal of neuroinhibition to be accompanied by increasing neuroactivation if birth is to be followed by the timely onset of consciousness 9-11, raises the prospect of testing the therapeutic efficacy of potent neuroactivators in some NMS foals. One candidate is 17β-oestradiol because of evidence that it could promote behavioural arousal, breathing and subsequent survival in lambs that were initially 'flat' or inactive after delivery by hysterectomy close to the time of normal birth 36. Another candidate is the use of strong tactile stimulation to elicit locus coeruleus–noradrenaline mediated neuroactivation. A suggested way to achieve such tactile stimulation (J.E. Madigan, personal communication) is to use a modified soft rope 'squeeze' technique to simulate compression of the young by the cervix and vagina during birth 37, a natural process that is known to strongly stimulate the locus coeruleus 9, 11. It is apparent from these observations that the fresh perspectives provided by the notion that inhibited fetal states of cerebral cortical function may persist or return after birth in some NMS foals, as outlined by Aleman et al. 2, lays open several fruitful lines of investigation. In building on earlier insights into the onset of consciousness in other neurologically mature young shortly after an uneventful birth 9-11, 31, such investigations, as is usual in their early stages, are likely to constructively generate more interesting questions than they provide answers, but answers do eventually become clear. So, watch this space!",

Symptom overlap complicates accurate antemortem diagnosis and additional diagnostic tools to distinguish between clinically diagnosed SYN and NSYN etiologies are needed. Design/Methods: We analyzed quantitative RSWA in 138 patients; 73 SYN (33 PD, 20 MSA, 20 DLB), 50 NSYN (15 AD, 11 FTD, 17 PSP, 7 CBS), and 15 primary snoring controls. Phasic, tonic, and “any” muscle activity percentages and phasic burst durations were calculated in the submentalis (SM) and anterior tibialis (AT) muscles. The automated REM atonia index was also determined in SM. Statistical group comparisons and regression were performed, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves used to determine RSWA cutoffs that distinguished SYN from NSYN. Results: All RSWA measures were significantly greater in SYN patients. SM cutoffs with AUC >0.9 (sensitivity, specificity) were: “any” 11.5% (75%, 96%); phasic 10.8% (75%, 98%); phasic burst duration 0.61 seconds (74%, 94%). In contrast, AT SYN discrimination was poor. Cutoffs were similar irrespective of clinical dream enactment behavior. Subgroup analysis showed greatest SM RSWA in patients with MSA, similar RSWA elevations in PD and DLB patients, and control level RSWA in AD, FTD, PSP and CBS patients. Conclusions: Quantitative submentalis REM sleep muscle activity accurately distinguished clinically diagnosed SYN from NSYN etiologies, even without clinical dream enactment. Polysomnographic RSWA appears to be a useful diagnostic tool for probable alpha-synucleinopathy in patients with parkinsonism and/or cognitive impairment.

Their sleep problems vary according to dementia subtypes, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Multiple factors, such as neurobiologic mechanisms underlying sleep disturbances and dementia, primary sleep disorders, long-term care environments, and physical and mental health conditions are associated with sleep disturbances. In older adults with dementia, these disturbances negatively affect their health, quality of life and medical expenses. As a result, these adults may require placement in a long-term care institution, and their caregivers' health may be adversely affected. Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions may alleviate the symptoms associated with sleep disturbances. However, nonpharmacologic interventions, particularly when combined, have been shown to be more effective than pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of sleep disturbances in older adults with dementia.",

The objective hallmark of SRDD, found in about half of the reported cases, is sustained electroencephalogram (EEG) wakefulness during dissociative episodes emerging during wake-sleep transitions or after awakenings from light non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Herein are reported two additional cases of SRDD in two female patients aged 53 and 40 years with prominent histories of multimodal abuse (typical of SRDD), with childhood emotional and food deprivation abuse in Case 1, and childhood emotional, sexual, and physical abuse in Case 2. Both patients were affected by “sleep phobia” and had recurrent nocturnal eating episodes. Major findings from the cumulative literature on SRDD are reinforced by these cases, with additional findings being described, particularly nocturnal eating behaviors and priming/triggering factors.",

However, situations arise in which a person's sleep timing, or circadian rhythm of sleep, is not synchronized with other factors, potentially leading to sleep quality problems. The term circadian refers to a circuit or period that is about 24 hours long. Many physiological, biochemical, and behavioral activities have a circadian rhythm, with the sleep-wake cycle being the most easily recognized. The sleep-wake cycle is related to other circadian rhythms, such as core body temperature and concentrations of melatonin or cortisol, through a complex interaction of signals.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinsonian patients often experience wake/sleep behavior disturbances, which can appear at an early stage of the disease in a way that is still not fully described. We aimed here at reproducing and characterizing these clinical signs in a progressive non-human primate model of the Parkinson’s disease to better understand the underlying physiopathology and to identify biomarkers of the disease. Three adult non-human primates ( macaca fascicularis ) were equipped with a polysomnographic telemetry system allowing the characterization of the wake/sleep behavior by long-term neurophysiological recordings and a modified multiple sleep latency test. Experiments were first performed in healthy animals and then during the progressive induction of a parkinsonian syndrome by chronic intramuscular injections of low doses of MPTP. We observed a significant early onset of wake/sleep behavior disturbances, before any motor symptoms, resulting in (i) a disorganization of nighttime sleep with more deep sleep and (ii) a disorganization of daytime naps with an excessive daytime sleepiness characterized by longer duration of naps, which occurred faster. These observations persisted and worsened in stable symptomatic state. In that latter state, we observed persistent excessive daytime sleepiness and more disorganized nighttime sleep architecture and continuity. Interpolating to the human condition, the present study suggests that nighttime and daytime sleep disorders may appear in early stage of the disease. They could thus be used as biomarkers of the disease for early stratification of patients who are at risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.",

Recent studies suggest that these symptoms may be the by-products of a labile sleep-wake cycle.In the current study, we explored this issue in patients suffering from insomnia (N=46). We investigated whether these patients have raised levels of dissociative symptoms and whether these are related to objective sleep parameters. Patients stayed for at least one night in a specialized sleep clinic, while sleep EEG data were obtained. In addition, they completed self-report measures on dissociative symptoms, psychological problems, and sleep characteristics.Dissociative symptom levels were elevated in patients suffering from insomnia, and were correlated with unusual sleep experiences and poor sleep quality. Longer REM sleep periods and less time spent awake during the night were predictive of dissociation.This is the first study to show that insomnia patients have raised dissociative symptom levels and that their dissociative symptoms are related to objective EEG parameters. These findings are important because they may inspire sleep-related treatment methods for dissociative disorders.",

Recently, social maladjustment and Hikikomori states have also been noted to be highly prevalent among individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), which involve abnormalities in social interactions and communication. The individuals with PDDs report a tendency to sleep and wake at irregular or inappropriate times and to suffer from sleep disorders by nature, and they tend to sleep at extreme late night or during the day while experiencing social maladjustment and Hikikomori states. Therefore, it is probable that their oral hygiene might deteriorate due to a circadian rhythm disorder, such as an abnormal salivary secretion rhythm or refusals and noncooperation of dental care due to mood/emotional and social problems, underlying and caused by their sleep and wake patterns. In this review, we describe the importance of regular lifestyle, especially regular sleep–wake rhythm with appropriately timed bright light exposure during daytime, for management of oral health in PDDs via improving their circadian rhythm disorders.",

Even though there are specific biological treatments, such as medication for restless legs syndrome, wake-promoting medication for narcolepsy and positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnoea, these are not always perfectly effective and there may be a role for adjunctive treatments that address the distress and emotion that become part of these chronic conditions and add to their impact.

Vigilance impairment and neuropsychological deficits are among the main symptoms seen in this condition. One of the major questions in this field concerns the reciprocal interactions between nocturnal hypoxemia, sleep disruption, excessive daytime sleepiness and cognitive deficits. Results of this study suggest that vigilance impairment is attributable mostly to nocturnal hypoxemia. However, in cognitive deficits, hypoxemia seems to play a major role in executive and psychomotor tasks, whereas attention and memory functions appear to be related to vigilance impairment. After treatment, hypoxemia-related deficits and some degree of sleepiness persist. These results raise the possibility of an irreversible anoxic central nervous system (CNS) damage in severe OSAS.",

In this paper, the author describes the clinical steps in the differential diagnosis of insomnia symptoms for readers who are not specialized in sleep medicine. When patients complain of insomnia symptoms, physicians first need to check their sleep habits and optimize them if they are inappropriate and interfere with good sleep. Medical history and medication use should also be reviewed in the first step because some medical conditions (e.g., articular diseases, skin diseases, cardiopulmonary disorders) and medications (e.g., steroids, interferon, methyldopa, levodopa) can cause insomnia symptoms. Insomnia symptoms can be caused by a variety of sleep disorders other than insomnia disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given only if the insomnia symptoms cannot be fully explained by another sleep disorder.",

      "title": "Contributions to Psychiatry of Recent Studies on Sleep",
      "abstract": "RésuméUne revue de quelques-unes des contributions les plus récentes des études sur le sommeil à la psychiatrie a été présentée. Les effets d'une privation de sommeil dépendent de plusieurs facteurs tels que l'âge, la prise de médicaments, l'état de santé physique et psychologique du sujet et le type de privation (total versus sélectif). Il peut y avoir atteinte des fonctions affectives, cognitives, sensori-perceptuelles, musculo-squelettiques et autonomes. Certains chercheurs pensent que l'état obtenu à la suite d'une privation prolongée de sommeil est un véritable état psychotique tandis que d'autres pensent que des sujets normaux peuvent endurer sans trop de mal une perte prolongée de sommeil; mais un comportement psychotique marqué a été noté chez des sujets ayant des traits de personnalité prédisposants et des patients schizophrènes reconnus ont montré une réactivation de leurs symptômes. Dans la plupart des cas, une privation totale du sommeil provoque une diminution des pulsions tandis qu'une privation sélective augmente ces pulsions et accroît l'excitabilité du système nerveux central. Les personnes présentant une insomnie fonctionnelle, en plus de se plaindre de problèmes communs aux gens âgés, présentent des profils polygraphiques de sommeil semblables à ceux des gens âgés, mais reposant vraisemblablement sur une base physiologique différente. Jusqu'à maintenant, ces études polygraphiques n'ont permis de déterminer aucune caractéristique qui permettrait de différencier une dépression réactionnelle-névrotique d'une dépression psychotique. En ce qui concerne la majorité des états dépressifs, les chercheurs notent de façon générale, une latence accrue dans l'apparition du sommeil, des réveils fréquents, un temps réduit de sommeil total, un raccourcissement de la phase 4 et un allongement du sommeil de la phase avec mouvements oculaires (PMO) (tel qu'il peut être observé dans les cas de dépression induits par la réserpine). Les patients atteints de manie montrent une réduction du temps de sommeil total, un raccourcissement de la phase 4 et du sommeil PMO. On a rapporté chez les schizophrènes aigus une réduction du temps de sommeil total, un raccourcissement du sommeil PMO, un accroissement de l'activité de pointes ponto-géniculo-occipitales (P.G.O.) et une absence du phénomène de “rebound” PMO notée habituellement après privation du sommeil PMO. Des observations similaires ont été effectuées sur des chats préalablement traités avec p-chloro-phenylalanine (un inhibiteur de la synthèse de sérotonine); certains traits de comportement présentés par ces animaux ont été qualifiés de “psychotiques” par certains chercheurs. Comparativement aux cas aigus, les patients schizophrènes chroniques montrent un même accroissement de l'activité de pointes P.G.O. mais une privation de sommeil PMO amène un “rebound” exagéré. Les patients présentant des états confusionnels aigus, de l'hallucinose ou du delirium tremens causés par des agents métaboliques toxiques ou l'alcool montrent un accroissement de sommeil PMO après disparition de l'agent toxique. Généralement, les patients présentant des syndromes cérébraux chroniques et un état de démence montrent une réduction du temps de sommeil total, une réduction du temps de sommeil PMO et un accroissement ou une réduction du sommeil à ondes lentes. Dans les cas de retard mental, on a trouvé une plus grande proportion de sommeil PMO (par rapport au sommeil total) que chez les sujets normaux. L'énurésie nocturne, le somnambulisme, les cauchemars et la terreur nocturne se produisent habituellement durant un éveil (“arousal”) survenu dans la phase des ondes lentes. Les sédatifs, les phénothiazines et les antidépresseurs provoquent une réduction de temps de sommeil PMO. La réserpine, les tranquillisants mineurs et particulièrement les psychomimétiques provoquent un allongement du sommeil PMO. On a discuté de quelques hypothèses plausibles concernant la pathophysiologie de certains désordres psychiatriques et les mécanismes d'action des mesures thérapeutiques.",

      "abstract": "A review of the sleep of 31 patients 45 years old or older undergoing nocturnal penile tumescence studies showed that 19 had a previously undiagnosed sleep disorder. Of the patients 9 had periodic leg movements in sleep, 9 had sleep apnea and 1 had both disorders. In 10 of these patients the sleep disorders affected nocturnal penile tumescence by disrupting sleep and causing brief periods of detumescence, movement artifacts and delays in the tumescing phase of nocturnal penile tumescence. These disruptions resulted in an apparently abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence that appeared as if the patient had difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erection. The nocturnal penile tumescence disruptions may have reflected only a disruption of the necessary conditions for normal nocturnal penile tumescence to occur, namely adequate sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. The results strongly suggest that failure to measure concurrent sleep parameters and screen for occult sleep disorders could result in the incorrect diagnosis of abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence.",

      "title": "Rehabilitation or Recovery Sleep: A Future Potential Therapeutic Target for Sleep Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a period of relaxation and repair. During sleep, waste products of brain metabolism are removed. It plays central role in maintenance of physiological homeostasis and psychological balance. Sufficient sleep helps us think more clearly, complete complex tasks better and more consistently. One of the important function of sleep is to promote synaptic plasticity and neuronal recovery for proper brain functioning. Memory consolidation, brain growth and repair are other functions proposed for sleep. Problems related to sleep deprivation are being increased in today's modern society. Every day there seems to be twice as much work and half as much time to complete it, this results in a decrease in sleep or extended periods of wakefulness. Sleep deprived individuals may not have difficulty of verbal disturbances but research studies have shown that individuals have more difficulty in reacting well, to taking biological discussion and implementing the task with efficiency of action. Although day time performance due to sleep loss is experienced universally but in professionals such as paramilitary forces, army personals, who work under stressful conditions are more vulnerable to the sleep deprivation. These conditions become more stressful during emergencies and war because, after periods of extended wakefulness neurons may begin to malfunction, visibly affecting person's behavior. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep plays a role in learning due to an activation of the hippocampus involved in encoding new memories. Many experiments have shown that the day after a good night's sleep, one may retain newly acquired knowledge or a newly learned skill more effectively. An enriched environment (EE) which is a complex combination of social, cognitive, and physical stimulation, improves learning and memory. Many changes such as increased brain weight, synaptic plasticity, gliogenesis, growth of dendritic spine as well as change in neurotransmitter content, up regulation of neuronal signaling molecules, neurotrophin levels and adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been reported.",

Afflicted individuals struggle to stay awake during waking hours despite extended periods of sleep, often experiencing difficulties waking up in the morning. Cognitive functions, including memory and concentration, may be impaired, leading to social and occupational hindrances. While short naps provide minimal relief, hypersomnia's impact on overall well-being necessitates timely diagnosis and intervention. Diagnosis involves a comprehensive assessment of medical history and, if required, polysomnography.

      "title": "Regulation of a-Synuclein Membrane Binding and Its Implications",
      "abstract": "Introduction 1.1 Parkinson's disease and Lewy bodiesParkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease that affects motor control, although dementia, depression, and other psychiatric symptoms are occasionally present (reviewed in Jankovic, 2008).The motor symptoms include resting tremors, bradykinesia/akinesia, rigidity, and postural instability, and are associated with the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (Lloyd and Hornykiewicz, 1970; reviewed in Saper, 1999) and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (Mann and Yates, 1983; Gaspar et al., 1991).Degeneration of these neurons disrupts basal ganglia circuitry of the brain and interferes with the initiation of voluntary movement (Levy et al., 1997).Another pathological characteristic of the disease is the presence of the intracellular protein aggregates known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (Hughes et al., 1992), described initially by Frederick Lewy in 1912, that were associated with dying dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc by Tretiakoff (reviewed in Holdorff, 2006).Lewy bodies are also present in other brain regions outside the SNpc, and may appeat first in the glossopharyngeal, vagal, and olfactory centres (Braak et al., 2003).The disruption of these regions is now linked to a preclinical phase of PD that includes perturbations of smell, gastrointestinal motility, and sleep patterns prior to the development of motor impairments coincident with neurodegeneration and inclusions in the midbrain.These intraneuronal aggregates are composed of lipids and various proteins including -synuclein, ubiquitin, and neurofilaments (Spillantini et al., 1998; reviewed in Cookson, 2005).Whether Lewy bodies directly cause cytotoxicity or are formed as compensatory activation of survival pathways remains under debate.Nevertheless, the presence of Lewy bodies is an essential component of post-mortem diagnoses of PD (Christine and Aminoff, 2004; reviewed in Jankovic, 2008). α-Synuclein in Parkinson's disease-Synuclein is important to understanding the etiology of PD both because it is the main pathological component of Lewy bodies and because mutations and changes in its expression are linked to familial PD.Three missense mutations causing single amino acid www.intechopen.comMechanisms in Parkinson's Disease -Models and Treatments 158 substitutions in -synuclein are linked to autosomal dominant forms of familial PD: A53T, A30P, and E46K (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997;Kruger et al., 1998;Zarranz et al., 2004).Interestingly, in many mammalian species, including mice and new world primates, threonine is the normal residue at position 53, which suggest some kind of corrective mechanism elsewhere in the coding sequence to reduce the toxicity of the A53T mutation (Hamilton, 2004).Elevated expression of normal -synuclein is also pathogenic as gene triplication or duplication is linked to early-or late-onset PD, respectively (Singleton et al., 2003;Chartier-Harlin et al., 2004).Despite the efforts of many research laboratories since its initial discovery as an abundant presynaptic protein in cholinergic nerve terminals innervating the Torpedo electric organic (Maroteax et al, 1988), -synuclein's function still remains somewhat of a mystery.Mice deficient in -synuclein are unremarkable, but exhibit increased release of dopamine under paired-pulse stimuli and reduced striatal tissue content of dopamine (Abeliovich et al., 2000).Over-expression of -synuclein in yeast leads to aggregation of vesicles, disruption in vesicular transport, and death (Gitler et al., 2008;Soper et al., 2008).Similarly, moderatesynuclein over-expression in mammalian neurons reduces transmitter release and the number of synaptic vesicles arrayed at presynaptic active zones (Nemani et al., 2010).These reports clearly implicate -synuclein in synaptic vesicle mobilization or fusion, but offer little information about its pathogenic role.In vitro studies revealed that A30P and A53T mutant -synuclein form oligomers at a faster rate than wild-type -synuclein (Conway et al., 2000).Post-translational modifications may also affect -synuclein aggregation, as phosphorylation of serine at position 129 is highly upregulated in Lewy bodies (Fujiwara et al., 2002).Phosphomimic residue changes, such as serine 129 to aspartate, which simulates the charge distribution of phosphorylation, cause neuronal loss in fruit flies and substitution of serine 129 with alanine, which prevents phosphorylation, rescues this cell loss (Chen and Feany, 2005).However, experimental evidence for the toxicity of serine 129 phosphorylation is somewhat equivocal in rodents, because expression of -synuclein with alanine 129 is as toxic as aspartate 129 (Gorbatyuk et al, 2008;McFarland et al., 2009).Although -synuclein is decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients (Mollenhauer et al, 2011), there is an increase in -synuclein oligomers suggesting that -synuclein aggregation and its leakage from neurons is accelerated in PD (Tokuda et al., 2010).However, the mechanistic contribution of -synuclein to neuronal death in PD still remains unclear.Low nanomolar concentrations of -synuclein are neuroprotective against the oxidative insults of hydrogen peroxide and 6-hydroxydopamine, whereas higher micromolar concentrations are toxic (Batelli et al., 2008).This suggests that -synuclein may be neuroprotective and toxic at low and high levels, respectively, and is in accord with the pathogenic effects of SNCA duplication or triplication.-Synuclein has also been shown to cause oxidative stress through direct damage to mitochondria.For example, mitochondrial import of -synuclein mediated by a cryptic targeting signal can disrupt complex 1 activity (Devi et al., 2008), and -synuclein over-expression in nematodes and mammalian cells induced fragmentation of mitochondria (Kamp et al., 2010;Nakamura et al., 2011).Coexpression of PINK1, parkin, and DJ-1 protect against mitochondrial fragmentation, consistent with the notion that these three proteins function in a common mitochondrial pathway leading to PD pathology.The convergence of -synuclein to a mitochondrial role when expressed at sufficient levels could therefore be viewed as a pathogenic pathway that diverges from its normal physiological role in vesicle trafficking.www.intechopen.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep-related health issues are more common and have significant impact on the health and well-being of the child. Approximately 25% of all children develop sleep problems ranging from difficulty falling asleep and night awakenings to more serious sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. The complications related to sleep disorder include cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive conditions as well as failure to thrive and growth retardation. Children also developed social and academic growth retardation. This chapter describes how to recognize, evaluate, and treat sleep disorders in children. This chapter also addresses sleep problems and special populations including pregnancy and menopausal states. Maternal sleep quality in the perinatal period begins to change; it has been noted that the greatest sleep disruption tends to occur approximately 1 week postpartum. Approximately 50% of women experience excessive daytime sleepiness at 18 weeks postpartum. Postpartum major depression is a serious illness that occurs in approximately 13% of mothers, negatively affecting both the mother's and child's psychological adjustment. Poor sleep clearly is a major confounder in maternal depression. Menopause is a time of change of life for women. By definition, menopause is considered when there has been the absence of menstrual periods for 1 year. Hormonal changes begin 7–10 years before the final menses. During this perimenopausal period, the pituitary-gonadal axis changes with decreasing estradiol and progesterone and rising FSH and LH.",

      "abstract": "After limb or body part amputation, three different types of perceptual sensitive phenomena can be recognized. They can be all named posttraumatic neuropathies: painless sensations in phantom limb ,painful phantom limb and painful posttraumatic stump. Painless sensations in phantom limb can be seen in 90% of cases in resected body parts as soon as first postoperative day, less often during the first week, and its clinical characteristics are usually stabilized during the first year. Painful posttraumatic stump appears because of pain neuroma existing, that forms at the proximal end of amputational stump as a consequence of physiological nerve regeneration attempt. Frequency of pain significantly varies considering authors from 5 - 90%, depending on definition of this phenomena and criteria used. It is considered that 5- 10% mast be under permanent medicament treatment. Phantom pain appears more often in elderly and people with specific affective personality construction. It can bee permanent, burning, nettling, tearing (25%), or intermittent, lancerating, in the shape of electrical discharging (32%), but it can also have bizarre attributes. Phantom pain appearance usually announces its duration in the longer period. After two years it is present at 59% of patients, with decreasing intensity, and only 5- 10% suffer severe pain. In our Institute in the period from 1980-2003, 48 patients have been treated, 36 patients with medicamentous treatment, local blockades and chronic stimulations, and 12 patients, who did not react at conservative treatment were operated. In operated group in 10 patients pain disappeared, one patient it was with decreasing intensity, and one patient was without change.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders are a prominent and common feature in many autoantibody-mediated neuropsychiatric disorders and are caused by an expanding spectrum of antibodies. Depending on the presenting and early symptoms, patients with these disorders are often referred to psychiatrists or general, movement disorder and/or behavioral neurologists. Clinicians need to be aware of these conditions in order to know when to consider and test for them, as many are treatable if not reversible. Improved awareness and understanding of these disorders will help with early identification and prompt treatment, thereby reducing long-term morbidity and mortality. This chapter will focus on the most common autoimmune, especially antibody-mediated, syndromes associated with psychiatric and movement disorders. Many of the autoimmune-mediated movement disorders discussed in this chapter are often associated with other features, including psychiatric/behavioral disorders, limbic encephalitis, and other symptoms. Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) is a syndrome in which parts of the limbic system are involved and classically presents with features including short-term memory loss, irritability, depression, hallucinations, sleep disturbances, and/or seizures.",

DEVELOPMENT: In the case of REM sleep behaviour disorder, a number of studies have shown that it may appear more than ten years before the motor signs. Although there is no evidence to prove that patients with restless legs syndrome have an increased risk of suffering from PD, the high prevalence of this symptom in PD and the good response to dopamine agonists suggest the existence of a relation between the two conditions.

      "title": "Contribution of the GABAergic System to Non-Motor Manifestations in Premotor and Early Stages of Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and they represent a major source of disease burden. Several non-motor manifestations, such as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, olfactory loss, gastrointestinal abnormalities, visual alterations, cognitive and mood disorders, are known to precede the onset of motor signs. Nonetheless, the mechanisms mediating these alterations are poorly understood and probably involve several neurotransmitter systems. The dysregulation of GABAergic system has received little attention in PD, although the spectrum of non-motor symptoms might be linked to this pathway. This Mini Review aims to provide up-to-date information about the involvement of the GABAergic system for explaining non-motor manifestations in early stages of PD. Therefore, special attention is paid to the clinical data derived from patients with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder or drug-naïve patients with PD, as they represent prodromal and early stages of the disease, respectively. This, in combination with animal studies, might help us to understand how the disturbance of the GABAergic system is related to non-motor manifestations of PD.",

Anxiety is a nervous disorder characterized by a state of excessive uneasiness and apprehension, typically with compulsive behavior and panic attacks. This disorder is the pervasive mental disorder. Social anxiety disorder is the most common, and the most disabling type of anxiety disorder. (Hartley 2013) The brain regions thought to be involved in anxiety are the amygdala and the hippocampus. Depression is a mental health disorder and a psychiatric condition. More specifically, though a mood disorder characterized by a determinedly low mood when a feeling of sadness and loss of interest.

      "title": "Volatile Anesthesia Does Not Satisfy Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Debt",
      "abstract": "A common statement made to patients before they undergo a general anesthetic is, \"We will watch you very carefully while you are asleep.\" The relationship between states of sleep and anesthesia raises clinically relevant questions. For example, sleep deprivation enhances pain, worsens obstructive sleep apnea, impairs immune function, and contributes to cognitive decline.1If a patient is sleep deprived, and if anesthesia is similar to sleep, will the sleep debt be diminished by anesthesia? In addition to being homeostatically regulated, mammalian sleep occurs with a prominent circadian rhythm. If a general anesthetic is administered during a patient's normal sleep time, will the patient be less sleepy after the anesthetic, as if he had maintained his normal sleep cycle?\"If a patient is sleep deprived, and if anesthesia is similar to sleep, will the sleep debt be diminished by anesthesia?\"In a report published this month by Pick et al. ,2the authors demonstrate that after a 6-h general anesthetic with sevoflurane, isoflurane, or halothane, mice exhibited a rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deficit, followed by a REM sleep rebound. The study also reports a nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep debt and rebound only after halothane. Pick et al. used an ingenious experimental design that made it possible to evaluate the effects of time, light-dark cycle, type, and duration of anesthetic agent on states of wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM. Their results documented significant main effects on the temporal organization of sleep and wakefulness caused by both duration and type of anesthetic. Analogous to the oxygen debt of exercise being compensated by an increase in minute ventilation, the Pick et al. results support the interpretation that the ability of volatile anesthetics to satisfy the homeostatic drive for sleep differs as a function of anesthetic agent and the NREM or REM phase of sleep. Pick et al. also raise the intriguing suggestion that the duration of anesthesia or sleep/wake states is monitored by some, as yet unknown, control systems. Their findings imply that the brain stores this information regarding the temporal organization of behavioral states and, after recovery from anesthesia, reactivates neuronal networks that generate the appropriate amount and type of sleep needed to reestablish homeostatic balance.States of sleep are different from states of anesthesia. Apply a painful stimulus and the individual who is asleep will awaken. One goal of a general anesthetic, of course, is to eliminate responsiveness to external stimuli. During sleep, humans cycle approximately every 90 min between the REM and NREM phases of sleep. During REM sleep, which is characterized by dreaming and skeletal muscle atonia, there are rapid eye movements, increases in brain metabolic and electrical activity, heart and respiratory rate irregularities, erection of the clitoris or penis, and oscillations in a large number of hormones.1In contrast, one of the goals of balanced anesthesia is to maintain prolonged intervals of stable autonomic function.In this last decade, there has been much progress documenting the similarities and differences between sleep and anesthesia. As recently reviewed,3there is consensus that states of anesthesia, like sleep, are actively generated by multiple brain regions, overlapping networks, and a humbling complexity of neurotransmitters and signal transduction cascades. Studies of sleep and anesthesia benefit from a viable interaction between clinical and basic research. Clinical concerns have led to interesting basic studies. Do patients in an Intensive Care Unit who are sedated for long periods get enough sleep? That question influenced a study in which sleep-deprived rats that received either propofol or isoflurane lost the righting reflex more quickly and also took longer to recover from anesthesia.4Additional studies found that sleep-deprived rats that received propofol showed reversal of both REM and NREM sleep debt.5Interestingly, the Pick et al. data from mice are consistent with recent data obtained from other studies. For example, rats deprived of REM sleep for 24 h that received isoflurane for 4 h had the same amount of REM sleep rebound as rats that were allowed to sleep ad libitum .6When rats were deprived of REM and NREM sleep and administered 6 h of sevoflurane, signs of NREM sleep deprivation were reduced to half the time of rats that did not receive sevoflurane anesthesia. REM sleep debt was not reduced by sevoflurane anesthesia, and sevoflurane induction time was significantly reduced in sleep-deprived rats.7The Pick et al. findings raise an interesting historical point regarding isoflurane. Most anesthesiologists today probably did not practice anesthesia during the early 1980s, when isoflurane was introduced. At that time, excluding enflurane, halothane was the most commonly used anesthetic. Recovery after isoflurane is remarkably fast compared with halothane, in large part because the metabolism of halothane releases bromide. The increase in bromide is related to minimum alveolar concentration hours of exposure, as the rise in bromide approaches sedative concentrations. In an editorial published in this journal in 1976, Nicholas Greene summarized other studies showing elevation of plasma bromide levels after halothane.8He noted that prolonged sedation can be seen after halothane anesthesia and that the peak levels of plasma bromide are in the range that can cause sedation.9The fact that recent studies searching for a relationship between sleep and anesthesia have not included halothane is probably because halothane is no longer used in many countries, including the United States.Going forward, more work is needed on the clinically relevant topic of sleep and anesthesia. The study limitations acknowledged by Pick et al. point to an exciting opportunity for bench-to-bedside investigations designed to document anesthetic effects on human sleep. Most patients who receive anesthesia also have pain on awakening, and sleep is significantly disrupted both by pain and by the use of opioids to treat pain.10The excellent study by Pick et al. encourages future research aiming to elucidate the contributions of pain to the sleep-altering effects of anesthetic molecules.",

In addition these motor symptoms, cognitive motor and axial symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, cognitive dementia, hallucinations, shaking the whole body and changes in the speech like slurred speech, etc., and also affect the Parkinson`s malady due to the L-dopa (levodopa acts like a pre cursor to the dopamine, a panacea which reduces the symptoms but there are dyskinesia`s, i.e., side effects to the patients).

The cognitive symptoms of PD are increasingly being acknowledged by clinicians and researchers alike. However, PD also involves a host of emotional and communicative changes which can cause major disruptions to social functioning. These incude problems producing emotional facial expressions (i.e., facial masking) and emotional speech (i.e., dysarthria), as well as difficulties recognizing the verbal and nonverbal emotional cues of others. These social symptoms of PD can result in severe negative social consequences, including stigma, dehumanization, and loneliness, which might affect quality of life to an even greater extent than more well-recognized motor or cognitive symptoms. It is, therefore, imperative that researchers and clinicans become aware of these potential social symptoms and their negative effects, in order to properly investigate and manage the socioemotional aspects of PD. This narrative review provides an examination of the current research surrounding some of the most common social symptoms of PD and their related social consequences and argues that proactively and adequately addressing these issues might improve disease outcomes.",

      "title": "Practical Strategies for Longitudinal in-Home Sleep Tracking in Diverse Populations",
      "abstract": "Longitudinal monitoring of sleep metrics, night-to-night sleep quality, and weekly sleep patterns is important for enabling healthy aging and, more importantly, understanding and mitigating cognitive decline with aging. Recent work has shown that longitudinal changes in selected sleep metrics, such as total sleep time, time in the rapid eye movement (REM) versus non-REM sleep phases, and non-REM slow wave activity, is closely correlated with decline in cognitive function in older populations. Further, evidence also suggests that sleep disturbance in middle-aged and older populations can contribute to cognitive decline and heighten the risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by increasing beta-amyloid burden. In older, at-risk populations, persistent sleep disturbances and/or shifts in sleep patterns also precede an AD diagnosis and may even appear years before cognitive decline, indicating that clinically-accurate, longitudinal sleep tracking can allow for on-time therapeutics and interventions before onset of AD symptoms. However, clinical-grade wearable sleep monitoring is a challenging problem since it requires simultaneous monitoring of brain activity, eye movement, muscle activity, cardio-respiratory features, and gross body movements. This requires multiple sensors to be worn at different locations as well as uncomfortable adhesives and discrete electronic components to be placed on the head. As a result, existing wearables either compromise comfort or compromise accuracy in tracking sleep variables. I will describe our lab's recent work in developing a suite of fabric-based sensors and garment-integrated sensing systems for in-home sleep tracking, focusing particularly on our efforts at enabling clinically-accurate sleep phase recognition. Our best-performing solution is PhyMask, an all-textile sleep monitoring solution that is practical and comfortable for continuous use and that acquires all signals of interest to sleep solely using comfortable textile sensors placed on the head. We show that PhyMask can be used to accurately measure all the signals required for precise sleep stage tracking and to extract advanced sleep markers such as spindles and K-complexes robustly in the real-world setting. We validate PhyMask against polysomnography and show that it significantly outperforms other commercially-available sleep tracking wearables, including the Fitbit wristband, the Oura Ring, and the Muse, Phillips SmartSleep and Dreem headbands.

Concurrent deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning, i.e., an individual's effectiveness in meeting standard expectations in a range of areas, such as social skills and responsibility, communication, daily coping, personal independence, and self-sufficiency. 3. An onset before the age of 18, i.e., the mental retardation is manifested during the developmental period.",

      "abstract": "Bruxism is a para-function with tooth clenching and grinding. Particularly, the sleep bruxism is a frequent phenomenon that causes cephalalgia and muscular/joint pains to the awakening, besides an increased dental abrasion and sensibility. The etiology of sleep bruxism is uncertain: while the occlusal discrepancies and the anatomy of the bony structures of the orofacial region play only a minor role, others factors, like smoking, alcohol, drugs, systemic diseases, stress, trauma and heredity, appear to have an important role in the sleep bruxism genesis. Recent polysomnographic studies, suggest that sleep bruxism episodes are part of an sleep arousal response. The sleep arousal response is a sudden change in the depth of sleep. Besides the sleep bruxism appears to be an disturbance in the dopaminergic system. Further psychological factors (like stress, anxiety) are implicated in the aetiology of sleep bruxism as well. The aim of this paper is to review the literature on the aetiology of bruxism.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric recipients of organ transplants and their families present a variety of psychological and ethical challenges to transplant teams and the psychologists and psychiatrists who work with them. Some of these are relatively similar to those of adult patients, but others differ in significant ways. For example, a primary difference between adult and pediatric transplants is that the majority of organ transplantation done in children is for congenital disorders such as biliary atresia or cardiac malformations (Fox and Swazey 1992). This means that the recipients are often very young, and require an adult, usually a parent, to act as the decision maker. Congenital illnesses also mean that the child has been chronically ill, often without an experience of normal development, and sometimes with quite delayed development. A third implication of a congenital illness is that it is not acquired by the patient, and thus is not subject to the recrimination about causation or concern for recurrence frequently raised by organ damage secondary to alcohol use, cigarette smoking, or diet, and often seen in the adult population (Craven and Rodin 1992).",

      "abstract": "Schedule-dependent sleep problems tend to increase as the youngster moves from middle childhood through preadolescence and into adolescence. This is partly because the youngster becomes more independent and parental control over both the selection of particular sleep schedules and the consistent maintenance of these schedules across weekends diminishes. Even accurate descriptions of the existing problem may become difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, specific syndromes are common and may be identified and treated. There may be increased demands at both ends of the sleep period leading to later bedtimes, earlier wakings, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Periods of wakefulness confined to one portion of the night (beginning, middle, or end) may occur if sleep requirements are overestimated. Insomnia coupled with trouble waking may imply a circadian phase shift abnormality or a 'school-refusal' variant. And, variable sleep difficulties may be seen in a youngster with irregular schedules and poor sleep hygiene. Guidelines to the understanding, evaluation, and treatment of these syndromes are presented.",

      "abstract": "There is convincing evidence that the Parkinson disease neurodegenerative process begins many years before the onset of motor manifestations. Initial estimates based on nigral neuropathological findings or striatal dopamine imaging suggested a 5- to 6-year preclinical period. However, more recent evidence of Lewy body pathology in other neuronal populations preceding nigral involvement suggests that the preclinical phase may be much longer. Epidemiologic studies of nonmotor manifestations, such as constipation, anxiety disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and anemia, suggest that the preclinical period extends at least 20 years before the motor manifestations. Olfactory impairment and depression may also precede the onset of motor manifestations; however, the lag time may be shorter. Recognition of a nonmotor preclinical phase spanning 20 or more years should guide the search for predictive biomarkers and the identification of risk or protective factors for Parkinson disease.",

Although sleep disturbances in demented people could be classified into not only insomnia type but also irregular pattern type, differentiation has not yet been sufficiently practiced in a clinical setting. Demented people with irregular sleep pattern increase with progressive stage and are often insensitive to the usual pharmacotherapies for insomnia using benzodiazepines or antipsychotics.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease a chronic degenerative disease of the central nervous system, clinically manifested by a combination of hypokinesia and postural disorders with rigidity and resting tremor, and autonomic disorders and mental functions. The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is inhibition of the functions of dopaminergic systems of the central nervous system (stria negroid, tuberoinfundibular, olfactory, retinal, and so on). With a comprehensive defeat of dopaminergetic systems associated with the appearance not only of motor disorders, but also a wide variety of autonomic, endocrine, emotional and cognitive, that is, non-motor symptoms. The frequency and severity of non-motor disorders correlated with the duration of Parkinson's disease and the severity of motor disorders. It is important to note that many non-motorized violations appear already at the preclinical stage of Parkinson's disease, ahead of the manifestation of the classic symptoms of Parkinson's disease hypokinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural disorder. As the disease progresses, some of them become the dominant clinical significance, having a negative impact on the quality of life of patients, leading to their disability and reducing life expectancy. The period before the movement disorder can be quite long, sometimes up to 10 years, and is characterized by the appearance of non-motor symptoms. Typical non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are impaired sense of smell, sleep disorders, depression, constipation, change in color perception, less pain, restless leg syndrome, apathy, fatigue, anxiety. Already in the early stages of Parkinson's disease can be detected as a violation of neurodynamic bradiphrenia and disorders of attention. For the first stage Parkinson characteristic lesion olfactory bulb, olfactory nucleus anterior, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, peripheral ganglia, autonomic nervous system, as well as pre-and post-ganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic structures intestinal, heart and pelvic plexus that clinically hypoosmia, constipation, the sympathetic innervation of the myocardium as vasodilation, reducing the strength of heart contractions, disorders of the heart rate variability, orthostatic hypotension. In the second stage of the disease in the degenerative process involves the nucleus of the medulla oblongata and pons, including the core of the nuclei raphe, the locus coeruleus and reticular formation. The second stage is manifested clinically disturbed sleep and wakefulness rapid eye movements during sleep, daytime sleepiness, falling asleep as well as a violation of emotional disorders as depression and apathy. Join a moderate or severe cognitive impairment, and autonomic dysfunction. For the third stage is characterized by loss of the substantia nigra, the tonsils, the basal forebrain is shown connecting motor symptoms such as distortion of fine motor skills. At the fourth step involves the degeneration of the hippocampus and temporal mesokortex. The fourth stage of Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of 60% of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and a decrease in dopamine production by 80%. Symptomatology complemented tremor, rigidity, hypokinesia, different manifestations of autonomic dysfunction. In the fifth stage of the disease have shown an interest associative zones prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortex. Degeneration of the motor and sensory cortical areas is characteristic of the sixth stage of Parkinson's disease, is characterized by increasing cognitive, behavioral and psychotic disorders. Patient J. 57 years, was admitted with complaints of persistent sleep disturbances, memory loss, fatigue, darkening of the eyes, frequent urge to urinate, especially at night ( up to 4 times), constipation, stiffness and clumsiness, excessive salivation, sweating.

      "title": "Ocular dipping movements in an electrocution cardiac arrest survivor",
      "abstract": "Background : Abnormal eye movements can occur in patients with neurological diseases. These have been described in unconscious patients due to anoxic coma and often disappear as the patient regains consciousness. Ocular dipping movements are rarely seen in practice in pediatric patients. Methods : A one year old male patient was brought unconscious with electrocution injury. With resuscitation, he became hemodynamically stable. He could not recognize his mother or respond to visual/auditory stimuli; and had generalized hypertonia. Cranial nerves were normal. He showed abnormal involuntary conjugate vertical saccadic eye movements, consisting of slow downward movement (for 1-2 seconds) followed by a relatively faster return to the primary mid-position. These persisted continuously for 48 hours at irregular intervals of 1-2 seconds. The patient was awake but non-responsive and not interested in surroundings. Results : These eye movements are called ocular dipping (OD) . In a normal person, saccadic movements are meant for stable fixation and are maintained by pause-cell neurons positioned in the pontine raphe. These prevent the occurrence of unwanted saccadic pulses by inhibiting the saccadic premotor burst neurons in the paramedian pontine reticular formation and midbrain. Injury to pause cells leads to extraneous saccades without fixation. It appears that cortical and basal ganglia malfunction causes ocular dipping. OD is mainly seen in anoxic coma and creuztfelt Jacob disease. A 53-year-old man developed ocular dipping following prolonged hypotension.Our patient was in vegetative state with normal respiratory and cardiac function suggesting that major midbrain and medullary centers were intact. Conclusion : The self limiting nature of OD suggests that these are caused by diffuse dysfunction rather than a single structural locus.",

      "title": "M6. REDUCED READINESS POTENTIAL AS A NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE OF SELF-DISTURBANCES IN EARLY–COURSE PSYCHOSIS: PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM A HIGH–DENSITY EEG STUDY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Self-disturbances reflect a core dimension of Schizophrenia that can be identified before disease onset and might underlie the development of typical psychotic symptoms. The Sense of Agency (SoA) can be conceptualized as the pre-reflective sensation of being the one who is causing or generating an action or thought. Passivity phenomena, such as the reported feeling and belief that one’s thoughts or actions are generated and/or controlled by an external agent, are exquisite examples of SoA disturbances observed in Schizophrenia. Despite intensive research, the neurobiological pathogenetic mechanisms underlying such disturbances remain unclear. Among several putative neurophysiological brain abnormalities, a reduction of the Bereitschaftspotential, also called pre-motor or Readiness Potential (RP), was described in chronic, medicated patients with Schizophrenia. Given its anticipation of voluntary movement by 1 – 2 seconds over the motor cortex and supplementary motor area contralateral to the effector, RP has previously been proposed to be a neural signature of volition to initiate movement. Interestingly, higher RPs among healthy subjects have been recently associated with stronger intentional binding, suggesting increased SoA in subjects exhibiting stronger premovement activity. The objective of our work was to study RP abnormalities in patients with a psychotic illness of recent onset and to relate them to self disturbances, in order to clarify the relationship between known neurophysiological and psychopathological abnormalities. Methods We employed high-density electroencephalography (64-channel BrainAmp, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) to record scalp potentials during a self-paced movement task in a group of seven early–course psychosis patients (mean age = 24,5, range 20–33) and an equal group of age– and gender– matched (mean age =25,3, range 19 – 36) healthy control subjects. Patients were recruited during an acute stage of their disorder requiring hospitalization and were treated with low–dose atypical antipsychotics. Exclusion criteria included major medical or neurological illness affecting the CNS and any intellectual developmental disorder. Several parameters related to the elicited RP were recorded, including maximum amplitude and slope. The Examination of Anomalous Self Experience (EASE) scale was chosen to assess Self disturbances in the patient group by an experienced clinician who was blind to the neurophysiological outcome. Results RP was found to be reduced in patients, compared to healthy control subjects, in both its amplitude and slope (p &amp;lt; 0,005) despite comparable EMG activity. EASE scores of items ‘EASE-10’ (a comprehensive item that reflect most prototypically the disorders of self-experience) and ‘EASE-2’ (“Self-Awareness”) appeared to increase monotonically with the decrease of RP slope (p &amp;lt; 0,05). Discussion Our preliminary data show that disturbances of RP are present since the early course of psychotic disorders. They also suggest that such abnormalities may reflect the severity of self-disturbances in these patients. If confirmed in a larger, medication-naïve samples, our findings might clarify the underlying neural mechanisms of such abnormalities and provide a solid basis for further investigation of RP disturbances as an early biological marker for Schizophrenia spectrum disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A 29-year-old man had a chronic history of muscle fasciculations and painful muscle contractions triggered suddenly after extreme exertion. His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These disturbances can primarily affect the patient's quality of life and may worsen the symptoms of PD. Among the multiple sleep disturbances in PD patients, there has been a marked growing interest in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). This is likely due to the fact that RBD has been proven to precede the motor symptoms of PD by many years. The aim of this article is to examine the sleep disturbances found in PD, with special attention to RBD as a premotor symptom of PD, as well as to assess its proposed related pathophysiology. MEDLINE (1966-March 2010), American Academy of Sleep Medicine's, The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, and current textbooks of sleep medicine were searched for relevant information. Search terms: RBD, sleep disturbances, Parkinson's disease, and pre-motor were used. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sleep attack, insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and RBD are sleep disturbances commonly found in the literature related to PD. Sleep benefit has been proven to lessen PD motor symptoms. RBD has been described as a premotor symptom of PD in several prospective, retrospective, and cross-sectional studies. Sleep disturbances in PD can result secondarily to natural disease progression, as a side effect of the medications used in PD, or in result of pre-clinical pathology. Treatment of sleep disturbances in PD patients is crucial, as what is termed as, \"sleep benefit effect\" has been shown to improve the symptoms of PD.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D.

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar]. Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness. Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation. The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicide Differential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made. Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar]. Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar]. Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]. Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death. adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well. The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral). General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agents Psychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

The reductions in quality of life associated with excessive sleepiness may be substantial, involving compromised cognitive performance and work productivity as well as possible harm to the individual and the public. Excessive sleepiness may be the result of a number of extrinsic and intrinsic causes. Although it is an established symptom of certain psychiatric illnesses, abnormal excessive sleepiness in psychiatric patients may be the result of a comorbid disorder of sleep or wakefulness. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of sleep disorders are common in community psychiatric practices because clinicians may not be aware of the different causes and consequences of excessive sleepiness. It is essential to recognize and treat the underlying cause of this disorder. In cases where sleep disorders are suspected, a comprehensive treatment program might include nonpharmacologic approaches, pharmacologic approaches, or both may need to be initiated to encompass the complexity of sleep disorder treatments. Careful monitoring and follow-up of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, including counseling and long-term support, are essential to ensure treatment compliance and to maintain improvements over time.",

      "abstract": "Dream-enactment behavior that emerges during episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without muscle atonia is a parasomnia known as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). RBD constitutes a prodromal marker of α-synucleinopathies and serves as one of the best biomarkers available to predict diseases such as Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies. Most patients showing RBD will convert to an α-synucleinopathy about 10 years after diagnosis. The diagnostic advantage of RBD relies on the prolonged prodromal time, its predictive power and the absence of disease-related treatments that could act as confounders. Therefore, patients with RBD are candidates for neuroprotection trials that delay or prevent conversion to a pathology with abnormal α-synuclein metabolism. The administration of melatonin in doses exhibiting a chronobiotic/hypnotic effect (less than 10 mg daily) is commonly used as a first line treatment (together with clonazepam) of RBD. At a higher dose, melatonin may also be an effective cytoprotector to halt α-synucleinopathy progression. However, allometric conversion doses derived from animal studies (in the 100 mg/day range) are rarely employed clinically regardless of the demonstrated absence of toxicity of melatonin in phase 1 pharmacological studies with doses up to 100 mg in normal volunteers. This review discusses the application of melatonin in RBD: (a) as a symptomatic treatment in RBD; (b) as a possible disease-modifying treatment in α-synucleinopathies. To what degree melatonin has therapeutic efficacy in the prevention of α-synucleinopathies awaits further investigation, in particular multicenter double-blind trials.",

      "abstract": "A compelling urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable dysesthesias, is the fundamental element of restless legs syndrome (RLS). To make a diagnosis of RLS, this core sensory-motor symptom must be present at rest, at least temporarily relieved by movement, and most pronounced at night.1 Sleep disturbance is usually present in RLS and is traditionally considered as a consequence of either the sensory-motor symptom interfering with sleep or of periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), present in roughly 80% of RLS patients. However, dysesthesias, sleep disturbance, or PLMS are not required for an RLS diagnosis, though they are supportive. In this way, difficulties with understanding, recognition, and treatment of RLS may be related to its definition: is it a sleep disorder, a movement disorder, or a chronic pain disorder?",

As a result of this relationship, an exacerbation of a chronic disease frequently parallels worsening sleep quality. Additionally, some sleep disorders may directly exacerbate or even cause a chronic disease state [i.e., obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension], which is an important consideration in the diagnostic evaluation of a variety of disease states. Many major medical conditions in fact occur at significantly higher rates in individuals with severe insomnia as compared with those without insomnia. These conditions include hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), clinical and subclinical depression, diabetes, and acute myocardial infarction (1).

      "abstract": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep DisordersCircadian rhythm sleep disorders all involve a problem in the timing of when a person sleeps and is awake.The human body has a master circadian clock in a control center of the brain known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).This internal clock regulates the timing of such body rhythms as temperature and hormone levels.The primary circadian rhythm that this body clock controls is the sleep-wake cycle.The circadian clock functions in a cycle that lasts a little longer than 24 hours.The circadian clock is \"set\" primarily by visual cues of light and darkness that are communicated along a pathway from the eyes to the SCN.This keeps the clock synchronized to the 24-hour day.Other time cues, know as zeitgebers, also can influence the clock's timing.These cues include meal and exercise schedules.Circadian rhythms and their sensitivity to time cues may change as a person ages.Each circadian rhythm sleep disorder involves one of these two problems:• You have a hard time initiating sleep.• You struggle to maintain sleep, waking up frequently during the night.• You tend to wake up too early and are unable to go back to sleep.• You sleep is nonrestorative or of poor quality. Types of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders• Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSP): DSP occurs when a person regularly goes to sleep and wakes up more than two hours later than is considered normal.People with DSP tend to be \"evening types\" who typically stay awake until 1 a.m. or later and wake-up in the late morning or afternoon.If able to go to bed at the preferred late time on a regular basis, a person with DSP will have a very stable sleep pattern.DPS is more common among adolescents and young adults with a reported prevalence of 7-16%.It is estimated that DPS is seen in approximately 10% of patients with chronic insomnia in sleep clinics.A positive family history may be present in approximately 40% of individuals with DPS.",

      "abstract": "Circadian sleep-wake disorders are common. Because they represent conflict between the timing of the patient's endogenous rhythms and desired timing of sleep, the presenting complaints may include both difficulty of sleep initiation or maintenance and undesired or unplanned daytime or early evening sleepiness. Therefore, circadian disorders may be misdiagnosed as either a primary insomnia or a hypersomnia disorder, depending on which complaint is more troublesome for the patient. Objective information about sleep and wake patterns over long periods is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Actigraphy provides long-term information about the rest/activity pattern about an individual. However, caution should be applied in interpretation of the results because the information provided only includes information of movements, and activity is only an indirect circadian phase marker. Timing of light and melatonin therapy is critical for successful treatment of circadian rhythm disorders. Therefore, results of actigraphy are useful and should be used in conjunction with additional measurements, including 24 hours sleep-wake history, sleep log, and melatonin measurements.",

Environmental factors, such as light exposure, noise from diverse sources, and sleep interruptions related to patient care, have all received considerable investigational attention. Critical illness can affect elements involved in sleep initiation and maintenance. The various modes of mechanical ventilation may have different effects on sleep fragmentation and on the propensity to cause central apnoeas, thereby potentially prolonging the time on the ventilator. Pharmacologic agents, especially sedatives, can directly affect sleep architecture and may contribute to the incidence of intensive care unit delirium.

If that discrete and sustained discharge occurs in the temporal lobe or limbic region of the brain, the condition is referred to as nonconvulsive complex partial status epilepticus (discussed in Chapter 10). If the discharge is ongoing in systems that subserve language function, an aphasia may result (see Chapter 11). This chapter will deal with the disorders and conditions associated with FSE arising from other regions of the brain. This condition can be associated with a wide variety of neurologic disorders and have a multitude of signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms vary according to the function of the brain area engaged by the discharge and can be as simple as a repetitive movement, as seen in epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), or as subtle as an inability to write to command (see case example).",

      "abstract": "Over a century of work has confirmed critical links between sleep and epilepsy. Seizures can have profound effects on sleep, typically causing awakenings, arousals and shifts to lighter stages. However, sleep continuity is disrupted in people with epilepsy even in the absence of seizures, suggesting that sleep instability may be an inherent component of certain forms of epilepsy. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can adversely affect sleep and wakefulness. At least some of the newer AEDs appear to have more favorable sleep-wake profiles than the older agents. In turn, sleep is an important modulator of seizures and epileptic discharges on the electroencephalogram (EEG). Sleep instability can promote seizures and sleep deprivation provokes seizures and EEG abnormalities. Synchronized Non-REM (NREM) sleep facilitates seizures, whereas the clinical and EEG manifestations of epilepsy are suppressed in REM sleep. The sleep EEG is useful in the diagnosis and localization of epilepsy. New epileptic foci can appear in sleep and REM sleep demonstrates the most precise localization of the epileptic discharge. Polysomnography combined with video and EEG (VEEG-PSG) aids in the differentiation of seizures and parasomnias. Daytime sleepiness and sleep disorders such as sleep apnea are common in people with epilepsy. Treating sleep apnea has been shown to reduce EEG abnormalities and seizures in some cases. These observations underscore the importance of a routine sleep assessment in case of all the people with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "The data concerning neurophysiological and neurotransmitter mechanisms of two principal kinds of inhibition of behavior is carried out: the inborn genetically determined inhibition and that developed in the course of training. On the basis of the experiments performed by the author and the literature on general neurophysiology the conclusion is made that development of inhibition of behavior during training (i.e. internal inhibition, including \"latent inhibition\") is determined by the relative strengthening of inhibitory hyperpolarization processes either locally (in a conditioned stimulus analyzer) or globally in the brain cortex and other brain structures during intensification of the inhibitory state (profound inhibition of a reflex and sleep). The main neurotransmitter in development of internal inhibition is gamma-aminobutyric acid. Inhibition of behavior without preliminary training arises either during the action of superstrong stimuli, (exceeding the maximum value inhibition) or during interaction of two and more active systems. A stronger one of these two systems suppresses another one (external inhibition, dominant inhibition, \"freezing\", \"prepulse inhibition\", etc.). These kinds of inhibition develop on the background of EEG activation, which suggests participation in their realization of reticular structures and corresponding neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, noradrenalin, dopamine and serotonin). Behavior pathology causes a break of the balanced interaction between the excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system. This affects both genetically determined forms of behavior inhibition and the learned internal inhibition.",

      "title": "Gait disorders in adults and the elderly",
      "abstract": "Human gait depends on a complex interplay of major parts of the nervous, musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory systems. The individual gait pattern is influenced by age, personality, mood and sociocultural factors. The preferred walking speed in older adults is a sensitive marker of general health and survival. Safe walking requires intact cognition and executive control. Gait disorders lead to a loss of personal freedom, falls and injuries and result in a marked reduction in the quality of life. Acute onset of a gait disorder may indicate a cerebrovascular or other acute lesion in the nervous system but also systemic diseases or adverse effects of medication, in particular polypharmacy including sedatives. The prevalence of gait disorders increases from 10 % in people aged 60–69 years to more than 60 % in community dwelling subjects aged over 80 years. Sensory ataxia due to polyneuropathy, parkinsonism and frontal gait disorders due to subcortical vascular encephalopathy or disorders associated with dementia are among the most common neurological causes. Hip and knee osteoarthritis are common non-neurological causes of gait disorders. With advancing age the proportion of patients with multiple causes or combinations of neurological and non-neurological gait disorders increases. Thorough clinical observation of gait, taking a focused patient history and physical, neurological and orthopedic examinations are basic steps in the categorization of gait disorders and serve as a guide for ancillary investigations and therapeutic interventions. This clinically oriented review provides an overview on the phenotypic spectrum, work-up and treatment of gait disorders.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and related diseases are becoming increasingly relevant for the health and wellbeing of the general and working populations. Sleep disorders affect all aspects of health, showing a bi-directionality with health conditions and comorbidity with several diseases. Consequently, sleep disorders may have severe negative consequences both for the individual and the enterprise, as well as for society on the whole, in terms of health, productivity and social costs. When considering the disturbances of the sleep/wake cycle, it is important to distinguish between those connected with endogenous biological factors from those related to socio-environmental conditions, including work, and those associated with mental and physical diseases, that are often associated and interact with each other. Many sleep disorders are still underestimated and under-valued in clinical practice and, to a much greater extent, in workers' health surveillance. The present paper is aimed at drawing the attention of the occupational health physician to some key issues, particularly regarding excessive daytime sleepiness, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and shift and night work, as well as their implications in terms of health and occupational consequences. Information on the main aspects of clinical diagnosis and health surveillance, as well as risk management and prevention at the workplace, are provided.",

The study includes results from detailed sleep histories, sleep logs, psychiatric interviews, and a number of psychological tests. Short sleepers were found generally to be smooth, efficient persons with a tendency towards handling stress by keeping busy and by denial. Long sleepers were \"worriers\" and were chronically somewhat depressed or anxious; they scored higher than the short sleepers on most tests of pathology. This group also included some creative persons. It is suggested that the differences in sleep need may be a<i>response</i>to the above differences in life-style and personality and that sleep, and especially D-sleep, may have a function in restoring the brain and psyche after stress or psychic pain.",

However, levodopa does not halt the advance of the underlying disease, but by improving mobility, it delays the onset of fatal complications (Marsden and Parkes, 1977; Yahr et al., 1972). Thus, after 2–5 years many PD patients have increased disability. The increased disability may manifest itself by the reappearance of old symptoms, i.e., symptoms present before levodopa treatment, or by new symptoms, symptoms not present before levodopa treatment. Most of the new symptoms are disease manifestations seen only because patients live longer (postural instability, dementia), and some of the symptoms may result from the chronic effects of levodopa itself (dyskinesias, diurnal oscillations in performance).",

      "title": "MASGUTOVA METHOD OF REFLEX INTEGRATION FOR CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY",
      "abstract": "Childhood Cerebral Palsy – the group of diseases concerned with motor disorders as the result of brain damage or dysfunction of certain brain centers – is usually acquired during the first years of life, at the time when the system of primary movement patterns is developing. Primary movements are genetically programmed for protection and survival, and also for the development of the conscious movement system. Developmentally their role is to support: - maturation of the nervous system (synaptogenesis, myelination, and brain plasticity) - brain function (cognitive development, emotional maturation) - sensory-motor integration. Dysfunctions of motor development and sensory-motor integration in the child with CP are a reflection of the type of neurological insult and the developmental stage of the infant/child when the neurological insult occurred. The developmental stages can be divided into prenatal (in utero); natal (during the birth process); or postnatal (after birth but during the first years of life). Each developmental stage is vulnerable to specific neurological insults. Prenatal palsy can be caused by infection, toxicity in the fetus, or compromised health in the pregnant mother. Some primary motor patterns and reflexes, such as Trunk Extension, Automatic Gait, Grasp, Swallowing and Sucking develop in utero. Prenatal brain damage will cause poor expression of these reflexes and adversely impact the next stage of development. Natal palsy is generally caused by neurological insult during birth: a consequence of premature birth, sudden deliveries, narrow pelvis of the mother, use of forceps during birth, etc. Natal trauma can negatively affect the activation of primary motor patterns and reflexes characteristic of a normal successful birth. In such cases the expression of these genetic programs will be abnormal. The primary movements and reflexes of childbirth, such as Head Righting, Perez, Tonic Labyrinthine (TLR) in extension, Bauer Crawling, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning, and Sucking may be dysfunctional. Postnatal palsy is often caused by an infection with encephalitic symptoms. Other causes include childhood cranial injury, central nervous system injury, and poor systemic health. Infant motor patterns and reflexes will be stressed by postnatal CP, and may develop dysfunctionally or pathologically. Dynamic reflexes (e.g., Grasp, Hands Pulling, Automatic Gait, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning); positional reflexes (e.g., Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [ATNR] Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [STNR], Babkin Palmomental, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "title": "Noise-induced sleep disturbances and long-term health risks",
      "abstract": "Undisturbed sleep of sufficient length is essential for daytime alertness and performance, health and wellbeing. According to recent figures published by the WHO, sleep disturbance is one of the most deleterious non-auditory effects of environmental noise. A connection between noise exposure in the residential setting and detrimental effects on sleep and health is suggested by observational, experimental and epidemiological evidence that has been accumulated over the last decades. Maximum sound pressure levels as low as 33 dB have been shown to induce physiological reactions such as autonomic, motor, and cortical arousals (e.g., tachycardia, body movements, awakenings). Whether or not noise will induce such acute effects depends on the number of noise events and their acoustical properties, but also on situational moderators (e.g. momentary sleep stage) and individual noise sensitivity. Although clinical sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) have been shown to be associated with increased risks for cardiovascular diseases, only little is known about long-term effects of noise-disturbed sleep on cardiovascular health. In the past years, several hints have surfaced that undermine the suspicion that nocturnal noise exposure may be more relevant for the genesis of long term effects than daytime noise exposure. The paper reviews the present state of research in the domain of noise-induced sleep disturbances from transportation and other noise sources, compares exposure-effect functions, critically appraises methods for the assessment of noise effects on sleep, and reviews potential mechanisms of the genesis of long term health effects due to noise-induced sleep disturbances.",

In this review, we describe the clinical subtype of Park Sleep and related 'tests' ranging from polysomnography to investigational neuromelanin MRI brain scans and some tissue-based biological markers.Expert Opinion Cholinergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems are dominantly affected in PD. Park Sleep subtype is hypothesized to be associated primarily with serotonergic deficit, clinically manifesting as somnolence and narcoleptic events (sleep attacks), with or without rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD). In clinic, Park Sleep recognition may drive lifestyle changes (e.g. driving) along with therapy adjustments as Park Sleep patients may be sensitive to dopamine D3 active agonists, such as ropinirole and pramipexole. Specific dashboard scores based personalized management options need to be implemented and include pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and lifestyle linked advice.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia manifested by vivid, often frightening dreams associated with simple or complex motor behavior during REM sleep. The polysomnographic features of RBD include increased electromyographic tone +/- dream enactment behavior during REM sleep. Management with counseling and pharmacologic measures is usually straightforward and effective. In this review, the terminology, clinical and polysomnographic features, demographic and epidemiologic features, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and management strategies are discussed. Recent data on the suspected pathophysiologic mechanisms of RBD are also reviewed. The literature and our institutional experience on RBD are next discussed, with an emphasis on the RBD-neurodegenerative disease association and particularly the RBD-synucleinopathy association. Several issues relating to evolving concepts, controversies, and future directions are then reviewed, with an emphasis on idiopathic RBD representing an early feature of a neurodegenerative disease and particularly an evolving synucleinopathy. Planning for future therapies that impact patients with idiopathic RBD is reviewed in detail.",

Patient’s psychomotor development was normal and clinical history unremarkable; in particular, he denied infectious or inflammatory cerebral diseases, head trauma and exposure to toxic agents.

In human NC with cataplexy, an association with specific HLA haplotype (DR DQB1 0602) and a deficiency in hypocretin (orexin) peptide in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are almost constant findings. The pathogenesis of human NC is still unknown. Autoimmune and neurodegenerative processes of hypothalamic structures have been discussed with more solid evidence for the first theory [2–4] . Most of narcoleptic symptoms develop early after the onset of the disease and usually do not worsen with the progression of the neurodegeneration [2] . Moreover, the absence of ubiquitinated inclusions (cardinal neuropathological finding of most neurodegenerative diseases) in narcoleptic patients argues against the neurodegenerative hypothesis in NC [3] . An autoimmune process involving the hypocretin neurons of lateral hypothalamus has been postulated [4] . There are few reports in the literature showing the occurrence of NC-like symptoms in patients already affected by Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative diseases [2, 5–7] .

These deformities involve structures in the upper brain stem that control vertical eye movements and vergence movements, as well as parts in the lower brain stem generating horizontal versional movements, and in the cerebellum controlling saccadic and pursuit movements (Leigh and Zee, 1983). In addition concomitant strabismus is often seen in children with general brain damage, for example as a result of hydrochephalus (von Noorden, 1985).

      "abstract": "The brain reciprocally communicates with the rest of the body via neural, endocrine, immune, and other systems. This is crucial for coordinating the complex behavioral and physiological responses needed to cope with the many challenges of life. The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is a key brain structure involved in assessing rewards and threats, as well as activating appropriate responses. This is a dynamic process that depends on evolving needs and challenges. Important challenges include illness or injury. These typically involve inflammation and pain, which evoke neuroinflammatory processes in the brain to drive sickness behaviours. In the short term, sickness behaviours are considered adaptive, as they promote convalescence (e.g. low mood; lethargy, fatigue, social withdrawal), and enhanced threat appraisal (e.g. anxiety) to combat increased risk/vulnerability associated with sickness. Chronic inflammation, however, appears to remodel the system to inappropriately activate threat-coping responses, resulting in depressive and/or anxious phenotypes. These mood disorders are particularly pronounced in diseases and disorders associated with gut dysfunction, which feature chronic inflammation and altered ACC function. We propose that chronic inflammation remodels ACC physiology such that it errantly predicts heightened danger based on a mental model (a.k.a &amp;lsquo;schema&amp;rsquo;) of the world. This evokes chronic activation of threat-coping systems, including endocrine signaling (e.g. adrenaline), and anxiety. Inflammation can be driven by brain systems involving ACC, leading to a feedback-cycle that self-reinforces pathological states. This theory accounts for a wealth of clinical and preclinical data that implicate the ACC in disorders of mood and gastrointestinal function, and reveals a key player in the gut-brain axis that may represent a novel therapeutic target.",

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

The term dizziness is used by patients to describe a variety of symptoms, including a hallucination of movement (vertigo), light-headedness, and a true appreciation of unsteadiness associated with gait disorders. Although there are age-related decrements in the somatosensory, visual, vestibular, and motor systems, dizziness should not be regarded as part of normal ageing. Diagnosis can usually be reached without specialist investigations, through focused history taking and bedside clinical assessment, including careful examination of eye movements and the Dix-Hallpike test. The underlying cause may be in one or several physiological systems and this will guide treatment plans. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and neuritis are more common than Meniere’s. The presence of red flag symptoms or signs suggesting central vestibular disease will require further imaging.",

A high frequency of sleep disorders in menopausal women, reaching 60 %, has been revealed. However, the results of studies on complaints of sleep disorders depending on the climacteric phase are ambiguous, which may be due to ethnicity. Data on some pathogenetic mechanisms of the formation of the most frequent sleep disorders in menopausal women - insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and fibromyalgia - are described. The results of polysomnography in these pathological states are presented, indicating a decrease in sleep efficiency, a change in its \"architecture\", and a longer waking time during the night with insomnia; a significant increase in the apnea/hypopnea index, a delay in the phase of fast sleep, a decrease in the duration of deep stages of sleep and a decrease in its effectiveness - in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The social and medical consequences of sleep disorders and their comorbidity with such pathological conditions as mental disorders, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, oncology, disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, bronchial asthma, mortality are noted.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders (SRMD) include several different motor activities during sleep. Few of them are well known and well classified, whereas others are minor motor disorders of sleep which are neither thoroughly characterized and classified nor have been extensively investigated to clarify their pathogenesis and clinical relevance. This review will focus on those minor sleep-related movement disorders. Before diagnosing periodic limb movement (PLM) disorder in patients with PLM during polysomnography, other disorders associated with PLM need to be excluded, namely restless legs syndrome (RLS), narcolepsy, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and sleep-related breathing disorder. For the diagnosis of propriospinal myoclonus at sleep-onset, multi-channel surface electromyography recording during polysomnography is required and a possible psychogenic origin of the movement disorder has to be considered. Excessive fragmentary myoclonus (EFM) does not require symptomatic treatment, but further evaluation is suggested as electrophysiological abnormalities are present in 50% of cases. Nine percent of healthy sleepers meet the criteria for EFM, raising the question if current, arbitrarily defined, cutoffs are valid. Hypnagogic foot tremor, rhythmic feet movements, alternating leg muscle activation, and high-frequency leg movements are somewhat overlapping minor motor activities during sleep which may exist on their own or represent stereotyped movements to relieve RLS-like symptoms. Neck myoclonus is probably a physiological phenomenon related to REM twitching. RBD is formally a parasomnia but a relevant differential diagnosis when evaluating sleep-related movement disorders. In particular, prodromal RBD is characterized by electromyographic and behavioral findings on video-polysomnography which needs to be differentiated by minor sleep-related movement disorders. Minor SRMD beyond the well-known main motor disorders of sleep should be correctly diagnosed, distinguished from differential diagnosis, and understood in their potential clinical relevance, in order also to start an appropriate treatment if needed.",

Sleep is of the utmost importance for the maintenance of body homeostasis. Many disease processes affecting sleep have been associated with numerous symptoms, including cognitive impairment, fatigue as well as a wide range of behavioral, hormonal and metabolic derangements. Sleep disorders in childhood can be classified by age of incidence (in infants, toddlers, school-age children or adolescents) and by the exact nature of the symptoms. They are classified in insomnias, hypersomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm disorders and respiratory disorders which affect sleep. Parasomnias are the most common sleep disorders in toddlers, with night terrors, nightmares and sleepwalking being the most common. Respiratory disorders are the most important in older children, especially obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. All sleep disorders are clinically manifested with symptoms of sleep deprivation. Their management always involves improvement of sleep hygiene, though in some cases (such as obstructive sleep apnea) specific medical treatment is also available and warranted. A three-way relationship of trust, compassion and cooperation between child, family and healthcare professional is a prerequisite for the effective management of childhood sleep disorders. Nursing staff are the main factor cultivating that relationship in the context of inpatient care.",

      "abstract": "A common early non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is sleep disturbance. Indeed, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are predictors of PD. EDS and RBD are thought to be risk factors for the cognitive disturbances observed in PD. Some researchers have suggested that RBD can be used as a predictor of the pathological progression of PD. Thus far, sleep disturbances have not been recognized as a component in the progression of the disease, and therefore have not been routinely and adequately controlled in this patient population. In this review, we present evidence that the assessment of sleep (i. e. , the presence of fragmented sleep, insomnia, RBD, EDS, and sudden onset of sleep) should be a part of the routine evaluation of patients with PD.

Janz studied the relation between seizures and thesleep/wake cycle and divided the epilepsies into three categories: nocturnal,awakening, and diffuse. Since then, the effect of sleep on the ictal andinterictal manifestations of epilepsy has been studied extensively. Manyseizures are activated by sleep or arousal from sleep. Interictal dischargesare also seen more commonly during sleep, with the greatest activation seenduring nonrapid eye movement sleep. Sleep not only increases the frequency ofepileptiform abnormalities, but also may alter their morphology anddistribution. Sleep deprivation also facilitates both epileptiformabnormalities and seizures. Seizures, on the other hand, also impact sleep.Epileptic patients demonstrate multiple sleep abnormalities, including anincreased sleep latency, fragmented sleep, increased awakenings and stageshifts, and an increase in stages 1 and 2 of nonrapid eye movement sleep.These disturbances may in turn be modulated by antiepileptic treatment. Thisreview summarizes the interactions between sleep and epilepsy, including thetiming of seizures during the sleep/wake cycle, the influence of sleep onvarious seizure disorders, the effects of sleep deprivation, and the changesin sleep patterns caused by seizures and theirtreatment.",

However, it must be remembered that this definition is arbitrary, and OSA is better viewed as a spectrum with trivial snoring at one end and severe, almost continuous obstruction at the other. In addition to the sleep-study findings, if the patient is sleepy during the day, as defined by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, then this condition is termed ‘obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome’.

      "abstract": "Sleep is not a loss of consciousness, but an altered state of consciousness. What appears in the dream is preconscious and ready to move into consciousness. This material may be manifested also during free association. The difference between free association and REM dreaming is that the preconscious material is presented in response to internal and/or external stimuli in a more coherent form during free associations, whereas during a REM dream, the material of daily experiences and perceptions that are fragmented in the preconscious are recombined in a less coherent form. The material that cannot be easily expressed during free association in the wakeful state, due to inner or external inhibition, appear in dreams and thus, find an easier way of expression. The dreams of patients who have difficulty directly expressing their thoughts, feelings, and experiences serve as a useful means of communication during the initial stage of therapy and provide valuable analytic material to help the progress of the psychoanalytic treatment. This phenomenon is described with a case presentation. The very inhibited patient who could not openly express her life experiences, emotions, and conflicts found it easier to report her dreams at the beginning of the therapeutic process. Through the material presented from these dreams, it became possible to open the path to direct verbal communication, to work through her problems, and to monitor the progress of the therapeutic process.",

One perspective of this relationship, which has not received much attention to date, is that disturbances of sleep affect pain. To fathom this direction of cause, experimental human and animal studies on the effects of sleep deprivation on pain processing were reviewed. According to the majority of the studies, sleep deprivation produces hyperalgesic changes. Furthermore, sleep deprivation can counteract analgesic effects of pharmacological treatments involving opioidergic and serotoninergic mechanisms of action. The heterogeneity of the human data and the exclusive interest in rapid eye movement sleep deprivation in animals so far do not allow us to draw firm conclusions as to whether the hyperalgesic effects are due to the deprivation of specific sleep stages or whether they result from a generalized disruption of sleep continuity. The significance of opioidergic and serotoninergic processes as mediating mechanisms of the hyperalgesic changes produced by sleep deprivation are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

      "abstract": "Back pain in the working age population can coincide with work-related activities and may lead to temporary or permanent work disability in the case of functional impairment that interacts with workplace demands. This can lead to economic if not existential problems for the affected individual. Although neurogenic or inflammatory back pain may be the cause, the big majority of all cases is caused by \"common\" low back pain with or without irradiating pain, the main problem being frequent recurrencies of acute pain episodes (periodic or relapsing course). After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie einerseits im Zusammenhang mit Arbeitstätigkeiten auftreten können, andererseits im Falle der Beeinträchtigung von Körperfunktionen mit den Arbeitsaufgaben interagieren können und so zur vorübergehenden oder andauernden Beeinträchtigung der Arbeitsfähigkeit führen können. Dies kann ökonomische, unter Umständen auch existentielle Probleme zur Folge haben. Obwohl auch neurogene und entzündliche Ursachen in Frage kommen, stellen die „banalen“ Rückenschmerzen mit und ohne Ausstrahlung die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Fälle dar. Ein Hauptproblem stellt sich aufgrund der hohen Rezidivneigung („periodischer Verlauf“). Nach frühzeitigem Ausschluss spezifischer Ursachen („rote Flaggen“: Anamnese und einfaches Labor meist ausreichend!) sind wiederholte Abklärung zu vermeiden. Strukturelle Veränderungen und physische Arbeitsbelastungen als Ursachen dürfen nicht überbewertet werden. Dagegen spielt in der Frühphase eine geeignete Information und Medikation, bei anhaltender Funktionsstörung eine aktive Behandlung (Verläufe über 3 Wochen oder Rezidive) im Vordergrund. Langzeitverläufe haben erhebliche individuelle und sozioökonomische Konsequenzen. Das Chronifizierungsrisiko kann mittels „gelber Flaggen“ und Verlaufscharakteristika erkannt werden. Eine möglichst rasche Rückkehr zu Alltagsaktivitäten ist vordringlich. Bei Risiko für chronische Verläufe und/oder Eingliederungsproblemen sind eine interdisziplinäre arbeitsbezogene Rehabilitation oder sozialberufliche Eingliederung zu forcieren.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness characterized by alternating periods of elevated and depressed mood. Sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder are present during all stages of the condition and exert a negative impact on overall course, quality of life, and treatment outcomes. We examine the partnership between circadian system (process C) functioning and sleep–wake homeostasis (process S) on optimal sleep functioning and explore the role of disruptions in both systems on sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder. A convergence of evidence suggests that sleep problems in bipolar disorder result from dysregulation across both process C and process S systems. Biomarkers of depressive episodes include heightened fragmentation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, reduced REM latency, increased REM density, and a greater percentage of awakenings, while biomarkers of manic episodes include reduced REM latency, greater percentage of stage I sleep, increased REM density, discontinuous sleep patterns, shortened total sleep time, and a greater time awake in bed. These findings highlight the importance of targeting novel treatments for sleep disturbance in bipolar disorder. Keywords: bipolar disorder, circadian rhythms, sleep–wake homeostasis",

Next, and following the International Classification, we describe sleep disorders which require the knowledge of a physician specialized in sleep pathology: insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disorders and parasomnias. We also describe conditions related to sleep or worsened during sleep (snoring, apneas, cardiovascular disorders, etc.), the study of which requires the collaboration of a large number of specialists.The study of sleep and wakefulness disorders is clearly a branch of medicine due to the high prevalence of these disorders in the general population, their morbidity and their negative consequences in social and working life, especially as a cause of road and workplace accidents.",

      "title": "Bedeutung opioiderger Signalwege für die Modulation viszeraler Afferenzen bei funktionellen Magendarmerkrankungen",
      "abstract": "Funktionelle Erkrankungen des Magendarmtrakts sind uberaus haufig. Sie sind charakterisiert durch Symptome wie Oberbauchschmerzen, Vollegefuhl etc. sowie durch das Fehlen struktureller Lasionen oder biochemischer Abnormalitaten, die diese Symptome erklaren. Die funktionelle Dyspepsie mit auf den Oberbauch bezogenen chronischen oder chronisch rezidivierenden Symptomen ist dabei eine der wichtigsten Erkrankungen, die in der Klinik Anlass gibt fur endoskopische Untersuchungen.\r\nHinsichtlich der Pathogenese der Symptome wird heute angenommen, dass neben Motilitatsstorungen vor allem Veranderungen der gastrointestinalen Sensorik eine zentrale Rolle einnehmen. So sind bei Patienten im Vergleich zu gesunden Probanden die Schwellen fur die Wahrnehmung und das Auftreten von Beschwerden bei mechanischer Distension des Magens signifikant niedriger als bei gesunden Probanden . Neben Unterschieden hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmungsschwellen sind Patienten gekennzeichnet durch gestorte adaptive Veranderungen der Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation oder einer mukosalen Schleimhautschadigung durch nicht-steroidale Antirheumatika (NSAR). Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war es, den Einfluss opioiderger Bahnen fur die Modulation viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen zu erfassen und die Effekte bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie und gesunden Probanden zu vergleichen. In Ubereinstimmung mit anderen fruheren Arbeiten findet sich bei Gesunden ein Anstieg viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation und Behandlung mit NSAR, wahrend die Schwellen bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie abnehmen. Die Gabe von Naloxon, einem unspezifischen Opioidantagonisten, bewirkt bei Gesunden einen signifikant starker ausgepragten Abfall viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen als bei Patienten. Die Daten lassen insofern den Schluss zu, dass \r\na) bei Patienten offensichtlich antinozizeptive Bahnen nur eingeschrankt funktionstuchtig sind; \r\nb) b) dies auf eine Storung opioiderg vermittelter antinozizeptiver Effekte zuruckzufuhren ist, was die verminderte Antwort auf intravenos appliziertes Naloxon bei Patienten nahe legt.",

      "abstract": "Many with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) experience sleep problems, which are also common symptoms of stress-related and mood disorders.To determine if sleep problems contributed unique variance to post-concussive symptoms above and beyond symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder/major depressive disorder (PTSD/MDD) after mild TBI.313 active duty service members with a history of mild TBI completed sleep, PTSD, and mood symptom questionnaires, which were used to determine contributions to the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory.59% of the variance in post-concussive symptoms were due to PTSD symptom severity while depressive symptoms and sleep problems contributed an additional 1% each. This pattern differed between those with and without clinical diagnosis of PTSD/MDD. For those with PTSD/MDD, PTSD and depression symptoms but not sleep contributed to post-concussive symptoms. For those without PTSD/MDD, PTSD symptoms and sleep contributed specifically to somatosensory post-concussive symptoms. Daytime dysfunction and sleep disturbances were associated with post-concussive symptoms after PTSD and depression symptoms were controlled.PTSD symptom severity explained the most variance for post-concussive symptoms among service members with a history of mild TBI, while depression symptoms, daytime dysfunction, and sleep disturbances independently contributed small amounts of variance.",

      "title": "Postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction are common manifestations of acute brain dysfunction,occurring in up to 70% of post- surgical patients. The development of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction have long- term consequences,such as higher morbidity and mortality and increased hospital stay,and it increases the risk of dependency and institutionalisation. Delirium presents clinically with differing subtypes ranging from hyperactive to hypoactive. Despite the relevance of these cognitive disorders,the specific aetiology is still unknown,and there are many factors that have been associated with its development. In many forms of delirium,the brain's reaction to a peripheral inflammatory process is considered to be a pathophysiological key element and the aged brain seems to react more markedly to a peripheral inflammatory stimulus than a younger brain. The risk factors for delirium are categorised as predisposing or precipitating factors. In the presence of many predisposing factors,well documented predisposing factors are age,medical comorbidities,cognitive,functional,visual and hearing impairment and institutional residence. Important precipitating factors apart from surgery are admission to an ICU,anticholinergic drugs,alcohol or drug withdrawal,infections,iatrogenic complications,metabolic derangements,pain and the exposure to analgesics( opioids) and hypnotics( benzodiazepines). Several bedside instruments are available for the routine ward and ICU setting. The Confusion Assessment Method( CAM) and a version specifically developed for the intensive care setting( CAM- ICU) have emerged as a standard.Non- pharmacological multicomponent strategies and pharmacological prophylaxis may be useful to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium. Perioperative administration of haloperidol has been shown to reduce the severity and the incidence of delirium. The multicomponent interventions for prevention and treatment have been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of episodes.",

We discuss two patients with complex presentations. The first patient was diagnosed with sleep syncope, a relatively unknown type of reflex syncope. The prodromal symptoms of discomfort and the subsequent loss of consciousness occurred while the patient was in bed or got up to go to the toilet due to abdominal symptoms. The onset in supine position was misleading, since this is a well-known alarm symptom of a possible cardiac cause. The second patient had vasovagal syncope followed by a psychogenic pseudosyncope. This resulted in frequent loss of consciousness of long duration with typical and atypical triggers and uncommon syncopal signs, including eye closure. These conflicting symptoms can be a pitfall and clinical expertise is required to identify the type of syncope.",

They also had lifelong histories of more illnesses and somatic complaints, beginning with more childhood illnesses and more childhood problems related to eating and sleeping. During childhood, insomniacs reported more frequent discontent with their families, and prior to the onset of insomnia, they had less satisfying relationships with their parents as well as problems in other interpersonal relations and in their self-concepts. Currently, insomniacs felt considerably less satisfied with their lives, had lower self-concepts, and had greater difficulty with interpersonal relationships. Thus, stressful life events, mediated by certain predisposing factors of personal vulnerability, were found to be closely related to the onset of chronic insomnia.",

This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

Its physiological correlate is an unusual occurrence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, i.e., sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs). Various symptoms of the phenomenon are explained by the mechanisms of REM sleep. SOREMPs can be observed in various situations, which indicate a lower amplitude of circadian rhythms, such as during interupted sleep, acute reversal of sleep and wakefulness cycle, and disrupted sleep of depressive patients and in newborn babies. The lifetime prevalence of the phenomenon in the general population is as high about 40%. The phenomenon can be a mysterious and frightening experience far affected people and called as various names according to the folklore beliefs of local communities, e.g., nightmare in Europe, hexendrücken in Germany, cauchemar in France, and old hag in Newfoundland. Japanese college students are known for their very short sleep length and disturbed sleep wake rhythms. Many students claim to have experienced daytime sleepiness. Some of them meet the criterion concerning sleep latencies and frequency of SOREMPs for multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) as narcolepsy. SOREMPs are frequently seen in healthy college students with certain lifestyles. Practitioners should be cautious to diagnose narcolepsy if the student shows disturbed sleep wake schedules.",

      "title": "Traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "It has been estimated that more than 1.7 million individuals suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year. TBI causes secondary biochemical and metabolic changes which contribute to subsequent tissue damage and associated neuronal cell death. Two early and delayed events occur after TBI, which results in neurological deficits. Primary injury events include the mechanical damage that occur at the time of trauma to neurons, axons, glia and blood vessels as a result of shearing, tearing or stretching but secondary injury starts over minutes to days and even months after the initial traumatic insult and results from delayed biochemical, metabolic and cellular changes that are triggered by the primary event. Studying the secondary injury cascade could develop therapeutic window for pharmacological or other treatment to prevent progressive tissue damage and improve outcome. Processes such as depolarization, disturbances of ionic homeostasis, and release of neurotransmitters (such as excitatory amino acids), lipid degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and initiation of inflammatory and immune processes are some mechanisms that occur in secondary injury event. Through these events large amounts of toxic and pro-inflammatory molecules such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and pro-inflammatory cytokines generate, which lead to lipid peroxidation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and the development of edema. Edema, phenomena that intracranial pressure increases, can contribute local hypoxia and ischemia, secondary hemorrhage and additional neuronal cell death via necrosis or apoptosis. For improving neuroprotective strategies to control and decrease subsequent injurious events after TBI, studying on acute mechanisms in secondary injury event is necessary. With studying on this process, therapeutic window could be opened against a major cause of mortality, traumatic brain injury.

Zu deren Überprüfung werden in der Regel geeignete, objektivierbare psychologische Testverfahren verlangt. Festgestellte Eignungsmängel können unter Umständen durch entsprechende Hilfsmittel, Kfz-Umbauten oder durch eine besonders erfahrene, vorausschauende und sicherheitsbewusste Fahrweise kompensiert werden. Nicht kompensiert werden können homonyme Hemianopsie, persistierende Doppelbilder bei Geradeausblick, unvorhersehbar attackenförmig auftretender Schwindel, visuelles Hemineglektsyndrom sowie charakterliche Mängel. In der Beurteilung bei speziellen Krankheitsbildern ist immer vom Einzelfall auszugehen. Von einer Einschränkung der FE ist auszugehen, wenn eine Verkehrsgefährdung durch die Erkrankung/Symptomatik in konkreten Fahrsituationen anzunehmen ist, sodass ein Unfall mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit eintreten kann. Derartige Gefährdungssituationen entstehen durch Einschränkungen der körperlichen oder geistigen Leistungsfähigkeit, unvorhersehbar auftretende Störungen der Leistungsfähigkeit oder mangelnde Einsicht in Gefahren und Risiken. Die Bedingungen bei verschiedenen Krankheitsbildern/Syndromen werden diskutiert.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disease is becoming major health concern mainly for elder people of age over 60 years. The main cause of PD is permanent loss/death of dopaminergic nerve cells present in brain part called substantia nigra, which is responsible for dopamine synthesis. MAO-B, monoamine oxidase B, regulates dopamine metabolism and increased activity of MAO-B causes dopamine degradation which in turn promotes the accumulation of glutamate and oxidative stress with free radical liberation. Several factors like oxidative stress, free radical formation, increased cholesterol, mitochondrial dysfunction, nitric oxide toxicity, signal-mediated apoptosis, head trauma, and environmental toxins and gene mutations like VPS35, SNCA, EIF4G1, GBA, CHCHD, LRRK2, PINK1, DNAJC13 and SOD2 are associated with PD. Symptoms of PD include bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, resting tremors, postural instability and shuffling gait, constipation, sleep problems, fatigue, apathy, loss of smell and taste, excessive sweating, frequent nightmares, dream enacting behaviour, anxiety, depression, daytime drowsiness. In PD, low levels of ceruloplasmin were observed in people with early onset of PD. Ceruloplasmin, a ferroxidase enzyme which is synthesized in liver parenchymal cell, regulates iron metabolism and lower level of which causes iron accumulation in brain which is responsible for the early onset of PD. Levodopa-based preparations, Dopamine agonists, Catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, MOA-B inhibitors, Adjunctive therapy, Antiglutamatergics drugs are currently used for the treatment of PD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The patient’s complaint illustrates the scope of the differential diagnosis of “unsteadiness.” Shaking restricted to the legs is an unusual complaint, and unsteadiness does not typically dissipate with walking or movement. Patients with Parkinson’s disease usually note tremor or akathisia in the legs only while at rest when sitting or lying. Patients with essential tremor may complain of tremulousness and unsteadiness in the legs with action but typically have accompanying tremor in the arms, head and neck, or voice. In contrast, the worst unsteadiness and shaking in this patient with orthostatic tremor occurred while he was standing in place, as in line at the bank or grocery store. Often, a patient with orthostatic tremor may not report “shaking” but rather a sense of unpleasant, “vibratory” unsteadiness, further contributing to the diagnostic challenge. This patient’s history of sleep attacks and cataplexy also suggests a diagnosis of narcolepsy, although this is seemingly unrelated to the chief complaint.",

      "title": "STRESS COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION PREVENTS COCAINE RELAPSE BY DISRUPTING MEMORY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug addiction is a chronic and recurrent brain disease. Addictive substances can cause changes in brain circuits and may be integrated into the memory system. Drug addiction consists of different phases, beginning when recreational use escalates to compulsive use and then cycles through withdrawal, and relapse. A relapse is a return to drinking or drug use after attempts have previously been made to stop. The prevention of relapses is perhaps the most fundamental task in addiction recovery. Repeated retrieval by the cue without reward stimulant reduces the behavioral response through a process called extinction. This learning is the fundamental principle underlying many cognitive- behavioral psychotherapeutic treatments. Yet behavioral change may be difficult to sustain, and relapse is not uncommon, even after successful treatment. Memory updating was applied to substance use problems by weakening the ability of drug-associated triggers to elicit substance use[1]. Stress can potentially affect all cognitive phases involved in memory function such as the process of memory storage, retrieval or/and consolidation. Stress prior to extinction might not only enhance the consolidation of extinction memory, like post-extinction stress does, but also make it less context- dependent[2]. Aims &amp; Objectives 1) Whether stress combined with extinction learning disrupts consolidated memory to suppress cocaine relapse. 2) What is the mechanism of stress combined with extinction learning suppressing drug seeking behavior. Method The self-administration of cocaine was used as an animal model for addictive memory. A combination of techniques, including immunofluorescence, fiber optic recording, brain slice patch-clamp recordings, and Golgi staining, was employed to explore the mechanism of stress combined with extinction in addictive memory. Results (1) The drug-priming test following self-administration extinction training suggested that rats exposed to footshock before extinction training (FE group) had a lower number of active nosepokes compared to extinction group (E group). Interestingly, in conditioned place avoidance test, footshock did not elicit an aversive response. (2) Fiber optic recording results showed excitatory neuron in LHb were more active in FE group during drug-priming test. Electrophysiological in vitro results suggested a significant increase in action potential firing and reduction of the threshold of the injected current to trigger the action potential in LHb. (3) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb combined with extinction training effectively facilitated the elimination of cocaine addiction memory and reduced psychological craving. (4) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb increased cfos expression in RMTg. Activation of LHb-RMTg also facilitated extinction and inhibited relapse. Activation of LHb-RMTg circuit could mimic the effect of stress combined with extinction in inhibiting relapse. Discussion &amp; Conclusion This study demonstrateed that stress combination with extinction training may promote the extinction of addictive memory and inhibit relapse by reshaping activity of neurons in the LHb-RMTg circuit.

      "abstract": "During sleep, infants with obstructive sleep apneas are characterised by snoring, laborious breathing, and profuse sweating. During wakefulness, they may have breath-holding spells, and during feeding, difficult breathing and swallowing coordination. Abnormal weight, difficult growth, and recurring ear infections may also develop. During sleep apneas, cinefiuoroscopy shows approximation of tongue and hypopharyngeal tissues, with an obliteration of the air space. The obstructed breaths occur mainly in REM, and light NREM sleep, associated with total short sleep time, and frequent arousals. Preterm infants, and term neonates are more prone to obstructive apneas than older healthy infants. Apneas are more frequently seen in boys and in case of excess in body weight. Obstructive apneas are frequently associated with upper airway anatomic abnormalities: malformations, soft tissue infiltration, and neurologic lesions impairing muscle contractions. Alterations of the autonomic nervous control may induce airways obstructions. Contributing factors include mucopolysaccharide storage disease, hypothyroidism, or Down’s syndrome. Superimposed factors may occur, such as nasal obstruction, secretions in the airways, or tissue edema. Pressure- and chemo-sensitive reflexes may also favor obstruction. Environmental factors also contribute to the development of sleep apneas: body position, neck flexion, sleep deprivation, or the effects of sedative drugs.",

      "title": "Night Eating Syndrome Presenting as Anorexia in an Athlete",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Night eating syndrome (NES) was first described by Stunkard in 1955 as \"morning anorexia, evening or nocturnal hyperphagia in a fully conscious state, and insomnia\" (21). Over time, the syndrome has been further characterized to distinguish it from other forms of nighttime eating. Although some debate still exists, NES encompasses a few key behaviors, including evening hyperphagia (or late night eating before initiating sleep) and eating after awakening from sleep (night eating) either in a fully or semi-conscious state (11). This is in contrast to binge eating disorder (BED), which describes episodes of consuming large quantities of food in discrete time periods without control (23), or sleep related eating disorder (SRED), which refers to involuntary nocturnal eating, often of bizarre foods or inedible items, that occurs after awakening (25). Late-night eating also can be found in other diagnoses, such as bulimia nervosa or dissociative disorders, but in these cases it is usually a part of a group of symptoms rather than the central problem. The hallmark of NES is a delay of caloric intake until the evening and night hours. Birketvedt revealed that night eaters consume 56% of their daily caloric intake between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., compared with 15% by control subjects (5). The foods consumed during episodes of evening hyperphagia and night eating tend to be carbohydrate-rich (7), with a high carbohydrate to protein ratio of 7:1. Nighttime awakenings are common among night eaters, and >50% of these episodes were associated with food intake, compared with 0% in control subjects (5). CASE PRESENTATION A 19-yr-old college softball player was referred to a sports medicine clinic by her team's strength staff and teammates for not eating during the daytime and a concern for possible anorexia nervosa. For most of the day, she reported a lack of appetite until approximately 3 p.m., when she ate her first meal. A teammate reported her to be seen pushing her food around the plate and not eating. She attempted to restrict calories during meals because of a bloated feeling in the morning. She denied binging or purging activities. She was seen 3 months earlier by another physician for a complaint of insomnia. She denied difficulty with initiating sleep, but experienced frequent nighttime awakenings, on average three to four times in one night. She had one roommate, and she denied excessive noise, poorly regulated temperature, or light disturbances. She did not discuss her nighttime eating with that physician. She also denied nightmares or night terrors. She had attempted over-the-counter sleep aids without improvement in her symptoms. She was started on zolpidem tartrate, which did not diminish the number of awakenings. Upon each awakening she would consume a snack, consisting of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as cookies or crackers, frequently more than 1000 calories over the night. Although she tried to refrain from eating, she felt unsatisfied and unable to reinitiate sleep until consuming food. Generally, she reported being conscious while eating. However, at times she only would become aware of the episodes by the food wrappers surrounding her bed the next morning. After eating she easily returned to sleep, but reawakened 1-2 h later. Her roommate reported having her personal food confiscated by the patient at night and engaging in conversations that the patient could not recall the following day. The following morning after an episode, she experienced a moderate amount of guilt related to her eating and modest weight gain of approximately 7 lb. She admitted to a mildly depressed mood and intermittent anhedonia. She reported anxiety related to increased life stressors over the past few months associated with softball, classes, and a new relationship. She denied having difficulty concentrating or a decline in academic work. However, she noticed decreased endurance and performance during softball practice and competitions, especially with morning activities during which she felt tired, bloated, and groggy. By not eating for most of the day, she often lacked enough energy to complete an entire afternoon practice. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. At the time of the visit about eating disorder concern, she was no longer taking any medication or supplements. She denied a personal or family history of eating disorders. A complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Upon examination, vital signs were normal; height was 5'6,\" and weight was 160 lb. The physical and psychiatric exams were unremarkable. Her Zung depression scale score was 24, and her night eating questionnaire score was 49. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although NES was described initially in the obesity literature, it is not limited to this demographic. The syndrome's prevalence among the general population is estimated at 1.5% (19). Up to 8.9% of obesity clinic patients meet the criteria for NES (16). However, the diagnostic patterns do not appear to be different for obese and non-obese individuals with NES (7). A recent study investigating familial aggregation showed that individuals with NES were more likely to have an affected first-degree relative than control subjects (OR = 4.9) (13). Recently, the link between psychiatric illness and NES has become of interest because of its association with stress and depression. Lundgren et al. found that 12.3% of patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic met the diagnostic criteria for NES and that these patients had a higher rate of substance abuse and atypical antipsychotic use than patients without NES (12). DIAGNOSIS As NES is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV), variance in diagnostic criteria is widely seen in both past and present studies. In a recent evaluation of diagnostic criteria, Allison et al. report that the definition of night eating has ranged from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. to the more general \"after the evening meal,\" while the proportion of total calories consumed has varied from 25% to 50% (2). These inconsistencies create some difficulty in generalizing investigational results to the general population, as well as clearly identifying whether a patient meets criteria for the actual syndrome or is a variant of normal. In reality, many people have episodes of late-night eating, and in households that often spend evenings watching television, after-dinner snacking may be the norm. In addition, there is variation in the average dinnertime among cultures, with the average person in the United States eating between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., while the average person in Europe has dinner between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The question of whether to include NES in the DSM-V has prompted further investigation into the diagnostic tools and criteria currently used. In an attempt to assess two screening instruments, Vander Wal et al. found that use of a single simple screening question had adequate sensitivity but poor specificity to identify patients correctly with NES (24). Additionally, while the NEQ was correlated positively with increasing diagnostic detail, there was an inability to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity with varying cut points. Vander Wal concluded that the difference between eating late at night versus waking from sleep to eat might be the key to distinguishing NES as a true pathologic state. By evaluating several items from the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Allison et al. found that three items appear to be core aspects of the disorder: 1) evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal eating, 2) initial insomnia, and 3) awakenings from sleep (4). Their analysis suggests that the presence of morning anorexia and a delayed morning meal added little additional information. The NEQ has evolved alongside research to characterize NES. Developed as a standardized screening tool for diagnosing NES, the current version is a 14-item questionnaire that addresses both behavioral and psychological aspects of the syndrome. The questions investigate the following aspects of NES: morning hunger and timing of first food consumption, cravings, control over eating before bedtime and during nighttime awakenings, percentage of post-dinner food consumption, initial insomnia, frequency of awakenings, associated food consumption during awakenings and awareness during these episodes, and mood disturbance (4). By varying the cut score, Allison et al. calculated that a positive predictive value of up to 77% can be attained (2). While the NEQ has been shown to be an efficient and valid measure of the severity of NES, its primary use is as a screening tool and it should not replace clinical interview for diagnosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In general, it has been recognized that the pattern of intake rather than the total calories ingested is different in NES subjects compared with controls (17). NES has been linked to changes in the circadian rhythm and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Therefore, NES has been described as delayed circadian eating patterns superimposed upon normal sleep-wake cycles (17). An inpatient study by Allison et al. showed a decrease in overnight ghrelin levels, a stomach-derived appetite stimulant, compared with control subjects, whereas insulin and glucose increased at night (1). No difference was found in secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), melatonin, leptin, cortisol, or prolactin. In comparison, Birketvedt et al. found attenuated secretions of nocturnal leptin (an adipocyte-derived appetite suppressant) and melatonin, whereas cortisol was increased (5). In a small study comparing the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone among people with NES and control subjects, an attenuated response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol release was observed, suggesting an overexpressed HPA (10). The authors interpret this finding to be a result of the constant stressful stimuli to which people with NES are exposed, but they note that, alternately, it may be a direct result of a fasting state. They hypothesize that the behaviors of disordered sleep and increased nighttime appetite may be related directly to the neurotransmitter alterations that are caused by an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Based upon the observed caloric intake and neuroendocrine assays in a study of 15 women with NES and 14 control subjects, Goel et al. theorized that NES might represent dissociation between a central timing mechanism in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other presumed regulator systems in the central nervous system, stomach, or liver (9). Again, the question of causality arises in interpreting whether the observed differences in ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, insulin, and glucose amplitudes and timing are altered independently compared with control subjects or are results of the abnormal behaviors of nocturnal waking and eating. TREATMENT Researchers have explored several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for NES, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training, and light therapy. Lundgren et al. demonstrated elevated binding of midbrain serotonin transporters, which may amplify the reuptake of serotonin and impair postsynaptic serotonin transmission (14). This theory can explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are useful in treating individuals with NES. Early studies and case reports related reduction in night eating episodes and decrease in overall caloric intake to both short-term (2 wk) (15) and long-term (6-15 months) (20) SSRI use. In an 8-wk randomized, placebo-controlled study of sertraline for NES, 12/17 in the sertraline group responded to therapy compared with 3/17 in the control group (16). Seven of the 12 responders in the sertraline group had a remission or complete resolution of symptoms, compared with one of the three responders in the control group. This study was different than previous SSRI trials because it included a small number of normal weight subjects. Of these, two of the three in the sertraline group responded, compared with zero of three in the control group. Participants in the study group had a 30% chance of responding at 2 wk and a 50% chance of responding between weeks 4 and 8. Overall, the sertraline group had a significant reduction in the symptoms of NES, including a reduction in nocturnal ingestions (80%), lower caloric intake after the evening meal (32.5%), and weight loss (approximately 1 lb·wk−1). The changes in night eating did not correlate with changes in depressive symptoms, which were modest at baseline. Because individuals with NES report greater levels of depression and anxiety in addition to displaying evidence of elevated stress (increased cortisol and CRH), Pawlow et al. designed a study to evaluate effects of relaxation training (18). The study focused upon the short-term effects on a group (N = 10) randomized to abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation technique (APRT) compared with control subjects (N = 10). Participants in the APRT group reported lower levels of anxiety and stress and higher levels of relaxation immediately after a session, which correlated to lower levels of salivary cortisol. After 7 d of home practice, the significant decrease in levels of anxiety and stress persisted in the APRT group compared with control subjects. The relaxation group also had a significant increase in morning appetite and decrease in evening appetite rating, but had a nonsignificant decrease in days with post-bedtime eating. Bright-light therapy has been suggested as a therapy for weight loss in obese subjects (6). A case report of an obese woman with NES demonstrated resolution of night eating symptoms when exposed to light therapy, in addition to decreased depression scores (8). NES symptoms recurred when light therapy was discontinued. Light therapy's ability to alter the circadian pattern changes seen in NES may explain this therapeutic observation. DISCUSSION We used the following provisional criteria outlined by Birketvedt (1999) (5) to diagnose our athlete with NES: 1) morning anorexia, even if breakfast is eaten; 2) evening hyperphagia, in which >50% of daily energy intake is consumed after the evening meal; 3) awakenings at least once per night; 4) consumption of snacks during awakenings; 5) repetition of provisional criteria longer than 3 months; and 6) does not meet the criteria for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. To our knowledge, there have been no studies or case reports focusing upon NES in the athletic population. However, there is a well-accepted association between sports participation and eating disorders. While determining the true prevalence in athletes has been difficult, one Norwegian study estimated that 13.5% of elite athletes have eating disorders, defined as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, compared with 4.6% in the control population (22). Our patient was diagnosed before the Allison et al. (2009) proposed diagnostic criteria for night eating syndrome (3). Our patient fulfilled these criteria as well as the older Birketvedt criteria. With regard to NES, there are specific issues to consider in the athletic population. First, although morning anorexia may exist, athletes may force themselves to eat breakfast to meet the energy demands of early morning practice or competition. Similarly, athletes may appear to have a normal percentage of preevening meal calories, but their calorie requirements may far exceed their intake. As in our athlete, symptoms of underperformance as a result of a negative energy balance and inadequate sleep may be the driving factor to seek medical attention. Finally, although some athletes may notice weight gain, overall they are less likely to be clinically overweight or obese given the intense training required to perform at a high level. Our athlete's initial complaint was of insomnia, and she was instructed initially in basic sleep-hygiene practices. Her nighttime eating was not mentioned on the first visit, and the prescription of a sleep aid may have exacerbated her problem. Once NES was diagnosed, she was started on sertraline (50 mg daily). She was titrated gradually up to a dose of 200 mg daily over the next 6 wk. She was simultaneously sent to the college mental health center for cognitive-behavioral therapy. She went for four visits and reported a significant reduction in symptoms with the treatments. Although she awoke on average once per night, down from the previous three to four times each night, she was usually able to return to sleep almost immediately without eating. She developed regular eating patterns, consuming three regular meals per day with one to two snacks. Her mood improved and anhedonia also resolved. She continued softball participation throughout her treatment, with noticeable improvements and increased consistency in performance once her night eating resolved.",

Changes in the cranial nerve examination primarily relate to an age-related decline in sensory functions, especially of vision and hearing, and to a restriction in the range of eye movements, especially vertically. A progressive decline in the bulk and strength of muscles and in the speed and coordination of movements has long been recognised as an accompaniment of aging. Posture and gait show conspicuous changes with advancing age, partially correlating with diminished sensation in the legs and/or with a nonspecific bradykinetic senile gait. The distal depression of deep tendon reflexes and sensory function is primarily due to distal degeneration of sensory axons. Among the release signs, only the reappearance of the grasp reflex is a reliable sign for indicating pathology of the nervous system. Senile tremor, a decline in the maintenance of thermal homoeostasis, an increasing frequency of orthostatic hypotension, and disorders of sleep are also commonly associated with aging.",

Frequently reported medical co-morbidities with PTSD across various studies include cardiovascular disease, especially hypertension, and immune-mediated disorders. PTSD is associated with limbic instability and alterations in both the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal and sympatho-adrenal medullary axes, which affect neuroendocrine and immune functions, have central nervous system effects resulting in pseudo-neurological symptoms and disorders of sleep-wake regulation, and result in autonomic nervous system dysregulation. Hypervigilance, a central feature of PTSD, can lead to 'local sleep' or regional arousal states, when the patient is partially asleep and partially awake, and manifests as complex motor and/or verbal behaviours in a partially conscious state. The few studies of the effects of standard PTSD treatments (medications, CBT) on PTSD-associated somatic syndromes report a reduction in the severity of ill-defined and autonomically mediated somatic symptoms, self-reported physical health problems, and some chronic pain syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

The majority of patients experienced one or more consecutive 48-hour sleep-wake cycles (alternate nights with no sleep) when they switched out of depression into mania of hypomania. During a depressive phase, nine rapidly cycling patients were asked to simulate a 48-hour sleep-wake cycle by remaining awake for 40 hours (one night's total sleep deprivation). Eight switched out of depression, and seven were rated as manic or hypomanic; indicating that sleep loss (such as occurs with spontaneous 48-hour sleep-wake cycles) may help to trigger switches from depression to mania. The 48-hour sleep-wake cycles in patients may depend on a mechanism that is normally present in all humans, since normal persons also spontaneously experience near-48 hour sleep-wake cycles in certain experimental conditions.",

Typical dream reports include such psychological features as hallucinations, delusions, cognitive abnormalities, emotional intensification, and amnesia. These five remarkable features of dreaming have invited its comparison to abnormal states of mind occurring during waking in certain clinical conditions, especially schizophrenia and organic syndromes. The exploration of the neurobiological basis of dreaming therefore constitutes not only an aspect of mind-body interaction but also a model approach to the study of mental illness. An obvious problem is that the unconfirmable nature of all subjective experience is compounded by difficult access to the mind in sleep. The recent development of sleep laboratory techniques has given the study of dreaming a more instrumental and systematic character, and the emerging picture encourages psychophysiological integration.",

      "abstract": "There are many reasons to take into consideration the sleep disorders in the elderly. The sleep quality degrades with age and is strongly affected by medical conditions, intrinsic sleep disorders, or by a combination of these factors. Other age-related conditions such as severe dementia, dependence or living in institution worsen sleep disturbances in older people. When living alone elderly people, being cognitively impaired and medically disabled, may not be able to complain about sleep problems. Sleep disorders are thus underdiagnosed, unmarked, and insufficiently investigated in the elderly. In this heterogeneous population, sleep assessment should include a global geriatric approach and be individually adapted for each subject. The sleep interview must specially include medical comorbidities, medication uses, and aged-related changes of lifestyle such as retirement, loss of spouse, hospitalization or institutionalization. In the elderly with loss of autonomy, standard sleep assessment is not always adequate and must be replaced by shorter, simpler or observation-based tests such as the Sleep disorders inventory, Observation-based nocturnal sleep inventory, Observation and interview based diurnal sleepiness inventory. When sleep log is impossible, actimetry is an excellent alternative for studying sleep-wake rhythm. Ventilatory polygraphy is a simpler test for detecting sleep apnea than polysomnography. Utilization of sophisticated investigations should be discussed when the feasibility and usefulness is limited.",

The apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) and the periodic limb movements (PLM) index were higher. Sleep architecture was also impaired. There were no abnormalities of oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide levels, respiratory rate or heart rate.New post-polio sleep disturbances were isolated symptoms. It appears that these symptoms were not due to post-polio features, but rather, that they were due to dysfunction of the surviving motor neurons in the brainstem. Abnormal dopamine production, which is responsible for many sleep-related breathing disorders and abnormal movements, may also have been implicated in the present findings.",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "We describe three spinal cord injury cases exhibiting periodic leg movements (PLMs) in both rapid eye movement (REM) and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The difference in the average periodicity in REM and NREM sleep was modest, but was generally shorter in REM than in NREM sleep. However, the variability associated with the PLMs was nearly three to six times smaller in REM than in NREM sleep, suggesting that the periodicity of the PLMs in REM sleep was more precise than in NREM sleep. The finding of PLMs in these patients suggests that a spinal cord injury may permit the expression of a spinal PLM generator, which may be an unusual presentation of a spinal locomotor generator. The PLM generator would be displayed when the descending inhibitory spinal pathways are interrupted by a spinal injury. The rapid periodicity of the PLM generator in REM sleep, compared with NREM sleep, may result from an increase in sympathetic activity normally accompanying this sleep state. Alternative explanations for the occurrence of PLMs in spinal injury are the influence of adverse sleeping position, age, an increase in circulating catecholamines and peripheral perfusion. We conclude that the presence of PLMs may be an important, but neglected, sleep disorder in spinal cord patients. Therefore, health care professionals should be aware of the possibility of sleep-related PLMs when these patients have sleep and/or waking complaints.",

BRDs are associated with background EEG abnormalities as well as increased morbidity and mortality (Oliveira et al., 2000, Nagarajan et al., 2011), and appear to be more closely related to formal neonatal seizures than post-neonatal epilepsy (Nagarajan et al., 2011).

At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders, such as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and excessive daytime sleepiness, are among the most common non-motor symptoms in subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Sleep disorders have a major negative impact on the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. In addition, REM sleep behavior disorder is an important risk factor for cognitive impairment in PD. This systematic review was conducted on studies investigating the influence of RBD on cognitive performance in PD subjects. We searched the PubMed and Scopus databases, screened the references of the studies included, and reviewed articles for additional citations. From the first 244 publications, we included only 11 studies that met the search criteria. The results showed that sleep disorders in PD were associated with impaired executive functions, visual-constructive abilities, reduced attention, and episodic verbal memory, and could predict the possible risk of developing dementia.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

Cette dernière peut constituer la cause du retard des acquisitions (encéphalopathie épileptogène) ou bien n'être qu'une traduction supplémentaire conséquence d'une pathologie neurologique sous jacente commune (encéphalopathie avec épilepsie). Elle n'est alors pas seule responsable du retard. Dans le cadre des encéphalopathies avec épilepsie une démarche diagnostique rigoureuse est nécessaire avec notamment un examen cutané (syndromes neuro‐cutanés), un examen moteur (séquelles anoxo‐ischémiques de la période périnatale), un EEG, une imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM) cérébrale ainsi que la recherche d'anomalies associées (cardiaque, rénale…). D'autre part il existe des encéphalopathies épileptogènes telles que les syndromes liés à l'âge : syndrome hémiconvulsions, hémiplégie, épilepsie (HHE) ; syndrome de Rasmussen, épilepsie myoclonique sévère du nourrisson (syndrome de Dravet), épilepsie myoclono‐astatique (Doose) que nous développerons comme exemples. L'âge, le type de crises et l'EEG sont utiles pour le diagnostic dans ce cas, les autres examens étant généralement peu contributifs. Retard et épilepsie sont souvent associés et la première étape du diagnostic est d'essayer de comprendre si l'épilepsie est une cause active du désordre cognitif ou non, afin d'affiner la démarche étiologique mais aussi d'adapter la prise en charge thérapeutique.",

      "title": "Rhythm and timing as vulnerabilities in neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Millions of children are impacted by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which unfold early in life, have varying genetic etiologies and can involve a variety of specific or generalized impairments in social, cognitive and motor functioning requiring potentially lifelong specialized supports. While specific disorders vary in their domain of primary deficit (e.g. autism spectrum disorder (social), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (attention), developmental coordination disorder (motor) and developmental language disorder (language)), comorbidities between NDDs are common. Intriguingly, many NDDs are associated with difficulties in skills related to rhythm, timing and synchrony though specific profiles of rhythm/timing impairments vary across disorders. Impairments in rhythm/timing may instantiate vulnerabilities for a variety of NDDs and may contribute to both the primary symptoms of each disorder as well as the high levels of comorbidities across disorders. Drawing upon genetic, neural, behavioural and interpersonal constructs across disorders, we consider how disrupted rhythm and timing skills early in life may contribute to atypical developmental cascades that involve overlapping symptoms within the context of a disorder's primary deficits. Consideration of the developmental context, as well as common and unique aspects of the phenotypes of different NDDs, will inform experimental designs to test this hypothesis including via potential mechanistic intervention approaches. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Synchrony and rhythm interaction: from the brain to behavioural ecology’.",

      "abstract": "Ageing is often associated with a decrease in the quality of sleep. In older subjects, sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) are increasingly recognized as being responsible for alterations in the quality of sleep. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases with ageing; despite sometimes major disturbances in sleep structure, clinical symptoms are often subtle in this age group. Central apnea and periodic breathing, also more frequent in older subjects, most often occur in patients suffering either from neurological problems (such as tumors, brain infarcts, sequelae of infection, diffuse encephalopathies) or moderate to severe heart failure. In fact, patients suffering from cerebro-vascular diseases (such as brain infarcts or transient ischemic attacks) have a higher prevalence of SRBD than a control age-matched population. In these patients, SRBD are associated with a poorer prognosis in terms of functional recovery and survival. The clinical impact of SRBD on cognitive function appears to be modest in patients without dementia, albeit for a slight increase in daytime somnolence. However, in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, SRBD occur more frequently than in non-demented subjects, and indexes of severity of SRBD have been correlated with the importance of cognitive impairment. The hypothesis of a causal relationship between SRBD and the degree neuropsychological impairment in either Alzheimer's disease or multi-infarct dementia remains a matter of controversy. SRBD should be considered as a possible cause of \"reversible dementia\" and sought for in the presence of daytime somnolence, delirium, or unexplained right-sided heart failure in older patients.",

Nearly all of the patients show breathing abnormalities during their lifespan, both in wake and sleep and respiratory illness represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality in RTT. Pathogenic mechanisms underlying breath-holding and other breathing abnormalities in RTT are mainly related to dysautonomia and an alteration in respiratory control at different levels, including several regions of the central and peripheral nervous system. Pathogenic variants in the MECP2 gene have been implicated in the dysfunction of respiratory pathways, affecting chemosensitivity and the response to neurotransmitters. In addition, frequent comorbidities such as scoliosis, dysphagia, sleep disorders, and epilepsy can further impair the respiratory function in these patients.",

The appearance and sufferings of the patients during these attacks may further alarm relatives or onlookers, and even the medical man, unless he be familiar with the true nature of the seizures or fully alive to the history of the case, may be taken unawares, and feel so dubious about their purport and outcome as to be unable to give a reassuring prognosis. And yet the seizures which I have in mind are all consistent with long life and with good health at other times.

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common psychiatric complication associated with pregnancy and childbirth with debilitating symptoms that negatively impact the quality of life of the mother as well as inflict potentially long-lasting developmental impairments to the child. Much of the theoretical pathophysiology put forth to explain the emergence of PPD overlaps with that of major depressive disorder (MDD) and, although not conventionally described in such terms, can be seen as neurodegenerative in nature. Framing the disorder from the perspective of the well-established inflammatory theory of depression, symptoms are thought to be driven by dysregulation, and subsequent hyperactivation of the body's immune response to stress. Compounded by physiological stressors such as drastic fluctuations in hormone signaling, physical and psychosocial stressors placed upon new mothers lay bare a number of significant vulnerabilities, or points of potential failure, in systems critical for maintaining healthy brain function. The inability to compensate or properly adapt to meet the changing demands placed upon these systems has the potential to damage neurons, hinder neuronal growth and repair, and disrupt neuronal circuit integrity such that essential functional outputs like mood and cognition are altered. The impact of this deterioration in brain function, which includes depressive symptoms, extends to the child who relies on the mother for critical life-sustaining care as well as important cognitive stimulation, accentuating the need for further research.",

In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

All these paroxysmal dyskinesias and behaviors encompass a number of different entities forming a heterogeneous collection of phenomena. Some of these diurnal and nocturnal movement disorders are especially triggered by sleep or occur preferentially during sleep, whereas others are overlapping (i.e., those movements seen during the daytime may persist during sleep at night). In this chapter we try to address this dilemma by outlining a rational classification, brief description of some entities causing diagnostic difficulties, and approach to such patients.",

In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium.

Areas covered: This review discusses what is currently known about the characteristics of sleep disturbances in PD patients and attempts to clarify the role of dopaminergic pathways in their pathogenesis as well as the beneficial effect of dopaminergic agents in their treatment. In particular, this review will focus on the effects of transdermal rotigotine on improving PD-related sleep disorders. Expert opinion: Sleep disturbances are common in PD, and these disturbances can be reduced or resolved, in large part, by preventing or attenuating nocturnal and early morning motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. The studies discussed within this review suggest that sleep disorders are not just a consequence of motor impairment and dopaminergic therapy but are an integral part of the neurodegenerative process of PD. This is supported by the appearance of specific sleep disturbances, which are related to degeneration of the brainstem areas involved in the regulation of sleep/wake states in advance of typical PD symptoms. Development of more detailed diagnostic tools aimed at detecting sleep disturbances and at defining the main causative factors of sleep disturbances in PD will lead to improved treatment of these disturbances.",

Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

These impairments are likely to have a negative impact on daily activities and vocational integration. Neuropsychological assessments examine their degree of severity, the nature of the impaired processes and the presence of other, associated cognitive or affective symptoms. Cognitive rehabilitation mainly aims at reducing the impact of persisting memory difficulties on everyday life using compensation strategies. Cognitive rehabilitation studies have improved their quality in the last decade, as indicated by the increased number of randomized controlled trials and demonstrated the efficacy of some therapeutic interventions on various variables.Les troubles de la mémoire épisodique et la plainte mnésique sont fréquents après une atteinte cérébrale acquise chez l’adulte. Ces déficits peuvent se répercuter sur les activités de la vie quotidienne et l’insertion professionnelle. L’évaluation neuropsychologique examine le degré de sévérité, la nature des processus perturbés et la présence d’autres symptômes cognitifs ou affectifs associés. Les prises en charge cognitives visent principalement à diminuer l’impact des difficultés mnésiques séquellaires en vie quotidienne par l’utilisation de stratégies de compensation. Les études de réhabilitation cognitive, dont la qualité a augmenté cette dernière décennie avec un nombre croissant d’essais contrôlés randomisés, ont montré l’efficacité de certaines interventions sur différentes variables.",

      "abstract": "Seit einiger Zeit rücken psychiatrische Komplikationen der dopaminergen Therapie beim M. Parkinson in den Fokus der Aufmerksamkeit. Verhaltensstörungen wie Impulskontrollstörungen, das Dopaminerge Dysregulationssyndrom und das sogenannte punding sind trotz z.T. schwerwiegender sozialer, psychischer und physischer Konsequenzen für die Patienten bislang vermutlich unterdiagnostiziert, da sie von ihnen nur selten spontan berichtet werden [1]. Nicht alle Parkinsonpatienten entwickeln im Laufe ihrer Erkrankung Störungen des Verhaltens oder der Impulskontrolle. Es konnten mittlerweile für die verschiedenen Verhaltensstörungen potentielle Risikofaktoren identifiziert werden (z.B. Dopaminagonisten für Impulskontrollstörungen) [2]. Impulskontrollstörungen bei Parkinsonpatienten scheinen mit Veränderungen in der Funktion von Netzwerken assoziiert zu sein, die Belohnungen verarbeiten bzw. Belohnungseffekte vermitteln und/oder Risikoaspekte von Entscheidungen evaluieren [3]. Eine Hauptwirkung von dopaminergen Medikamenten scheint dabei zu sein, das Belohnungssystem zu desensibilisieren. Funktionelle Bildgebungsstudien haben hier gezeigt, dass wohl die tonische Stimulation von D2-Rezeptoren den Effekt des phasischen Abfalls der Dopaminausschüttung bei negativem Feedback ausmerzt und so möglicherweise zu einer Art Fehlprogrammierung führt [4]. Sowohl die Dichte der präsynaptischen Dopamintransporter, als auch die Zahl der unbelegten postsynaptischen D2-Rezeptoren ist bei vulnerablen Patienten scheinbar stark erniedrigt [5,6]. Aktivierungsstudien zeigten eine durch Dopaminagonisten hervorgerufene Deaktivirung inhibitorischer fronto-limbischer Netzwerke nur bei solch vulnerablen Patienten [7]. Im Liche dieser Befunde erscheint ein konstitutionell hoher Dopaminspiegel in den Synapsen des Belohnungssystems als entscheidende Gefährdung gut möglich [8].",

Sleep problems and disorders are more prevalent in patients with depression. Although in some people sleep problems and disorders may start before the onset of depressive symptoms, in others they may co-occur with depressive symptoms or persist after treatment of depression. Sleep problems and disorders may also increase risk of relapse and even lead to treatment-resistant depression. It has also been shown that treatment of sleep problems leads to better outcomes in patients with depression. The evaluation and treatment of sleep problems and disorders that are comorbid with depression is essential in improving outcomes.

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

      "abstract": "The formulation of a diagnosis in a child who has neurologic impairment should not (except in extreme circumstances) be made on the basis of a single finding. For example, the presence of delayed milestones, primitive or exaggerated reflexes, abnormal muscle tone, abnormal posture, abnormal neurologic examination, and temporal course should all be used to make the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Furthermore, because each condition has a spectrum of disabilities from mild to severe involvement, determination of the child's abilities and impairments should be part of the diagnostic process. Because the child lives in a number of different environments, assessment of the child's functional abilities and evaluation of the environments should be made. Finally, evaluations by specialists in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology, special education, and nutrition may be necessary to complete the child's diagnosis. The ability to examine the child over a period of time (i.e., continuity of care) allows the practitioner to provide a more accurate prognosis for future development. It also enables easier diagnosis of the child when he or she is acutely ill. This also allows a more trusting relationship to develop with the parent and enhances the ability to influence the psychosocial conditions that affect outcomes. Finally, all these children should have care coordination (case management) (i.e., someone who can ensure that they receive the care they need, without duplication) across all settings, including home, school, hospitals, and ambulatory facilities.",

      "abstract": "L'enuresi primitiva (essenziale notturna) può essere definita come una minzione involontaria che avviene di notte durante il sonno, mentre nel corso della giornata la minzione è normalmente controllata, ed ha perciò caratteri peculiari. Il notare, a volte, nei bambini affetti da enuresi primitiva la concomitanza di piccoli disturbi psichici o emozionali, di piccolo male, di stati di ipervagotonia o spasmofilia, conferma la natura funzionale complessa dell'affezione, sulla quale influiscono in prevalenza turbe della vita psichica o degli interessi affettivi del bambino. Alcuni dei fattori psichici implicati nell'enuresi (mancinismo, infantilismo nei giochi o discorsi, terrori notturni, fobie) possono anche essere considerati come indice di una incompleta maturazione psichica. Non vogliamo qui discutere sull'etiopatogenesi della malattia, che è tuttora piuttosto oscura. La maggioranza degli autori considera l'enuresi primitiva come un disturbo funzionale complesso, non legato ad alterazioni dell'innervazione o della maturazione delle strutture nervose e muscolari preposte alla funzione vescicale, ma piuttosto riportabile ad alterazioni (o ritardo) del meccanismo volontario della minzione. Si parla di enuresi primitiva quando il controllo anche notturno della minzione non è stato raggiunto entro i primi tre anni di vita. Secondo Harrison (1967), a 5 anni l'enuresi è presente nel 15% dei maschi e nel 10% delle femmine, a 9 anni nel 5%. Il disturbo cessa spontaneamente alla pubertà in quasi tutti i casi.",

Development We review the most relevant about sensory symptoms in PD: visual dysfunction, olfactory dysfunction, taste, hearing loss, and pain and other sensitive associate symptoms. Conclusions Pain is frequently observed in patients with PD, being its prevalence high and probably infra diagnosed. Its identification and classification is very important for a correct treatment. Hyposmia is a common symptom in PD and could be a predictor of future PD. Visual dysfunction and hearing dysfunction among others must be considered in patients with PD.",

These are due to drastic changes in living conditions such as prolonged work time, increased shift working, and various socio-psychological stresses. Sleep problems have been reported to strongly associate with emotional dysfunction in humans. Sleep loss cause not only daytime sleepiness and psychomotor impairment, but also emotional instability, anxiety and confusion, and chronic insomnia increases vulnerability to mood and anxiety disorders. Recent studies have revealed some of the neural basis of emotional regulation by sleep. For instance, continuous and accumulating sleep debt experienced in daily living could interfere with the functional regulation of the amygdala by ventral anterior cingulate cortex. And consequently this can induce an overreaction of the amygdala to negative emotional stimuli. Sleep-related mood disturbances may, in part, be attributable to the neural basis of emotional instability during sleep debt. In this text, recent findings on the functional linkage between sleep and emotional regulation have been reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Mental dysfunction including cognitive, behavioural changes, mood disorders, and psychosis are increasingly recognized in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. Their morphological correlates are complex due to multiple system degeneration. CNS changes contributing to cognitive changes in PD include 1. Dysfunction of subcortico-cortical networks with neuron losses in a) the dopaminergic nigrostriatal loop causing striato-(pre)frontal deafferentation and mesocortico-limbic system (medial substantia nigra, ventral tegmentum); b) noradrenergic (locus coer-uleus), and serotonergic systems (dorsal raphe nuclei), c) cholinergic fore-brain system (nucleus basalis of Meynert, etc), and d) specific nuclei of amygdala and limbic system (thalamic nuclei, hippocampus); 2. Limbic and/or cortical Lewy body and Alzheimer type pathologies with loss of neurons and synapses, 3. Combination of subcortical, cortical, and other pathologies. In general, degeneration of subcortical and striato-frontal networks causes cognitive, executive, behavioural, and mood disorders but less severe dementia than cortical changes which, when present in sufficient numbers, are important factors for overt dementia. In PD, cortical tau pathology with similar or differential patterns than in Alzheimer disease (AD) shows significant linear correlation with cognitive decline. In dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most frequent cause of dementia in the elderly, cortical Lewy bodies (LB) may or may not be associated with amyloid plaques and neuritic AD lesions. They predominantly affect the limbic system with less frequent isocortical Braak stages, whereas the cholinergic forebrain system is more severely affected than in AD. Both neuritic degeneration in limbic system in PD and DLB and the density of cortical synapse markers correlate with neuritic AD pathology and less with cortical LB counts. Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele frequency may represent a common genetic background for both AD and LB pathologies but there are different proportions of plaques between DLB (less Aβ1–40) and AD (more frequent Aβ1–40). Familial parkinsonism with dementia, linked to chromosome 17 (frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism (FTDP-17), and other tauo-pathies pathologically resembling PD plus AD, are often related to mutations of the tau gene, whereas familial PD with α-synuclein and Parkin mutations usually show no cognitive impairment. Mood disorders, in particular depression, and psychotic complications in both PD and DLB are related to complex involvement of noradregergic and serotonergic systems, not comfirmed in AD with depression, and both the prefrontal and limbic dopaminergic systems. The specific contributions of cortical and subcortical pathologies to mental dysfunction in PD and related disorders, their relationship to AD, and their genetic and aetiological backgrounds await further elucidation.",

      "title": "Images: Facial cataplexy with demonstration of persistent eye movements",
      "abstract": "A patient was transferred for management of \"medication-refractory seizures\" after failure of levetiracetam and valproate dual therapy. She had a life-long history of two types of events: periods in which she would rapidly and uncontrollably lapse into unconsciousness, and spells in which she would \"pass out\" but maintain consciousness, the latter happening with increasing frequency in association with laughing, as of late. She also reported hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. A clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy was made. The prevailing pathophysiological concept of narcolepsy details \"partial intrusions of REM\" sleep into wakefulness. Healthy REM sleep includes generalized atonia, but with preservation of eye movements, respiratory function, and sphincter tone. Cataplexy recapitulates this pattern, and is often induced by extreme emotions, laughter in this case. Despite generalized and severe weakness and areflexia during this patient's cataplectic events, she was able to volitionally move her eyes, which is consistent with the physiology of REM sleep. The diagnosis of cataplexy is often missed, due to clinicians being unfamiliar with the findings and the lack of ability to induce sufficient emotional responses to trigger an episode. This example of cataplexy is also quite characteristic of the \"cataplectic facies.\" The ability to observe the infrequently observed phenomenon of cataplexy serves as a reminder that consciousness is preserved, as are extra-ocular muscle movements.",

      "title": "Association Between REM Sleep Behavior Disorder and Cognitive Dysfunctions in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies",
      "abstract": "Background: Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is thought to be a prodromal symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). RBD is also thought to be involved in cognitive decline and dementia in PD. In PD, although the relationship between RBD and cognitive dysfunctions was confirmed by considerable studies, whether RBD was associated with distinct types of cognitive defects is worth of study. Objectives: This systematic review summarizes the evidence relating to cognitive dysfunction in PD patients with RBD (PD-RBD) and those without and explored their specificity to cognitive domains. Methods: A meta-analysis using random-effects model was performed for 16 different cognitive domains, including global cognitive function, memory (long-term verbal recall, long-term verbal recognition, long-term visual recall, short-term spatial recall, and short-term verbal recall), executive function (general, fluid reasoning, generativity, shifting, inhibition, and updating), language, processing speed/complex attention/working memory, visuospatial/constructional ability, and psychomotor ability. The cognitive difference between the groups of patients was measured as a standardized mean difference (SMD, Cohen d). PD-RBD patients were classified into Confirmed-RBD (definite diagnosis with polysomnography, PSG) and Probable-RBD (without PSG re-confirmation). In some domains, RBD patients could not be analyzed separately due to exiguity of primary studies; this analysis called such RBD patients \"Mixed-RBD\". Results: 39 studies with 6695 PD subjects were finally included. Confirmed-RBD patients showed worse performance than those without in global cognitive function, long-term verbal recall, long-term verbal recognition, generativity, inhibition, shifting, language and visuospatial/constructional ability; Probable-RBD, in global cognitive function and shifting; and Mixed-RBD, in long-term visual recall, short-term spatial recall, general executive function and processing speed/complex attention/working memory . Conclusion: This meta-analysis strongly suggests a relationship between RBD, Confirmed-RBD in particular, and cognitive dysfunctions in PD patients. Early and routine screening by sensitive and targeted cognitive tasks is necessary for all PD-RBD patients because it may offer the therapeutic time window before they evolve to irreversible dementia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Huntington’s disease (HD) is a progressive disease of the brain that causes movement abnormalities (especially chorea and dystonia), cognitive deterioration, and affective disturbances. Symptoms typically begin around age 40, with wide variation (Bell, 1934; Heathfield and McKenzie, 1971; Folstein et al., 1987). As in many other neurodegenerative disorders, early onset of HD is associated with more severe disease and a more rapid course. Onset of the disease in childhood is marked by akinesia, rigidity, severe intellectual impairment, and shorter survival (Merritt et al., 1969; Conneally, 1984; Bryois, 1989). Late-onset disease usually presents with severe chorea but milder cognitive impairment, and has a more gradual decline (Myers et al., 1985, 1991). Symptoms of HD progress relentlessly, with patients becoming severely demented, motorically dilapidated, unable to care for themselves, and eventually bedridden. There is no cure for the illness, and the only treatments currently available are either purely palliative or purely experimental. Death occurs an average of 15 to 17 years after disease onset (Folstein, 1989). Huntington’s disease causes untold suffering for those afflicted and their loved ones.",

According to The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, primary insomnia is a syndrome mainly composed of psychophysiological insomnia, paradoxical insomnia and idiopathic insomnia. Primary insomnia is difficulty initiating sleep (sleep onset insomnia), difficulty maintaining sleep (mid-sleep awakening, early morning awakening) or chronic non restorative sleep, which persist longer than three weeks despite having adequate opportunity for sleep and result in impaired daytime functioning. Primary insomnia is not explained by currently known psychiatric disorders, medical conditions, substance use disorders. Primary insomnia is a non-organic, unknown etiology, middle-aged female predominant sleep disturbance. Recent findings suggest the hyperarousal hypothesis of primary insomnia.

      "abstract": "Motion sickness is induced during passive locomotion in vehicles and is generated either by unfamihar bodily accelerations, to which the person has therefore not adapted, or by intersensory mismatch involving conflicting vestibular and visual stimuli (Dichgans and Brandt 1973, 1978; Benson 1977; Reason 1978; Brandt and Daroff 1980). According to the \"mismatch theory\"; (see also p. 3), spatial orientation and perception of movement are disturbed by a conflict between stimuli when the multisensory motion signals do not correspond to the expected pattern of sensory signals established from earlier experience with active locomotion. This may give rise to unpleasant illusions of movement with consequences of posture and the control of vehicles (Dichgans and Brandt 1978; Leibowitz et al. 1982) and to motion sickness as a result of summation. Thus, motion sickness is not a superfluous epiphenomenon of vestibular stimulation but — in a teleological sense — it represents a meaningful warning signal to withdraw the body from unusual stimulus situations which cannot be integrated with adequate dynamic spatial orientation. The first known reports on seasickness originate from Hippocrates. The major symptom of nausea is derived from the Greek word \"naus\" for ship. The general term \"motion sickness\" was coined by Irwin (1881). It stresses the phenomenological similarity of air-, sea-, car-, and space-sickness despite their different modes of provocation.",

NDE are responses to life-threatening crisis characterized by a combination of dissociation from the physical body, euphoria, and transcendental or mystical elements. Persons with NDE may have an arousal system predisposed to allowing intrusion of REM sleep elements during the transition between wakefulness and sleep.2 The arousal system is comprised of brainstem structures controlling or influencing sleep-wake states, alertness, and attention. REM intrusion manifests as the atonia of sleep paralysis (or cataplexy), as well as visual or auditory hallucinations. Although not considered REM intrusion, OBE and the REM state have an established relationship that is incompletely understood. In the state boundary disorder of narcolepsy, individuals often give accounts of OBE,3,4 which diminish after the narcolepsy is treated.4 In this study, we investigated if OBE in subjects with NDE could be regarded an arousal phenomenon by occurring during sleep transition or corresponding to REM intrusion.\n\nStructured interviews were conducted and REM intrusion measured in 55 subjects with NDE, and compared to age- and gender-matched controls as previously described.2 All gave informed consent as approved by the institutional review board.

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

These were characterized by moaning and autoaggressive behaviour, the ictal EEG showing generalized slow spike and wave complexes in the midst of several movement artifacts. At the end of each fit he fell back to REM sleep. Carbamazepine treatment completely resolved his symptoms, with full normalization of EEG activity.",

The important aspects of sleep are Rapid Eye movement (REM) sleep, Non- Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep and Dreaming. This review mentions the fundamental processes of sleep, the causes of sleep deprivation and dreaming. The physiological changes that occur through sleep are discussed along with medications aids in sleeping and the substances that affect or change the sleep pattern. The common factors associated with sleeplessness are emotional or mental tension, anxiety, depression, work problems, and an unsatisfactory sex life. Sleep medicine as a recent branch of medicine is reviewed as well as the use of Plant Medicine to deal with sleep disorders. Common substances used to induce sleep are hypnotic sedatives, and over the counter medications such as Benadryl and Nyquil. Alcohol is also used as a sleep aid. Herbal medicines are also commonly used as sleep aids. How sleep medication affects then biological pathways of man is emphasized (The Biochemistry of Sleep). Two hypothetical enzymes are proposed for the Biochemical Pathway starting with tryptophan and terminating in melatonin, a known sleep hormone. The two hypothetical enzymes proposed are 5-hydroxytryptophan synthetase and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase. The major problems associated with insufficient in the society is explained as well as the causes of sleep deprivation in this modern civilization. Some of the behavioral changes in the society that have contributed to sleep problems are shift work, increased work hours and extensive socialization.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a type of movement disorder that affects the ability to perform daily activities. It is considered that 1 million people in the U.S. and more than 10 million people worldwide live with PD. It is a chronic and progressive disease, so symptoms worsen over the time. Patients experience motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness and slow motion, and non-motor symptoms such as sleep problems, constipation, anxiety, depression and fatigue. Dopaminergic drugs are critical for treating motor symptoms in PD. Levodopa (L-DOPA) is the \"gold standard\" medication for the control of motor symptoms. Because of the progression of the disease, the effectiveness of oral L-DOPA decreases over time and motor fluctuations such as \"delayed ON\", \"no ON\" and unpredictable \"ON-OFF\" periods appear. These motor fluctuations affect the quality of life of the patient at a high rate and the patient has problems in fulfilling his daily morning routines. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems, as the common non-motor symptom, are the most important cause of motor fluctuations that occur because of inadequate oral treatment with the progression of PD. When oral treatments are not sufficient, non-oral treatments that are not affected by GI problems are required. In this review, the treatment strategies, developed and approved non-oral drug delivery systems in the early and advanced stages of PD are emphasized.",

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep–Wake Disorders I",
      "abstract": "Abstract Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is debilitating and the most common circadian rhythm disorder. It is defined as having a sleep pattern delayed by at least 2–3 hours from conventional timing, with great difficulty sleeping at conventional sleep times despite the frequent desire to do so. It is assumed to be caused by a delay of the endogenous circadian rhythm. Although it has its own diagnostic criteria, it lies on a continuum spanning from intermediate to moderate and extreme evening chronotypes to DSWPD and to non-24-hour phase disorder. This continuum is mainly driven by endogenous circadian period length varying from just over 24 hours to an extreme of 25 hours. Behavioral, psychological, and societal variables also contribute to the difficulty adhering to conventional sleep times. The recent novel findings of many DSWPD patients who do not have a substantial circadian rhythm delay suggest the contribution of non-circadian factors to the intransigence of a late timed sleep period; there is considerable evidence of the association of mental and physical health risks with the apparent inability to synchronize with the earth’s 24-hour period of rotation. Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is defined as having a sleep pattern timed earlier than desired or conventional. Attempts to delay bedtime to a more conventional time are difficult and result in reduced total sleep time since wake times remain early. This condition is relatively rare, affecting 0.0%–0.33% of the population, and infrequently presents for treatment.",

They are able to breathe spontaneously, and they retain their gag, cough, sucking, and swallowing reflexes. Sleep-wake cycles are preserved, and so are the hypothalamic and brain stem autonomic responses. They are incontinent of urine and faeces, but they may retain their cranial nerve, spinal, and primitive reflexes. Inconsistent non-purposive movements occur, notably facial grimacing and chewing; they make sounds; and they may show inconsistent auditory and oculomotor orienting reflexes to peripheral sounds or movement. The diagnosis of a vegetative state is not tenable if there is any degree of voluntary movement, sustained visual pursuit, consistent and reproducible visual fixation, or response to threatening gestures.2 3\n\nThe condition is distinct from coma, in which patients have their eyes closed and lack sleep-wake cycles, and from the “locked-in” syndrome, in which patients are aware of themselves and their environment but have lost motor function and speech, communication being achieved by eye movement or blinks.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sleep‐related complaints affect 50–80% of patients on dialysis. Sleep disorders impair quality of life significantly. Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disruption has a profound impact both on an individual and on a societal level. The etiology of sleep disorders is often multifactorial: biologicsocialand psychological factors play a role. This is especially true for insomniawhich is the most common sleep disorder in different populationsincluding patients on dialysis. Biochemical and metabolic changeslifestyle factorsdepressionanxietyand other underlying sleep disorders can all have an effect on the development and persistence of sleep disruptionleading to chronic insomnia. Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleepor having nonrestorative sleep. It is also associated with daytime consequencessuch as sleepiness and fatigueand impaired daytime functioning. In most casesthe diagnosis of insomnia is based on the patient's historybut in some patients objective assessment of sleep pattern may be necessary. Optimally the treatment of insomnia involves the combination of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. In some cases acute insomnia resolves spontaneouslybut if left untreatedit may lead to chronic sleep problems. The treatment of chronic insomnia is often challenging. There are only a few studies specifically addressing the management of this sleep disorder in patients with chronic renal disease. Considering the polypharmacy and altered metabolism in this patient populationtreatment trials are clearly needed. This article reviews the diagnosis of sleep disorders with a focus on insomnia in patients on dialysis.",

      "title": "Light Treatment for Sleep Disorders: Consensus Report",
      "abstract": "Advanced and delayed sleep phase disorders, and the hypersomnia that can accompany winter depression, have been treated successfully by appropriately timed artificial bright light exposure. Under entrainment to the 24-h day-night cycle, the sleep-wake pattern may assume various phase relationships to the circadian pacemaker, as indexed, for example, by abnormally long or short intervals between the onset of melatonin production or the core body temperature minimum and wake-up time. Advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome have been variously ascribed to abnormal intrinsic circadian periodicity, deficiency of the entrainment mechanism, or—most simply—patterns of daily light exposure insufficient for adequate phase resetting. The timing of sleep is influenced by underlying circadian phase, but psychosocial constraints also play a major role. Exposure to light early or late in the subjective night has been used therapeutically to produce corrective phase delays or advances, respectively, in both the sleep pattern and circadian rhythms. Supplemental light exposure in fall and winter can reduce the hypersomnia of winter depression, although the therapeutic effect may be less dependent on timing.",

      "title": "Commentary: A Quest for a Novel Peripheral Biomarker for Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a disabling disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep manifestations including cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions), sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep-onset REM (SOREM) periods 1. It is generally admitted that narcolepsy with cataplexy is caused by the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons 2. Patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy have been shown to lack hypocretin-1 in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This allows distinguishing narcolepsy with cataplexy from other forms of central hypersomnia, that is, narcolepsy without cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia, which show normal CSF hypocretin-1 level 3 and is sufficient to define narcolepsy type 1 based on the last classification (ICSD-3). However, because of a possible continuum in terms of clinical manifestations and physiopathological mechanisms between these sleep disorders 4, 5, differential diagnosis remains often tricky and difficult. Developing an easy, reliable, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tool has always been a major requirement in sleep medicine. Since the nineties, genotyping for HLA DR2 is extensively used as an index to confirm diagnosis because 85–95% of patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy carry the DQB1*0602 haplotype. However, it is unspecific to narcolepsy with cataplexy because it is also found in 20% of the general population. A striking decrease in CSF hypocretin-1 has been noted in patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy with a high (94%) positive predictive value for the diagnosis 3. Unfortunately, such measurements require invasive lumbar puncture and it is of no use for differentiating narcolepsy without cataplexy from idiopathic or other hypersomnia. A few studies measured plasmatic hypocretin-1 levels, but the reliability of this approach remains a matter of debate. Finally, other tryouts have also been attempted without clear success 6, 7. In a recent letter to the editor of CNS Neurosci Therap., Chen and colleagues 8 using HPLC and mass spectrometry have analyzed serum proteins in 35 patients with narcolepsy (25 with cataplexy), compared with 49 patients with other sleep disorders and 35 healthy controls. They found a protein fragment peak in 65.7% of patients with narcolepsy, 72% when considering patients with cataplexy only. The authors further sequenced the extracted protein fragment and identified it as RBM4/Lark protein 8. This is clearly an interesting attempt and original observation, worth to be pursued in further investigations in order to assess whether such RBM4/Lark protein may constitute a specific marker of narcolepsy and therefore a useful diagnostic tool. On the one hand, the protein fragment peak was also seen in 15% of other patients with sleep disorder and 16% of healthy controls 8. Quantitative analysis on patients with narcolepsy and the two control groups is therefore necessary to determine to which extent the RBM4/Lark protein could be specific to narcolepsy. On the other hand, only three patients with idiopathic hypersomnia and 10 with narcolepsy without cataplexy were included in this study 8. A much larger group size of patients in a matched case–control study is required to confirm whether or not the RBM4/Lark protein could serve as marker to differentiate narcolepsy from other forms of hypersomnia. In addition, the authors also report that the protein peak was not correlated with excessive daytime sleepiness assessed using Epworth scale, but was correlated positively with cataplexy and negatively with sleep latency and the number of SOREM during the multiple sleep latency tests 8. If one considers short sleep latency as an index of sleepiness, and SOREM and cataplexy as signs of REM sleep dysregulation, the significance of these correlations with narcoleptic phenotypes is of interest although it remains to be determined. Finally, detection, quantification, and other further studies of the RBM4/Lark protein in currently available narcoleptic animal models, such as those in murine, will certainly promote its characterization as marker of narcolepsy. Another major question raised from this study is the biological significance of the presence of such a Lark protein in the serum of patients with narcolepsy. Is it a consequence of the pathology in the CNS or periphery or is it a reflection of adaptive mechanisms? Unfortunately, the functional links between sleep and Lark protein are currently poorly understood. RBM4/Lark is an evolutionary conserved RNA-binding protein involved in pleiotropic functions such as stress, immune responses, and development 9. It controls the expression of a large number of genes, including those involved in the circadian clock 10. Increased expression of RBM4/Lark lengthens the circadian period in fly and mammalian cells 10, 11. The RBM4/Lark protein expression varies according to the molecular clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus 10, the CNS master clock modulated by hypocretinergic inputs. RBM4/Lark transcripts are listed among the genes that are regulated in a circadian manner 12. While circadian distribution of REM sleep is impaired in narcoleptic mice 13, few studies in patients with narcolepsy have focused on their circadian rhythms. In view of their excessive daytime sleepiness, decreased physical activity, and nocturnal sleep fragmentation, it is not to be excluded that their day/night balance is somehow affected. Investigations on the circadian rhythms and their links with the RBM4/Lark protein in patients with narcolepsy are needed to examine such a hypothesis. The RBM4/Lark protein therefore not only appears to be a molecule of interest with ubiquitous expression and broad array of functions, but also clearly associated with narcolepsy and circadian rhythms. Whether or not it constitutes a biomarker of narcolepsy requires further investigation, but the study of Chen et al. 8 in consistence with quite many recent studies shows that easily accessible body fluids such as blood, saliva, and urine are likely to provide interesting avenues for identification of biomarkers of sleep disorders, given the major impact of sleep disruption on the constituents of these fluids (e.g., 14, 15). This is critical to fulfill the need for new diagnostic tools in sleep medicine.",

      "abstract": "textabstractThe term migraine stems from hemicrania, describing a periodic disorder consisting of\nparoxysmal unilateral headache, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia and/or\nphonophobia. Hemicrania was later changed to Latin words - hemigranea and migranea;\neventually the French cognate, migraine, gained acceptance in the eighteenth century and has\nprevailed ever since. A working definition of migraine is benign recurring headache and/or\nneurological dysfunction usually attended by pain-free interludes and often provoked by\nstereotyped stimuli (1). Migraine may be triggered by certain factors (red wine, menses, hunger,\nlack of sleep, glare, perfumes, periods of let down) and relieved by others (sleep, pregnancy).\nPremonitory symptoms occur hours to a day or two before a migraine attack with or without\naura. Migraine is more common in females, with a hereditary predisposition towards attacks and\nthe cranial circulatory phenomenon appears to be secondary to a primary central nervous system\n(CNS) disorder.\nThe Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS)\npublished the classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders in 1988 (Table 1.1) (2).\nThe terms “common migraine” and “classical migraine” have been replaced by “migraine\nwithout aura” and “migraine with aura”, respectively. These operational criteria have been\nvalidated by different approaches and have enabled us to distinguish different headache entities\nin a reliable manner (3-6). In recent years, the IHS criteria have been used world-wide in several\nmulticentre double-blind drug trials, which have shown a reasonably consistent response rate to\ntriptans (7), reflecting a consensus in the defined migraine group. In a recent MAZE survey, the\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire has been used to assess the impact\nof migraine on work, home and social lives. MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of\nmigraine; >50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe\ndisability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently\neffective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy (8). These results show\nthat migraine patients world-wide are still not receiving adequate treatment and a significant\nunmet need in migraine care still remains.",

      "title": "Heart rate variability in multiple cerebrospinal sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic system autoimmune disease causing, on the basis of dissemination of demyelinisation focuses in CNS region, functional neurological deficit. The course is typically episodical, with acute attacks of demyelinisation occurring in irregular intervals and bringing about often increasing motor deficit and loss of sensoric functions (Havrdova, 2002). Dysfunctions of autonomic nervous system (ANS) are quite a frequent phenomenon in MS. They are characterized particularly by dysfunctions of urinary bladder, disorders of sexual and sudomotoric functions (Betts et al., 1994; Drory et al., 1995; elie et al., 1995). Autonomic dysfunctions affecting the cardiovascular system regulation, however, are also documented more and more frequently (e.g. Senaratne et al., 1984; nordenbo et al., 1989; Anema et al., 1991; Frontoni et al., 1993, 1996; Flachenecker et al., 1999; Acevedo et al., 2000; gunal et al., 2002; etc.). incidence of these dysfunctions varies as to frequency, importance of abnormities and autonomic reflex tests being used (Cartlige, 1972; pentland, ewing, 1987). Alterations of cardiovascular system parameters were demonstrated in MS patients both at rest and during physical load when AnS is responsible for compensation of hemodynamical cardiovascular response to physical stress. Autonomic dysfunctions can lead therefore to limitation of physical load capacity and can contribute to the fatigue of MS patients that has not yet been explained (Ziaber et al., 1997; Olindo et al., 2002; Konecný et al., 2007). It turns out that also subclinical manifestations of autonomic dysfunctions of cardiovascular regulation can become an unidentified risk factor with regard to farmacological and rehabilitation therapy of these patients. cardiovascular autonomic dysfunctions show also trend towards accentuation of clinical manifestations in consideration of the characteristic progression of MS disease. Diagnostics of autonomic dysfunctions, presenting themselves particularly on subclinical level, can be therefore a key element of preventive and curative strategy in the complex care of patients with this disease. Cardiovascular autonomic functions in MS are most frequently monitored by means of conventional reflex tests (Thomaides et al., 1993; Nasseri et al., 1998; Acevedo et al., 2000). These methods are limited mainly by difficult interpretation and differentiation of the sympathetic or parasympathetic component of cardiovascular regulation by autonomic nervous system. Heart rate variability (HRv) represents adaptation oscillation of heart rate values around its centre value. Distribution of these oscillations in specific frequency bands, from 0,02 Hz up to 0,50 Hz, expresses different mechanisms of acting on autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability (SAHRV) offers a quick and non-invasive evaluation of the function of this regulation (Kautzner, Malik, 1998; Konecný et al., 2007; Pospisil et al., 2004).",

The oculomotor system most often is found being reversible or irreversible damaged by chronic drug effects especially from barbiturates, psychopharmacologic drugs, anticonvulsives and some antiarrhythmics, whereas the vestibular organs and their pathways usually remain unaffected except from ototoxic drugs.

      "title": "Mechanistic basis of adverse drugreactions: the perils of inappropriate dose schedules",
      "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have long been recognised as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. They account for a substantial number of clinical consultations, hospital admissions and extended duration of in-patient stay as well as mortality. By far the most common ADRs are the concentration-dependent pharmacological reactions, the majority of which ought to be preventable. As a result of high concentrations of the parent drug and/or its metabolite(s), there is an augmentation of primary pharmacological activity and/or appearance of new and undesirable secondary pharmacological activity. Typically, these high concentrations result from administration of high doses in an attempt to maximise efficacy and/or modulation of the pharmacokinetics of a drug by either genetic or non-genetic factors. High plasma concentrations of parent drug may result from inherited impairment or drug-induced inhibition of its pharmacokinetic disposition. Conversely, inherited overcapacity or drug-induced induction of the metabolism of a drug may result in low concentrations of parent drug and frequently, rapid accumulation of its metabolites. Environmental, dietary and phytochemical factors may also influence the activity of drug metabolising enzymes. As with inherited polymorphisms of acetylation and cytochrome P450-based drug metabolising enzymes, polymorphisms of other conjugation reactions, such as glucuronidation, increasingly appear to be associated with drug toxicity. Diseases of organs involved in elimination of a drug also alter its pharmacokinetics, plasma concentration and, therefore, the profile of its concentration-dependent ADRs. Inherited mutations, concurrently administered drugs or presence of certain diseases may also alter the sensitivity of some pharmacological targets, accounting for a substantial number of ADRs and interactions. When there is enhanced pharmacodynamic sensitivity, plasma drug concentrations that are apparently within the normal 'non-toxic' range give rise to ADRs. Recent advances have also provided important insights into the wider scope of drug–drug interactions. Interactions that occur at P-glycoproteins, drug transporters and efflux pumps, at various transmembrane interfaces such as the gastrointestinal wall, renal tubules, hepatobiliary border and blood–brain barrier, are beginning to explain many non-metabolic interactions. These alter the systemic exposure to drugs and have so far, begun to explain unexpected neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. The function of these transporters is also genetically modulated. These advances, together with continued increased awareness and education of prescribers and pharmacists, offer great opportunities for substantially minimising concentration-related ADRs.",

Relevant sind hier vor allem fronto-parietale Verbindungen sowie Verbindungen zwischen Thalamus und primar sowie sekundar motorischen Kortexarealen. Mittels nicht-invasiver Hirnstimulationsmethoden lassen sich diese motorische Netzwerke prinzipiell modulieren. Erste Ergebnisse einer rTMS Studie weisen darauf hin, dass insbesondere inhibitorische Stimulation des supplementar-motorischen Areals uber 3 Wochen die psychmotorische Verlangsamung zu verbessern vermag.

For example, sleep apnea in adults affects men more than women, is more prevalent in the obese, and presents with symptoms of snoring and excessive somnolence. In preadolescent children, sleep apnea affects both sexes equally, is more closely correlated with adenotonsillar enlargement than obesity, and may be more likely to present with daytime inattention and learning problems rather than frank somnolence. Likewise, the insomnia and associated bedtime struggles of a 3-year-old bear little resemblance to the insomnia of a mature adult apart from the fact that both individuals are unable to easily fall asleep. Sleep disorders in children are reviewed with particular focus on age-related changes in normal sleep and on sleep disorders that primarily or exclusively affect children. Pediatric aspects of other sleep disorders will be reviewed in more limited detail, with examination of how age, developmental level, and comorbid conditions cause clinical presentation and treatment to differ from that of adults.",

The canonical phenotype of the Parkinson’s disease Dementia (PD-D) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes deficit of attention, executive and visuospatial functions, and presents often with apathy, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness, or sleep disorders. However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing the cognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition, recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it more and more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathology may support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is very likely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow common patterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share a prion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

      "title": "Sleep-wake abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis",
      "abstract": "A considerable proportion of patients with cirrhosis exhibit insomnia, delayed sleep habits, and excessive daytime sleepiness. These have been variously attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and impaired hepatic melatonin metabolism, but the understanding of their pathophysiology remains limited and their treatment problematic. Sleep is regulated by the interaction of a homeostatic and a circadian process. The homeostatic process determines sleep propensity in relation to sleep-wake history, thus the need to sleep increases with the duration of the waking period. The circadian process, which is marked by the 24-hour rhythm of the hormone melatonin, is responsible for the alternation of high/low sleep propensity in relation to dark/light cues. Circadian sleep regulation has been studied in some depth in patients with cirrhosis, who show delays in the 24-hour melatonin rhythm, most likely in relation to reduced sensitivity to light cues. However, while melatonin abnormalities are associated with delayed sleep habits, they do not seem to offer a comprehensive explanation to the insomnia exhibited by these patients. Fewer data are available on homeostatic sleep control: it has been recently hypothesized that patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy might be unable, due to excessive daytime sleepiness, to accumulate the need/ability to produce restorative sleep. This review will describe in some detail the features of sleep-wake disturbances in patients with cirrhosis, their mutual relationships, and those, if any, with hepatic failure/hepatic encephalopathy. A separate section will cover the available information on their pathophysiology. Finally, etiological treatment will be briefly discussed.",

Najczęściej tę chorobę diagnozuje się u młodych dorosłych, w Polsce choruje na nią około 45 tysięcy osób. Zaburzenia snu są powszechne wśród chorych na SM, choć często pomijane w codziennej praktyce klinicznej. W populacji pacjentów z SM rozpoznaje się bezsenność, zaburzenia okołodobowego rytmu snu i czuwania, zaburzenia ruchowe podczas snu, zaburzenia oddychania związane ze snem, zaburzenia zachowania podczas snu REM oraz narkolepsję. W SM podłoże zaburzeń snu jest wieloczynnikowe: wpływ mają czynniki immunologiczne, rodzaj stosowanej terapii modyfikującej przebieg choroby, obecność specyficznych zmian demielinizacyjnych w OUN. Zaburzenia snu mogą być również wtórne do częstych objawów SM, takich jak zmęczenie, nykturia, ból, spastyczność oraz zaburzeń depresyjno - lękowych. W przypadku wyżej wymienionych objawów wskazana jest analiza ich przyczyn i właściwe leczenie. Lekarze powinni być świadomi współistnienia zaburzeń snu u chorych na SM, gdyż mają wpływ na jakość życia, mogą zaostrzać przebieg choroby i powodować pogorszenie funkcji poznawczych.

      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Neurodynamic state fluctuations in the epileptic brain Catherine Stamoulis1* and Bernard S. Chang2 1 Children's Hospital Boston, United States 2 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, United States RATIONALE: Dynamically, the brain is never at rest. In the absence of task-induced neuromodulations and behavior- and/or stimulus-related state transitions, neural dynamics may fluctuate transiently and spontaneously between resting states, associated with arousal, self-reflection, emotion, or memory retrieval, among other processes. These may be represent short-term, but stable states, and may involve specific networks, as as the Default Mode Network (DMN), and distinct frequency ranges. Brain dynamics are also modulated by physiological states at longer temporal scales, such as sleep. Furthermore, abnormal neuronal networks dynamics may also be associated with distinct, pathological states and related transitions. For example, neurodynamic fluctuations and local and/or global network transitions to unstable states may be mechanisms of seizure initiation in patients with epilepsy. To date, these mechanisms remain only partially understood, which has limited the development of efficient treatments for medically intractable seizures. METHODS: We investigated the spatio-temporal variation and stability of dynamic states encoded in non-invasive, continuous (recorded over multiple days) electroencephalograms (EEGs), from 5 patients with multiple focal seizures of temporal origin. EEGs were analyzed in the range 1-250 Hz. We hypothesized that latent dynamic state fluctuations are encoded in these recordings, but are not directly measurable. We, therefore, developed a dynamic non-linear state-space dynamic model and estimated state fluctuations from i) scalp EEGs covering the entire brain, and ii) subsets of signals that are part of the DMN. In this preliminary study, we investigated and characterized the stability of estimated states through a simple analysis of the time-dependent eigenvalues of the state-space matrix. RESULTS: Dynamic state fluctuations were identified at distinct spatio-temporal scales and frequency ranges. In particular, spatially global transitions to distinct, yet stable states, not associated with measurable changes in any particular physiological state, e.g., sleep, were estimated at least 45 min prior to clinical seizure onset in all patients (and on average 70 min prior to ictal onset in two patients), at frequencies <=12 Hz. Furthermore, transitions of shorter duration, from a stable to an unstable state were estimated at higher frequencies (typically 30-50 Hz) on average 5-12 min prior to seizure onset, and at different rates. Rapid transient fluctuations to unstable states were specifically estimated from EEGs covering temporal regions and slower transitions were estimated in frontal channels and occipital channels. Dynamic instability extended into the ictal interval. On average 20-40 s into that interval, transitions to one or multiple states (depending on the patient) were estimated, which, in turn, extended into the post-ictal interval. Finally, the brain returned to a dynamic state of the same type of stability as estimated at baseline on average 70-90 min following seizure termination. No specific differences in state variation and stability were observed in elements of the DMN. CONCLUSION: There preliminary results suggest dynamic state fluctuations and possibly pathological transitions to both stable and unstable states at different frequencies, and different rates, may represent at least one mechanism of neural instability that may trigger seizure initiation in the epileptic brain. Based on the type of their (in)stability, these fluctuations appear to be distinct from normal resting state variations encoded in normal baseline EEGs.

      "title": "Premenstruális szindróma és premenstruális dysphoriás zavar.",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age worldwide, along with painful menstruation and genital inflammation. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. A severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which requires psychiatric management. The onset and severity of PMS with multifactorial pathogenesis is triggered by psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms that are influenced by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, altering the neurotransmitter or neuropathway functions of the brain, e.g., the serotoninergic system. The psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms contribute to the development of physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms, which are also influenced by the combined presence of other physiological (genetical background, metabolic and chronic inflammatory processes, chronobiological and circadian disorders) and psychological stressors and their interaction.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája világszerte a fájdalmas menstruáció és a nemi szervi gyulladások mellett. A fizikai, mentális és magatartásbeli tünetek a ciklus lutealis fázisában jelentkeznek visszatérően, és életminőség-romlást okoznak, befolyásolva a páciens szociális, munkahelyi és családi kapcsolatait. A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS súlyos formája a pszichiátriában diagnosztizált és kezelt premenstruális dysphoriás zavar (PMDD). A multifaktoriális kóreredetű PMS megjelenését és súlyosságát a hypothalamus–hypophysis–ovarium tengely ciklikus működésének hatására kialakuló pszichoneuroendokrin mechanizmusok indítják el, megváltoztatva az agy neurotranszmitter- vagy neuropeptid-funkcióit, például a szerotoninerg rendszer működését. A pszichoneuroendokrin mechanizmusok hozzájárulnak a fizikai, a pszichológiai és a viselkedésbeli tünetek kialakulásához, melyeket befolyásol még az egyéb fiziológiai (például genetikai háttér, metabolikus és krónikus gyulladásos folyamatok, kronobiológiai és cirkadián működészavarok), illetve pszichikai stresszorok együttes jelenléte, illetve azok egymásra való kölcsönhatása is.

      "abstract": "Disturbances in nocturnal sleep and their consequences during waking in Parkinson disease (PD) were recognized in 1817 by James Parkinson, who described sleep problems in his case series as follows: “His attendants observed, that of late the trembling would sometimes begin in his sleep, and increase until it awakened him: when he always was in a state of agitation and alarm.” Sleep disturbance in PD is complex, with a prevalence of up to 98%, and has been shown to be a key determinant of quality of life. Sleep disturbances in PD are heterogeneous, ranging from insomnia to drug-induced sleep disorders, and now can be assessed by simple validated bedside tools such as the Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS). Also, sleep, contrary to previous perceptions, can be disordered not just in advanced PD, but also in the pre-motor as well as the untreated states.",

Functional coma is an extremely rare disorder with only 21 described cases in the literature. The disease is linked to a conversion disorder or a dissociative disorder and is predominantly found in females. Predisposing factors are a history of sexual or physical abuse, psychiatric disorders, previous episodes of functional coma, and recent surgery with general anesthesia. Several clinical signs are suggestive for the diagnosis, however none of them is sufficiently sensitive or specific. Therefore, functional coma remains an exclusion diagnosis. Vital signs must be normal, just as a routine blood examination, an electroencephalogram and imaging of the central nervous system. The most important differential diagnosis are catatonia, factitious disorder, and malingering. Spontaneous recovery can be expected after a duration of about 45 minutes to 4 days.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of death in most developed countries and some developing countries including South Korea. It is well known that stroke has is related in some way with several sleep disorders. At first, the onset time of stroke varies according to circadian rhythm. Early morning is the most prevalent time and late evening the least. The changes of blood pressure, catecholamine level, plasminogen activity and aggregation of platelet during sleep have been suggested as possible mechanisms. Sleep apnea (SA), a representative disorder in the field of sleep medicine, is found in more than 70% of acute stroke patients compared to 2-5% of the general population. Various sleep related breathing disorders occur after stroke and snoring is a distinct risk factor for stroke. So the relationship between stroke and SA is obvious, but the cause and effect are still not clearly known. Also, stroke may cause many sleep related problems such as insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia and changes in sleep architecture. Patients, family members and even medical personnel often ignore stroke-related sleep problems, being concerned only about the stroke itself. The clinical impacts of sleep problems in stroke patients may be significant not only in terms of quality of life but also as a risk factor or prognostic factor for stroke. More attention should be paid to the sleep problems of stroke patients.",

Disorders of speech movements may be manifest as the only problem in communication or they may occur with impairments in language function. For this reason, and as a matter of scientific and clinical convenience, speech and language typically are considered to be products of distinct nervous system operations. On the one hand, speech can be viewed as the process whereby controlled movements are transformed into sound, thus providing the medium through which semantically significant messages are transmitted. By contrast, language is an organized system of consistent abstract symbols that provides the meaning-based format for speech.",

Sleeping is mandatory for the physical, emotional and mental health of children and adults. Sleep related problems are one of the most frequent reason parents ask for a pediatrician’s help. Although parents are more concerned about the child’s sleep than other processes of a child’s development, in general they do not know enough about sleep hygiene and healthy sleeping habits. Even though the prevalence of sleep disorders in children is high, it is often overlooked by healthcare professionals. From around the world we receive data how adolescents do not get enough restful sleep, leading to cognitive, social and health problems. Behavioral sleep disorders are directly related to sleep hygiene which treatment requires affect changes in behavior as well as providing optimal environmental conditions.

The most common pathologic brain changes and the histological hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy's bodies in the substantia nigra. Dysphagia symptoms in PD include difficulty with lingual motility, reduced initiation of swallow, difficulty with bolus formation, delayed pharyngeal response, and decreased pharyngeal contraction. Treatment for PD is focused on restoring (neuro-restorative) or preventing (neuroprotection) progressive nerve cell degeneration. Symptoms of MS involve both motor and sensory tracts, depending on the area in the central nervous system (CNS) affected. The diagnosis of MS is based upon patient interview, clinical examination, radiographic and supplementary laboratory tests such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture. Seizures may result from hypoxia (lack of oxygen), birth injury to the brain, fever, alcohol intoxication/ withdrawal, brain tumors, head trauma, or stroke.",

A careful case history including psychosocial aspects and a thorough physical examination are essential for an efficient diagnostic evaluation. Tests of pulmonary function not only in the awake patient at rest, but also during sleep or adequate physical exercise can reveal the causes of impaired physical performance and fatigue related to lung diseases.",

This is at variance with results of training and rehabilitation during which many thus affected subjects become independent, which is essential for their social integration. Despite this they have to experience sociopsychological attitudes which are prejudices with a typical stereotype which ignore the unique structure of everybody's potential who lost eyesight. The source of prejudices is general lack of information of people as regards actual sequelae of loss of eyesight and the emotional reaction of people with normal eyesight. A certain part is also played by tradition which does not take into account results of modern care of thus affected subjects. Prejudices cause in subjects with severely affected eyesight and in blind persons mental stress and render their actual social integration (employment, partnership etc.) more difficult. The solution is to train resistance against prejudices in thus affected subjects and to intensify health education on the given problem.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a neurological disease characterized by loss of normal REM motor inhibition and subsequent dream enactment. RBD is clinically relevant because it predicts neurodegenerative disease onset (e.g., Parkinson's disease) and is clinically problematic because it disrupts sleep and results in patient injuries and hospitalization. Even though the cause of RBD is unknown, multiple lines of evidence indicate that abnormal inhibitory transmission underlies the disorder. Here, we show that transgenic mice with deficient glycine and GABA transmission have a behavioral, motor, and sleep phenotype that recapitulates the cardinal features of RBD. Specifically, we show that mice with impaired glycine and GABA A receptor function exhibit REM motor behaviors, non-REM muscle twitches, sleep disruption, and EEG slowing—the defining disease features. Importantly, the RBD phenotype is rescued by drugs (e.g., clonazepam and melatonin) that are routinely used to treat human disease symptoms. Our findings are the first to identify a potential mechanism for RBD—we show that deficits in glycine- and GABA A -mediated inhibition trigger the full spectrum of RBD symptoms. We propose that these mice are a useful resource for investigating in vivo disease mechanisms and developing potential therapeutics for RBD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is not a unitary event. Identification of specific transition into sleep is often problematic. Sleep onset can be correlated with behavioral and biological changes that occur over a short period of time. However, behaviors typically associated with transitional sleep seen in adults (e.g., eye lids closed, recumbence, quiescence) are often paradoxical during childhood. Behavioral changes also consist of modulation in responsiveness to auditory and visual stimuli, decrease in the ability to perform and complete simple tasks, motor restlessness, mood changes, impulsivity, and varying degrees of attention problems. Although biological changes in electrocardiography (EEG) activity commonly associated with transitional sleep may be recorded, they are typically perceived by the child as sleepiness.1",

      "title": "Functional neuroimaging: the adaptive mechanisms in migraine",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by a primary brain dysfunction subtended by an episodic activation and sensitization of the trigemino-vascular pain pathway. Although migraine attacks are clinically welldefined, the underlying pathophysiology of the more complex migraine scenario is largely unknown. Functional brain changes, that occur because of repeated migraine attacks, may be explained through a maladaptive feedforward allostatic cascade model. The fundamental assumption is that “the brain is a central organ of stress” [1], able to detect stressful or potentially stressful situations and react in form of behavioural and/or physiologic responses. These brain responses, mediated by the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, could be either adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, allostasis is the ability to protect the body through adaptation [2]. Contrariwise, the allostatic load and overload, resulting from repeated stress and/or allostasis [3], refers to the wear and tear on the systems that normally support adaptation. Compelling evidence suggests that the brain of migraine patients is significantly different from healthy controls. Some of these differences are related to abnormal cortical activity during painful stimulations, suggesting an “adaptive” response observed in the course of moderate or high noxious trigeminal stimulations. Conversely, other differences relate to abnormality in responses that should be adaptive but become impaired or maladaptive, such as altered brainstem processing. More recently, a decreased functional connectivity was demonstrated within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) in patients with migraine without and with aura in the absence of clinically relevant executive deficits. FPN represents the neural substrate of executive functions and FPN functional abnormalities might be a part of a complex cascade that terminates in a migraine attack. Specifically, FPN functional connectivity changes could underlie a defective executive functioning in which high-demanding conditions cannot be correctly processed and solved by patients with migraine, escalating the brain adaptive response, likely resulting in a risk factor for headache attacks. In conclusion, we believe that in migraine an internal state of dysregulation creates an allostatic load with maladaptive consequences on brain, behaviour, physiological regulation and systemic physiology that progress in a feedforward cascade. Thus, we suggest that migraine should be considered a brain disease and not simply a recurrent acute pain syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Obsessions (e.g. usually associated with blasphemous thoughts) dominate the psyche of those afflicted with OCD until relief comes with a connected compulsive activity (i.e., another thought process, or action). OCD is disabling as to the time and mental energy it consumes. The disorder is characterized by repeated hand washing (the “Pontius Pilot Syndrome”), checking, and ordering. In some instances, these symptoms of OCD can have positive overtones and make a more productive and exacting worker. For example, dentist with OCD probably does more accurate restorations due to a “checker” inclination. Professions depending on industriousness and problem-solving like physician or scientist are custom-made for those with OCD. However, severe observable symptomology and often a dehabilitating decrease in functionality usually occur in those with the disorder. Nonetheless, those afflicted with OCD are quite skilled at hiding their symptoms from others; often including their employer or spouse. In addition, those with OCD usually have one or more depressive episodes or must also deal with chronic depression.

The subset of women with vasomotor symptoms has lower sleep efficiency, more sleep complaints, and higher risk of insomnia and depression. Subjective sleep quality may be poor even when the objective sleep quality is normal. Menopausal sleep disruption can aggravate other pre-existing sleep disorders including the restless legs syndrome (RLS) or circadian disorders. Co-morbidities without direct link with menopause as well as stressful changes in social environment coinciding with menopause should not be overlooked when exploring the etiology of insomnia in middle-aged women.",

It is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability (ID) and autism. This review focuses on neuropsychiatric disorders frequently experienced by premutation carriers with 55 to 200 CGG repeats and the pathophysiology involves elevated FMR1 mRNA levels, which is different from the absence or deficiency of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) seen in FXS. Neuropsychiatric disorders are the most common problems associated with the premutation, and they affect approximately 50% of individuals with 55 to 200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Neuropsychiatric disorders in children with the premutation include anxiety, ADHD, social deficits, or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In adults with the premutation, anxiety and depression are the most common problems, although obsessive compulsive disorder, ADHD, and substance abuse are also common. These problems are often exacerbated by chronic fatigue, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, autoimmune disorders and sleep problems, which are also associated with the premutation. Here we review the clinical studies, neuropathology and molecular underpinnings of RNA toxicity associated with the premutation. We also propose the name Fragile X-associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FXAND) in an effort to promote research and the use of fragile X DNA testing to enhance recognition and treatment for these disorders.",

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

      "title": "Resolution of Sleep Paralysis by Weak Electromagnetic Fields in a Patient with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis refers to episodes of inability to move during the onset of sleep or more commonly upon awakening. Patients often describe the sensation of struggling to move and may experience simultaneous frightening vivid hallucinations and dreams. Sleep paralysis and other manifestations of dissociated states of wakefulness and sleep, which reflect deficient monoaminergic regulation of neural modulators of REM sleep, have been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). A 40 year old woman with remitting-progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) experienced episodes of sleep paralysis since the age of 16, four years prior to the onset of her neurological symptoms. Episodes of sleep paralysis, which manifested at a frequency of about once a week, occurred only upon awakening in the morning and were considered by the patient as a most terrifying experience. Periods of mental stress, sleep deprivation, physical fatigue and exacerbation of MS symptoms appeared to enhance the occurrence of sleep paralysis. In July of 1992 the patient began experimental treatment with AC pulsed applications of picotesla intensity electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 5Hz frequency which were applied extracerebrally 1-2 times per week. During the course of treatment with EMFs the patient made a dramatic recovery of symptoms with improvement in vision, mobility, balance, bladder control, fatigue and short term memory. In addition, her baseline pattern reversal visual evoked potential studies, which showed abnormally prolonged latencies in both eyes, normalized 3 weeks after the initiation of magnetic therapy and remained normal more than 2.5 years later. Since the introduction of magnetic therapy episodes of sleep paralysis gradually diminished and abated completely over the past 3 years. This report suggests that MS may be associated with deficient REM sleep inhibitory neural mechanisms leading to sleep paralysis secondary to the intrusion of REM sleep atonia and dream imagery into the waking state. Pineal melatonin and monoaminergic neurons have been implicated in the induction and maintenance of REM sleep and the pathogenesis of sleep paralysis and it is suggested that resolution of sleep paralysis in this patient by AC pulsed applications of EMFs was related to enhancement of melatonin circadian rhythms and cerebral serotoninergic neurotransmission.",

      "abstract": "The body of research that reports the relevance of sleep in high-performance sports is growing steadily. While the identification of sleep cycles and diagnosis of sleep disorders are limited to lab-based assessment via polysomnography, the development of activity-based devices estimating sleep patterns provides greater insight into the sleep behavior of athletes in ecological settings. Generally, small sleep quantity and/or poor quality appears to exist in many athletic populations, although this may be related to training and competition context. Typical sleep-affecting factors are the scheduling of training sessions and competitions, as well as impaired sleep onset as a result of increased arousal prior to competition or due to the use of electronic devices before bedtime. Further challenges are travel demands, which may be accompanied by jet-lag symptoms and disruption of sleep habits. Promotion of sleep may be approached via behavioral strategies such as sleep hygiene, extending nighttime sleep, or daytime napping. Pharmacological interventions should be limited to clinically induced treatments, as evidence among healthy and athletic populations is lacking. To optimize and manage sleep in athletes, it is recommended to implement routine sleep monitoring on an individual basis.",

The most common problems were inability to turn over or get out of bed and a frequent need to pass urine during the night. For the majority of patients, sleep was disrupted. Despite these difficulties, two-thirds of patients rated sleep quality as acceptable or good. The average duration of sleep was 6.5-7 h but approximately 8% of patients reported less than 5 h sleep per night. Hypnotic or sedative drugs were used by 29% of patients to help them sleep but only 6% took any antiparkinsonian medication during the night. Just over half the patients had told their doctor of nocturnal problems; prescription of hypnotic drugs or changes to antiparkinsonian therapy were the remedies most frequently tried. Problems at night are common in PD and, because of their debilitating effect on performance during the daytime, merit special attention.",

They often perform well because they compensate impaired wakefulness by an increased willingness to respond. Neurophysiological research indicates that the sometimes occurring cognitive dysfunction is associated with a waxing and waning between wakefulness and sleep. The increased psychopathology is partly a reflection of, partly a reaction to the symptoms. The impact of hypersomnia on psychosocial functioning is more important than that of epilepsy in epileptics. In severe cases smoking and driving should better be dissuaded.",

      "title": "The influence of stress on the transition from drug use to addiction.",
      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status.

Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico.

      "title": "Aberrant Hippocampal Neuroregenerative Plasticity in Schizophrenia: Reactive Neuroblastosis as a Possible Pathocellular Mechanism of Hallucination",
      "abstract": "Hallucination is a sensory perception that occurs in the absence of external stimuli during abnormal neurological disturbances and various mental diseases. Hallucination is recognized as a core psychotic symptom and is particularly more prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia. Strikingly, a significant number of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and other neurological diseases like cerebral stroke and epileptic seizure also experience hallucination. While aberrant neurotransmission has been linked to the neuropathogenic events of schizophrenia, the precise cellular mechanism accounting for hallucinations remains obscure. Neurogenesis is a cellular process of producing new neurons from the neural stem cells (NSC)-derived neuroblasts in the brain that contribute to the regulation of pattern separation, mood, olfaction, learning, and memory in adulthood. Impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the adult brain has been linked to stress, anxiety, depression, and dementia. Notably, many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the mitotic and functional activation of neuroblasts and cell cycle re-entry of mature neurons leading to a drastic alteration in neurogenic process, known as reactive neuroblastosis. Considering their neurophysiological properties, the abnormal integration of neuroblasts into the existing neural network or withdrawal of their connections can lead to abnormal synaptogenesis, and neurotransmission. Eventually, this would be expected to result in altered perception accounting for hallucination. Thus, this article emphasizes a hypothesis that aberrant neurogenic processes at the level of reactive neuroblastosis could be an underlying mechanism of hallucination in schizophrenia and other neurological diseases.",

      "title": "PHOX2B mutations in three Chinese patients with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome",
      "abstract": "Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS, OMIM #209880) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) characterized by an abnormal autonomic ventilatory response to progressive hypercarbia and sustained hypoxemia. Patients typically present in the newborn period with hypoventilation or apnea asleep, awake, or both, without any associated cardiac, pulmonary, neuromuscular or brainstem lesions. Rarely, some patients may present at a later age and are diagnosed to have late onset central hypoventilation syndrome (LOCHS).1 Other features of ANS dysfunction such as feeding difficulty due to oesophageal dysmotility, severe constipation in the absence of Hirschsprung disease, poor regulation of basal body temperature, episodes of profuse sweating, pupillary and ocular abnormalities, decreased beat-to-beat variability of heart rate, attenuated response of heart rate to exercise, abnormal fluctuation of blood pressure, decreased perception to pain, and decreased perception to anxiety may be variably present but not essential for diagnosis.1 Furthermore, this central hypoventilation can occur as an isolated feature or in association with a number of neurocristopathies, notably Hirschsprung disease (Haddad syndrome, OMIM #209880) and tumours of the sympathetic nervous system particularly neuroblastoma, ganglioneuro- blastoma, and ganglioneuroma, which were found in 20% and 5%—10% of CCHS patients, respectively.2 Studies of genes pertinent to the early embryologic development of the neural crest cells, specifically the endothelin and the RET-GDNF signaling pathways, have recently led to the identification of PHOX2B as the major disease causing gene for CCHS.2-6PHOX2B was mapped to chromosome 4p12 and consists of 3 exons. It encodes a highly conserved paired-like homeobox transcription factor of 314 amino acids linked to the RET-GDNF signaling pathway. The DNA binding homeodomain is encoded by exon 2, whereas exon 3 encodes two short and stable polyalanine tracts of 9 and 20 residues, respectively. Expression studies performed in mice and human have shown that this is a master regulatory gene crucial for the proper development of the peripheral and central ANS.3,7,8 In this work, we detected PHOX2B mutations in three local Chinese patients diagnosed with CCHS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CCHS in Chinese. METHODS Patients Three male patients with CCHS were ascertained because of persistent hypoventilation in the absence of primary pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, brainstem and metabolic causes. Their clinical features were summarized in Table.Table: Clinical features of the three patients with CCHSMutational screening of thePHOX2Bgene Peripheral blood samples were taken after the families had consented for PHOX2B testing. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). The three exons and their intron-exon boundaries of the PHOX2B gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Ava II enzyme digestion and direct sequencing as described by Matera et al.6 The reference sequence is the human PHOX2B mRNA sequence (GeneBank accession number NM_003924). RESULTS Patient 1 A heterozygous c.586_c.590insG mutation was detected in exon 3 (Fig. 1). This is a frameshift mutation predicted to result in termination of translation at codon 359 (359X). Such mutation was not detected in his parents.Fig. 1.: Sequence chromatogram from exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. A heterozygous c.586_c.590insG was detected in Patient 1.Patient 2 A heterozygous in-frame duplication of 18 nucleotides was detected in exon 3, leading to an insertion of 6 alanines to the 20-alanines tract (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Parents’ PHOX2B genes were analyzed and found to be normal.Fig. 2.: Ava II enzymatic digestion of the PCR products of the exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. Extra band with size larger than 270 bp was observed in Patients 2 and 3, indicating expansion of the polyalanine tract. Lanes M1 and M2 are DNA size markers; Lanes N1 and N2 are normal controls; B is blank.Fig. 3.: Sequence chromatogram from exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. A heterozygous c.758_c.759ins18 was detected in Patient 2 and a heterozygous c.776_c.777ins21 was detected in Patient 3. The former insertion was occurred within the 13th alanine codon of the polyalanine tract, while the latter was occurred within the 19th alanine codon. A heterozygous c.762A>C nucleotide change was also detected in patient 3, which is a silent mutation.Patient 3 A heterozygous in-frame duplication of 21 nucleotides was detected in exon 3, leading to an insertion of 7 alanines to the 20-alanines tract (Figs. 2, 3). A heterozygous c.762A>C nucleotide change was also detected in patient 3, which is a silent mutation. Analyses of the parents’ PHOX2B genes were normal except that the father also had the heterozygous c.762A>C nucleotide change. As the c.762A>C nucleotide change was not a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we analyzed the DNA samples from 40 normal controls. We found that 5/40 (allele frequency 6.25%) controls also had a heterozygous c.762A>C change, indicating that it is a common SNP. DISCUSSION Several studies have shown that heterozygous mutation in PHOX2B is sufficient to cause CCHS and confirmed its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern,2-6,9-11 with incomplete penetrance.6 Taken together, there are 314 CCHS patients studied worldwide, with 14 cases being LOCHS. PHOX2B mutations were identified in 293 patients (93%). A mutational hotspot exists in the 20-alanines tract encoded by exon 3 as 91% of the mutations identified consisted of polyalanine expansion within this tract with size ranging from +5 to +13 (266/293). Small alanine repeats contraction has been identified in a few normal individuals, with size varied from -1 to -7.2-6 Rare frameshift and missense mutations account for the rest (27/293). Interestingly, most of these mutations did not disrupt the homeodomain. The molecular pathogenesis was thought to be protein misfolding that in turn led to decreased DNA binding, cytoplasmic or nuclear aggregation and nuclear exclusion, and or a partial dominant negative effect.12,13 Haploinsufficiency alone appeared insufficient to cause the full spectrum of CCHS, because a patient reported by Benailly with deletion of the PHOX2B gene had neither hypoventilation nor ANS dysfunction, but only Hirschsprung disease.8 Attempts of genotype-phenotype correlation have shown that the size of the polyalanine repeat expansion correlates with the severity of the respiratory phenotype and ANS symptoms.5,6 Such observation has been supported by two independent functional studies of the PHOX2B mutations, both of which found a progressive decrease in the transactivation of PHOX2B mediated target genes with lengthening of the expanded alanine tract.12,13 While frameshift and missense mutations appeared to result in CCHS phenotype at the severe end of the spectrum.6,11 with a predisposition to tumors of the sympathetic nervous system. 2 Bachetti et al12 proposed that the observed oncogenic role for frameshift mutations in the PHOX2B gene, among others, could be related to its ability to enhance the activity of the PHOX2A promoter, a transcription factor that acts with PHOX2B in the RET-GDNF signaling pathway. Here we report three Chinese patients with CCHS, our results generally support the overseas’ findings. All three cases presented in the newborn period with apnea and respiratory insufficiency that required ventilatory support. Patient 1, with a frameshift mutation (c.586_c.590insG), had the most severe phenotype. He was born preterm at 34 weeks with polyhydramnios, IUGR and poor respiratory effort requiring ventilatory support starting from birth. The apnea phenotype could overlap with apnea of prematurity and required a high index of suspicion. He developed constipation and abdominal distension on day 2 of life. Biopsy confirmed Hirschsprung disease with total colonic aganglionosis extending to distal small bowel. Patient 2, with an expansion of 6 alanines in the 20-alanines tract, had isolated central hypoventilation without the Hirschsprung association. Patient 3, with an expansion of 7 alanines, had both central hypoventilation and Hirschsprung disease, presenting with abdominal distension on day 2 and failure to pass meconium since birth. The extent of aganglionosis was uncertain, however, as his clinical course was complicated by necrotizing enterocolitis with transmural necrosis from part of ileum to whole colon, bowel resection and short gut syndrome. All three of them needed ventilatory support both awake and asleep. It is noteworthy that, with growth and maturation, they all subsequently became ventilator dependent only during asleep. Ocular abnormalities are common in CCHS patients as exemplified by patients 2 and 3, both of whom have strabismus. The smallest polyalanine expansion size known to date that led to the CCHS/HSCR is 6. However, not all CCHS patients harboring +6 to +13 polyalanine expansion developed Hirschsprung disease as shown by patient 2, suggesting that other modifying genes likely exist to modulate the penetrance for Hirschsprung disease. None of the three patients described here has shown any evidence of tumors of neural crest derivatives yet. However, predicted from his genotype, patient 1 will be at higher risk of developing tumors of the sympathetic nervous system. The great majority of the mutations were de novo, and the common polyalanine tract expansion was postulated to be the result of unequal crossover between the homologues during meiosis.3-6 Nevertheless, somatic mosaicism has been proposed in 4.5%2 and 10%5 of parents. Possibility of germline mosaicism cannot be excluded either. Finally, of the 14 cases with LOCHS studied, 9 (64%) were found to have mutations in the PHOX2B gene with an expansion of 5 alanines in the polyalanine tract,2,6,14,15 suggesting that idiopathic LOCHS and CCHS are indeed allelic disorders.",

This study compared rest-activity rhythms in healthy older adults and PD patients with and without hallucinations. Twenty-nine older adults and 50 PD patients (27 with hallucinations, 23 without) were assessed using wrist-worn actigraphy for 5 days. Disease-related and cognitive data were also collected. PD patients demonstrated reduced amplitude of activity (F = 12.719, P < 0.01) and increased intradaily variability (F = 22.005, P < 0.001), compared to healthy older adults, independently of age, and cognitive status. Hallucinators showed lower interdaily stability (F = 7.493, P < 0.01) significantly greater activity during \"night-time\" (F = 6.080, P < 0.05) and significantly reduced relative amplitude of activity (F = 5.804, P < 0.05) compared to nonhallucinators, independently of clinical factors including motor fluctuations. PD patients with hallucinations display altered rest-activity rhythm characterized by an unpredictable circadian pattern across days, likely arising from damage to brainstem and hypothalamic sleep centers. Treatment of sleep and rest-activity rhythm disturbance is an important target in Parkinson's Disease.",

      "abstract": "Online games are€basically intended to drive the fatigue away or to simply refresh the brain after carrying out daily €activities. But in some cases, playing games are potential in making someone addicted. Sleeping is a diverse and complex event, a reversible state which involves the decrease of consciousness and the cognitive function is also declining globally, so that the brain no longer responds to the surrounding stimulus. Teenagers today, especially men, tend to experience€disturbances during sleep caused by a high frequence of playing online games. Playing games with a long duration and performed everyday may cause some negative impacts€on either cognitive function or intelligence. Blue light from the Light Emitting Diode of laptop screens, monitors, and TV while someone is playing online games are believed to affect the production of melatonin hormone, which€regulates human sleep cycles. €Thus, this condition results in insomnia. Insomnia is characterized by the presence of difficulty in starting to sleep, frequent awakening, or inability to go back to sleep, and it gradually becomes a disorder during the day, increased depression and anxiety, abnormal eating habits, increased BMI, and increased risk of obesity. The intensity of playing online games with a frequency of more than 4 days per week and 4 hours per day are classified as maniac gamers. The period of time spent during playing the game should be separated by a few minutes up to hours of break for at least 10 minutes after 30 minutes of playing the game, with a maximum play time of approximately 2 hours per day.",

      "title": "REM-OSA as a Tool to Understand Both the Architecture of Sleep and Pathogenesis of Sleep Apnea—Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a complex physiological state, which can be divided into the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) phase and the REM phase. Both have some unique features and functions. This difference is best visible in electroencephalography recordings, respiratory system activity, arousals, autonomic nervous system activity, or metabolism. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition characterized by recurrent episodes of pauses in breathing during sleep caused by blockage of the upper airways. This common condition has multifactorial ethiopathogenesis (e.g., anatomical predisposition, sex, obesity, and age). Within this heterogenous syndrome, some distinctive phenotypes sharing similar clinical features can be recognized, one of them being REM sleep predominant OSA (REM-OSA). The aim of this review was to describe the pathomechanism of REM-OSA phenotype, its specific clinical presentation, and its consequences. Available data suggest that in this group of patients, the severity of specific cardiovascular and metabolic complications is increased. Due to the impact of apneas and hypopneas predominance during REM sleep, patients are more prone to develop hypertension or glucose metabolism impairment. Additionally, due to the specific function of REM sleep, which is predominantly fragmented in the REM-OSA, this group presents with decreased neurocognitive performance, reflected in memory deterioration, and mood changes including depression. REM-OSA clinical diagnosis and treatment can alleviate these outcomes, surpassing the traditional treatment and focusing on a more personalized approach, such as using longer therapy of continuous positive airway pressure or oral appliance use.",

      "abstract": "Based on the video-EEG study, the diagnosis of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy was made and the patient was started on carbamazepine. Genetic testing demonstrated a mutation in the CHRNA4 gene consistent with the diagnosis of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE). The patient responded well to carbamazepine and would experience only rare seizures after missed doses of medication. Useful clues to help differentiate SHE from parasomnias include the presence of stereotyped behaviors, events occurring during periods of wakefulness, a history of clear seizures, a family history of epilepsy, later age of onset (parasomnias usually begin between 4 and 6 years of age), and multiple events per night. Seizures are less likely to occur during REM sleep and more often arise during transition from sleep to waking. The EEGs in SHE often lack clear abnormalities and may be normal despite multiple seizures per night.",

      "title": "A Comprehensive Review of Sleepwalking",
      "abstract": "Sleepwalking, a prevalent parasomnia disorder characterized by complex motor activities during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, affects individuals across the lifespan, with distinct developmental patterns. It is especially common among children. Their behaviors can vary from simple actions like sitting up or walking in bed to more complex ones such as dressing or opening doors. These actions are typically purposeless and mechanical, with reduced awareness of the environment and limited responses to external stimuli. In adults, sleepwalking behaviors are generally less frequent but can still involve similar mechanical and purposeless actions. Stress, irregular sleep patterns, and environmental factors often act as triggers. Both pediatric and adult populations require age-specific management strategies to address sleepwalking effectively. For children, ensuring regular sleep routines and avoiding forced awakenings are key, with professional help recommended if episodes occur frequently. For adults, maintaining consistent sleep habits, managing stress, and creating a safe environment is crucial, with medical intervention suggested if sleepwalking persists. This paper provides a comprehensive review of current literature to explore multifaceted aspects of sleepwalking, focusing on its epidemiological characteristics, triggering mechanisms, clinical manifestations, pathophysiological underpinnings, and tailored management approaches for both children and adults.",

However, the disease also encompasses many nonmotor issues that can impact a myriad of processes such as cardiovascular status, gastrointestinal function, autonomic function, mood and sleep. These issues can be more debilitating and impactful on health status in part because of a lack of effective treatments. The pathophysiology of the disease process is under active investigation with postulated mechanisms involving both the central nervous system and the periphery. More in depth examination of the many nonmotor symptoms may aid in the discovery of the overarching pathological origin and progression of Parkinson’s disease. Examining the disease process from the perspective of nonmotor symptoms may also provide additional target pathways and potential drug development options not considered previously.

      "title": "Investigation des fonctions mnésiques impliquées dans le processus de rémission de l'état de stress post-traumatique",
      "abstract": "L'etude de l'etat de stress post-traumatique (ESPT) amene a se poser deux types de questions fondamentales : 1) pourquoi certains individus exposes a un evenement traumatique developpent le trouble alors que d'autres non? et 2) parmi ceux qui developpent le trouble, pourquoi la majorite des individus entrent en remission apres quelques mois alors que d'autres developpent un ESPT chronique qui persiste pendant plusieurs mois, voire plusieurs annees? La presente these avait donc pour but de trouver certaines explications a cette deuxieme question qui semble plus importante d'un point de vue clinique en raison des repercussions que ce trouble peut avoir sur le fonctionnement quotidien des victimes et de leur entourage. Effectivement, pour certaines victimes, plus le temps passe, plus les symptomes s'installent et se cristallisent. Pour ces individus, les symptomes chroniques et dommageables seraient souvent jumeles a differentes complications, notamment un trouble depressif ou anxieux, un trouble de dependance ou d'abus de substances, un changement au niveau de la personnalite, ainsi qu'a une degradation durable au plan du fonctionnement social et professionnel (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). Il a ete propose que le processus de remission ne requiert pas un oubli, mais reflete plutot un nouvel apprentissage (Foa, 2000) et que les dysfonctions mnesiques (souvenirs recurrents et involontaires du trauma et difficultes a se souvenirs du trauma) observees chez les victimes d'evenements traumatiques pourraient interferer avec la remission du trauma, un processus d'adaptation qui requiert ce nouvel apprentissage par extinction (Shalev, 2000). La these se compose de quatre chapitres. Le premier consiste en une description des modeles theoriques et neuronaux ainsi qu'une recension de la litterature sur les processus mnesiques impliques dans l'ESPT ainsi que les facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux dysfonctions mnesiques retrouvees dans l'ESPT. Cette recension met en evidence la controverse dans la litterature en ce qui a trait a la memoire traumatique ainsi que les principales failles methodologiques qui empechent de repondre au questionnement souleve. Le deuxieme chapitre presente une etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des experiences emotionnelles peritraumatiques (detresse et dissociation vecues au moment du trauma) chez des individus exposes a un evenement traumatique en fonction de leur statut diagnostic. Il etait anticipe qu'en appliquant la theorie d'une relation en « U » inversee entre l'intensite du stress et le systeme mnesique hippocampique (Metcalfe & Jacobs, 1998) et en tenant compte du statut diagnostique, nous pourrions mieux comprendre les resultats contradictoires obtenus jusqu'a maintenant au sujet des souvenirs traumatiques. Les resultats de cette etude ont demontre que le statut diagnostique est associe a la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des reponses peritraumatiques. Ces resultats sont donc en accord avec la theorie de Metcalfe & Jacob (1998) sur la memoire traumatique humaine qui suggere qu'un niveau de stress modere produit un souvenir forme a l'aide de l'hippocampe et est associe avec la memoire episodique, autobiographique et contextuelle, alors qu'un niveau de stress extreme mene a un encodage independant de l'hippocampe, mais associe a l'activation de l'amygdale, menant a la creation d'un souvenir decontextualise, sensoriel et charge emotionnellement. Le troisieme chapitre presente une deuxieme etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, le role des facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux fonctions mnesiques dans l'evolution des symptomes d'ESPT en etudiant l'implication de certains SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphism) du gene FKBP5 dans le processus de remission du trouble. Les resultats ont demontre que le gene FKBP5 pouvait prospectivement predire le manque d'amelioration des symptomes d'ESPT chez des individus ayant recours a une therapie pour un ESPT aigu. Des analyses plus specifiques ont aussi demontre un effet interactif des SNPs du gene FKBP5 et du souvenir subjectif de la severite du trauma (c.-a-d., les reponses peritraumatiques) sur les dysfonctions mnesiques. Les resultats demontrent donc une relation entre les corticosteroides et les performances mnesiques, ce qui pourrait interferer avec l'apprentissage par extinction, et par consequent, en partie expliquer la persistance du trouble. Le dernier chapitre propose une discussion generale des resultats qui permettent de constater que les processus mnesiques sont impliques dans la remission/persistance de l'ESPT. Les differentes forces et limites ainsi que les implications cliniques et theoriques de la presente these sont aussi examinees.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________",

Agomelatine (valdoxan) rapidly improves sleep in depressed patients by making it easier to fall asleep, increasing total sleep time, duration of rapid eye movement (REM), and slow-wave sleep (SWS), and improving functioning during the day.",

Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND Sleep problems are a core feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, a robust objective measure for the sleep disturbance in patients has yet to be found. METHODS The current study assessed EEG power across a wide frequency range and multiple scalp locations, in matched trauma-exposed individuals with and without PTSD, during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. In addition, a full polysomnographical evaluation was performed, including sleep staging and assessment of respiratory function, limb movements and heart rate. The occurrence of sleep disorders was also assessed. RESULTS In PTSD patients, NREM sleep shows a substantial loss of slow oscillation power and increased higher frequency activity compared to controls. The change is most pronounced in right-frontal brain areas and correlates with insomnia. PTSD REM sleep shows a large power shift in the opposite direction, with increased slow oscillation power in occipital areas, which is strongly related to nightmare activity and to lesser extent with insomnia. These pronounced spectral changes occur in the context of severe subjective sleep problems, increased occurrence of various sleep disorders and modest changes in sleep macrostructure. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to show pronounced changes in EEG spectral topologies during both NREM and REM sleep in PTSD. Importantly, the observed power changes reflect the hallmarks of PTSD sleep problems: insomnia and nightmares and may thus be specific for PTSD. A spectral index derived from these data distinguishes patients from controls with high effect size, bearing promise as a candidate biomarker.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "Non-Intrusive Analytical Approaches to Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Samy, Lauren | Advisor(s): Sarrafzadeh, Majid | Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and the most prevalent sleep disorder in general. Approximately 22 million people in the United States and more than 100 million people worldwide are affected by this serious disorder. The disorder is characterized by repeated involuntary breathing cessations (apnea) or reductions in breathing (hypopnea) during sleep, accompanied by oxygen desaturation (hypoxia). The apneas occur due to the obstruction of the upper airway as a result of the relaxing of throat tissue. The hypoxia triggers a brain activity arousal to restore the normal breathing pattern until the next apneic episode occurs. OSA patients can experience hundreds of apneas per night. The frequent sleep disruptions and the resulting fragmented sleep pattern can have serious physical and psychological consequences and can lead to premature death. Because the apnea episodes rarely trigger a full awakening, patients are often unaware of having difficulty breathing at night. As a result of this unawareness, OSA is severely underdiagnosed. This problem is exacerbated by the intrusiveness of current diagnosis methods. Polysomnography---the traditional gold-standard diagnosis method---requires close overnight monitoring of patients' body functions, making it an uncomfortable and intrusive diagnostic test. Intrusive diagnosis methods discourage patients from getting tested for OSA until they experience its serious health effects. As a result, many patients remain untreated and OSA continues to be a major public health problem that places a significant burden on health care systems worldwide. In an effort to increase the level of diagnosis and treatment of the disorder, this work investigates the design and implementation of effective non-intrusive OSA diagnostic methods. We explore two kinds of detection methods: nocturnal methods that rely on diagnosing OSA by detecting apneic episodes from overnight recordings, as well as daytime methods which use features and signals that can be obtained while the subject is awake. This work involves identifying the data to be collected, building the appropriate systems to obtain them, and using machine learning techniques to analyze them. The effectiveness of our methods was proven using real data from clinical trials. Daytime methods quickly revealed their advantages over the common nocturnal methods and the few existing daytime methods.Experimental results show that our daytime methods perform the initial diagnosis of OSA non-intrusively without significantly affecting the diagnosis accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art nocturnal methods.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep disorders are quite common and often disturbing to either the patient or the child's family. As the patient matures into adult, sleep disorders continue to be common and an important factor in development, both social and cognitive. Sleep disorders can adversely impact physical and mental health. Nonrestorative sleep can hamper a child's ability to concentrate and control emotions and behavior. Sleep disorders vary among age groups, but most can occur with varying frequency at any age. Several disorders are typically seen only during the first few years of life, including colic, excessive nighttime feedings, and sleep onset association disorder. A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age. Sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respirations are not found only in adults but are, in fact, quite common in the pediatric population. While these disorders can occur at any age, treatment options vary substantially by age.",

In animals, converging evidence—some reasonably well controlled—indicates that REM sleep deprivation probably heightens central neural excitability and increases motivational behavior, but has unclear or inconclusive effects on learning. In humans, evidence indicates that REM sleep deprivation is not dream deprivation and is not harmful to schizophrenic, depressed, or healthy subjects. Controversy continues about whether or not (some) schizophrenic patients respond abnormally to REM sleep deprivation by having no REM rebound. Controlled but unconfirmed work indicates that endogenous, but not reactive, depressive patients are improved by REM sleep deprivation, a finding consistent with the animal behavioral consequences of the procedure and with the unique REM-depriving properties of efficacious antidepressant drugs.",

The latter include improved psychophysiological control as well as enhanced performance in controlled parapsychological experiments. Multiple studies on meditation, hypnosis, sensory homogenization, psychoactive drug ingestion, and spontaneous alterations of consciousness have demonstrated enhanced physiological (e.g., gastrointestinal and other somatic systems, heart rate and bleeding control, ability to withstand cold temperature and painful stimuli) and psychological (e.g., perceptual sensitivity, attention control and cognitive deautomatization, creativity, enhanced positive affect and personality change) functioning. Parapsychological (psi) research also indicates that when individuals are exposed to techniques to alter the state of consciousness such as sensory homogenization, meditation, hypnosis, and psychedelic drugs, they exhibit stronger evidence of psi functioning than when they are in ordinary waking consciousness, particularly if they are prone to having spontaneous alterations of consciousness and/or have had a mental practice for a long time. Recommendations for further development of research in this area are provided. (Less)",

However, infants with colds exhibit some sleep state specific alterations in sleep apnea. At 40, 44, and 48 weeks postconception, the number of respiratory pauses of 2 to 4.9 seconds and of 5 to 9.9 seconds duration per 100 minutes of state, during rapid eye movement, and indeterminate sleep are decreased in infants with colds. The absence of this phenomenon at 52 weeks suggests that it is modified by maturation. We hypothesize that the reduction in rapid eye movement and indeterminate sleep apnea is a manifestation of an adaptive response in normal infants, but for infants at risk for the sudden infant death syndrome, this response may be overwhelmed, resulting in increased apnea and, in some instances, sudden infant death.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychotic symptoms are the main and the most disabling “nonmotor” complications of Parkinson's disease (PD), the pathophysiology of which is poorly recognized. Polysomnographic studies have shown a relationship between visual hallucinations and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The objective of this study is to clarify the relationship between psychotic symptoms and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in PD. In a Parkinson's disease outpatient unit, 289 consecutive subjects with idiopathic PD were administered (in the period from January to December 2002) a multiple‐choice questionnaire and structured interview on sleep and mental disorders. RBD was diagnosed in accordance with the minimal diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Hallucinations and delusional disorders were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders‐IV criteria. The presence or absence of psychotic symptoms, of RBD, and of daytime sleepiness, as well as motor status, cognitive status, and mood were assessed. Approximately 32% (n = 92) of the subjects presented with psychotic disorders; 30% (n = 86) had experienced hallucinations; 2% (n = 6) had delusions without hallucinations. Sixty‐two (72%) hallucinators reported nocturnal hallucinations. A total of 6.6% (n = 19) of the subjects complained of a delusional disorder. There were 26.6% (n = 77) of subjects who presented with RBD: 28 (36%) with onset before and 49 (63%) with onset after PD diagnosis. The presence of RBD was associated with an increased risk of manifesting hallucinations and delusions (odds ratio [OR], 2.73). Other independent clinical factors found to have an effect on psychotic disorders were cognitive impairment (OR, 3.92), disease duration (OR, 2.46), advanced age (OR, 2.34), and severity of motor symptoms (OR, 2.06). These results suggest that RBD is widely associated with psychosis in PD. © 2005 Movement Disorder Society",

      "title": "Restless legs is a medical disorder and can be treated",
      "abstract": "Movement disorders have long been an interest of the Editor of Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment (Brimblecombe and Pinder 1972). Movement disorders can manifest as slowness or poverty of movement (hypokinesias) or as abnormal involuntary movements (hyperkinesias). Two of the commonest hyperkinesias are essential tremor, which has been described in a previous issue of the journal (Uccellini et al 2006), and restless legs syndrome (RLS), which occupies much of the current issue and was also reviewed in a recent issue (Byrne et al 2006).\r\n\r\nRLS is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the limbs accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, leading to disturbed sleep and a poor quality of life. Symptoms usually begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, and are partly or completely relieved by active movement. Symptoms tend to worsen in the evening and at night. Not all cases where legs are restless are due to RLS, and it can be distinguished from nocturnal leg cramps, positional discomfort, and akathisia. However, almost all RLS patients also experience periodic limb movements (PLMs) during sleep or while awake. RLS is a chronic neurological condition that occurs in two forms, a primary disorder independent of other disorders, and a form that is secondary to other conditions such as pregnancy, iron deficiency, and end-stage renal disease.\r\n\r\nRLS affects about 5%–10% of the general adult population, but the risk increases in the elderly and in women. It can also affect children and adolescents, and is more common in children with ADHD. An early age of onset is indicative of a family history, while the familial nature of RLS is indicated by the demonstration of linkage to several chromosomal loci. The pathogenesis involves dopaminergic dysfunction, iron metabolism, and abnormalities in supraspinal inhibition.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis is simple and based upon well-validated criteria. Nevertheless, RLS is misunderstood, frequently misdiagnosed, often classified as a psychogenic disorder, and patients can suffer inappropriate treatment and consequent distress. With correct diagnosis, counseling, and reassurance, many patients will not require pharmacological treatment which will be determined by the severity and nature of the symptoms. Treatment of secondary RLS should focus on the underlying cause where possible. Some drugs may exacerbate RLS, including antidepressants particularly tricyclics and fluoxetine, some antiemetics, calcium channel blockers, phenytoin, and excessive consumption of caffeine or alcohol especially at bedtime. Evidence-based treatment guidelines for RLS are available (Byrne et al 2006). Dopaminergic therapies are first-line treatments but there is also substantial, but lesser, evidence for the efficacy of some antiepileptic dugs especially gabapentin, for opioids like oxycodone and propoxyphene, for benzodiazepines particularly clonazepam, and for the α2-adrenergic agonist clonidine. Iron therapy, despite the evidence for the involvement of iron in the causality of RLS, has not been consistently shown to be effective, although it is recommended whenever serum ferritin levels are low.\r\n\r\nIn this issue of Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment the biopsychosocial aspects of RLS and particularly mental health problems like disturbances of mood and cognition are reviewed (Becker 2006), as well as the major influence that RLS has on sleep especially when it is accompanied by PLMs (Bogan 2006). Both authors also briefly review treatment options and conclude that the evidence base is strongest for dopaminergic therapies and in particular ropinirole. Disturbed sleep, diminished quality of life, and mood symptoms are all alleviated by therapy with dopamine agonists. Individual dopaminergic agents are also reviewed. Ropinirole is currently the only FDA-approved therapy for RLS, a decision based upon several large scale clinical trials which established its safety and efficacy in treating the motor symptoms of RLS and improving sleep quality (Kushida 2006). Oral pramipexole (Benbir and Guilleminault 2006) and transdermal rotigotine (Bunten and Happe 2006), which are approved in many countries for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, have also undergone successful large-scale, randomized, and placebo-controlled trials in RLS. Data on pramipexole and rotigotine are promising, and both drugs should be soon added to the armamentarium of treatments for RLS. Other dopaminergic agents useful in RLS include L-dopa itself and the ergot derivatives pergolide and cabergoline (Becker 2006; Bogan 2006). Restless legs is a medical disorder that can be safely and effectively treated.",

      "abstract": "In multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), the myelin sheet insulating the axons is destroyed. This diminishes the electric conduction within the CNS. The exact pathologic mechanism responsible for the development of demyelinating plaques and axonal damage is still unclear. MS is probably a heterogeneous disease where different pathogenetic mechanisms are of importance (1, 2). We know from clinical evidence that demyelinization is mediated by autoreactive T-cells, and furthermore, certain hereditary and environmental factors seem to make certain individuals more susceptible to MS than others. In the MS population, sleep disturbances are three times more common as compared to the general population and MS patients are twice as likely to have reduced sleep quality (3, 4). MS-related sleep disorders can be subdivided into primary sleep disorders and secondary sleep disorders. The most common primary sleep disorders seen in patients with MS are insomnia, nocturnal movement disorders, sleep-disordered breathing, narcolepsy, and rapid eye movement behavior disorder (5–7). Secondary sleep disturbances can result from a clinical variety of symptoms seen in MS. Sleep disturbances, depression, and fatigue are often co-existing in MS and thereby influence and intensify each other. Identification of them is very important, because appropriate treatment will improve the symptoms itself, improve quality of sleep, and diminish fatigue. Altogether this reduces disability and will provide patients with a better quality of life (QOL). MS has a substantial negative effect on QOL, even when compared with other chronically ill patients (8). This is probably due to its unpredictable and most often progressive disease course. As a healthcare provider for MS patients, it is important to aid patients in maintaining social activity, employment, and regular exercise. All these factors are important for the improvement of patients' well-being. As attitudes toward MS and ways of coping with this unpredictable disease are vital to the experienced QOL, psychological support toward the acceptance of having MS is essential. Through maintaining a reasonable QOL institutionalization of those with MS may be delayed.",

Identification and minimization of such factors is the first step in proper management. General sleep hygiene principles are outlined. Avoidance of regular hypnotic therapy is encouraged, but recommendations regarding the use of hypnotic drugs in selected cases are provided.",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "title": "PIK3CA-Related Segmental Overgrowth",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) commonly occurs with several sleep disorders, including hypersomnia, breathing or limb-related sleep disturbances, and most notably chronic insomnia. A bidirectional relationship exists between sleep and mood problems, and both issues often warrant timely clinical management. However, there are several assessment- and treatment-related complexities that complicate the clinical management of such patients. For example, there are several overlapping symptoms for MDD and both insomnia and hypersomnia, and the two sleep conditions are both listed as possible symptoms in the diagnostic criteria for MDD. This has led to a well-documented problem of underrecognizing and undertreating these significant disorders in the context of MDD. Moreover, certain effective depression treatments can actually worsen the coexisting sleep disorder. Understanding and treating both disorders (i.e., MDD and the co-occurring sleep disorder) is imperative for effective clinical care. Almost all (i.e., up to 90%) of those with depression report sleep problems. This chapter provides an overview of the etiologic, assessment, and treatment issues inherent in this very large, highly prevalent group.",

Driven by this tension, the animal changes its behaviour. At the same time, alterations occur in bodily functions. All organs and regulatory systems (central and peripheral nervous systems, endocrine and immune systems) participate in these behaviour-physiological response and are affected in their activities. The character of the reactions (e.g. fight, flight, passivity) is mainly determined by the animals appraisal of the environmental change and of the possible impact of its response. Aim of the reactions is neutralising the threat and gaining control over the environment (adaptation). When this is achieved, the tension recedes. In case the response is unsuccessful, the state of tension persists ('chronic stress'). Prolonged exposure of brain and/or bodily functions to stress can result in pathological states.",

      "abstract": "Acute respiratory failure is a common complication of drug abuse. It is more likely to develop in the setting of chronic lung disease or debility in those with limited respiratory reserve. Drugs may acutely precipitate respiratory failure by compromising respiratory pump function and/or by causing pulmonary pathology. Polysubstance overdoses are common, and clinicians should anticipate complications related to multiple drugs. Impairment of respiratory pump function may develop from central nervous system (CNS) depression (suppression of the medulla oblongata, stroke or seizures) or respiratory muscle fatigue (increased respiratory workload, metabolic acidosis). Drug-related respiratory pathology may result from parenchymal (aspiration-related events, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, infectious and non-infectious pneumonitides), airway (bronchospasm and hemorrhage), or pulmonary vascular insults (endovascular infections, hemorrhage, and vasoconstrictive events). Alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and benzodiazepines are the most commonly abused drugs that may induce events leading to acute respiratory failure. While decontamination and aggressive supportive measures are indicated, specific therapies to correct seizures, metabolic acidosis, pneumothorax, infections, bronchospasm, and agitation should be considered. Drug-related respiratory failure when due to CNS depression alone may portend well, but in patients with drug-related significant pulmonary pathology, a protracted course of illness may be anticipated.",

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte.

Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

      "abstract": "We present a case of recurrent fearful isolated sleep paralysis in a 52-year-old male of Indo-Caribbean ethnicity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Recurrent sleep paralysis is a widely under-reported yet worrisome symptom of various sleep disorders. Although a benign condition in most cases, sleep paralysis in a minority of patients causes great distress. Some patients exhibit bedroom avoidance behavior, whereas others experience bedtime anxiety, making it difficult to fall asleep. This leads to poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, which can greatly impact a person's overall health. As in our case, this led to a vicious \"lack of sleep\" cycle where a patient who had bedtime anxiety and could not fall asleep, owing to his recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, also had poor quality sleep secondary to his OSA. This increases morbidity and has many potential consequences, which may include cardiovascular events, cognitive decline, and motor vehicular accidents. Sometimes, simply addressing the underlying medical condition cures the recurrent sleep paralysis as in this case where continuous positive airway pressure for OSA cured the recurrent sleep paralysis. One of our goals is to raise awareness of recurrent sleep paralysis so that patients can seek medical help and would not have to live with the anguish of the condition. Coming forward will also assist medical researchers in furthering their understanding of sleep paralysis.",

      "abstract": "We report a girl 3 years and 6 months old with onset of aphasia at age 3 years and 3 months. There was no evidence of brain damage and there were no seizures. The neuropsychological evaluation showed that the girl tended to be right-handed, that aphasia was global and that other higher cortical functions seemed to be preserved. Isolated spikes and spikes-and-wave were recorded during wake over the right temporal region with rare independent contralateral abnormalities. During polysomnography (PSG), the physiological patterns of sleep were preserved and right temporal epileptiform discharges were significantly increased in all sleep stages. Maximal activation was obtained at sleep onset and during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep periods, when focal abnormalities became continuous and spread contralaterally. Repeat PSGs showed that the activation profile retained this particular trait, although subclinical discharges tended to increase during slow wave sleep (SWS). This pattern of subclinical temporal status epilepticus during REM sleep differs from the characteristic activation profile found in the syndrome of continuous spikes-and-waves during SWS. However, this profile was transient and all epileptiform changes disappeared during clinical recovery at 18 months of follow-up.",

      "title": "Excessive Sleepiness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Persons are considered excessively sleepy if they are unable to consistently achieve and sustain wakefulness and alertness to accomplish the tasks of daily living. Sleep occurs unintentionally or at inappropriate times or places. In children, sleepiness may manifest as hyperactivity. Excessive sleepiness can be defined using either clinical or Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) criteria, namely hypersomnolence occurring almost daily for at least 3 months, and mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, respectively. Although the likelihood of falling asleep is greater during inactive monotonous situations, severe sleepiness can manifest precipitously as sleep attacks, recurrent episodes of microsleep, or automatic behavior during which there is no memory of semiconscious activities. It is important to distinguish excessive sleepiness from fatigue, exhaustion, tiredness, weariness, listlessness or weakness, which may closely mimic it. Excessive sleepiness is estimated to affect 5% of the general population. Occasional excessive daytime sleepiness may be present in up to a third of the general adult population. Prevalence is greater among adolescents and older adults. Both genders appear to be affected equally. Among young adults, hours of weekday sleep predict daytime sleepiness, as do snoring, depression, marital status (those who are single are more likely to develop daytime sleepiness than married individuals), and employment status (sleepiness is more prevalent among persons employed full-time compared with those who are employed part-time or unemployed).",

      "abstract": "Lapses in psychic functioning, i.e., occurrence of certain psychological mishaps, e.g., making a slip of tongue, reading wrong word, stumbling in walking, forgetting to carry out an intended purpose, accidentally breaking or mislaying something, failing to recall what one ought to be able to recall, etc., have been attracting a great deal of attention during past fifteen or twenty years. Unfortunately for psychology, those who gave subject this attention approached it with a bias resulting from preoccupation with system of psychotherapeutics known as psycho-analysis. Owing to this bias these investigators found in these lapses confirmation of their theories about mental and they have used these lapses and their interpretations of them as a means of introducing uninitiated into mysteries of so-called new psychology. According to this new such lapses are not explainable by principles of orthodox psychology, are due to operation of mental processes of which individual is not and cannot be aware at time of lapse, are manifestation of activity within the of desires of a painful or disgusting or unthinkable nature, and betray something which individual does not want to know or have known about himself. In following analyses of such lapses (slips of tongue, etc.) as have recently come under my notice or have been studied by me, I shall show that such psychic mishaps or accidents can be satisfactorily explained by principles of orthodox psychology, do not involve unknown or unknowable mental processes, are not manifestations of repressed desires, are not unconscious betrayals of individual's secret self, and that they furnish not slightest basis on which to construct a psychology of unconscious. The careful scrutiny of circumstances surrounding lapses (slips, forgettings, accidental breakages, etc.) proves that these mistakes are results of verifiable psychophysiological processes, that known laws of orthodox psychology are adequate to explain them, that they are psychologically determined (not psychically determined), that they are not valid psychic acts and do not give expression to repressed, unknown, and unknowable motives of an undesirable, discreditable, or disgusting nature.

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

Most importantly, they are treatable. Hallucinations experienced by people with PD are varied.

      "abstract": "Age is the largest risk factor for the development and progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Ageing affects many cellular processes that predispose to neurodegeneration, and age-related changes in cellular function predispose to the pathogenesis of PD. The accumulation of age-related somatic damage combined with a failure of compensatory mechanisms may lead to an acceleration of PD with age. The formation of Lewy bodies may represent a marker for protective mechanisms against age-related dysfunction and degeneration of the nervous system. Mild parkinsonian signs may be present in older people, which are associated with reduced function. These may be due to age-related decline in dopaminergic activity, incidental Lewy body disease, degenerative pathologies (early PD and Alzheimer’s disease) or vascular pathology. Ageing may affect the clinical presentation of PD with altered drug side effects, increased risk of developing dementia and an increased likelihood of admission to a nursing home. Progression of PD, including the development of dementia, and hallucinations is related to the age of the patient rather than the age of disease onset. PD may reflect a failure of the normal cellular compensatory mechanisms in vulnerable brain regions, and this vulnerability is increased by ageing. PD is one of the best examples of an age-related disease.",

      "title": "Provoked and reflex seizures: Surprising or common?",
      "abstract": "Most patients with epilepsy report that seizures are sometimes, or exclusively, provoked by general internal precipitants (such as stress, fatigue, fever, sleep, and menstrual cycle) and by external precipitants (such as excess alcohol, heat, bathing, eating, reading, and flashing lights). Some patients describe very exotic and precise triggers, like tooth brushing or listening to a particular melody. Nevertheless, the most commonly noticed seizure increasers by far are stress, lack of sleep, and fatigue. Recognized reflex seizure triggers are usually sensory and visual, such as television, discotheques, and video games. Visually evoked seizures comprise 5% of the total of 6% reflex seizures. The distinction between provocative and reflex factors and seizures seems artificial, and in many patients, maybe all, there is a combination of these. It seems plausible that all of the above-mentioned factors can misbalance the actual brain network; at times, accumulation of factors leads then to primary generalized, partial, or secondarily generalized seizures. If the provoking factors are too exotic, patients may be sent to the psychiatrist. Conversely, if the seizure-provoking fluctuating mechanisms include common habits and environmental factors, these may hardly be considered as provocative factors. Awareness of precipitating factors and its possible interactions might help us to unravel the pathophysiology of epilepsy and to change the notion that seizure occurrence is unpredictable. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, treatment, and especially similarities in the variety of provocative and reflex factors with resulting general hypotheses.",

      "abstract": "After Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent and incidental neurodegenerative disorder, affecting more than 2% of the population older than 65 years old. Since it was first described 200 years ago by Dr James Parkinson, great steps have been made in the understanding of the pathology. However, the cause(s) that initiates and perpetuates the neurodegenerative process is (are) still not clear. Thus, early diagnosis is not available, nor are there efficient therapies that can stop neurodegeneration. PD clinical features are defined by motor (like bradykinesia, resting tremor, gait impairment) and non-motor symptoms (like constipation, apathy, fathigue, olfactory dysfunction, depression and cognitive decline) that get more severe as the disease advances. Neuropathological hallmarks comprise selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and Lewy bodies (LB) in different nuclei of the nervous system. Numerous studies have shown that these pathological features are aggravated by the confluence of other contributing factors, such as a genetic component, exposure to environmental toxins, mitochondrial dysfunction, increase of oxidative stress, calcium imbalance and chronic neuroinflammation, among others. Here, we provide a summary of the actual state of PD's pathology, the most studied molecular mechanisms, classic and novel therapeutic strategies and diagnosis methods, especially highlighting recent advances in these 200 years.",

      "abstract": "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of dizziness and vertigo. This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

      "title": "Disorders of Consciousness",
      "abstract": "Disorders of consciousness (DoC) is a state where consciousness has been affected by severe damage to the brain, including acute or prolonged DoC (pDoC). The pDoC means that the loss of consciousness lasts for more than 28 days, with the first cause being cerebral trauma, followed by stroke and hypoxic encephalopathy. pDoC is classified into vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) according to the level of residual consciousness. VS refers to a state in which basic brainstem reflexes and sleep-wakefulness cycles are preserved, with spontaneous or stimulated eye-opening, but with no consciousness. MCS refers to the presence of clear signs of consciousness with discontinuity and fluctuation in patients after severe brain injury. It is more difficult for patients in VS to recover consciousness, while MCS patients have good recovery potential. New clinical and imaging data suggest that some pDoC patients may still benefit from therapeutic interventions several years after the onset of the disease. Most studies aimed at improving the level of consciousness and functional recovery of patients are open trials or case reports about behavior or brain imaging. The results of a few randomized controlled trials, especially on noninvasive neurostimulation treatments, have been published. It suggests that new therapies such as neurostimulation are valuable for the treatment of DoC, while the stimulation method and parameters still need further testing and validation.",

These observations suggest that memory stores in senile dementia remain outside the destructive action of the senile atrophic process, in any case until the expressive speech is preserved. Storage of the information acquired before the appearance of the symptoms of dementia is unlikely to depend on the degree of its personality importance. Before it becomes strongly manifest, senile dementia does not prevent the stamping on the person's memory, at least of part of new information (possibly, of only emotionally significant). Such material may also be stored in the patients' memory even in case of pronounced dementia. Difficulties in active reproduction of the ideas available in memory stores can already be seen at the early stages, becoming more remarkable as the disease progresses.",

      "abstract": "The syndromes of oculogyric crisis (OGC) and paroxysmal perceptual alteration (PPA) in chronic schizophrenics have been investigated. The perceptual symptoms of PPA are characterized by hypersensitivity of perception, psychedelic experience (brightening of colors, sharpening of contrast, visual distortion, etc.) and a disorder of somatic schema (one feels that one is floating, one's extremities are pulled and elongated, etc.). PPA in chronic schizophrenics occurs abruptly mainly in the evening, often precipitated by fatigue. During the attack patients also suffer from mood and thought alteration (anxiety, agitation, depressive mood and inability to distract their thought from one thing), but they are aware that symptoms of PPA are not real and apprehensive about them. The attack ceases gradually and spontaneously while the patient rests or sleeps. The syndrome of OGC occurs in a similar fashion as in PPA; the attack occurs mainly in the evening and is also associated with a variety of transient mood and thought disturbances similar to those in PPA. Four cases have been described in this study, who experienced both PPA and OGC simultaneously. Among 223 schizophrenic patients admitted to our hospital between April 1987 and September 1988, 18 cases with OGC, 5 cases with PPA, and 4 cases with both PPA and OGC were found. The mean +/- SD dose of neuroleptics (chlorpromazine equivalent) at the latest occurrence of these syndromes was 761 +/- 470 mg (N = 22, ranging from 195 to 2010 mg) for OGC and 773 +/- 587 mg (N = 9, ranging from 227 to 2010 mg) for PPA. The appearance of OGC in cases with 195 mg or more dose (chlorpromazine equivalent) of neuroleptics of OGC in cases with with 195 mg or more dose (chlorpromazine equivalent) of neuroleptics (NLP) is significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that in cases with less than 195 mg of NLP. Similarly, the appearance of PPA in cases with 277 mg or more dose of NLP was higher (p less than 0.1) than that in cases with less than 277 mg of NLP. In paranoid schizophrenic patients the incidences of OGC and PPA were significantly lower (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively) than those in other types of schizophrenics. In disorganized schizophrenic patients the incidence of PPA was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than those in undifferentiated, residual and schizoaffective types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "Sleep in Patients with ESRD Undergoing Hemodialysis",
      "abstract": "Sleep has been identified as an essential human need; this is partly because of the metabolic activities that occur while the individual is sleeping. Normal sleep is divided into non–rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM sleep comprises 75% to 80% of total sleep time (TST), and is characterized by relatively quiescent brain activity and decreased metabolic rate (Carskadon & Dement, 2000). NREM sleep consists of four stages (S1-S4), with each stage leading to a progressively deeper sleep. REM sleep follows slow wave sleep (SWS), or deep sleep, and increases over the night, comprising 20% to 25% of TST. REM sleep is characterized by an activated EEG pattern, muscle atonia, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movements. Normal sleep provides a period of physiologic and mental rest. During sleep, sympathetic tone decreases and parasympathetic tone increases, leading to a reduction in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and cardiac output (Rosenthal, 1998). Deep sleep is theorized to be necessary for physiologic restoration. REM sleep is associated with dreaming, and is essential for maintaining emotional and cognitive well-being (Redline et al., 2004). Waking and consciousness depend on the activity, of neurons in the ascending reticular activating system of the brainstem. These neurons project into the thalamus, hypothalamus and basal forebrain and eventually send projections to the cortex. There are particular neurotransmitters, such as the catecholamines, acetylcholine, histamine, glutamate and aspartate, that are localized within the reticular formation and have important roles in cortical activation and arousal (Jones, 1989). Sleep-promoting neurotransmitters include gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine, and melatonin. Specific stages of sleep are regulated by the turning “on” and “off” of various neurons. REM “on” use GABA, acetylcholine, and glutamine, whereas REM “off” use norepinephrine and serotonin. REM On cells are cholinergic in the lateral pontine and medial medullary reticular areas that innervate the thalamus, hippocampus and hypothalamus. These discharge at high rates during REM and show little or no activity during NREM.REM Off cells are noradrenergic and serotonergic found in the locus coeruleus and raphe. These are which are slow or silent during REM sleep. Affecting levels of norepinephirne or serotonin can have an effect on REM sleep (Hoyt, 2005). Sleep regulation is a balance between a homeostatic sleep need and an intrinsic body clock, or circadian pacemaker. Located in the suprachiasmic nucleus, the circadian pacemaker determines the onset and termination of sleep, and is partially regulated by environmental",

      "title": "Mesothalamic Dopaminergic Activity: Implications in Sleep Alterations in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Movement, sleep and cognition: three connected realms enriching to the human life. Three harmed realms limiting parkinsonian patients. A degenerative process in dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra (SN) midbrain nucleus is the basic origin underlying a set of symptoms developed in patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) (Andrade & Ferraz, 2003). The devastating motor difficulties usually do not appear isolated. Indeed, PD consists of distinct kinds of manifestations involving motor and mental rigidity as well as sleep alterations (Dubois & Pillon, 1996; Rye et al., 2000; De Cock et al., 2008; Arnulf & Leu-Semenescu, 2009). Even though impairments in other brain nuclei also contribute to the symptoms present in PD (Braak et al., 2000), it is surprising how so distinct brain systems suffer influence of the degenerative alterations in the SN. This phenomenon may be regarded as a simple consequence of the connections between the SN and diverse brain areas. As a matter of fact, it also highlights that distinct behavioral aspects are achieved through the sharing of brain resources. Here, we examine through a neurocomputational model relationships between alterations in the mesothalamic dopaminergic activity (MDA) and sleep impairments in PD. With origins in the SN, the mesothalamic pathway (MP) reaches the thalamic complex, in particular the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Investigations on such dopaminergic pathway, evidenced by Freeman and colleagues (Freeman et al., 2001), have been contributing to a more global comprehension of cognitive processes in the brain. Based on experimental results (Floran et al., 2004), the mathematical model proposed in (Madureira et al., 2010) indicates a way by which the mesothalamic dopamine inhibits neurons in the TRN. And computational simulations of this model suggest that alterations in the MDA lead to inattention symptoms as observed in PD and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Thalamic neurons are able to spike under tonic and burst states (Steriade et al., 1993; Llinas & Steriade, 2006). Whenever in the tonic state, these neurons respond linearly to input stimuli. By this way, they propagate information reliably from perceptual systems to the cerebral cortex, where a more refined processing takes place. This mode of activity is crucial to the thalamocortical filtering of perceptual stimuli that allows attention focusing (Madureira et al., 2007, 2010; Carvalho, 1994).",

Inappropriate sleep habits in children have increased in developed countries and have become a major public health concern. Indeed, the impositions of daily life in technologically advanced societies on sleep and wake schedules have markedly shortened the total duration of sleep that children obtain these days. When sleep fragmentation is conducted in healthy adults using auditory stimuli to elicit arousals throughout the night, detriments in performance are clearly apparent the following day. Acute sleep restriction for one night in children has been shown to increase inattentive behavior the following day, although no changes were observed in hyperactive or impulsive behaviors.",

      "title": "Physiological Responses to Hypoxia in the Absence of Brain Glycogen",
      "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis: Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of glucose and is an important form of energy storage in mammals. The brain is able to form glycogen in astrocytes and neurons via glycogen synthase and branching enzyme. Once formed, brain glycogen functions as the only stored energy source for these cells. Various physiological roles for brain glycogen have been hypothesized, including memory consolidation and sleep regulation, as well as a protective role during various physiological stressors, such as hypoglycemia and hypoxia. For instance, rat brain glycogen levels were decreased 10 minutes after vaginal birth, but not after a C-section. This suggested that cerebral hypoxia experienced during vaginal birth induced the utilization of brain glycogen to minimize neurodegeneration during the hypoxic event. Symptoms of hypoxia can range from tachycardia, tachypnea, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis to confusion, loss of motor coordination and cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and brain death. The many causes of hypoxia include lungs diseases (COPD, pneumonia, pulmonary edema), CNS depressants (opiates), heart problems (CHF), anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We hypothesized that the lack of brain glycogen would cause a noticeable detrimental effect to the survival time and physiologic functions of mice exposed to acute hypoxia. Experimental Design or Project Methods: We subjected mice, with or without glycogen synthase disrupted in the brain, to carbon dioxide- or nitrogen-induced hypoxia and monitored effects on brain glycogen levels, behavior, and survival time. Results: We found that mice lacking brain glycogen exhibited the characteristic physiologic responses to hypoxia, but expired ~50% sooner than mice with brain glycogen. Conclusion and Potential Impact: These results provide evidence that brain glycogen is imperative in responding to hypoxic events. Further, these findings suggest that brain glycogen may protect patients with OSA against other comorbidities, especially neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.",

Classically, night terrors arise during the first sleep cycle, usually within 1-3 hours of sleep. Parents identified the following as precipitants: overtiredness, fever, separation, loss, moving, divorce, change of school, death in the family, return to school from vacation, or change of school. The prevalence of sleepwalking and night terrors in first-degree relatives was estimated as being ten times greater than in the general population. Treatment of night terrors can be divided into two categories: behavioral and medical strategies. Night terrors are fascinating entities that share many of the same characteristics of the other parasomnias occurring as arousals from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological problem and encompasses a variety of functional, anatomical, and pathological disturbances. Patients suffering from chronic pain of neuropathic origin experience worsened health and greater disability than those not suffering from this type of pain. Disorders of the peripheral nervous system, including sensory disturbance, are commonly seen in adults. Peripheral neuropathy has a prevalence of 2.4% in the general population and increases with age to an estimated 8% in those over 55 years of age. Nerve fibers affected by peripheral neuropathy may serve motor, sensory, or autonomic functions; the fibers may be large or small; the distribution of neuropathic involvement may be proximal, distal, or multifocal; and the onset of symptoms may be acute (less than 3 weeks), subacute (3 weeks to 3 months), or chronic (over 3 months). Peripheral neuropathy may occur as a result of several common and many rare diseases, but the most common cause is diabetes. Diseases of the peripheral nervous system may involve muscles (myopathies), nerves (neuropathies, with axons and myelin being affected), and neuromuscular junctions. The subject of peripheral neuropathy; its anatomy; and physiology, classification, evaluation, treatment, and prognosis is an extremely broad topic, and the intent of this chapter is to present a summary review, not an exhaustive analysis of the subject.",

      "title": "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome",
      "abstract": "The neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) involves fever, extrapyramidal rigidity, and disturbances of autonomic function and consciousness. It occurs more often with high potency and depot forms, frequently 3 to 9 days after initiation and sometimes years later, and is not related to dose or previous exposure. About 40% of cases had evidence of an affective disorder. NMS apparently results from deficient compensatory mechanisms following blockade of dopaminergic regulation of muscle tone and autonomic function. Possible indicators of vulnerability and various treatments are discussed. Neuroleptic challenge resulted in recurrence of symptoms in about one third of cases. Symptoms sometimes subsided despite continued treatment. Early diagnosis and effective treatment have reduced the risk of such challenge.",
