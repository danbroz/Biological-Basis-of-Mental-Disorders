      "title": "Morbid jealousy: The green-eyed monster",
      "abstract": "Jealousy is a commonly experienced emotion which has been observed in infants as young as 5-6 months of age and across the lifespan of an individual. In its extreme form jealousy can be pathological, when the belief which may be a delusion, obsession or an overvalued idea, is held on inadequate grounds and is unaffected by rational discussion. Morbid jealousy differs from normal jealousy in its intensity or rationality. It can be thought of as hypersensitive jealousy since jealous reactions are experienced at a much lower threshold than in average individuals. Morbid jealousy is a disorder in which an individual believes that their partner is, or will be, sexually unfaithful. Morbid jealousy can occur when a partner is in fact being unfaithful, provided that the evidence for the infidelity is incorrect and there is an excessive or irrational response to such evidence. The preoccupation with the partner's infidelity is often triggered by vivid mental images of their partner's past or present relationships.",

      "title": "Child sexual abuse : Disclosure, social support and subjective health in adulthood",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a known risk factor for ill-health. It is assumed that the health consequences are worse if the abuse has been considered severe or if the child has been exposed to cumulative trauma, e.g. physical abuse or other stressful life events. However, symptom development seems to vary widely between individuals. According to developmental theories the dynamic interplay between environmental and individual conditions creates a course toward either healthy or maladaptive outcomes. Social support has been shown to have a strong influence, direct or indirect, on abuse sequelae – a higher amount of support is related to better psychological functioning. However, adult victims may have difficulties forming close relationships with others due to lack of trust and other abuse aftermath. Further, despite a high risk for ill-health victims often fail to disclose the abuse. If they do tell they are not rarely met by negative reactions, which has been related to worse outcome. Delayed disclosure is related to intrafamilial abuse, closeness to the perpetrator, multiple perpetrators, age at onset and severe abuse. The victim may experience a psychological disclosure dilemma: the need to tell in order to get support is weighed against the risk to receive negative reactions. Thus, the overall aim of the thesis was to contribute knowledge concerning the relationship between child sexual abuse, disclosure, social support, and subjective health in adult women reporting experiences of sexual child maltreatment. Methods. The thesis was based on a study with a cross-sectional design using retrospective data about abuse and disclosure experiences as well as current data about health and social support. Participants (n = 152, aged 20-60 years) were recruited by advertisements in a membership magazine published by a national organisation for sexually abused women providing activities for support and healing, as well as in staff magazines for municipal employees in the Stockholm area. Data was retrieved by both a semi-structured interview and questionnaires. Analyses included quantitative methods (variable-approach and person-approach) as well as qualitative methods. Results. The results showed that disclosure characteristics were more prominently related to health than sexual abuse characteristics. Moreover, in spite of experiences of severe abuse and negative reactions after disclosure it was possible to get access to health enhancing social support in adulthood. The relation between disclosure-related events and health was dependent on source and type of reaction, in favour of partner and friends. A positive reaction from a partner was strongly related to subjective health. It may be crucial for victims of CSA who have problems with trust and intimacy to get emotional support, acceptance and respect from a partner in overcoming these feelings. Further, two groups of women reporting good health in spite of severe abuse were found by cluster analysis. The groups were among other things characterised by a high proportion of women who had formerly been active members in the support organisation. A qualitative analysis of the member’s experiences from the organisation showed that a victim process altering the victim identity over time seemed to constitute an important part of the individual development. However, few members who had gone through crucial steps of the victim process seemed to remain in the organisation passing the knowledge on to new members, thus creating a chronic structural problem for the organisation to deal with. Conclusions. Social support is a crucial protective factor for victims of child sexual abuse, a group highly at risk for and ill-health and adverse outcome. Victims of child sexual abuse seek and receive social support in various ways depending on severity of abuse, timing of disclosure and choice of disclosure receiver. Thus, the whole disclosure process during life is important to consider when studying disclosure-related events in relation to social support and health. Further, different methods of analyses may contribute to the understanding of how risk and protective factors interact. Both variableand person-based methods pointed at the importance of resources like self-esteem and social support above the amount of risk factors for health outcome. Finding ways to combine self-help with professional help might be fruitful and constitutes a further challenge for psychiatry when it comes to the task of developing new and effective care for this group.",

      "title": "Child Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "Abstract Child sexual abuse is typically defined as any sort of sexual contact between a child and an adult (or significantly older teenager), including sexual solicitation of, or exposure to, a child by an older person. It may include unwanted and inappropriate physical contact with the child's genitals; sexual touching, manipulation, or fondling; penetration in terms of vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse or attempted intercourse; as well as exposing children to sexual images or forcing them to watch pornography or to witness adult sexual acts. Child sexual abuse can vary along a number of dimensions, including pattern, frequency, duration, age at onset, and relationship of victim to perpetrator. Experience with and exposure to sexual abuse in childhood are particularly associated with long‐term psychological effects and profoundly shape victims' lives well into adulthood by increasing the probability of negative psychological outcomes such as poor self‐esteem, lack of a sense of control or agency, and associated mental disorders. The level of harm may be affected by multiple factors such as duration and frequency of abuse, use of force, and penetration, and the social stigma of child sexual abuse often compounds the psychological harm to children.",

Involving the patient's sexual partner in treatment is imperative if marital difficulty is part of the presentation, or if the spouse has rejected the sexual behavior. This chapter addresses patients with primarily aggressive disorders sometimes manifested in sexual terms to some extent.

Presenting complaints generally focus on guilt or difficulty with one's sexual partner.

      "abstract": "When children exhibit unusually intense or persistent sexual interests or behavior, this is an indication that they have been exposed to more than the expectable amount of sexual experience, Although sexualized behavior and/or statement is a symptom of sexual abuse, it is not necessarily an indication of sexual abuse. The possibility of false allegation needs to be considered, particularly if allegations are coming from the parent rather than a child, if parents are engaged in dispute over custody or visitation, and/or if the child is a preschooler. False allegations may arise in other situations as well, such as the misinterpretation of a child's statement or behavior by relative or caretakers. And children may make false statement in psychiatric evaluations. A case of false allegation of sexual abuse made by mentally retarded 10 year-old girl who has been located in an institute is presented. During her evaluation process, it was clinician's diagnostic impression that she had no been sexually abused but sexually stimulated in some way, and most of what she said was a fantasy lie. Its pathological mechanism is discussed in terms of pseudologia fantastica along with the review of literatures.",

Key characteristics include being acutely tuned in to others' emotional needs and prone to feeling rejected. People with features of this personality style also tend to base their self-worth on others' perceptions of them and worry about the quality of their relationships with others. Although they may recognise that they tend to ‘lose themselves’ in relationships and become too attached, they are generally unable to prevent such pathological types of attachments from forming. As a direct result of their fears of abandonment, people with characteristics of the rejection sensitivity personality style may act in ways to please others at the expense of their own emotional health.

      "title": "Psychological Aspects of Child Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT.According to statistics, about 90% of people were emotionally abused in childhood, but many do not realize, deny or, worse, their own children or others, considering that their treatment of childhood was natural and normal. Emotional is form of aggression, but law can not penalize it. Most parents believe that child means physical or violence and / or child neglect. But they do not know that they can hurt child simply by their excessive attitude. The emotional is any behavior that is intended to control, subjugate, submit other beings through fear, intimidation, humiliation, blaming, and growing guilt, coercion, manipulation, invalidation etc. The consequences of emotional are multiple, varied, extremely serious; they leave marks for life, affecting child development at various levels - emotionally, intellectually and even physically. Moreover, it will affect future adult's social and professional life, relationships and physical and mental health, to greater or lesser extent, depending on type of emotional abuse, and on its frequency and intensity.Keywords: behavior, emotional abuse, violence, control, abuse1. IntroductionAbuse means use of force in order to try to dominate child, to compel him/her to do dangerous things that he/she does not want to do, expose him/her to hazardous situations or to situations perceived by him/her as dangerous. Any action that causes injury or psycho-emotional disorders is an abuse.The can be of several types:Physical - involves use of physical force against children and subjecting them to hard work that exceed their capabilities, actions that result in damage of their body integrity.Emotional - is inappropriate behavior of adults towards children, behavior that adversely affects child's personality in development. Child rejection, forced isolation, terrorization, ignoration, humiliation and corruption are manifestations of child abuse.Sexual - consists in exposing child to watching pornography, seduction (advances, caresses and promises) or involvement in acts of any kind.Economic - implies attracting, persuading or forcing child to do income generating activities, adults close to child at least partially or indirectly benefiting from this revenue. The economic leads to removing child from school, thus depriving him of to access superior social and cultural levels.Neglection - is adult's inability or refusal to appropriately communicate with child, and limited access to education.The term sexual abuse refers to exploitation of child whose age does not allow him/her to understand nature of contact and to adequately resist it. This exploitation may be done by child's friend whom he/she is psychologically dependent on.The can have different aspects:- evocation (phones, exhibitionism, pornography, content of adult's language etc.)- stimulation (erotic contact, masturbation, incomplete genital contact, forced participation in sexuality of couple etc.)- making sex (rape or attempted rape).1.2 Issues of Abusea) Children may be abused since very young.Children may be abused from very early age. They are often seduced by games in sexual- abusive situation. The abuser often establishes positive relationships with both parents and child.The child is encouraged or forced to engage in abusive relationship. This is achieved through rewards and / or threats. The activity is presented as something special, and child should be considered lucky because he/she has a chance to participate in it. The child is unable to understand what is happening. Just when he/she is told that the game is secret he/she begins to understand that something is wrong. …",

      "title": "Psychosocial Adjustment of Women Who were Sexually Victimized in Childhood or Adolescence",
      "abstract": "As many as one third of all women have experienced sexual victimization as juveniles, and a range of emotional, inter-personal, and sexual problems appear to be frequent among these victims. On the current evidence, it is not possible to determine the extent to which these problems are a direct result of the exploitive sexual encounter or of other circumstances in the victims' lives. Nor can the incidence rates for various problems among victimized and non-victimized women be stated with any certainty, the samples on which estimates are made being biased and limited in many ways. Emotionally, the problems of guilt, low self-esteem, and depression, are extremely common among victims, especially those who seek treatment. The interpersonal relationships of many victims are characterized by feelings of isolation, alienation, and difference from other people, together with much mistrust and insecurity. There is some conflict of evidence over the prevalence of hostile or fearful attitudes towards men. Some victims do appear to avoid a lasting relationship with a man and many engage in a series of more transient and casual relationships. Prostitution also seems to be associated with sexual victimization in childhood. Among victims there appear to be tendencies to oversexualize all relationships with men, to engage repeatedly in ill-matched and punitive partnerships, and to exhibit a fear of intimacy. The evidence is contradictory on the incidence of homosexuality among women victims. Sexual problems, and more particularly sexual dysfunctions, appear to be more frequent among victimized compared to non-victimized women, The dysfunctions exhibited include lack of motivation, sexual phobias, vaginismus, impaired arousal, difficulty in reaching climax, dyspareunia, and sexual dissatisfaction. There is wide variation in adjustment between women victims, and among the factors that may contribute to these individual differences are the age of the child victim, the duration of the victimization, the nature of the sexual activity involve, and the perception of the woman concerning her feelings at the time of the victimization and its effects on her.",

There is consistent evidence that a history of physical or sexual abuse is a risk factor and some evidence for other risk factors, including poor family or parent-child communication, loss of caregiver to separation or death, and psychopathology in first-degree relatives. However, the researchers of the vast majority of studies did not attend to whether the putative risk factors preceded the development of suicidal symptoms; thus, most of the claims regarding family risk factors are not justified by their research designs and findings.",

      "abstract": "Genetic research raises ethical issues that differ in many ways from those that arise in other kinds of human subject research. Aside from the generally low likelihood of injury from drawing blood, the harms that might result to subjects once the genetic data is obtained range from minor to major, from physiological to psychosocial and even economic. Disclosure of results may cause loss or increased cost of health and/or life insurance, discrimination and stigmatization. In this presentation, I am going to discuss the issue through the followings: Privacy and confidentiality Unlike other kinds of health data, genetic information applies to or is about more than one person. (parents, siblings, children, and perhaps others). Research that includes follow-up studies requires that a subjects unique information be linked to the genetic information. For this and other reasons, many investigators seek to unlink personal identifiers from genetic data or biological specimens. Successful unlinking reduces or eliminates some threats to privacy and confidentiality. Informed consent The participant should be adequately informed. Consent should be free from coercion or undue influence. The participant should be fully competent. Risks of harm The idea of testing can cause pre- and post-test anxiety. Disclosure of results may result in employment and social bias, discrimination and stigmatization. Family members of the index subject may face similar risks of harm. The presentation also tackles the subject of research on stored biological samples and the ethical issues, with discussion of the laws and regulations applicable.",

      "title": "The Role of Self Esteem in Developing Social Anxiety",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, anxiety is a growing phenomenon because people come across more and more stressful situations. Therefore, among its different forms of manifestation, there is social anxiety. This type of anxiety generally starts in adolescence, when personality is still shaping up and when teenagers are more and more interested in getting confirmation from others. When he is analyzed by others, a teenager fears failure and being ashamed when things are not the way they should, he fears being judged by others for possible small mistakes and, thus, anxiety appears. In other words, persons with low self-confidence and lacking confidence in their abilities have low self-esteem and can easily develop a form of anxiety. As we have already mentioned, social anxiety is caused by the fear of being criticized by others, by the fear of being improperly evaluated, by the feeling of being ashamed, of being in the presence of unknown persons, etc. All these social contexts are backgrounds for individuals’ unexplainable restlessness that can lead to physical symptoms such as excessive perspiration, trembling, palpitations, blushing etc. Self-esteem is very important here as it is very important how the subject sees himself or herself in the social situation. Thus, if a person feels unable to deal with situations considered difficult and if there is lack of confidence in her/his own abilities, meaning he/she has low self-esteem, it is highly possible that this behaviour lead to the debut of social anxiety. Therapy sessions help reduce and even eliminate this disturbance. There are certain techniques consisting of facing the problems up to the moment where the subject begins feeling comfortable with normal life aspects which used to be considered anxiety episodes.&#x0D;",

      "abstract": "A case of a mother confabulating an extended sexual abuse of her 13 and 15 year old children involving bizarre sadistic features is presented and discussed. The kinship to Munchhausen Syndrome by proxy, identity diffusion, Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome, folie à deux and other concepts is highlighted. It is suggested that sexual confabulations are generated within incestuous family structures as a means to stimulate and satisfy needs of personal closeness when losses and disruptive events have occurred. The disclosure or suspicion of sexual abuse may prove neither true nor false but may hint to an impending emotional breakdown of a parent and to ongoing subtle incestuous traumatisation of a child.",

      "abstract": "Some important psychosocial factors which lead to unwanted pregnancies -- fear, embarrassment, conflicting priorities, and subconscious motivation -- are reviewed along with the need for nurses to be aware of their own attitudes about contraception and sexuality when counseling clients about contraception. Individuals may hesitate to use effective contraceptive methods because of reported side effects or because they fear the judgmental attitudes of others. Embarrassment about discussing anything related to sexuality or having a medical examination can mean a woman will avoid certain contraceptive methods. Frequently, contraceptive use is subordinated to some other concern, reflecting a lack of maturity, an inability to focus objectively or to plan, to assume responsibility, to accept one's own behavior. Priorities commonly affecting contraceptive use include: the \"nice girls don't\" ideology; \"it won't happen to me;\" \"excitement is taking risks;\" loneliness; and crises and pressures. Although pregnancy may be rejected when it actually happens, it may be desired in part. The desire for pregnancy may be operating at a subconscious level. Additionally, pregnancy may be used to deal with or avoid conflicts in relationships, to ease guilt, or to make up for losses. Nurses counseling clients in family planning clinics can help their clients do a cost/benefit analysis of contraceptive use and pregnancy should it occur. A way to help women explore their available options is group sessions. Nurses should be aware of the goals of family planning work and help each client explore for herself the ramifications of the use of each of the available contraceptive methods.",

      "abstract": "Violence against women by their male partners is widespread and infrequently identified as a causal factor in multiple physical and psychological problems of female patients in medical and psychiatric settings. Three main countertransferences that interfere with accurate identification of battered women are described: (1) counter- identification, (2)countertransference rage, and (3) countertransference helplessness. Battering men and battered women are found in all levels of society, although younger, lower income, less-educated men who have observed parental violence in their own home are at higher risk of abusing their spouses. Additionally, antisocial personality disorder, depression, and/or alcohol and drug abuse increase the risk of male violence in the home. Contrary to popular belief, the husband-to-wife violence is usually motivated by his need to control her rather than a result of his loss of control. Battered women show no consistent prebattering risk markers, except for a history of parental violence in their family of origin. Violence against women by their male partners is a serious public health problem that has not been adequately addressed by the medical and psychiatric professions. Myths and clinical realities of battered women are described and detailed recommendations for clinical inquiry and evaluation of level of danger are given.",

      "abstract": "Background It used to be called ‘impotence’: a double-edged label, with its implication not only that the man is unable to persuade blood into his penis, but also that he’s powerless in sexual situations, in the relationship arena, and in life. The word was never just a medical description; it always held undertones of accusation – a word to be hurled across the room during late-night arguments. How preferable that we now use the term ‘erectile dysfunction’ (ED): descriptive, non-judgmental, and with no misunderstandings. Problem is, there’s still a misunderstanding here, and a serious one at that. We still think that ED is only about the man, his penis and his problem. Wrong. Yes of course the man suffers – and deeply. It’s not just the day-to-day lack of sexual performance, not just the panic that normal service will never be resumed. It’s also the low self-esteem, the failing confidence when he compares himself with other men. It’s the guilt at what he sees as failure towards his partner. And it’s the intimation if not of mortality, certainly of frailty and old age. ED can all too easily turn into a symbol of male helplessness and hopelessness, which is why the original ‘im-potent’ term struck disturbingly to the very heart of the problem. So yes, the man suffers. But what not only my postbag but recent studies 1 suggest is that the man’s partner suffers too. And that means that his ED can also become her (or conceivably, his) sexual and emotional dysfunction, and then become a relationship dysfunction rippling out through the whole of the couple’s lives.",

The impact of parental loss during childhood is life-long. Its myriad manifestations can be broadly grouped under the following categories: continued intrapsychic relationship with the dead parent, mental pain and defenses against it, narcissistic imbalance, disturbances in the development of aggressive drive, problems in the realm of love and sexuality, disturbances in the subjective experience of time, and attitudes towards one's own mortality. To be sure, a provision is important in the treatment of all patients but it acquires greater valence in those with a background of childhood parental loss. While they might not have consciously experienced or registered it as such during childhood, adults orphaned as children remain forever vulnerable to separation anxiety, or to use Fred Pine's more evocative term, 'separateness anxiety'; this involves discomfort and disorientation over the sense of separateness from others.",

It has a profound effect on people from all social classes. Because there was no standard term for violence, which made it a complicated and pervasive issue, it was not previously seen as a public health concern2. There is more to understanding violence than just tying it to empirical data. Instead, it entails making decisions about what constitutes proper and acceptable behaviour, which are influenced by societal norms, beliefs, and practices3. The deliberate use of force, real or threatened, towards themselves, another individual, an organisation or society, or oneself is what the World Health Organization, or WHO, defines as violence. This conduct has the risk of causing injury, death, psychological suffering, stunted growth, or impoverishment4. Although professional violence, including punching, kicking, shoving, hitting, shooting, and harming, has been acknowledged, until recently, little has been done to combat intellectual assault5. The intentional use of harm towards a person or group, including the threat or application of blunt force, is referred to as psychological abuse. The victim of this kind of assault may have detrimental effects on their psychological, ethical, moral, physical, and cognitive well-being6.",

It is also pointed that hypoactive sexual desire can be caused by: long-term sexual abstinence; response to a sexual disorder of one’s male/female spouse (male/female partner); psychological response to another sexual dysfunction in the other person. Besides, weak sexual desire can be revealed in homosexual men and women, who have not accepted their sexual orientation to the end. The article gives data about influence of cultural/religious factors on the frequency of sexual desire. For example, noticeable differences exist in the levels of incidence of low desire in different cultures: from 12.5% in men from Northern Europe to 28% in men from South-East Asia at the age of 40-80. The association between the East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men can be mediated by feeling of guilt. Lower values of sexual desire were detected in women from East Asia versus women of the Canadian origin.",

      "title": "The Experience of Shame in Social Phobia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONSocial phobia is highly prevalent anxiety disorder characterized by excessive fear of situations where an individual is subject to scrutiny of others. People with social phobia are concerned that they will react with noticeable and embarrassing signs of strong physiological arousal, such as blushing, shaking, or trembling. As consequence, activities such as eating, drinking, writing or speaking in public, expressing an opinion in group, and talking to member of opposite sex or to an authority figure may actively be avoided to evade perceived negative evaluation of others. As most of our everyday functioning involves contact with other people, social phobia can be an extremely disruptive disorder, which usually causes great distress in sufferer and sometimes for those close to them. Despite social phobia being an extremely disruptive and distressing anxiety disorder impacting many areas of an individual's life its etiology is still poorly understood.Parental Rearing Practices and Social PhobiaHaving known mean age of onset of disorder being in early adolescence contribution of early parental rearing practice in development of disorder seems appropriate to be explored. In fact parental rearing practices have been found to be one of key factors contributing to development of social phobia. Investigating role of parental influence on development of anxiety Rapee and Melville (1997) found significant association between child anxiety and greater parental control and protection and less warmth. Retrospective reports from adults with social phobia have also generally supported similar picture of early parental interaction characterized by greater control and less warmth disorder (Arrindell, Emmelkamp, Monsma and Brilman, 1983; Arrindell et al., 1989; Parker, 1979). Gellar (2000) also reported findings emphasizing relationship between social phobia and overprotective and rejecting parenting styles. Greco and Morris (2002) examining associations among perceived and actual father behavior and child social anxiety, found that fathers of high socially anxious children exhibited more controlling behavior. Taylor and Alden (2005) found that patients who reported childhood overprotection were less adept at taking in or discriminating social cues. A positive correlation between overprotection, rejection and children's anxiety symptoms was reported by Muris, Loxtonb, Neumannc, Kinge and Ollendickf (2006). Similarly, Gastel, Legerstee and Ferdinand (2009) found significant association between maternal and paternal overprotection and child anxiety.Shame and Social PhobiaShame was once considered sleeper in psychopathology (Lewis, 1987) has in recent years come to be seen as the bedrock of psychopathology (Miller, 1996). The word comes from Indo-European word skam meaning to hide and implies fear of exposure (Lewis, 1992). Lewis (1971) defines shame as a self-oriented emotion that involves global, negative self-evaluation associated with feeling of helplessness or sense of passivity in correcting perceived fault. Qian, Liu and Zhu (2001) describes shame as type of negative emotion accompanied by negative introspection and self-evaluation, which shows feature of ''self-orientation'' on phenomenological assessment. Many researchers regard shame as most self-reflecting emotion with subsequent self-evaluation in terms of useless, defectiveness, powerless and exposure in relation to others (Barrett, 1995; Gilbert and Andrews, 1998). Central to phenomenology of shame is presence of ''disapproving public eye'' (Hahn, 2000). Thus, when individuals experience shame, this painful awareness of an (actual or imagined) external critic causes feelings of worthlessness and inferiority, coupled with heightened self-consciousness and an instinctual urge to hide from further exposure resulting in avoidance of social interactions (Tangney, Wagner, and Gramzow, 1992). …",

      "title": "When Exoneration Seems Hopeless: The Special Vulnerability of Sexual Abuse Suspects to False Confession",
      "abstract": "This chapter considers sources of vulnerability among innocent sexual abuse suspects to police-induced false confession. We suggest that sexual abuse suspects may be particularly vulnerable to false confession, primarily as a result of their enhanced sense of hopelessness that they might be believed or be able to establish their innocence. Moreover, we suggest this sense of hopelessness derives largely from two factors: first, their perception of the evidentiary situation they face; and, second, stereotypes associating fathers, step-fathers, priests, boy scout leaders, day care personnel and others with sexual abuse. That is, we suggest sexual abuse claims are often characterized by (1) seemingly credible claims of one or more victims, (2) against a suspect whose social category is consistent with stereotypes of sexual abusers, (3) lack of concrete physical evidence that could exonerate the suspect, and (4) testimony of professional and nonprofessional witnesses in seeming support of the occurrence of the abuse and/or the suspect’s guilt that likewise cannot be refuted by concrete evidence. Sexual abuse suspects may therefore be less likely than most other innocent suspects to expect (a) that their claims of innocence will be believed in the absence of concrete proof of innocence, (b) that there will be a way to prove their innocence, or even (c) that there will be a way to effectively cast doubt on the validity of the alleged victim(s)’ claims of guilt or other apparently abuse supportive testimony. A primary goal of interrogation tactics is to instill in suspects such a sense of hopelessness, which then makes it easier for the interrogator to convince the suspect that confession will result in better legal outcomes than denial. For many sexual abuse suspects this goal may have been effectively met before they enter interrogation.",

The stress of infertility and its treatment may be a cause of sexual difficulties for both the prospective father and mother. Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established, so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem. Postcoital tests or having to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, adversely affecting his erectile or ejaculatory ability.

      "abstract": "People with Dependent Personality Disorder often have had parents that have protected them too much, underlining further the dangers of their decisions than the benefits. Overprotection of parents has led them to the development of passive behavior. Often the only source of stimulation in their environment has been the mother. The future dependents have developed an insecure attachment to their mother, leading them to feel more anxious to leave her. Often they have suffered a chronic illness in childhood or adolescence, and have not had sufficient satisfaction or have had too much satisfaction in the oral period. Responding to excessive frustration or to excessive satisfaction in childhood, they have developed a passive oral character, which often leads to weakness of character and tendency to alcoholism. The patterns of protector figures that have introjected will lead them to the choice of protector pairs and to the dependence on any protective figure, rather than to the choice of specific attachment figures. The need to distinguish themselves from others creates some uncertainty and anxiety to them and they show difficulty in securing personal identity. They show anxiety in the process of differentiation and they live the differentiation as a loss. They feel anxious when alone and euphoric in the company of protective figures. They live anchored in the dilemma of complete dependence or complete independence, without middle ground of more or less dependence. By failing to develop an autonomous personality, they are undecided, conformist and uncritical to the protective figures. They are more oriented towards the needs and desires of the people they love than towards their own needs. They are vulnerable to criticism from others and they are fear of failure. Their personality is characterized by a lack of self esteem, confidence and assertiveness, and the need for affection and the self-contempt. They are humble, kind, loyal, viscous, friendly and generous. They often develop psychosomatic disorders. Both the dependent and the avoidant personality have lack of security and fear of criticism. The avoidant is in great need of protection and affection, but usually does not trust others. The dependent, however, trust others. The avoidant keeps away from others and is isolated from others predicting exclusion. The dependent, however, fears being alone, trust others and seeks their protection. The therapist should set clear goals for patients with dependent personality, because they must go leaving the feeling of futility, as they achieve these goals. But the dependent personality always looks suspiciously the therapeutic advances that will lead him to independence. The therapist must teach behavioral skills and make decisions. The others must share their doubts with him. Objectives: Assess “Alexithymia” as a variable in patients with dysthymia. Material and Methods: Alexithymia Toronto Scale 20-items (TAS-20) and Zung`s Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) applied to 30 subjects. Mean (X), standard deviation (SD), positive cases percentage (%), Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, t-Student test accepting p ). Depression in dysthymic disorders and alexithymia showed a positive lineal correlation, r=+0.62. Conclusions: Dysthymia shows increased alexithymia.",

      "abstract": "Drug misuse and juvenile delinquency share overlapping aetiologies that are complex and multifaceted and include parental, social, psychological, environmental, and economic aspects. Initiation, maintenance, and even escalation of drug use and criminal behaviour in an individual are heavily influenced by social factors like culture, neighbourhood, and family. Juvenile delinquency can be influenced and sustained by factors such as family structure and functioning, broken homes, absent or unsatisfactory interpersonal relationships, unbalanced parenting, lack of guidance, economic instability, substance abuse or addiction in the family or among peers, access to addictive substances, exposure to physical, sexual, emotional abuse or trauma violence, and peer pressure. Psychological factors that can result in drug use and criminal behaviour include high stress, personality traits like high impulsivity or sensation seeking, depression, and anxiety. People who develop substance use disorders have excessive dependencies, which may initially be reinforced because they lower stress and lift spirits. The belief that drugs can provide solace and help lift one above all misery, which underlies continued drug use, is associated with this reduction. There has also been evidence of an association between early violent behaviour, impulsivity, and problems with concentration or attention.",

      "title": "The Emotional Background of Marital Difficulties",
      "abstract": "I N THE POPULAR MIND, marital difficulties and psychoanalysis are almost synonymous. There is a widespread belief that the majority of individuals who consult a psychoanalyst come because of with marriage. If for conscious dissatisfaction is substituted unconscious with the marital state, the popular belief is correct, for no matter how diverse the symptoms which the psychoneurotic patient presents to the psychoanalyst, closer scrutiny always reveals some psychosexual dissatisfaction. A marital relation in which the ideals of the man's or the woman's personality are realized while at the same time their diverse instinctual needs also find adequate expression is the goal for which men and women are striving in marriage. Yet it is increasingly evident that a large percentage of men and women either cannot marry or, if marriage occurs, can find little happiness in it. Their discontent may find expression in illness, unfaithfulness, psychosexual difficulties such as frigidity and impotence, psychoneurotic or even psychotic manifestations such as depression, delusional jealousy, or alcoholism. Anyone who goes through the case records of any psychiatrist or psychiatric clinic will immediately be struck by the frequent coincidence between an engagement or marriage and the onset of the psychosomatic, psychoneurotic, or psychotic disorder for which the patient is consulting a physician. The patient may be completely unconscious, or more or less of a causal connection between the marriage and the illness. One striking example of the desperate measures which an individual unconsciously took in order to preserve the illusion of a perfect marriage comes to my mind. A married woman of forty was sent by an internist who had been treating her for spastic colitis. In the course of the treatment, he had been struck by something queer in her personality. The woman came to the psychiatric consultation with a very sweet, fixed smile on her face. She protested immediately, before any question could be asked, that she had no need of psychiatric help since her marriage was an absolutely ideal one. When the psychiatrist made only a nonargumentative neutral reply to this statement, she continued her story. She had been married some fifteen to twenty years. She had wanted a child very much, but her husband did not. Of course she did not mind at all, she was sure she did not care whether she had a child. Throughout the last ten years of her marriage, she had had various illnesses which were always diagnosed as nothing wrong-or functional -in character. Five years ago, her husband became impotent-which she",

      "abstract": "Abstract Demonstrated here are the distinctive personality traits that matter in the discussion of rejection responses. On one hand, such reactions can be classified as emotionally rooted, cognition grounded, and behaviorally linked; while on the other, feedbacks can be based upon the level of self-confidence, conceit, anxiety, depression, attachment style, perceived social support, and sexual orientation. The extent of sensitivity to rejection is accounted for by the quality of personal relationships, which eventually establish the physical and the psychological well being of an individual. Although people are expected to experience negative emotions when faced with denunciation, refusal, or elimination (due to several factors), they react differently. Integrated and socially involved people are more likely to constructively surpass misfortunes, sudden unemployment, the unexpected death of loved ones, and other possible shocks. Similarly, people who lack healthy and affirmative social ties are more inclined to take maladaptive actions when they encounter difficult situations.",

      "abstract": "The article reviews data, much of rather recent origin, bearing on the assumption that human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood. The available data permit the following conclusions: l. We have no compelling evidence of a predictable relationship between child training practices and later personality. 2. Severe psychological stresses can have as marked effects in adulthood as in infancy and childhood, sometimes having greater effects in adulthood than in childhood. 3. Important personality changes occur after childhood (in the absence of treatment) including the disappearance of marked psychological disorders. 4. Infants reared according to ostensibly ideal methods of infant care show no greater immunity to mental illness than do other children reared differently. Infants reared under apparently inadequate or harmful circumstances do not necessarily develop psychological disorders. 5. Resemblances between patterns of behavior in children and adults can be explained without the hypothesis of a special impressionability or vulnerability of personality in childhood. 6. The initial immobility and the prolonged physical dependency of children upon adults places them at a special disadvantage in that they cannot readily change their environments to obtain new experiences. A lack of new experiences may give to the personality a pattern which appears more fixed than it really is. The assumption that the human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood remains unproven. Neither is it disproven. We need much further research in this area and this research may eventually show that the human personality is more plastic during childhood in some respects, but not in others.",

As the attention of narcissists is focused on themselves, they are preoccupied almost exclusively with their own thoughts, feelings, troubles and triumphs. Narcissistic, self-absorbed parents inadvertently have a devastating effect on their children because their preoccupation with themselves precludes real contact with their child. As noted, people who are vain have an inflated image of themselves that they use to compensate for feelings of inferiority, powerlessness, and self-hatred. Often people who are vain were treated as \"special\" by parents who overprotected and indulged them. As adults, they continue to expect this kind of treatment. Attitudes of superiority and a sense of entitlement are a natural outgrowth of imagining that one is extraordinary. Vanity or narcissism in one or more family members tends to reverberate throughout the entire family, affecting everyone.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Rejection sensitivity is the disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection by significant others. A model of the role of this disposition in male violence toward romantic partners is proposed. Specifically, it is proposed that rejection sensitivity is a vulnerability factor for two distinct maladaptive styles of coping with intimate relationships. Rejection‐sensitive men may attempt to prevent anticipated rejection by reducing their investment in intimate relationships. Alternatively, they may become highly invested in intimate relationships in search of an unconditionally supportive partner. Their low threshold for perceiving and overreacting to rejection, however, heightens their risk of responding aggressively to their partners’negative or ambiguous behavior. Cross‐sectional data from 217 male college students supported predictions derived from the model. Among college men who reported relatively high investment in romantic relationships, anxious expectations of rejection predicted dating violence. Among men who reported relatively low investment in romantic relationships, anxious expectations of rejection predicted reduced involvement in discretionary close relationships with friends and romantic partners and, more generally, increased distress in and avoidance of social situations.",

Jealousy is found in every culture and has been recorded throughout history as an integral component to human relationships. Although it is neither desired nor essential for healthy relationships, it is nevertheless a common, even ubiquitous response. All people experience jealousy at some point in their lives. Unfortunately, some people's experience of jealousy involves intense psychological turmoil that can lead to aggressive or maladaptive responses.

Some have endured gross insensitivity, disrespect, indifference, imbalance in give-and-take, or ingratitude. Substance abuse or destructive family patterns may have compromised or even ruined what could have been so much better. Sometimes we become unusually dependent on those who have died-to the point at which some of us have merged our identities with theirs, deferred to them on almost all decisions, or allowed them to manage nearly all details of our lives. Some of us have struggled with another’s attempts to control, manipulate, dominate, or even possess us. Some of us have been abused and actually harmed physically, sexually, or psychologically.

      "abstract": "The importance of primal-scene experience is suggested by the wide range of attention it has received, with a multitude of derivative phenomena being attributed to its influence. Emphasis has been on possible psychiatric problems, and almost all available reports are clinical and anecdotal. The classical psychoanalytic view has been that such stimulation, be it through actual witnessing or fantasy, results (especially in children) in experience of anxiety, intense eroticization, and sadomasochistic confusions about sexuality. It is suggested here that issues of affectional love and fears of aloneness and feelings of vulnerability may often be the focus of primal-scene reactions. A wide range of evidence has been presented here to support the view that primal-scene experience per se is not necessarily deleterious, and that traumatic or pathogenic effects usually occur only within a context of general brutality or disturbed family relationships. In contradistinction, some emphasis here has been placed on possible positive effects of primal-scene experience. There is a clear need for further study, especially among nonpsychiatrically selected persons, for understanding to be advanced regarding the vicissitudes of both normal and pathological primal-scene experience.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a time of great physiological and psychological change. Individuals have to progress from the dependence of childhood to the independence and maturity of the adult state whilst they are still regarded by many adults as predominantly children. Adolescents have to cope with the central problem of identity and of motivation and ambitions. They have to come to terms with the perceptions and judgements of other people on them and often experience stress in situations where they feel they are unable to reach the ideals of themselves or of others. Relationships with the opposite sex and acceptance by friends become crucial since they are the only means of judging one's self-value until the individual has achieved a reasonable degree of confidence and self-integration. This dependence on the opinions of others or on perhaps inappropriate ideals can lead to strong feelings of insecurity or inadequacy in adolescents. Adults obviously face similar problems but the myriad of physical and physiological changes which adolescents experience serve to heighten their emotional sensitivity. As a consequence of these adjustment problems, adolescence is often a period of unrest, of questioning and sometimes of outright rebellion and hostility.",

      "title": "Consequences of lonely experience in adolescents",
      "abstract": "The article explores the consequences of experiencing loneliness in adolescents, highlighting the negative impact on mental, physical and social health. Because adolescents feel the need to communicate and receive affection, aspiring to be understood and to have an interlocutor with whom to be honest. This stage of life often comes with emotional intensity, a state of euphoria, periods of sadness and, sometimes, a distancing from family, especially in situations of misunderstanding on the part of adults. The main danger at this stage refers to an excessive concern for oneself or the escape from interactions with others. The inability to form trusting relationships with others generates a feeling of loneliness. Relevant studies on the causes and factors that can lead to social isolation, as well as its effects on adolescents, emphasize the complexity and ambiguity of this phenomenon. The lack of a clear picture of how adolescents experience loneliness suggests that this phenomenon can take various forms. These forms can be manifested in different contexts of social isolation, either by choosing to isolate themselves or being forced to withdraw, and can influence both personal development and a wide range of causes, manifestations and effects on the existence of adolescents. When these needs are not met, there is a risk of developing emotional and social loneliness, the absence of connections with loved ones, and the search for belonging to informal groups. The article also analyzes theoretical perspectives on the fundamental needs of adolescents and how the lack of emotional connections affects personal development. Loneliness is associated with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, poor academic performance and risk behaviors, such as substance use or suicide attempts. Social isolation also influences physical health by increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders. The article emphasizes the importance of multidimensional interventions for the prevention and management of this phenomenon, recommending emotional support, social activities and the development of communication skills.",

      "abstract": "Sexual exploitation of children (under 14 years of age) is a common occurrence, although actual numbers are unknown. There are three major forms of sexual abuse: (1) incest, ie, sexual activity between consanguineous family members; (2) sexual assault, such as rape or molestation by adults not related to the child; and (3) habitual sexual exploitation for purposes of financial reward or perverse sexual satisfaction. Brother-sister incest has the highest incidence in the middle and upper socioeconomic levels and is probably the least damaging, psychologically, to sexual adjustment later in life. Father-daughter incest is more common in the lower socioeconomic levels and is thought to produce major disorders in the psychosexual area. Sexual assault of children, if handled supportively and with understanding by the surrounding adults, including parents, physicians, teachers, law enforcement officers, and others, can result in minimal sequelae; however, often the situation is handled with emotional reactions ranging from disgust to hysteria which result in the child's being victimized and traumatized unnecessarily. These latter situations lead to sexual acting-out in adolescence, promiscuity, perversions, or frigidity in adult sexual life. Teachers, physicians, and child welfare workers need to be attuned to the possibility to sexual abuse in the children they serve.",

Paraphili as indulged in abnormal and orthodox sex play by using objects as parts of the body or fantasies in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. Perversions are acts that are socially prohibited or unacceptable, or biologically undesirable. In sexual paraphilia, usually, person psychopaths suffer from mental aberrations and conflicts, socio-sexual maladjustments, psychosexual imbalance, and abnormalities. Paraphilia-induced suicide is a type of anomic suicide, and anomic suicide is due to a lack of social regulation that occurs during high levels of stress and frustration. Paraphilia may induce suicide even though paraphilia is not punishable. It is just due to fear of social defamation and social taboo. Case presentation: A 59-year-old male committed suicide on the railway track, and thenthe body was sent to the mortuary room for an autopsy examination. History was taken from the police and relatives. He was a widower for the last 15 years. Conclusions: Paraphilia is the form of the insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum, and when a person cannot remove foreign bodies himself, attending a hospital is very humiliating. To prevent the social integrity or selfesteem, the person committed suicide. Where this type of paraphilia is not listed as a crime in India, for sexual gratification, a person may use it by any means, which may be natural or unnatural form. Many unnatural forms of paraphilia are used by many people, which is not punishable. Sexual gratification is done by most of normal people and a few abnormal psychiatric people by any sexual perversion. All paraphilia that is not punishable by the law should not be considered a social taboo.",

      "title": "The Universality of Emotional Child Abuse.",
      "abstract": "Emotional child abuse is virtually inevitable in the context of the traditional nuclear family and often has a more detrimental effect on children than other, more widely publicized forms of maltreatment. Clinical, statistical, and empirical evidence shows that normative child-rearing practices in Western culture have pathogenic properties and effects. Parental abuse in the traditional nuclear family often results in the personal suffering, limitation, and maladjustment of children. Manifestations of this abuse include: (1) behavior based on parental hostility such as verbal abuse, sadistic socialization, and lack of respect for a child's boundaries, spontaneity, and individuality; (2) destructive practices including permissiveness and inconsistency; (3) overly restrictive or harsh moral codes; and (4) defenses and addictive patterns which tend to transmit from parents to children. A number of factors are involved in the psychodynamics of emotional maltreatment: (1) parents' ambivalent feelings toward themselves and their children; (2) their projection of their negative traits Onto their children; (3) a confusion of emotional hunger with love; (4) the exclusivity of traditional couplings; and (5) the utilization of the child as a symbol of immortality. The more parents were deprived or abused during their formative years, the greater the impairment of their parental functions. The nuclear family is not inherently detrimental to human mental health, but it has evolved into a destructive institution. Only by dealing with the issues that make families dysfunctional can family life be made more supportive and constructive for children. (Contains 118 references.)

      "abstract": "Abstract Childhood experiences such as physical and sexual abuse and neglect are adverse events with immediate and long-term consequences. However, in considering child abuse and neglect as examples of adverse life events that have the potential to affect development and subsequent psychopathology, the assumption of “well-being” in the child’s life prior to the victimization experience may not be a reasonable one. Although certain forms of childhood victimization may indeed be viewed as acute stressors, child abuse and neglect often occur against a background of more chronic adversity in multiproblem homes. Child abuse or neglect may be only one of a family’s problems. Thus the general effects of other family characteristics, such as poverty, unemployment, parental alcoholism or drug problems, or other inadequate social and family functioning, must be recognized and disentangled from the specific effects of childhood abuse or neglect.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality, particularly during adolescence, involves personality as a whole. During puberty, which starts the process of adolescence, adolescents are faced with the fact they have not chosen their body which sends them back to the experience of passivity of childhood. It arouses in the most vulnerable adolescents what remains of expectations or affective dependence regarding their family circle, and thus they are confronted with that basic human paradox, i.e. to be oneself one has to accept to receive and to feed upon others and at the same time to be different from them. Such a fear of being dependent on others may lead adolescents to deprive themselves of what they expect to receive from others. Sexuality and the body, through the emotions they summon, are particularly subject to aggressive or rejection behaviours which characterize that age.",

      "title": "Disorganized Attachment, Development of Dissociated Self States, and a Relational Approach to Treatment",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Disorganized (D) attachment, and the double-bind characteristics of the relationships that foster it, form a basis for theoretical approaches to understanding the development of alternating, dissociated self states with incompatible, idealizing/devaluing or victim/persecutor models of attachment, such as are observed in borderline personality and dissociative disorders. This model proposes that the double binds inherent in abuse by a primary caretaker are likely to generate two or more dissociated self states, with contradictory working models of attachment. In contrast, because dissociated states ensuing from extra-familial trauma can be expected to have been constructed primarily around fear, all parts of the self will operate according to the same attachment paradigm. Because relationships within the family of origin appear at least as important as trauma in the development of dissociated self states, this has important implications for treatment of child abuse survivors. D attachment may result from several parental behaviors: abuse, neglect, frightening, intrusive or insensitive manner; and disrupted affective communication. Longitudinal research demonstrates that D attachment in infancy predicts dissociation in childhood and early adulthood. Theoretical models describing the relationships among D attachment, the development of segregated internal working models of attachment, and the emergence of dissociated self states will be discussed. A relational approach to therapy calls for consideration of attachment issues in creating the frame for therapy and tailoring treatment to the individual trauma survivor. The therapist can serve as a relational bridge between dissociated self states, allowing the patient to internalize a working model of the therapeutic relationship. This interaction provides a vehicle for integrating dissociated self states and opportunity for development of more flexible, adaptive models of being with others.",

However, upon reviewing the available empirical literature with respect to epidemiologic. post mortem, risk factor, follow-up, family, twin, adoption, biological, and therapy studies, this postulated close relationship could not be confirmed. Factors such as presence of any psychiatric disorder and personality traits such as impulsivity, aggressivity, addiction and suicide/suicide attempts in first degree relatives. as well as divorce, separation and parental discord, all seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of suicidal behaviour. Furthermore, treatment studies with antidepressants, ECT, and lithium have only been able to demonstrate an antisuicidal effect for lithium. It remains an open question whether these factors play a independent role from depression or whether these factors have to be seen as additional to the depression. as operating factors for the development of suicide ideas. suicide attempts and suicide.",

      "title": "Social trauma: The pathogenic effects of untoward social conditions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychoanalysis has traditionally overlooked the fact that unsuitable and damaging life conditions, originating in the social milieu, play a part in the pathogenesis of emotional suffering and mental disorders. Nonetheless, the self establishes an object relation with the social system, as well as with the non-human environment. This is expected to act as a container–contained relationship. Whenever the community and its institutions fail to act as a container for individuals and groups, this generates a trauma, which can be compared with the baby's experience of a failure in mothering. Such failures can be classified in several categories. The first is when the social system fails to contain, nurture, care for, and protect individuals, as in the case of the lack of assistance and compassion towards the victims of poverty, disease, natural catastrophe, social turmoil, economic crisis, violence, or war. The second category occurs when there is a blatant attack, on the part of the authorities or privileged social groups, on minorities, or even on the bulk of the population, as in the case of social repression, war—both internal and external—racism, genocide, or persecution. The third is when there is a perversion of the social system, which feigns to uphold current social values and laws while actually breaking them, as in the case of corruption, chicanery, and mendacity on the part of the authorities. One recent example of this is the impeachment process against the Chief of Government of Mexico City. The author approaches this problem by exploring the consequences of such experiences for the development and functioning of personality structure and personal relations, as well as their repercussions for individuals living together in the community and for the necessary relation between them and the authorities.",

Some come distressed and tearful. They may feel shame and disgust about their symptoms or because of the reaction of others. Many find the whole consultation an ordeal.

      "abstract": "Shame is a painful, universal emotional response to a failure, shortcoming, or other wrongdoing of what society demands or what a person demands of him or herself. Scientists have learned that very young infants experience shame (as a personal feeling of unworthiness and shame), when they experience rejection-even if it is unintentional. Children, who are admonished for doing something over which they have limited or no control, are also capable of feeling shame. On a more serious, long-lasting scale, physical and sexual abuse and other traumatic experiences, particularly those that happen directly to the child, without adequate intervention, may lead to the development of shame as well. Considering the origin of the shame-wound is critical as well. If one is the child of abusive and/or addicted parents, their shame could have been an emotional and psychological transplant. Assessing if the shame is a consequence of actions, inactions, or someone elses conflicts, can allow for internal conflict resolution.",

      "title": "Tethered Love: When Failures in Adult Development Forge Inescapable Archaic Bonds",
      "abstract": "Character development does not end in childhood. It is a lifelong endeavor in which the undertaking of parenthood is a developmental stage. Parenting presents various challenges that promote maturation of the adult, while securing autonomy of the child. These adult developmental tasks include some that enhance abilities: respecting difference, accepting defiance, enduring anger, managing separations, and establishing identification with the child. In addition there are tasks that involve loss: relinquishing fantasies, tolerating disappointment, releasing the archaic bond, surrendering the helm, and withstanding one’s own abandonment. When the adult is incapable of successfully transiting through these parenting challenges, the child’s early ties to the primary caregiver are at risk of being abnormally extended. Parental refusal to relinquish the archaic attachment scuttles their offspring’s journey toward independence, and is referred to as “tethered love.” The concept of tethered love posits a pathogenesis of exaggerated compliance (or defiance) in children that begins with adult developmental failures in their caregivers. Clinical examples are used to underscore the suffocating impact of tethered love and demonstrate how the therapist must put aside feelings of distaste to better understand the child’s continuing connection to a constraining, even crippling, but often intensely loving parent.",

Abuse of children is defined on different manners in literature but the author gives essential elements for legal determination of this concept. Act of violence exists when a parent, using a physical power on a position of supremacy tyrannies a child endangering its life, health, physical or emotional development. Physical abuse of a child can be determined from several aspects: medical, legal, social and cultural. The phenomenon of abuse was first observed by medical doctor and described as 'the battered child syndrome'. Although, it seams easy to define the physical abuse, there are many various definitions. In this paper, physical abuse of a child in the family means physical acting of the parents or guardians, by which on purpose, by the use of physical force, with or without the use of other means, are caused or could be caused physical injuries or death of a child. Emotional abuse is defined as parent's or guardian's acting or non acting, such as rejection, insult, isolation, terror, verbal attack etc. that might cause serious and permanent disorders in child's emotional development. Sexual abuse is defined as the use of a child to satisfy the sexual needs of one or more adult persons who have authority over a child and in whom the child trusts. The sexual abuse survivors have lifelong psychological problems.",

When parents are overprotective or neglectful, abusive or overindulgent, they are likely to produce hostility in their children that will give lasting direction to their lives. Numerous case histories show how improper parental care produces disordered motivation, conflict about dependency needs, inferiority feelings, resentment, projection, with consequent paranoid idealism, or cruel and violent behavior.

Consequently the person usually has poor interpersonal relationships, little consideration for other people and an inability to tolerate frustration. There may be angry outbursts particularly if the person does not get his own way. Mood fluctuations can mean that the person is crying one moment and laughing the next. While such behaviour is of course possible in either sex, the literature points to a higher incidence among females. Such females frequently dress and act seductively in relation to males. Heavy makeup is often worn and manipulation is quite common. Such people have generally suffered from some kind of emotional deprivation during formative years. Present behaviour is unconsciously motivated by anxiety and a desire to be loved and cared for. The individual may have been denied the opportunity to experience feelings of security and consistency during the process of growing up. Unfortunately for the person concerned, attention-seeking behaviour often arouses negative feelings in others.",

Several typologies have been developed, however studies often do not distinguish between differing relationships (e.g., strangers, acquaintances, friends). Unrequited love relationships are less emotionally intense than equal-love relationships. If one falls upward (falls in love with someone with higher mate appeal), that person is not likely to reciprocate one's love and that love will be unrequited. In addition, unrequited love can be a 'false start' on the path to a mutual-love relationship. Research suggests that the pursuer/rejected and the target/rejecter of unrequited love have substantially different perspectives on the situation. Pursuers look back on the episode with both positive and intensely negative emotions, whereas rejecters are more uniformly negative in their accounts. Rejectors and rejected persons also differ in their guilt, self-esteem, and perceptions of persistence. Some dyads can maintain a friendship after the rejection, depending of variables such as prior commitment and current friendship maintenance behaviours. Unfortunately, unrequited love sometimes leads rejected pursuers to engage in negative relationship behaviours, including stalking-related behaviours.",

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF OWN GREED PERCEPTION AND ITS ASSESSMENT IN THE OTHERS",
      "abstract": "The article examines the relationship between self-assessment of human greed and assessment of the greed of the others. It has been shown that young people's perceptions of greed are ambivalent: greed is described as a defect, something bad that makes a person vulnerable, lowers his/her self-esteem, causes trouble, prevents him/her from living a full life and reduces the ability to acquire what is desired. On the other hand, young people pay attention to the fact that due to their greed they are careful about their own funds, control costs and consolidate resources for large purchases. The greed of others is also ambiguous: it can be an obstacle to satisfying the desires of young people, or it can be one that does not affect their goals achievements. The greed of the others is an obstacle to satisfying the desires of young people, achieving their goals. The assessment of the others' greed varied depending on the degree of these people intimacy. The characteristics of relatives, friends, people who they study or work with, were similar to the data obtained in the self-assessment of greed. However, when assessing the greed of the people who run the city and the country, the subjects attributed to them a higher degree of greed. The positive connection between the assessment of one's own greed and the assessment of the greed of relatives, friends and colleagues is determined. No significant relationship was found between the assessment of one's own greed and the greed of the people who run a city or country.",

      "title": "PARENTAl, ATTITUDE AND CHILD BEHAVIOUR*",
      "abstract": "Behaviour is an integral function which derives its existence, its, form and meaning from total setting of life situation. The setting is resultant of relationships and experiences which have begun to exert themselves from beginning of child's life and towards which a.child ha~s formed his own accepting or rejecting, aggressive or submissive reaction tendencies The individual's make-up at any moment includes an integrated overall combination of his attitudes evolved in past and oriented towards future. There is, of course, no limit to complexity of experience relationships which may combine to produce a certain attitude or attitudes. The attitudes which have a most profound influence on childIen and in response to which they develop their own attitudes, are those of parents. Our attention has been directed to thb importance of parental behaviour due to findings of psychoanalysts and to Freudian ideology. For example, it is stated that fear of toss of mother's love is ~ potent factor which may cause regression of a bleast-fea infant. great many people cannot overcome fearol loss of love; they never become independent enough and continue their infantile behaviour. HEALY, BONNER and BOWERS refer to importance of parent child relationship. For example they state : Lack of tender responses and feeling of not being loved may make it difficult for child to discard his aggressive inpulses. EARNEST JONES, an early authority on psychoanalysis made following statement : A person who from childhood had developed a hostile attiu d~ *owards one or other parent took up same attitude towm~l~ his or her children. JuNo and his followers were among first to _,aenUon relationship between parental attitude and child personality~ AICHHORN, a Viennese psychoanalyst in his book which has been translated into English under title Wayward Youth states: If child receives toc much or too little love then he becomes egocentric and reacts to personal demands in situation rather than objective demand of reality Based on psychoanalyst approach, concept of parental attitudes t-as brought such words into vocabulary as rejection and overprotection. Although terms rejection and,overprotection are now ~reely used in ~he literature not many attempts have been made to define t,lem exao;ly. WrnTMER defines the rejecting mother as one whose behaviour towards her child indicates a strong dislike for him. NEW~LI in his study used equally unsatistactory criteria. It included foIl~wing'ten items indicating rejection: severe punishment, neglect, nag.",

      "title": "Experiences of Sexual Violence Myth Following Different Types of Sexual Violence",
      "abstract": "Sexual violence myth has a substantial influence on the occurrence/overcoming/signifying of, and response to sexual assault. This study starts from a critical view on how victims of sexual violence experience misconception in different relationships and under different conditions. We surveyed 235 victims and conducted 14 in-depth interviews to look into how they experience sexual violence myth depending on their relationship with perpetrators, their age when the incident took place, and whether the incident was rape or not. The results show that victims are more vulnerable to sexual violence myth during investigation or court trial, by people around them and media, especially when the victims are adult women, and they knew/were close with/went on dates with/had drinks with the perpetrators on their own will. Victims of sexual aggression by stranger or rape are relatively less prone to experience rape myth in which their sufferings are questioned, denied, downplayed, and even attributed to them. Damages of sexual violence cannot be measured objectively by its types. It varies depending on the relationships and circumstances surrounding the incident. Therefore, no one but the victim can define the damage and its significance for each case. Nonetheless, rape myth instigated by family members, acquaintances, and media, often during investigation/trial procedures, assumes that feelings suffered by victims/women such as discomfort, anger, false accusation, and betrayal, can be easily edited and altered. Impacts of sexual assault are not a matter to be accepted based on biased social misconceptions. It should be about how much the society can empathize with the challenges that victims/women face.",

      "abstract": "In loving relationships, one risks temptation either to give up one's autonomy or to abridge the other person's. Since loving relationships can produce dispositions, one risks developing a long-term disposition to do so. In order to protect against this risk, a person can develop a contrary disposition, one that will nurture autonomy. I argue that receptivity is such a disposition. I define receptivity as the ability to be with someone without having to impose careless or compulsive expectations. I explain this definition using research from psychology and neuroscience about biases, defense mechanisms, and other cognitive and motivational features common to most people. Since receptivity involves sufficient control of or independence from these cognitive and motivational features, and since they are often the cause of breaches in autonomy, receptivity enables one to have loving relationships without damaging the autonomy of oneself or the other.",

Children of 3, 4, and 5 years of age were told or shown that child story characters held beliefs different from their own or from one another, not only concerning matters of physical fact (\"false beliefs\"), but also concerning morality, social convention, value, and ownership of property. In contrast to the older subjects, most 3-year-olds had difficulty in attributing to others deviant beliefs of all types, except perhaps ownership, sometimes even after having been told repeatedly what the other child believed. In addition, intercorrelations among different belief tasks were positive and substantial. It was suggested that an emerging representational conception of the mind is what enables older preschoolers to understand the possibility of belief differences of all these types.",

      "abstract": "People with disabilities are “easy targets” because they often lack the acquired knowledge of appropriate or unacceptable behaviour, do not have sufficient acquired social skills, or sometimes believe that because of their disorders and dependence on others, they must be conciliatory and have no right to protest or rebel. Also, a physical or psychological deviation that sometimes suggests a person’s weakness in others can cause a sense of dominance and superiority, which in certain situations can turn into the intention of physical or emotional abuse. Unfortunately, statistics show that a greater number of people with disabilities have faced some types of violence to a greater or lesser extent, especially in the female population. Violence can have numerous and psychophysical severe consequences on people who are already struggling with health, functional and/or mental disorders and consequently have difficulties in realizing the required quality of life and human rights. For this reason, the task of the entire society should be aimed at preventing a spiral mechanism in which one fateful unfavourable situation, such as disability, triggers a series of others. Regardless of its potential, every being deserves care and protection, especially vulnerable groups whose suffering, pain or limitations are seen as their inevitable destiny. However, the strength, fighting spirit and dedication shown by people with disabilities are proof of their magnificence, which should not be rewarded with verbal or physical blows, but with tolerance, respect, and appreciation.",

      "title": "Sexual abuse of children and adolescents.",
      "abstract": "Parents, relatives, and friends may inflict their passions on children of the same or opposite sex. This is often initiated by sleeping together. Sexual abuse contributes to and causes emotional trauma, although the child's turmoil, confusion, wish for acceptance, and anxiety may be overlooked by the parent and professional. Mutual silence aided by threats adds to the anxiety. Despite the notion that reports of parental sexual exploitation of their children are usually fantasies, there appear to be increasing data that incest and sexual abuse are frequent traumata. At present, there is increased risk of lowering the incest barrier because of increased rates of divorce and step- or surrogate parenthood, since they provide additional potential for being sexually and emotionally traumatized. Sexual abuse seems to be part of a constellation involving neglect and a pathological symbiosis. That sexual abuse is emotionally traumatic is apparent, but it needs emphasizing. Children's defensive reactions may cloud this, and it may be years before such incidents are connected to symptomatic behavior, even when the child is in intensive therapy. In the reported cases, there appears to be a pattern of reactions and defenses related to the traumata that are embedded in imprinting and identification with the aggressor. This leads to sexual abuse being a legacy passed on to the next generation of victims, as the victim becomes the molester through identification. Adolescent self-destructive behavior may stem from guilt about sexually abusing younger children. Therapists may be better able to understand and deal with some of their patients' symptoms if sexual abuse is considered as a possible factor in one or both directions.",

In many cases sexual communication is improved because of contraception; in many cases it has a negative influence, caused mainly by the mental immaturity of the partners, by their emotional instability, or by their sociocultural background. Negative sexual side effects of contraception are usually caused, in the woman, by a conflict with the traditional image of the woman as mother, and by an unconscious desire of fertility; in the man they are usually caused by the long-accepted identification of sexual potency with reproductive ability, and by fears for the newly acquired freedom of the female partner. Positive or negative psychological effects of contraception vary, but not greatly, according to the method used. A sympathetic and experienced doctor can furnish good advice on the matter.",

Different deviant conditions may evoke different kinds of responses. For example, individuals who display selfish behavior such as hurting others, stealing property, or lack of motivation to cooperate, tend to be punished; others who are incapable of cooperating and contributing to group life due to illness or injury, usually receive care and medical treatment; and still others with abnormal facial features, may primarily evoke fear and avoidance rather than punishment or care and protection. Furthermore, the same deviant condition may also trigger widely different responses in different situations, historical periods, and cultures, ranging from extreme moral outrage and harsh physical punishment to “softer” treatment and forgiveness, and from extreme tenderness and care to “less soft” and more aggressive and authoritative forms of nurturance and therapy. Pretending not to be affected by a particular deviant condition, and the suppression and indirect expression of one's emotional reactions to the condition, or the consistent avoidance of a deviant individual in order to prevent experiencing these emotions, may be considered as further variants of how individuals respond to deviance.",

Observed among children are: young age (abuse begins very early in life); male sex, as concerns shaken baby syndrome and lethal violence; the presence of mental disability and/or behavioural disorders; and particularly frequently, prematurity, especially if it requires neonatal hospitalisation. In fact, any circumstance that makes early attachment between the newborn and its parents difficult or impossible, such as prematurity or postpartum depression, constitutes a situation of risk for subsequent child abuse. Among parents, psycho-affective factors take precedence over socio-economic factors, which play no role. Child abuse is found in all social classes, as is the transgenerational transmission of violence, with those parents having suffered from abuse as children being more at risk than others of becoming abusive themselves.",

      "abstract": "Today, anxiety is a growing phenomenon as people face increasingly stressful situations. Therefore, among the various forms of manifestation, there is social anxiety. This type of anxiety generally begins in adolescence, when the personality is still being formed and when the teenager is increasingly interested in getting confirmation from others. When he is being analyzed by others, a teenager is afraid of failure and is embarrassed when things don't go as they should, he is afraid of being judged by others for possible minor mistakes and, thus, anxiety arises. In other words, people with low self-confidence and lack of confidence in their abilities have low self-esteem and can easily develop this form of anxiety. As we have already mentioned, social anxiety is caused by the fear of being criticized by others, by the fear of being evaluated incorrectly, by feelings of shame, being in the presence of strangers, etc. All these social contexts are the backdrop for unexplained individual restlessness which can lead to physical symptoms like excessive sweating, shaking, palpitations, blushing etc. Self-esteem is very important here because it is very important how the subject sees himself in social situations. Thus, if a person feels unable to deal with situations that are considered difficult and lacks confidence in his own abilities, which means he has low self-esteem, this behavior is very likely to lead to social debut. worry. Therapy sessions help reduce and even eliminate this disorder. There are certain techniques that consist of dealing with the problem until the subject begins to feel comfortable with aspects of normal life that were formerly considered episodes of anxiety.",

      "abstract": "It is only with great diffidence that the following considerations on a difficult subject are put forward in the hope of being of possible assistance to others. By unbelief is meant the initial reluctance to accept the doctrines of Christianity as well as the disinclination to retain them that often comes upon those who devote themselves to an intellectual life. This unbelief occurs especially during the formative period, usually, but not necessarily, the years spent by young people at a university, or the time immediately following. The purpose of this essay is to try to isolate the various elements in modern life that tend to disturb settled faith in Christianity, and very briefly to indicate some way of trying to counteract them. Many of the causes are common to all periods of history, some are proper to our own age or have unusual strength now. This account does not pretend to be more than a limited and partial sketch. Behind every problem of modern instability there lies, first, a fundamental insecurity in social life, affecting all of us in many and sometimes unsuspected ways. This insecurity is manifested in the multiplicity and diversity of moral and political, personal and emotional standards all round ; these react in their turn to make more acute the basic insecurity in the soul—it may sometimes amount to a positive fear of life.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic conflict among feelings of entitlement, defectiveness, and deprivation is discussed from the perspective of superego defense against dangerously aggressive (and sexual) wishes. These negative feelings and negative self-images are exploited so as to appease the superego in the face of one's hostile aggression: that one is justified, that there are extenuating circumstances for one's hatred and destructiveness. The \"oral\" clamor of deprivation and entitlement, together with dependency, submissiveness, and defensive uncertainty, serve a screening function for hostile aggressive wishes, from any developmental level. Typically, attitudes of entitlement are contradictory, unclear, and wavering, because of conflict between differing ego ideal images, and conflict between superego, and ego and id, about the sadistic extractiveness in these attitudes. Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past trauma, deprivation, abuse, teasing overstimulation coupled with neglect, or alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as identification with certain parental attitudes--exploitation and extractiveness--and denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.",

      "abstract": "Abuse is on the significant rise in the world and affects all populations of people equally. Abuse is the use of strenght and power on another person or group, resulting in negative consequences for the victim. As such, violence is a major problem in society, which nurses often encounter. A nurse is competent to recognize forms and types of violence, as well as victims and abusers. Abuse is a complicated phenomenon. It can be active, in the form of physical, sexual or psychological abuse of different intensity, or passive, in the form of neglect. Violence can be directed directly or indirectly. Violence occurred throughout the entire history of mankind. In the past, children and women were considered property by their fathers and husbands. Such behavior was acceptable at that time.There are various theories about the source of violence. Biological theories include neuropsychological, biochemical and genetic influences, and brain disorders. As for the psychological ones, there are psychodynamic theories and theories of learning. One of the sociocultorological theory is related to social influence. Data related to intimate partner abuse, child abuse and neglect, and sexual assault are useful in the use of health care process. Information on the characteristics of both victim and the abuser may be used as background knowledge in designing plans of care for clients who are victims of abuse. Physical abuse between domestic partners may be known as spouse abuse or relationship abuse. Women often get stuck in the cycle of battering, and most often stay in such a relationship because they fear for their own life or the lives of their children. The effects of child maltrearment are usually deep and longlasting, because children are vulnerable and powerless. Poor behavior towards children includes physical and emotional abuse or neglect, or sexual abuse. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of incest. Adults who have survived incest during their lives carry their scars for the rest of the life, and such childhood events can affect their present lives. In recent decades, International organizations warn people of an increasing number of violence against the elderly. Violence of a child over his/her parent is also an act with which a child intimidates and controls a parent, and can be in the form of physical, emotional, material violence and neglect. It can also lead to a high level of stress and is considered to be a risk factor for early death. Any type of sexual act in which an individual is threatened coerced or forced to do against his/her own will is considered to be sexual abuse. Sexual abuse include rape, which implies expression of power and domination, and some of its forms are acquaintance rape, marital rape and statutory rape. Two emotional response patterns for victims can be identified within a couple hours of rape. Those are: the expressed response pattern and the controlled response pattern. Some victims develop a compounded rape reaction while others develop the silent reaction. Health care management is an activity that is coordinated, and its purpose is to provide the quality health care to a sick or healthy individual. The basic management functions are planning, organization, management and control. They include human, financial, material and IT resources in an organizational environment. Nursing diagnosis is based on the data collected during the assessment phase and on background knowledge regarding predisposing factors for the situation. For assessing the outcomes in the care of victim of abuse, criteria for a sexually injured and physically injured patient and abused children may be used. A care plan for abuseed victims and nursing diagnosis was presented together with the outcomes criteria, appropriate nursing interventions, and rationales for each. There is also an innovative approach to planning and organizing nursing care. It is mapping the concept of care as a strategy of teaching and learning in the form of a diagram. Evaluation of nursing actions to assist victims of abuse must be considered on both a short- and a longterm basis. Among the treatments, crisis intervention, safe house or shelter and family treatment are mentioned.",

      "title": "Emotional Neglect and it's Impact Upon the Self",
      "abstract": "Emotional neglect is one of the five sub-types of childhood mistreatment that has been classified by practitioners in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and education. The other four are sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and physical neglect. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the least studied area from these five despite being commonly cited by research as being the most likely to occur. Contrary to what one might guess, numerous studies have in fact reported that emotional neglect can have an even greater negative impact upon individuals than the other types of mistreatment, particularly in regards to how individuals view themselves and their place in the world. Emotional neglect can broadly be defined as repeated and consistent caregiver-child interactions that are characterized by emotional unavailability, withdrawal, lack of reciprocity, disinterest or disengagement which lead to the child feeling that s/he is worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value in meeting another's needs. Previous research has published findings strongly associating childhood emotional neglect with a range of cognitive and behavioral outcomes including but not limited to; depression, anxiety, low self-compassion, shame, guilt, sexually risky behavior, self-destructive behavior, negative schemas, poor emotional regulation, Machiavellianism and so on. Given what we know in relation to the sheer importance of the interactions between primary caregivers and the child, namely by way of Bowlby's attachment theory, it is unsurprising to find that emotional neglect has many detrimental consequences. The reasons for emotional neglect can be numerous. One of the more common reasons behind it include it being passed on from generation to generation (as is also often the case with other types of abuse/neglect); indeed, social learning theory would support the idea that we take a lot of our parenting skills and styles directly from our own parents, even if we perceive them to be negative. Another source may be familial adversity, such as poverty, living within a conflict, or living during a time of persecution. Emotional neglect may also ensue due to the sickness of a sibling or parent, as the physically sick family member often can receive all attention and emotional capital of the family unit. Parental drug or alcohol abuse would place a child at risk of experiencing emotional neglect as would the seemingly more benign yet often just as threatening driven parental styles within which all love is contingent upon meeting pre-set academic or, later in life, professional goals. In the context of Qatar, it is also worth noting that emotional neglect often occurs within family units within which material wealth is abundant, however there is physical or psychological distance between the child and the primary caregiver, say due to a large number of siblings, half-siblings or maid/nursing staff being employed to take on child-rearing duties. Our emotional development, and being raised within a context in which we feel loved and cared for, is vital to the healthy development of the self. Accordingly, I have been looking at how emotional neglect impacts upon the self, that part of us that is believed to be the source of our consciousness and the core of our being. Two specific aspects of the self which I intend to include in my research are self-esteem and memory recall. Both of these areas have not been looked at in the context of emotional neglect research yet both may hold valuable findings that will then allow practitioners to be able to design interventions that will aide individuals in overcoming their emotional neglect. This will also be the first reported study that has used qualitative interviews to assess the impact of emotional neglect. This was also a key for me; through all the research I had reviewed, the emotion in emotional neglect was not being conveyed in the numbers and the statistics. Being a student of science though I know the value of these constructs and it was with both of these ideas in mind that I decided to use mixed methods for this doctorate study. This Ph.D. is currently being carried out by me at Queen's University Belfast, and is being supervised by, Dr Teresa Rushe.",

      "title": "The Systematic Estimation of the Leucocytosis in Certain Cases of Insanity: with Special Reference to the Toxæmic Theory",
      "abstract": "Surveying insanity as a whole, one recognises as a fundamental fact that insane persons belong to a class who start life with a “deficient grade of organisation” of the nervous system called “hereditary predisposition.” Some authorities hold that this is the sine quâ non of insanity, but such a view, I consider, is not strictly accurate. It is certainly not borne out by statistics. All observers, using even indifferent discrimination, must have noticed cases in which no hereditary factor could be traced, but in which much self-abuse had occurred—either in the form of alcoholic, sexual, and other excesses—or where syphilis or other powerful toxæmic conditions had been contracted. Such conditions, I argue, may themselves break down the most hardy constitution and leave it a prey to secondary infections or intoxications, which may manifest themselves as insanity. Assuming that the insane, prior to their attack of mental disease, suffer from either some hereditary weakness, or some acquired constitutional degeneration, it is most probable that such defects act a dual part, weakening not only the nervous system, so that it is more susceptible to the actions of toxins and environments, but also weakening the natural defences of the body. The nervous system of these people is thus laid open to more severe and frequent attacks from poisonous substances, whether of bacterial, metabolic, or other sources, than is the nervous system of a more normally organised individual. In support of this statement I would mention that Dr. L. C. Bruce has pointed out that over 60 per cent. of maniacal patients were deficient in the normal protective agglutinin to certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. This agglutinin is always present in healthy sera. Further, Dr. C. J. Shaw has ably demonstrated that the reason tubercular diseases account for so large a proportion of the deaths in asylums lies, not in any faulty hygienic precautions, but in the fact that the resistive power of the insane to tubercular infection is below par. Assuming that this hypothesis is true, we can more readily understand why the various insanities so frequently resist our efforts to cure them.",

      "title": "Who makes false allegations and why? The nature, motives, and mental health status of those who wrongly allege sexual assault",
      "abstract": "Allegations of sexual assault, both true and false, are common and cause considerable harm. False allegations may be deliberate or inadvertent or partially true with elements distorted or embellished. Deliberate fabrications are usually motived by personal gains such as material profit, revenge, provide an alibi, or to win sympathy. Sometimes, those making false allegations may have underlying mental health issues. Other cases of wrongful allegations arise when accusers sincerely but falsely believe they have been sexually assaulted, either naming the wrong person or recounting an event that did not occur. Memories may not be accurate, and new post-event information can become incorporated to create false memories. When investigators believe that abuse has occurred, confirmatory bias may mean that only evidence supporting the allegation is sought, and evidence contradicting the claim is ignored or misinterpreted. Examples include custody disputes and widespread allegations of ritual abuse in day-care centres in the 1990s. The premise that false allegations rarely happen, and that all sexual offence complainants must be believed, has led to prosecution policy assuming presumptive guilt of the defendant. Convictions based solely on believing the complainant not the defendant in the absence of any corroborative evidence could be considered counter to the premise of guilty beyond reasonable doubt. This chapter explores some of the factors that may influence outcome.",

      "title": "Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace",
      "abstract": "Workplace bullying and harassment is prevalent in contemporary workplaces with detrimental negative outcomes for targets as well as for bystanders and the organization itself. At any one time, some 3%–20% of the working population is targeted, suffering reduced motivation and productivity, severe mental and physical health problems, and a risk of exclusion from the organization and even working life altogether. Bullying and harassment is about the systematic and ongoing mistreatment of an employee by other organization members, mostly of a psychological and social nature and often involving a gradually escalating process that may end in severe victimization of those targeted if not properly managed and handled in its early phases. In early phases, by some denoted incivility, the behaviors involved are often subtle, indirect, and discrete, while in later phases they become ever more prevalent and direct—even involving threats and open verbal abuse. Bullying may involve work-related behaviors creating a difficult and even dangerous working situation for the target, personally demeaning behavior, acts of social exclusion and non-inclusion, and physically intimidation behaviors. Hence, bullying comes in many shades and forms, as well as at many levels of intensity. Although risk factors and antecedents of this complex problem may be found on many levels, factors in the immediate working environment and the design and management of work are particularly important. Furthermore, bullying is particularly prevalent in working environments characterized by a hostile working climate and in organizations where such behaviors are permitted or even rewarded.",

There are certain subthreshold response in form fear and loss of reproductive life to no more ability to reproduce and a feeling of loss of femininity. The period of menstruation simulated to reproductive age or fertility is around half of their lives; therefore, loss of fertility or reproductive life may be a source of stress specially among tribes where long reproductive age period is desired on the cultural belief that this will lead to a large family size that is considered as a symbol of success. Psychological factors such personal or inter-psychic (personality, self-esteem, and coping skills) and intra-psychic (relationship issues and social support) may contribute in the onset, course, and repose to perimenopausal period.

It is also best to make clear at the outset that jealousy is not a basic emotion such as fear, anger or sadness. It is a complex emotion that is a composite of several different emotions triggered by a social situation. The feelings making up this composite include anger, fear, sadness, guilt, envy and sexual arousal.

      "title": "THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE CHANGE OF SEX OPERATION",
      "abstract": "The syndrome of male transsexualism is characterized by a life-long preference for the feminine role, predicated on the conviction of belonging to the female sex. This conviction is held and persists despite the painfully obvious fact of normal male anatomy and genitalia, before and after puberty, and in the absence of delusional ideation or psychosis in the majority of transsexuals studied. He is disgusted with the development of his primary and secondary sexual characteristics, to the point where the male transsexual frequently contemplates and occasionally performs self-mutilation of his genitalia. He prefers normal, heterosexual men as sexual partners, and rejects homosexual men or the idea that his sexual activity is homosexual. Feeling he belongs to the female gender, he considers it appropriate to have a love relationship with a man, and he feels “unnatural” in a relationship with a woman, considering this “homosexual.” There is some evidence that sex or overt sexual activity, whether it be considered homosexual or heterosexual, plays a minor or secondary role. The transsexual may decide to pass and become accepted as a female, either before or after sex reassignment surgery, depending upon individual circumstances. The postoperative results of 121 male transsexuals who have obtained sex reassignment surgery are reviewed. A satisfactory outcome, as indicated by improved social and emotional adjustment, is 10 times more likely than an unsatisfacory result. Improvement is enhanced if the transsexual has functional use of an artificial vagina, obtains a legal change of gender status and freely passes in society as a member of the opposite sex. At the present time one is impressed with the lack of success in attempting to alter gender identity, once established, by traditional psychotherapy. This fact, together with the apparent success of sex reassignment surgery, compels one to accept the surgical treatment of transsexualism on an experimental basis until the initial results can be verified or contradicted or until alternative treatment procedures prove successful.",

      "abstract": "The contrast between the potent, aggressive male and the impotent female is so widespread that when anything gives a male a sense of weakness, inadequacy, or incompleteness, he seizes upon the contrast and begins to suspect that he is lacking in virility, a thing so unendurably disgraceful that his whole life becomes one intense, unremitting effort to prove to himself and all the world that this is not so. That is the and when one is obsessed with it, he soon develops the neurotic constitution--always determined to be the superior male, always tense and overbearing except when he is exhausted, and, of course, always subject to the physical symptoms that such a purgatorial life involves. When suspicion or accusation of inferiority leads to a protest in women, it is by no means always a masculine protest. An uncomfortable sense of inferiority is very common, indeed, with women. Its victims attribute it to a variety of causes. They care about all kinds of social relations; they want to be like other girls they admire; and their self-respect is not so steeped in thoughts of worthy masculinity that it is marked. The dominant thoughts and impulses of youthful human beings are more social than sexual, and their social ambitions are not all couched in terms of brute force.

      "title": "Determinants of Juvenile Deviant Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Deviant behavior of minors manifests in various forms and with different degrees of intensity, influenced by external social environments and the individual characteristics of the minor's personality, which shape their reactions to various life challenges. Behavior that deviates from generally accepted expectations can be either constructive or destructive, and deviant behavior, accordingly, can be positive or negative. The evaluation of such behavior is based on the social consequences of the deviation. The article establishes that within the framework of criminological research, the focus is on negative deviant behavior of minors, which may result in criminal responsibility (in accordance with the Criminal Code of Ukraine) or may not lead to such responsibility (e.g., withdrawal from social contact, self-isolation, or avoidance of societal norms and interaction with others; behavior contrary to common communication norms, such as rudeness; alcohol consumption by minors, which may not yet lead to offenses but is socially unacceptable; behavior that violates aesthetic or moral standards but is not illegal, such as extreme forms of tattooing or piercing; protest behavior, for instance, ignoring traditions or deliberately breaking etiquette; or actions by minors that have the objective signs of criminal offenses, but the perpetrators have not yet reached the age of criminal liability). The article states that there is no single theory of deviant behavior, including among minors. However, all researchers agree on the following point: eliminating certain factors can significantly reduce the likelihood of deviant behavior, but only a systematic approach to addressing all determinants of deviance provides grounds to talk about a high probability of significantly reducing or partially eradicating such actions. Deviant behavior is a complex form of social behavior influenced by a range of interconnected factors. Thus, in each case of deviant behavior, it is insufficient to investigate only biological, psychological, or social factors. A comprehensive approach that considers all these factors together is necessary, as such behavior results from the unsuccessful socialization of youth: due to disruptions in the processes of identification and individualization, such individuals are prone to \"social disorganization,\" where cultural norms, values, and social ties are either absent, weakened, or in conflict with each other. It is important to create conditions for preventing negative deviant behavior, particularly through the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, fostering a favorable socio-psychological climate in the child's environment, and providing opportunities for personal self-realization in society.

      "title": "Examining the relationship between suicidal behavior and psychopathic traits through the lens of the interpersonal–psychological theory of suicide",
      "abstract": "Psychopathy has historically been conceptualized as conferring relative immunity to suicidality due to low anxiety and reduced self-conscious emotions (e.g., shame, guilt). The Interpersonal–Psychological Theory of Suicide is a promising heuristic for clarifying complicated and potentially contradictory findings within the literature. On one hand, the development of active suicidal ideation requires a perception of oneself as a burden on others with no meaningful connections to others. The callousness, unemotional personality, and manipulative interpersonal style inherent in individuals with high core (Factor 1) psychopathic traits may render them less likely to develop suicidal desire due to an indifference to enduring and meaningful relationships and/or inability to perceive problematic interpersonal interactions. In individuals with elevated Factor 2, but normative or low Factor 1, however, the combination of normative affect and interpersonal interactions and exposure could lead to both enhanced suicidal desire and capability. Rather than thwarted belonging or perceived burdensomeness, an individual high in core psychopathic traits may realize that his chances for \"success\" in an endeavor have suddenly been drastically reduced and may seek the feeling of power associated with \"going down in a hail of glory\" or cheating law enforcement out of exacting justice.",

      "title": "Behavioral Inhibition as a Temperamental Category",
      "abstract": "Abstract Historical changes in the sense meaning of the term temperament have been less dramatic than alterations in other important psychological concepts, such as emotion, memory, symptom, or perception. Most ancient and modern writers agreed that the human temperaments were combinations of psychological profiles (behaviors, thoughts, and emotions) and their presumed biological foundations, which, during this century, were assumed to be genetically mediated. A set of psychological features was not sufficient evidence to posit a temperamental disposition. Chronic shyness with strangers, for example, need not be due to a temperamental bias, because some shy adults could have acquired that trait during adolescence. A combination of a psychological profile and its presumed biological foundation represents the ideal definition of a temperament. Combining behavior with biological measures is common in other domains. An individual born with the genes for compromised pancreatic function who has normal blood sugar levels is not diabetic. An adolescent born to two schizophrenic parents who displays one non debilitating marker of this illness is not regarded as schizophrenic as long as he or she does not display any of the primary symptoms that define the category. However, the lack of insight into the biological contribution to temperament has meant that, at present, the psychological features compose the primary definition of temperament. The definition of temperament offered here suggests the potential error in classifying a trait as temperamental simply because it is stable over long periods of time. Future research on the temperaments will gather biological data and, if possible, begin with observations of young children. As investigators discover sensitive biological markers for each of the temperamental types, they will be able to separate groups of children or adults who display similar behavioral phenotypes into those who probably do and probably do not possess the relevant temperaments. The research of Davidson (1994, 1995) and Fox, Schmidt, Calkins, Rubin, &amp; Coplan (1996) on asymmetry of alpha power in frontal areas illustrates this point. These investigators suggest that greater activation in the right frontal area than in the left (that is, greater desynchronization of alpha frequencies on the right side) is a sensitive sign of a temperamental vulnerability to uncertainty and/or anxiety. As a result, scientists can gather the electroencephalograph (EEG) data on groups of anxious adults and parse these samples into distinct groups based on the presence or absence of right-hemisphere activation. This suggestion is not fanciful. My laboratory has been following a large group of middleclass, Caucasian children who were evaluated initially at 4 months of age (see Kagan, 1994). Twenty percent of the infants, called high reactive, displayed high levels of motor activity and distress to a variety of unfamiliar stimuli; 40% of the sample, classified as low reactive, showed the complementary profile of minimal motor activity and distress. More children from the high-reactive group became shy and fearful in the second year, whereas most low reactives became relatively sociable and fearless.",

      "title": "Primary femininity.",
      "abstract": "In Freud's theory of the origins of femininity in females, there is a stage unaccounted for in the chronology of the little girl's development: the first many months of life are not considered. We know by now that castration anxiety, penis envy, and the traumas and frustrations of oedipal conflict are easy to demonstrate; but if the first stage in female development is different from Freud's description-if a fundamental, fixed sense of being rightfully a female is established in earliest childhood-then our psychology of women needs repair. The factors that make up this stage, with examples, are reviewed: (1) a biological \"force\": the effect of circulating fetal sex hormones on the brain of the fetus; (2) sex assignment: the announcement at the time of birth to the parents that they have had a boy or a girl (or a hermaphrodite); (3) parental attitudes: the effects of the sex assignment on parents, then reflected back onto the infant; (4) \"biopsychic\" phenomena: early postnatal effects caused by certain habitual patterns of handling the infant-conditioning, imprinting(?), or other forms of nonconflictual learning; (5) developing body ego: sensations, especially from the genitals, that define the child's dimensions. I suggest that one can divide the development of femininity in females into two phases, both of which lead to adult femininity, but each of which contributes in a different manner. The first, nonconflictual in origin, contributes a sense of femaleness and some of what allows for one's looking feminine; the second, the result of conflict, especially oedipal, produces a richer and more complicated femininity, not merely one of appearances, but one enriched by desires to perform with the substance, rather than just the façade, of femininity.",

      "abstract": "Relational by definition, grief is influenced by others’ witness, acknowledgement and validation. Although such influence has drawn sociological interest to the disenfranchised grief of marginalized groups, differential grief within the family goes mostly unaddressed in relational psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. Many factors influence the ranking of grief, including “proprietary rights” conferred by traditional roles and the psychodynamics of the family. In such situations, the more highly-ranked mourners may appropriate another’s grief by claiming a stronger sense of entitlement, conferred by felt anguish, attachment or social standing. Preempting another’s claim may come without conscious intention or even with intent to protect the other from such anguish. The self is injured when one’s right to grieve is withheld, overlooked or otherwise curtailed by others, or waived by oneself. Where one’s grief is deferred to mourners deemed more needy, deserving or powerful, a diminished sense of personal ownership of grief may present itself as generosity, guilt or compliance.",

Avoidantly attached individuals will often close themselves off: epistemic mistrust. Anxious-ambivalently attached individuals often rely too heavily on one attachment figure and have developed too little autonomy, to suspend that trust when necessary. That makes them vulnerable to entanglement in dependent relationships. They are epistemically hypervigilant towards almost everyone, but epistemically naive towards that one attachment figure who knows how to reach them. Disorganized attached individuals are often deeply confused and isolated. They dare not trust themselves or others. These learning dispositions influence the contact they have with others. Often such people come across as quite rigid and closed, while securely attached people, with a healthy dose of epistemic trust and epistemic vigilance, are flexible in their thoughts and actions, and open to the other.",

Destructive attitudes are usually exerted by parents but also by other power figures in and outside the family. The most common sexual disorders seen in the general population are dysfunctions such as impotence, premature ejaculation, frigidity, and other operational problems; however, psychological difficulties linked to sexual behavior, though not usually recognized as sexual, are far more common— falling in love, maintaining long-term love relationships, resistance to marriage, and postpartum reactions.",

Examination of theory and research in eyewitness, cognitive, and social psychology suggests that these discrepancies are due to differential instigation of integrative memorial and cognitive processes across eyewitness situations. These processes occur unconsciously and therefore may alter either memory or confidence independently of each other. As a result, accuracy-confidence correspondence should be inversely related to the extensiveness of reconstructive memory processes (which change memory but not confidence) and/or suggestive social influences (which change confidence but not memory). Noncorrespondence is expected when memory is altered by inconsistent information, a criminal stereotype, or a descriptive label of the suspect; or when confidence is altered by factors that promote commitment to testimony or trust in facial memory. It is suggested that police and lawyers avoid behaviors that facilitate these effects and that, along with jurors and possibly even witnesses, they be informed that confidence is often a poor index of accuracy.",

      "abstract": "The concept of codependency stems from the field of chemical dependency. Initially, codependent individuals meant women who dominated their partners and took care of them, while women actually were dependent upon their husbands. Nowadays, it has been recognized that men can become codependent as well, and its presence is not limited only to the relationship. This paper reviews the various interpretations of codependency and the empirical researches on the etiological factors of codependency. The explanatory models of codependency can be placed on a continuum of severity: psychopathology on the level of personality disorder, behavioural addiction, or excessive feminine behaviour. The etiology is mutifactorical: biological, psychological and social elements are also listed among etiology factors. The individual variability of the predisposition to care, failure of prefrontal cortex to inhibit empathic responses, a multitude of aversive experiences in a dysfunctional family (e.g. parental conflicts, emotional abuse, neglect and parentification), changes in the perception of women's role, and the emergence of substance abuse in the family could play a role in the development of codependency. Codependency is often unrecognized. Codependent individuals visit the health care system with stress-related or depressive symptoms which can mask the underlying causes, thus, it is possible that they will only receive symptomatic treatment. Through its trans-generational nature, codependency endangers children growing up in the family.",

Research on health resistance has contributed two central reasons for the deliberate disregard or dismissal of health messages by reasonable people: one, a different definition or interpretation of health and health maintenance (largely encompassing free-will ideas) and two, a suspicion of authority-driven science, medicine, and government-funded communication. These findings ask questions about a strict adherence to a particular idea of human health and life, and a particular format of communicating these ideas.",

      "title": "Developmental trajectory of substance use disorders: what role do the parents play (or are perceived to play)?",
      "abstract": "The aetiology of substance use disorders is considered to be multi-factorial as the individual, developmental and contextual dimensions interact together. From the developmental perspective, research has identified several aspects of family environment that are consistently associated with substance use disorders. Parent child interaction and parenting style are the primary focus of research. A conflict ridden and highly authoritarian parent child interaction predicts substance use in the future1. On the other hand, parenting style can both be a risk or a protective factor depending on its characteristics. Parental warmth as well as limit setting could be protective for future substance use2.\r\n\r\nParenting style is not a unitary concept. It is largely dependent on direct factors like parental personality, psychopathology, and substance use and on the indirect effects of other contextual factors like low socio-economic status (LSES), minority status, immediate environmental adversities and children's maladaptive behaviour3. Parental substance use has been consistently linked to substance use in the offspring4,5. Addicted mother's parenting has been characterized by a wide range of deficits starting from neglect, physical or emotional abuse, punishments to excessive control, lack of emotional involvement and inconsistent discipline2. In addition, parental psychopathology like depression, anxiety or antisocial personality and poor coping with stress has been demonstrated to be related with substance use disorders in their children4,6. But this indictment of the parents needs to be seen in the light of the various contextual factors2. This proposition could be more appealing in the traditional societies where there is interdependence and family is the most important institution that has survived through the ages. These traditional societies are collectivist (with a sense of harmony, interdependence and concern for others, and where collective values of the family take precedence over individual values in case of a conflict) that emphasizes family integrity, family loyalty, and family unity7.\r\n\r\nIn the article by Pettenon & colleagues published in this issue8, the perception of parental bonding has been compared between crack cocaine users and non-illicit drug users. The authors examined hospitalized cocaine dependent subjects and non-illicit drug users as control subjects, both from the same geographical area with matched demographic characteristics. Parental bonding instrument (PBI)9 was used to assess various parenting style in both the parents. PBI measures two constructs: care and control. With various permutation and combinations of these constructs, four different styles of parenting are possible: optimal parenting (high care, low control), affectionate control (high care, high control), affectionless control (low care, high control) and neglectful parenting (low care, low control)9. Results of this study demonstrated that crack cocaine users were more likely to perceive their mothers as neglectful and their fathers as carelessly controlling. On the other hand, non-illicit drug users were perceived to have optimal parenting. This study has highlighted the importance of parenting style in the developmental trajectory both as risk factors (for cocaine users) and perhaps as protective factors (for the control subjects) for development of later substance dependence.\r\n\r\nThe study was cross-sectional and conducted on an exclusively male clinical sample selected by non-random purposive method. As already acknowledged by the authors, these factors have curbed the generalizability of the study and its strength to establish causality8. But, by choosing clinical population the authors perhaps were able to tap the most severe end of the spectrum of substance use disorder which could be assumed to be homogeneous. They had a reasonably large sample size seemingly adequate for the purpose of the study. To eliminate the effects of the contextual factors like LSES, ethnic minority or adverse residential environment, the study subjects and the controls were matched as per their socio-demography. Hence, the result of ‘disordered’ parental bonding in the cocaine dependent subjects was unlikely to be due to other contextual variables. Additionally, exclusion of these contextual factors has made the association of impaired parental bonding with substance dependence more specific. Nevertheless, there are a few caveats in the study. As the authors have only studied subjects with substance use disorder, there is always a possibility of subjective bias coloured by subjects’ personality and personal experience. Concurrent interview of the parents could have eliminated this possibility. The subjects with cocaine dependence had significantly higher psychiatric co-morbidity than the controls. As it has been amply researched that psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety are linked to childhood adversities and impaired parenting, presence of these co-morbidities perhaps confounded the association of parenting style and cocaine dependence10,11. However, epidemiological studies have shown that almost half of those having substance use disorders have a mental illness in their lifetime. The risk of developing a mental illness is 2-4 times more common in subjects with substance dependence than the controls12,13. Hence, it would practically be impossible to find out a substance use disorder group which does not differ significantly from controls with regard to the presence of psychiatric co-morbidity.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, there is a philosophical controversy in any research directed to the area of parenting style and future psychopathology. The controversy pivots around causality. One is reminded of Freida Fromm-Reichmann's theory of ‘schizophrenogenic mother’, which stated that schizophrenia is ‘caused’ due to unconscious rejection by the mother of the child (who later grows up to develop schizophrenia)14. A commentator has recently observed on its current status: “Today, in light of what we now understand about schizophrenia, the theory of the schizophrenogenic mother seems hopelessly mistaken, and more than a little embarrassing”15. Likewise, one has to be careful in the interpretation of this study findings, lest ‘affectionless’, ‘controlling’ and ‘neglecting’ parents are easily labelled as ‘addictogenic’. This could have the appalling potential to inflict pain and burden to the parents who were and would be the primary caregiver for their kids. ‘Blaming’ the parenting style and family interaction for addiction in other family members could, therefore, be a double edged sword and might well be detrimental.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, important to remember that the parenting styles reported in this study8 are ‘perceived’ parenting styles rather than actually observed parenting styles. Such perceptions can be distorted through the looking glass of chronic addiction. It is extremely difficult to conduct prospective longitudinal cohort studies to settle this issue. In an exceptional 30-year prospective study published very recently, unsupportive maternal behaviour, actually observed and rated by a developmental psychologist at eight months of age of the infant, predicted mental health problems in the grown up adults 30 years later16. Such studies are rare to come by. ‘Perceived’ parenting styles in a retrospective recall design cannot, and should not, implicate causality of addiction as ‘addictogenic’ parents. The value of the current study8, therefore, does not lie in inference of causality of any sort, but in the very fact that these ‘perceived’ parenting styles can have important bearing on the course and outcome of the subjects’ substance use trajectory. These need to be considered in the therapy of these subjects.\r\n\r\nThe present study by Pettenon & colleagues8 is from Brazil, which is one of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries which are developing or newly industrialised countries, distinguished by their large, fast-growing economies. All these countries have their commonalities in the primacy of family or collectivistic society over the individualistic society. Hence, the results of this study could be equally relevant and meaningful for Indian context.",

An onslaught of biological, social, and psychological stresses force acknowledgement of previously denied needs for succor, plunging them into battle with their wife-surrogate mother. The resulting counterphobic, hypersexual, ofter self-destructive behaviors are usually falsely interpreted as oedipal. Clinical material in this report strongly suggests this distress is not primarily related to genital sexual issues or fears of castration, but more often concerns issues of autonomy and independence which typically involve the mother and which arose in the toddler or anal phase. Supportive evidence for this thesis from cross-cultural observations, child developmental studies, and primatology is presented, and the usefulness of this view in facilitating clinical work with such men is described.",

Therefore, the ultimate goal of the studies was to identify the main cause and the main pattern of this non-commitment, and to continue to refine and provide solutions to this problem. The fact is that some women in the long-standing relationship and finally commitment in all years will eventually betray their Infidelity and commit themselves. Of course, men may also be betrayed after having had a long relationship with one person. At the same time, none of the parties, ultimately lethargy, refuse to accept their own indignation and Infidelity! With the difference that the method of Infidelity and its causes are different in both sexes, they are completely different. Men, while committing to their own people, if they are fascinated, emotionally or sexually abusive others, on the contrary, women, until they are fully satisfied by their man, Committed to their commitment. But as soon as a person creates and continues to experience the emotions, sexual relations, finances and ... on the part of the man, with the onset of problems between the two, the woman is also drawn to Infidelity and inertia. Most women cannot easily engage in sexually abusive relationships and intimacy with another man, because unlike men, the creation of a new sexual relationship on the part of the woman is quite apparent in the state of affection and self-expression in relation to the previous man. For women: If men learn to respect their own person, emotionally, financially, and financially, there is no reason for a woman to betray her.",

He probably makes large sacrifices to defray the cost of a ‘good education,’ and is liable finally to sacrifice his boy’s chances of happiness and success by an injudicious decision about his future. His difficulties may be increased, curiously enough, by his failure to realise that conditions of entry into a career are radically different from what they were thirty or forty years ago. He perhaps is still sufficiently romantic to talk about, and even to believe in, the ‘self-made man’ ideal, although the impracticability of it in these days of combines and over-population is surely manifest. Or he is likely to adopt one of two favourite attitudes; either, that his personal experience of the exigencies of his own calling determines him not to allow his son to follow it, or that the only reasonable thing for a son to do is to step into his father’s shoes and continue the work built up for him. If he is neither romantic nor obstinate, he will consult his son’s inclinations and, in all probability, he will find them either fantastic or completely unformed. A normal boy rarely shows a marked aptitude for one particular business or profession in his early or middle school-days, and if he forms an opinion about his future it is usually much influenced by a limited knowledge of his father’s occupation.",

      "title": "Family factors associated with conduct disorders in Children and Adolescents.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : Conduct disorder is a disorder initially diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and\r\nrefers to a persistent pattern of antisocial behavior in which the individual repeatedly\r\nbreaks social rules and carries out aggressive acts that upset other people. Antisocial\r\nbehavior is a common problem in the course of development of children. Although\r\nconduct disorder has been widely studied, it still consumes much of the resources of\r\nmental health, juvenile justice and the special education system. DSM-IV mentions\r\nconduct disorder as one of the most frequently diagnosed conditions in outpatient and\r\ninpatient mental health facilities for children 1 DSM- IV specifies for conduct disorder,\r\ncriteria which includes symptoms from the following areas: aggression against people\r\nor animals, property destruction, lying or theft and serious rule violation. It defines\r\nconduct disorder as a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic\r\nrights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated 2. About a\r\nthird of those affected have antisocial personality disorder in adult life and a further\r\nthird experience other personality, psychiatric and psychosocial problems. The\r\nprevalence of conduct disorders varies from 6-20% in studies across different cultures\r\nand settings 3, 4. In the evolution of conduct disorders different risk factors are\r\nimplicated which includes “child biological factors,” “child functional factors,” and\r\n“psychosocial factors” 5. Even though the number of studies discussing the evolution of\r\nconduct disorders and factors associated with it are numerous, there is a lack of\r\ninformation on risk factors associated with conduct disorder in our Indian population.\r\nIn this study we aim to delineate the family factors like parenting style, parental\r\nseparation, parental psychopathology, family type and family functioning associated\r\nwith conduct disorders.\r\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES : \r\nTo study the family factors associated with conduct disorder in a clinic-based\r\npopulation.\r\nTo study the family factors in children and adolescents diagnosed with conduct\r\ndisorder, in comparison with a group of children without conduct disorder, but with\r\nother psychiatric disorders.\r\nThe following null hypothesis was postulated:\r\nThere is no significant difference between children and adolescents with conduct\r\ndisorder and those without conduct disorder, with respect to family factors.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS : The participants were recruited from the outpatient department of the Child and\r\nAdolescent Psychiatry Unit, Department of Psychiatry, Christian Medical College. This\r\nis a tertiary care centre, providing services to children and adolescents with various\r\nmental health needs, from different parts of the country and neighboring regions. The\r\nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry unit of the Department has two divisions, one for\r\nchildren with emotional as well as behavioral disorders and the other one for children\r\nwith developmental disorders. The multidisciplinary treating team makes the clinical\r\ndiagnosis based on the ICD-10 clinical diagnostic system.\r\n Inclusion criteria:\r\n1. Children and adolescents between 5 - 18yrs.\r\n2. Diagnosed to have conduct disorder based on the ICD-10 clinical diagnostic criteria\r\nat initial presentation.\r\n3. Conduct disorder with or without comorbid psychiatric disorders\r\n4. Conversant in English, Tamil or Hindi.\r\n\r\nRESULTS : The acceptability of the study data for a parametric analysis was initially assessed and\r\nfound to be favourable as depicted in Table 1.\r\n164 children and adolescents were enrolled for the study between January 2010 and\r\nOctober 2010. As diagnostic data was missing for 5 participants, only 159 participants\r\nwere considered for further analysis. Table 2 shows the participant characteristics of the total sample. The sample consisted\r\nof children and adolescents between the ages of 5 to 18 years with a mean age of 11.61\r\nyears (SD 3.5). Approximately three fourth of the participants were male (74.2%). The\r\nmajority had completed at least a primary or high school education (91.2%).\r\nParticipants were predominantly Hindus and hailed from a upper middle socioeconomic\r\nbackground. There was a slightly larger representation from urban areas (56.6%). The\r\nmajority was from Tamil Nadu and West Bengal (79.3 %), therefore spoke Tamil and\r\nBengali respectively. All the participants included whose mother tongue was Bengali,\r\nwere also conversant in Hindi.\r\nThere were 63 participants with conduct disorder which accounted for 30.6% of the\r\ntotal disorders seen. Among children with conduct disorder, 33.3% had conduct\r\ndisorder in the family context, 15.9% had socialized conduct disorder and oppositional\r\ndefiant disorder was seen in 50.85%.The majority (40%) of other diagnosis present in\r\nthe total sample included mild mental retardation and ADHD. ‘Other’ disorders\r\nincluded nonspecific behaviour problems and enuresis.\r\nCONCLUSION : In conclusion, while this study failed to find a significant association of family factors\r\nwith conduct disorder when a multivariate analysis was done, male gender and more\r\nnumber of comorbidities had a significant association with conduct disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Threat, a central concept in theories of ethnocentric behavior and intergroup conflict, is probably one of the most important factors underlying intergroup hostility or war. Threat can be most broadly defined as the anticipation of negative consequences or loss, either for oneself or one's group, and can involve challenges to power and status, well‐being and security, beliefs and values, or self‐esteem. Threats can originate from an outgroup or from within an ingroup, as well as from more abstract factors in the environment such as economic insecurity or climate change. Psychological analyses of the role of threat emphasize the subjective nature of threat rather than objective threatening conditions. Thus, it is perceived rather than actual threat that affects how people think, feel, and behave. In the context of intergroup relations, experiences of threat often result in negative perceptions of and attitudes toward outgroups, as well as avoidant or confrontational behavioral tendencies. Social psychological research has demonstrated that both threats directed at an ingroup as a whole as well as threats directed at the individual can be consequential for intergroup relations.",

A developmental process which leads to suicidal ideation, suicidal communication, self-destructive behaviour, in some cases even to suicide, and its consequences to the survivors is often referred to as a suicidal process. There is no single unanimously accepted definition of suicide, although in most proposed definitions it is considered as a fatal act of self-injury (self-harm) undertaken with more or less conscious self-destructive intent, however vague and ambiguous. Since the deceased cannot testify as to his or her intent, the conclusions about this must be drawn by inference. The evidence required for this inference depends on many factors, for example the mode of death, the use of autopsy, age, gender, social and occupational status, and the social stigma of suicide in the person’s culture. The assessment of suicide intent is always based on a balance of probabilities. This chapter discusses the suicide process and the act of suicide, epidemiology and public health aspects of suicide, basic characteristics of the suicide victim, and finally mental disorders and suicide.",

This research is a qualitative description of the type of research that attempted to link psychological phenomena with other aspects that are considered important.\r\nThe results obtained show that the phenomenon of husband's infidelity that occurs because of the need for a friend who can be invited to communicate, physical keterpikatan that occur between husbands and their mistresses, the influence of the existing environment so as to make the husband having an affair, and certainly the perceived sexual satisfaction husband when dealing with the affair. It must be realized that in order to dare to separate himself from the cheating partner is difficult, it takes energy, thoughts, sacrifice, and incredible time. This involves the liver needs, tastes, and biological. The occurrence of cheating actually started because of the situation himself the husband who was in dire need of attention and affection touches to create different nuances of everyday life is her husband. Based on the results of this study can be concluded that generally the husband who cheated on the need to release tension caused by biological, they need a friend to talk, they need someone who can be invited to communicate and so forth. Every couple should better understand the meaning of marriage as something sacred. Communicative open communication between couples is essential. So that every husband and wife can understand each other and understand the needs of their partner.",

      "abstract": "Trust plays a crucial part in many facets of life, including politics, business, sport, friendship, love, marriage and, indeed, all human relationships. Trust appears to be a critical precondition for success in most human endeavours involving more than one person. Trust can typically appear as a social construct or a psychological belief and may often touch on ethical, personal or organisational values. The issue of trust evokes deeply held practical as well as philosophical contradictions and paradoxes. The implication of the paradox is that trust requires a leap of faith that obliges one side to give the benefit of the doubt to a relatively unknown and 'unproven' person. In order to build stronger relationships and achieve through greater partnerships and alliances, one must embrace new and untested opportunities, thereby exposing oneself to potentially fresh vulnerabilities. Effort is not proportional to achievement; instead it depends on the stage of the relationship.",

      "abstract": "Suicide is associated with certain diagnoses. In addition to its association with depression, suicide is related to panic disorder, borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia, more so than other psychological disorders. Therefore, full understanding of the individual, including his or her psychiatric diagnosis, is important in dealing with someone who is suicidal. Suicide is associated with certain traumas. The trauma of physical and sexual abuse as a child increases risk both in childhood and in adulthood. In studying the connection between different types of abuse and suicide, prospective research is needed that uses clear definitions and distinguishes between physical, sexual, and combined abuse. Also, the trauma of contracting AIDS may heighten suicide risk, particularly near the time of HIV testing or if dementia or drug treatment clouds consciousness. At these times clinicians should take special care to assess for suicidality. Suicide is associated with certain groups more than others. Adolescents, the elderly, and certain ethnic groups, such as Caucasians, have higher rates than others. Prevention strategies that acknowledge the uniqueness of the individual and take place at home, in school, and in the community have become extremely important. Suicide may be contagious. Contagion is more likely if the model is a celebrity, if the publicity is extensive, and if people are asked about others rather than themselves. Suicide is so complex that current knowledge, though enabling us to predict which special populations and circumstances increase risk, is not sufficient to predict the specific individuals who will attempt or succeed in killing themselves.",

Extreme favoritism appears to require one or more of these four factors for its development: (a) at least one parent experienced emotional trauma in his/her childhood, (b) the child's conception or birth was unusual or stressful, (c) a child's appearance or actions are invested with “good” or “bad” meanings, and (d) there is severe marital conflict, accompanied by the inability of the family to provide corrections to the “good/bad” identities assigned to children. Favorites are exposed not only to the love of a favoring parent but also to that parent's weaknesses and to the other family members' dislike. The favorite is usually guaranteed the lasting dislike of his brothers and sisters. To be a favorite is indeed a mixed blessing.",

[1] [2] According to Freud psychoanalytic theory, the driving forces behind personality is generated by the libido. Freud suggested that our mental states were influenced by two opposing forces: cathexis and anticathexis. Cathexis is defined as an investment of mental energy in a person, an idea or an object. Anticathexis on the other hand involves the ego blocking the socially unacceptable needs of the id. Interview was the main method of data gathering. Collaizi’s strategy in descriptive phenomenology established the data analysis. Thefindings of the study show that all the participants are not agreeable on casual sex and in publicity of their sex life; however, they are divided about losing their virginity before or after marriage. Public display of affection or PDA, had a low acceptance rate but can be conditional on what is displayed. Cohabitation is not acceptable for most of the participants but is qualified for the minority, then again divided, as to cohabitation with sex or none. Parent’s approval is deemed necessary for the majority, but for the minority, as not badly needed and not needed at all. My findings suggest that students’ view on sexual morality is dynamic. There are a lot of factors and considerations as to how moral is moral to them, their decisions were based but not limited to their family upbringing, cultural environment and society’s norm. I cannot conclude whether the participant’s beliefs and moral values are moral or otherwise. There are no concrete bases as to what is moral or not. However, The bible suggests and contains what are known as biblically acceptable moral values and so as the law comprehends what is moral or not.",

Nevertheless, it can be reliably and validly measured with such behaviors as callousness, impulsivity, sensation seeking, dishonesty, emotional detachment, extreme selfishness, antisociality, belligerence, juvenile delinquency, and sexual promiscuity. Hare's Psychopathy Checklist-Revised is the best available assessment. Psychopathy exists in women, men, children, and in all racial and ethnic groups examined. No one knows whether some psychopaths function successfully without committing serious offenses. Among institutionalized offender samples, psychopathy is the strongest predictor of violent recidivism and differential response to treatment yet discovered. Although psychopaths can exhibit subtle neurological, physiological, and cognitive differences compared with other people, it is unclear whether these differences constitute defective brain function or the execution of a viable life strategy.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders can be a burden for the patient and his family. They affect the family everyday functioning, require greater demands on adaptation and re-evaluation of the existing habits of family members and consequently may result in family dysfunction due to anxiety disorders, especially in marital relationship or partnership. However, the knowledge about the impact of anxiety disorders on one or both partners in marital or partner life is still limited.The relevant studies were identified through the Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases, within the period 1990-2017. Additional references were found using reviews of relevant articles. The search terms included \"anxiety disorders,\"\"marital problems,\" \"marital conflicts,\" \"partnership,\" \"family functioning,\" and \"communication.\"Dissatisfaction in a relationship can act as a trigger for the development of anxiety disorders and could also be responsible for the modulation and maintenance of these disorders. However, this dissatisfaction may also be the consequence of manifestation of the anxiety disorders. The individuals with the anxiety may feel guilty about their partners because of the tolerance and help (does not matter what kind and quality of the help he/she provides), sometimes they are submissively grateful because of the support, they may feel inferior, tend to serve him /her. On the other hand, he/she begins to rebuke partner's supposed negative attitudes; the patient may start to use his psychological problems as an excuse and expects others to help him and solve the situation. Consequently, he /she starts to check and criticize the partner and this tense situation may lead to problems in marriage and disturbs family functioning.Distress elements that contribute to the development of anxiety disorders can be diverse and sometimes it is not easy to identify so-called precipitating factors. The link between anxiety disorders and family relationships is bi-directional: psychological problems adversely affect patient relationships and attitudes of the partner towards the patient significantly affect his/her anxiety.",

It is the personal and interpersonal psychology of individuals that prohibits more widespread use of family planning. Denial of the effectiveness of contraceptives is common and involves a conflict and/or lack of faith in any method. Condoms, the IUD and the pill are dismissed with the idea that anything so cheap must be worthless. Sexual relations for most people is not performed solely for procreation, but as an expression of love, sometimes manifested in the risk of possible pregnancy, sometimes manifested in the presentation of a pregnancy by a woman to a man she loves, a frequent and acceptable aspect of Papua New Guinean married love. Some who would prefer to use contraceptive devices reject them because of embarrassment and shame. For many people sexual identity and sexual adequacy are closely aligned with self-esteem and self-worth. Some women measure their femininity by the number of children they produce. Hostile impulses from conflict in sexual and social adjustment may also lead to nonuse or misuse of contraceptives. Nihilism associated with the helplessness and hopelessness of psychoneurotic and psychotic depressional states, an \"I don't care\" attitude, destroys motivation to protect oneself.",

      "title": "The Life Mission Theory IV. Theory on Child Development",
      "abstract": "We can identify five important needs that children have: the need for acknowledgment, acceptance, awareness or attention, respect, and care. If these needs are not met, children will modify themselves by denying central parts of their nature in order to adjust to their parents and the situation at large. When a child denies his or her talents, powers, and gender or aspects thereof, he or she loses quality of life, the ability to function, and physical or mental health. The loss of ability takes the form of diminished social ability, psychosexual potency, joy, energy, and fantasy while playing, as well as diminished ability to concentrate, focus, and learn. Many modifications result in a child with severely damaged self-confidence, self-worth, and poor performance. A child more or less deprived of self-worth cannot enjoy, give, or receive. A child deprived of emotions turns cold, rational, asocial, socially stiff, uncomfortable, and in the extreme case ... intentionally “evil”. When a child denies his or her own sex, it becomes invisible, uninteresting, and vague or becomes like the opposite sex in behavior and appearance. The general holistic solution to the vast diversity of symptoms in children with low quality of life is to improve the situation for the child and give the child the holding and support he or she needs. It is very important to realize that a negative belief often has survival value to the child as it helps the child to avoid taking responsibility for problems, which really belong to the parents or other adults. Children have a fine capability for spontaneous healing, and seem to enter this process more easily than adults, given sufficient holding. The symptoms of children with poor thriving ability are often difficult to understand, as they are caused by a complex combination of self-modification in five existential dimensions. This often leads to complex medical diagnosis, giving the idea that the child is sick and without therapeutic reach, while sufficient holding could solve the problem. If holding and support of the child is not enough, the situation must be carefully analyzed to find other possible causes of poor quality of life, health, and functional ability. Education of the parent in holding is often mandatory. Most children with bad thriving ability can thus be helped by simple means.",

The stigma of being identified as 'a criminal' is primarily linked to 'cause' and 'degree of peril' because criminal behaviour is perceived to be controllable and criminals are therefore perceived as blameworthy. Those engaging in criminal behaviour are also often viewed as untrustworthy and a source of potential danger to others. Numerous instances of 'stigma in action' have been studied. For example, substance-misusing offenders may be ostracized not only as a result of their criminal behaviour and 'offender' label but also due to their presumed dependence on mind-altering substances.",

The purpose is not to demonstrate again that there is a connection between personality and political belief. Instead, the authors ask whether or not it matters if a political attitude—in the present case, isolationism—stems from personality influences rather than from some other sources, for example, education, group memberships, or ideology. Isolationists low in self-esteem are shown to differ from those high in self-esteem on a range of values and beliefs: liberalism-conservatism, extreme political values, and specific foreign policy questions. Thus, those who hold common beliefs on one set of issues are likely to differ in the opinions they hold on other political questions depending on whether they owe their convictions to their personality characteristics or to some other influence.",

      "title": "Individualizing Criminal Law’s Justice Judgments: Shortcomings in the Doctrines of Culpability, Mitigation, and Excuse",
      "abstract": "In judging an offender’s culpability, mitigation, or excuse, there seems to be general agreement that it is appropriate for the criminal law to take into account such things as the offender’s youthfulness or her significantly low IQ. There is even support for taking account of their distorted perceptions and reasoning induced by traumatic experiences, as in battered spouse syndrome. On the other hand, there seems to be equally strong opposition to taking account of things such as racism or homophobia that played a role in bringing about the offense. In between these two clear points, however, exists a large collection of individual offender characteristics and circumstances for which there is lack of clarity as to whether the criminal law should take them into account. Should our assessment of an offender’s criminal liability be adjusted for their cultural background? Their religious beliefs? Their past life experiences? The pedophilic tendencies they have always had but usually suppressed?\r\n\r\nThe question of how much to individualize the criminal liability judgment is not peripheral or unusual but rather common in a wide range of formal criminal law doctrines including, for example, the culpability requirements of recklessness and negligence, the mitigation of provocation and its more modern form of extreme emotional disturbance, and the excuse defenses of mistake as to a justification, duress, and involuntary intoxication. indeed, it turns out that the problem of individualizing factors is present, if often obscured, in all criminal law doctrines of culpability, mitigation, and excuse.\r\n\r\nThe Article reviews the appeal of criminal law adhering to a purely objective standard, where the problem of the individualizing factors is sought to be avoided altogether. But the resulting stream of injustices has forced most jurisdictions to adopt a partially individualized standard in some cases involving some doctrines. But this leaves the jurisdiction’s criminal law in an awkward and unstable state. Without a guiding principle for determining which individualizing factors are to be taken into account under what circumstances, the law is inevitably unprincipled and internally inconsistent. And without guidance, different decision-makers inevitably come to different conclusions in similar cases.\r\n\r\nThe Article proposes a solution to the individualizing factors puzzle and a statutory codification that would provide guidance in the adjudication of the many cases in which the issue arises.",

Children increased their sharing to a desired friend after friendly overtures from him (her) and retaliated small donations by an established friend with decreased sharing. In still more neutral conditions, the children followed a norm of equality that was introduced into the experimental situation. Subsequent sharing with a needy child was related neither to feeling good nor to feeling guilty. Also subjects did not respond differently in the experimental conditions because of sex. Finally highly popular children followed more reciprocal patterns of sharing than other children, and were more susceptible to modeling influences",

Alternatively, the court may request the therapy records of someone who has faced criminal charges, perhaps for substance use, in an effort to determine if the client is following through on the court's requirements, such as regular therapy sessions or abstinence from drugs and alcohol. In addition to the “one-up” issue, consider that many clients may be seeing a therapist because they have issues with trust or boundaries. Additionally, engaging in a business relationship before or after seeing the client in therapy constitutes a dual relationship. The APA code of ethics defines multiple relationships, forbids sexual ones, and recommends that a therapist avoid any dual relationship that can potentially “impair the psychologist's objectivity, competence or effectiveness in performing his or her functions as a psychologist”.",

Abuse is directed at the same person, it is intentional and conscious behavior.\r\nThree main types of abuse are: physical abuse, emotional abuse and sexual abuse. As forms of violations of children's rights and inadequacy of their needs, which can have the same effects on the child as well as abuse, is neglect. Child abuse can be identified by different signs.\r\nPsysical abuse has clear consequences and if we observe child psysical abuse should be the easiest to identify. Psysical abuse includes hitting, pushing, causing pain, physical restraint, shaking, tightening, biting, scalding, etc. Emotional abuse dentified according to changes in the behavior of the child. Indicators of emotional abuse can be the child's fearfulness, tics, stuttering, insecurity, etc... Sexual abuse includes kissing, touching genitals or breasts, sexual intercourse, oral and anal contact, viewing and showing pornographic magazines and films or other pornographic material. Sexual abuse, same as an emotional abuse, dentified according to changes in the behavior of the child (anxiety, depression, fear of physical contact, etc.) and to injuries in the area of sexual organs.\r\nIt is very important as soon discover that a child is a victim of abuse, and protect it from further exposure to violence, and to report it to the social welfare center. Kindergarten teacher have a very important role in the detection and prevention of violence because she spend a lot of time with children and she (or he), with children, builds trusting relationship.\r\nThe empirical part was about recognized sings of abuse. The kindergarten teachers are very important in a child's life and they need to be sensitive and skilled in tracking and identifying the different signs of violence.",

      "abstract": "Claims about the devastating effect of child loss on parents have frequently been made on the basis of subjective or clinical evaluation and without reference to general levels of symptoms or distress — even in the scientific literature. We therefore examine whether, and in which specific areas, empirical evidence confirms that bereaved parents are in worse psychological, physical, and psychosocial shape than nonbereaved counterparts. It cannot be said that there is a sound body of evidence on these dimensions. Although there are indications that bereaved parents may suffer negative health and marital consequences, conclusions must remain tentative until more methodologically-sound evidence is available. Most complex is the impact on marital closeness, some authors attesting to greater perceived closeness, while others report the opposite. It is concluded (a) that these opposite effects can co-occur for different relationship dimensions within couples, and (b) that effects may be masked since some couples are drawn together, while others are driven apart by their loss. Research should explore these so-called enhancement-aggravation and polarisation effects.",

      "abstract": "The causality behind psychiatric disorders lies on a still poorly understood interaction between genetic, biological, environmental, social, and psychodynamic factors. The classical biopsychosocial model hypothesizes that psychopathy develops when genetic and neurobiological components are associated with personality traits such as impulsivity, increasing the risk when these individuals are exposed to a dysfunctional family, and worsening when the surrounding social environment fails to provide basic protection. Notwithstanding, other models have been studied. For instance, brain structure and function, neurotransmitters, and hormones are traditionally categorized as biological risk factors; however, they may have either a genetic or an environmental origin, or they may reflect an interaction between both, characterizing the so-called biosocial interaction. Acting on gene expression, environmental factors may modify the brain, changing psychopathic traits and increasing the risk of developing the disorder or, on the contrary (i.e., in a positive way), protecting the individual. Regarding environmental influences, family dysfunction is the most important psychological factor involved, covering paternal antisocial behavior or alcoholism, lack of boundaries and supervision as a child, and parental separation or loss. Childhood trauma may have a dramatic impact on the child’s mental health and is also related to psychopathy. Finally, ethical issues are discussed: Does the presence of psychopathy affectcriminal responsibility in these individuals? If yes, in what way? Should psychopaths committi ng crimes be sent to prison or to forensic hospitals? Is it correct to subject psychopaths to research and scienti fi c investi gati on?

      "abstract": "Anxiety is defined as fear or worry to a perceived, imminent challenge or threat either in the present or the future. The experience would be an exaggeration in the perception of situational threats. This may cause muscular tension and guarded behaviors. The prevalence of anxiety among adults in Pakistan is 34% (range 29-66% for women and 10-33% for men).1 There is a high prevalence of anxiety in adolescents more in male gender, 22.5% 2, and an estimate of 65% in the shelter homes and 51% in the community samples of children.3 Variation in anxiety is attributable to the difference in perception and symptoms related to a threatening situation. For example, Generalized Anxiety is characterized by excessive worry about numerous things. In Social Anxiety the individual is fearful or avoidant of social interaction and situations that involve the possibility of being scrutinized. Separation Anxiety refers to fear of separation from an attachment figure. Stage Fright is characterized by a consistent failure to speak at public occasions. Among students it is common to experience Exam or Performance Anxiety, which falls under the umbrella of generalized anxiety disorder. Performance anxiety presents with worries about failure in regards to accomplishing something specific or a fear of failing to perform effectively in similar situations. It is generally noted that anxious students perform poorly and are less motivated in highly evaluated exam situations as compared to a relaxed student.4 Multiple factors can lead to the development of anxiety among students negatively impacting their performance that include; self-doubt, insufficient preparation, fear of scrutiny, and facing failure.5 Anxiety is curable and at the same time treatable. Anxiety gets worse when not attended to by engaging with appropriate services. Among students, clarity in their study goals and a stepwise approach towards their future goals can help ease the burden and the tension (anxiety) about it. A good routine and healthy eating habits have always been noted with mental well-being. Conducting a self-evaluation to determine one’s strengths and areas for improvement and adopting a clear, feasible study plan coupled with consistency has been proven very effective.",

As regards terrorists’ psychological characteristics, the available studies (mostly carried out with no sound scientific design) have failed to identify the common or typical pathological personality traits of modern terrorists. The popular opinion that terrorists must be insane or psychopathic is still widespread; however, no evidence exists that terrorist behavior may be caused either by prior or current psychiatric disorders or psychopathy. Not surprisingly, some theories have proposed social factors and non-pathological psychological traits as predisposing elements for terrorist acts, but they generally lack of empirical validation. Moreover, most of these theories do not explain why, even if so many people are exposed to the same social factors or show the same psychological traits, only a tiny minority of them join a terrorist group. Therefore, it is mandatory that systematic and scientific investigations be carried out in order to understand the possible bases for terrorist aggression, including the early detection of possibly associated psychopathology, and to design an appropriate counterterrorism prevention policy.",

      "title": "Perceived Parental Acceptance-Rejection, Psychological Adjustment and Self Concepts of Persons with Disabilities",
      "abstract": "Rohner' s Parental Acceptance-Rejection theory (PARTheory) postulates that children all over the world, irrespective of cultural variations, gender, age, and socioeconomic status, need parental love and warmth for healthy social and emotional development. Parental acceptance-rejection is commonly represented along a continuum representing the quality of the affectional bonds between parents and their children and with the physical, verbal, and symbolic behaviors that parents use to express their feeling. One end of this continuum represents warmth dimension whereas the other end is marked by parental rejection exhibited in the form of physically and psychologically hurtful behaviors. Empirical evidence demonstrates that children who do not receive adequate parental love tend to be psychologically maladjusted and exhibit adequate parental love tend to be psychologically maladjusted and exhibit poor self-esteem and self-adequacy and are likely to develop a negative worldview. Rejected children often perceived other individuals as untrustworthy, unfriendly, threatening and even dangerous. All such misconceptions negatively influence their interpersonal relationships and psychological wellbeing. Several researchers have reported that perceived parental love and warmth accounts for about 25% of the variability in psychological adjustment of children (Rohner, Khaleque, & Cournoyer, 2009). Riaz (2010) reported that 20% of the variability in psychological adjustment of children in Pakistan can be accounted for by the extent to which children perceive themselves to be accepted or rejected by their parents. These findings suggest that several other factors (for example, interpersonal, socio cultural, behavioral, genetic) are influencing parent-child relationship and psychological adjustment of children.According to PARTheory the need for positive response or parental acceptance not only persists throughout childhood it exerts a predictable impact on self concept of the individual. The theory predicts the existence of positive correlation between parental acceptance rejection and seven self concepts of children / adults: Hostility/ Aggression, Dependency, Negative Self-Esteem, Negative Self Adequacy, Emotional Unresponsiveness, Emotional Instability and Negative Worldview (Rohner 1986; Rohner, Khaleque, & Cournoyer 2003a). The underlying assumption is that parental behaviors perceived by the child as rejection produce psychological discomfort and development of belief that they are unworthy of parental love. To resolve the dissonance created by children's need to be loved by parents, they adopt negative self concepts.Personality sub theory of PARTheory attempts to predict psychological outcomes of perceived parental warmth and rejection. The mental health of the child is likely to be affected adversely by the severity, frequency and form of his /her experienced rejection. However, some individuals who come from loving families also manifest psychological problems typically displayed by rejected children. All such individuals, according to PARTheory, are categorized as troubled. Nevertheless, a few of them demonstrate emotional stability despite experiencing rejection from parents/caregivers. Social scientists believe that appropriate emotional support and love of parents serves as a key factor in promoting the successful emotional, social and academic development of children. However, in actual practice, the association between perceived acceptance-rejection and psychological consequences is far from perfect. The situation is further complicated for children suffering from certain disabilities.Every child is unique and so is the problem encountered by his/her family. The home environment of children with disabilities and the attitudes of different family members towards disability vary from family to family. It is often a great shock to parents when they come to know that their child is handicapped. While every family struggles to fulfill diverse needs of children, families with disabled children have more challenges. …",

Over time, the advances in science and technology have been viewed with skepticism, and the inventors have had to overcome different obstacles to impose their ideas. The discovery of the lie has haunted people since ancient times and motivated them in their research to develop an apparatus to help to discover simulated behavior. Lying is an aspect of communication less investigated, but this phenomenon should not be ignored as long as it exists, and we do not find it only at adults, but also at the children. The negative character traits behind the lie are the effect of wrong education in the family, kindergarten, school, because the lie arises for a variety of reasons, some with conscious intention, others without conscious intention. Lying means, by definition, deceiving, but not all forms of deception mean lies; the language of lies is often complicated and confusing, depending on the nature of the subject itself. From a religious point of view, sincerity or veracity is a virtue, a virtue that consists in acting and speaking according to what we are thinking, avoiding lying and duplicity, because falsifying the truth makes the inter-human interaction in society disruptive as it destroys mutual trust among people and conducts to the removal of others and of God.",

      "title": "Stigma and Disadvantage",
      "abstract": "Stigma is the devaluation of an individual or group that is based on social identity and leads to status loss and other negative outcomes. Although there are variations in the manifestation of stigma, the existence of stigma is pervasive, transcending time and culture. Moreover, stigma has the potential to cause profound harm across virtually every facet of a stigmatized person’s life. At the same time, there is tremendous variation across individuals and groups in the experience of stigma. Stigmas vary in concealability, the circumstances under which they originate, and the extent to which they change over time, interfere with social interactions, are considered disgusting, and are perceived as posing a danger to others. Functional approaches to stigma posit that stigma can serve to encourage the exploitation of outgroups for ingroup gain, enforce norms within a group, or encourage disease avoidance behaviors. Stigma is enacted at a structural level when societal norms, laws, and policies harm the ability of stigmatized groups to access resources and safety. Interpersonal stigma occurs when stereotypes, prejudice, and other negative biases lead individuals to intentionally or unintentionally discriminate against members of stigmatized groups. The hallmark characteristic of a stigma approach to the study of inequality and disadvantage is a focus on the psychological experience of people who belong to stigmatized groups. People who belong to stigmatized groups are generally aware of their disadvantaged status and the devaluation of their group. This awareness sets the stage for a variety of psychological processes to unfold including felt stigma, internalized stigma, anticipated stigma, and social identity threat. People who experience stigma cope with the stress posed by stigma in a variety of ways. Three well-established mechanisms for coping with stigma include identifying with the group, distancing from the group, and engaging in collective action to improve the status of the group. Stigma can influence a variety of life outcomes including, but not limited to, health and well-being, interpersonal relationships, education, and work outcomes. Interventions can both reduce the prevalence of stigma and mitigate the harmful consequences of stigma.",

This refers to the fact that sometimes an integral part of the person is sacrificed, up to his or her own dignity, in order to sustain a subjective ideal of emotional stability.\r\n     It could also be concluded that the lack of taste for their work, is due to the organizational culture in the company, the functions performed, the boss or directives, the work environment is not the best, growth policies or benefit systems are not ambitious enough to satisfy its employees.\r\n     However, it is evident in most cases, some factors that affect the performance of the companies and organizations themselves. Of the most relevant or common, stand out, the loss of days of work, this situation, which translates into significant economic costs for entities, since absenteeism is often associated with the reduction in performance and productivity, increase in unsafe work practices, greater number of complaints and claims from customers, and increased costs.\r\n     Both public and private entities present this problem on a different scale. Some with a higher rate of absenteeism, and others with a somewhat lower figure; the development of this work is in order to reduce the percentages of absenteeism on the part of public EPS officials; and also aims to consolidate a Plan for Improvement of such shortcomings, which include strategies for verification, identification, prevention and possible solution, which may, at the discretion of the entity, become effective.\r\n     The public EPS that was the object of study and the primary basis for the development of this investigative essay, is located in the city of Bogota, Colombia. Entity created in 1995, result of the transformation of an old social security fund, following the mandate of the law 100 of 1993 that ordered that local governments should liquidate social security entities of a territorial nature; This entity is the process of transformation of different entities created by the departmental government since 1936 when it was created as a social welfare fund for employees, it is one of the few public EPSs existing in the country.\r\n     This entity at the end of 2017, had 210 people who provided their services through service contracts (auxiliary, technicians, technologists, professionals and specialized professionals) and 96 staff that make up the staff plant, for a total of 306 employees The information collected is clearly linked to the employees of the plant, who are governed by the elements of the work contract - Subordination, time and remuneration -, while the others, being contractors and by the nature of the contract to provide services, they must not meet a schedule but a specific function or task.\r\n     The 96 employees of the plant are divided into two types, public employees, seven (7) in total, who are employees of free appointment and removal. This appointment is made directly by the Lord Governor of the Department; the other 89 employees have the status of official worker, linked through a work contract that regulates the regime of the service they will provide, in accordance with the provisions of the individual work contract, the collective agreement and the internal work regulations. indefinite term contract and has all the legal guarantees.\r\n        The information provided by the Office of Human Resources and Welfare of the EPS, is based on research through surveys, individual and group interviews to the 89 official workers, which yields interesting but at the same time worrisome information about the high degree of absenteeism in the entity, causing discomfort in the same group of official workers and with the group of employees for rendering services, causing economic losses, conflict between the processes and hindering that they correctly fulfill the missionary objectives of the entity.\r\n     To deal with this phenomenon and implement some strategies, we will analyze some relevant data provided by the entity, such as: the composition of the type of work",

      "abstract": "This paper describes severe, disorders of maternal affection and behaviour and suggests that there is an early process of mother-to-infant bonding which can go seriously wrong.Forty-four self-selected women who had suffered from at least one episode of postnatal mental illness described an unexpected and often catastrophic failure to love one or more of their babies.These women reported absent affection, sometimes hate, rejection, neglect or impulses to harm, in relation to at least one of their children. These feelings often began immediately or very shortly after the birth, and with one exception, were specific to one child; such characteristics are best encapsulated by the term 'maternal bonding disorder'. Twenty-nine of the women were multiparae; first-borns were not significantly more likely to be the focus for such feelings. There was no direct evidence of predisposing maternal personality traits or previous experiences. Postnatal mental illness and recalled severe pain during labour were significantly associated with such disorders which, in their severe forms, did not occur in the absence of postnatal mental illness.The nature of the link between postnatal mental illness and disorders of maternal bonding remains unclear. Because, in multiparae, the disorder often 'missed' the first child, factors such as maternal personality traits or early childhood experiences cannot be regarded as sufficient causes.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between individual personality traits and criminal behaviour is well established across various fields. Offenders are often more likely than others to engage in crime when exposed to problematic situations. However, differences in individual control within social contexts may explain varying levels of deviance. This theoretical review aims to identify key variables that lead to behavioural imbalance and deviant actions. Relevant literature on behavioural control and deviance was analysed. The findings indicate that five main variables influence deviant behaviour. First is the level of control, reflecting a person’s ability to anticipate correct behaviour and avoid deviance. Second is opportunity, linked to one's role, appearance, intelligence, and social connections. Third are restrictions and motives, where restrictions stem from social values and motives arise from family or societal persecution. Fourth is the causal sequence, meaning repeated psychological or social shocks that push individuals toward deviance. Fifth is self-control, shaped during childhood through experiences of discrimination or lack of safety. These factors are critical indicators that may predispose individuals to criminal activity. This study offers a theoretical base for future research and guidance for institutions aiming to develop behaviour-modifying social policies.",

Regardless of one's views on luck, as random, personal, or magic, people are considered lucky when escaping risks unharmed, and unlucky when harmed. A risk is usually defined as the probability for an aversive event. In high-risk domains, or high-risk environments, probabilities are high, or the consequences are severe, or both. If luck depends on close and worse counterfactuals, risky or hazardous situations should have the potential of generating luck. Such situations might be considered dangerous. Beliefs in oneself as a lucky or unlucky person can further be based on personal memories of fortunate or unfortunate episodes in one's own life, without assumptions of hidden forces or a continued future luck. A lucky turn of events, a lucky coincidence, a lucky free kick in a football game, could easily, almost by definition have been less lucky.",

The traumas vary widely from physical abuse to being parented by someone suffering a serious psychiatric illness or alcohol addiction. The disorganised pattern is frequently met by those working with behaviourally very disturbed children. Perhaps a little confusing at first sight, the disorganised-unresolved classification can be superimposed on one of the three organised attachment patterns of secure, avoidant and ambivalent, whichever 'best fits'. This is meant to suggest that, when the individual is not immediately caught up in their fear and distress, an underpinning 'organised' attachment style operates. However, at times of stress and emotional low points, the disorganised interactional pattern predominates, adversely affecting relationships and the ability to cope.",

      "abstract": "Future offenders have more ratings than controls on variables indicating psychopathology. The characteristics which most consistently and significantly discriminate between preoffenders and controls, and which also turned out to be the best predictors of future criminality, are those which previously have been observed in subjects with serious mental disorders. The results indicate that the high degree of psychopathology in subsequent offenders is associated with distortion of body image and with poor reality orientation, i.e. that the most prominent characteristics of future offenders are related to a weakness of the ego. Future offenders seem to have a sufficiently developed ego to handle common tasks. However, their ego fails when they are confronted with unfamiliar and frustrating situations. The inability of subsequent offenders to complete a task properly, with failure on difficult and provocative tasks, shows that they have not developed adequate defence mechanisms and that they have a low tolerance for frustration. They are emotionally immature, instable and impulsive. In short, they are dominated by id impulses. There is no indication of gender confusion (homosexuality) in subsequent offenders. However, there are marked differences between the drawings by cases and by controls regarding characteristics related to sexuality. These findings are interpreted as an exaggeration of masculinity and an abnormal preoccupation with sexuality combined with anxiety for the opposite sex. It is possible that severe criminality, contrary to milder forms of lawbreaking, is associated with elevated self-esteem and extroversion. There are indications that ultimate offenders experience human beings (others or themselves) as deviant, monstrous and inhuman, features which indicate that distorted self-concept and distorted self-perception are characteristics of preoffenders. The findings regarding aggression are inconsistent, just as they were in prior projects. The Draw-A-Person Test (DAP) and Colour Slide Test (CST) findings indicate that preoffenders are more aggressive and destructive than controls, whereas the Hand Test (HT) shows neither more aggression nor more acting-out tendencies in future offenders than in controls. The literature offers conflicting findings regarding depression. The CST results indicate that depression is more common in preoffenders than in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Rape is a sexual act committed against a person without consent or without explicit consent. This is a very serious form of sexual violence and violates human rights. Rape can occur in a variety of contexts, including during an intimate relationship, by someone you know, or even by a stranger. This can cause deep physical and emotional trauma to victims, as well as having far-reaching impacts on society as a whole. It is important to take steps to prevent rape and provide support to victims. Rape carried out on women or men usually causes very severe trauma to them. Usually, the person becomes uncomfortable, insecure, and afraid of meeting people. He will feel alone forever, and think about ending himself, because he thinks that he is no longer pure. Usually, rape is committed by someone or several individuals, known or unknown, who deliberately rape the victim. Rape may occur because the perpetrator likes the victim, or because the perpetrator wants revenge on the victim, or there is something else. Women are creatures of God Almighty who are very perfect, because they give birth and breastfeed. In Indonesia, there are still many cases of rape that occur against women and children. The motive may be because the perpetrator likes the victim, or the perpetrator just wants revenge on the victim, or it was planned long ago by the perpetrator. Rape against women or girls is a form of sexual violence that occurs when someone commits a sexual act against a woman without her consent. This may include vaginal, anal, or oral penetration, as well as other sexual acts carried out with violence, threats, coercion, or the woman's inability to provide valid consent. Rape against women is often a form of expression of systematic gender inequality and domination. It is important to remember that rape does not only happen to women, but can also happen to men or individuals of various other gender identities. Nevertheless, rape of women is often in the spotlight due to its high prevalence and serious impact on the well-being of women and society as a whole. Therefore, it is important to continue fighting sexual violence and fighting for gender equality to create a safe and inclusive society for all individuals.",

Although peer and environmental factors play an important role in all drug use, family factors, psychological difficulties and emotional distress play a crucial role in the transition from controlled to excessive drug use. Essentially, dysfunctional parent – child relationships and severe family disruption contribute to emotional distress and to a sense of alienation from conventional sources of reward (family, school, work, and intimate relationships). For people who are distressed or alienated, heavy drug involvement can be a way to manage negative affect, bond with others, and/or experience alternative source of reward. Even people who use drugs to manage negative affect, however, are also likely to use them in some circumstances such as to have fun and be social. Excessive substance use also results in emotional distress, and it can be difficult to distinguish cause and consequence.",

      "abstract": "Whilst one would not expect the incidence of male rape to approach that of female rape in our society, the finding is that it is not so rare an event as would appear from the reported incidents. Unfortunately, the underreporting of the crime supports the general acknowledgement as established fact that rape is almost exclusively a crime against women and children.\nThis is extremely unfortunate, as the effects of male rape are manifold and far-reaching.\nMale victims make it clear that the rape on its own is stressful. This strain is then exacerbated by the scepticism of family members, peers, police and the judicial system.\nRape is commonly misconstrued to be a sexually motivated crime and it is assumed that males are unlikely targets of such victimisation. That he was a victim is sometimes linked to questions being raised around the victim's own sexual orientation.\nIt not uncommon for a victim of a rape to ejaculate during the assault. In misidentifying ejaculation with orgasm, the victim is often discouraged from reporting the assault for fear that his sexuality may become suspect.\nFurther disruption in the male victim's lifestyle has been evidenced by eating and sleeping disorders, psychological reactions, drug and/or alcohol abuse, social reactions, and sexual changes.\nFinally, there is the reality of rape trauma syndrome symptoms.\nUnder South African law, rape is, by definition, gender specific. Despite the Constitutional guarantees to equality, as far as men are concerned in South Africa, the law of rape does not apply. In an attempt to remedy the dissonance, the South African Law Commission was tasked with developing relevant legislation. In its final proposals it has presented for approval, a definition of rape consonant with the Constitutional guarantees is being put forward.\nOther international jurisdictions have already introduced similar legislation.",

      "title": "Weaponized sex: Defensive pseudo-erotic aggression in the service of safety",
      "abstract": "Problematic sexual behaviors are frequently encountered in the treatment of patients suffering Dissociative Identity Disorder and related forms of dissociative disorders. These may include unfortunate patterns of ready acquiescence or submission to overtly or potentially aggressive or sexual approaches/encounters, subtle and/or overt seductive signaling and behaviors, and even overt sexually provocative patterns of verbalizations and actions. This paper discusses the possibility that in some instances, sexual behavior has become weaponized; that is, deployed in circumstances under which assertiveness and/or aggression or other self-protective measures might be expected, probably because such behaviors were not within the range of the possible or were not understood as potentially successful for some victims of trauma. Clinical manifestations are described and discussed. An animal model in which sexual behaviors substitute for aggressive behaviors is described. A speculative hypothesis is offered, postulating that in some cases, such patterns in traumatized humans might represent an epigenetic response to exogenous trauma. Exploration of this model may lead to improved understandings and approaches to trauma victims who manifest such behavior, hopefully destigmatizing them further, facilitating reduction of their shame and guilt, and supporting their recoveries. Clinical interventions are suggested.",

      "abstract": "The article examines the influence of alcoholism as one of the main factors contributing to domestic violence. It was established that alcoholism is a problem that significantly increases the psychological causes of violence, is a significant factor that affects the spread of domestic violence, as it significantly changes a person’s behavior and psycho-emotional state. Under the influence of alcohol, people can lose self-control, become more aggressive and prone to violent actions, which is especially dangerous in the home environment, where interaction takes place against the background of close relationships and emotional dependence. It is motivated that people under the influence of alcohol can exaggerate the importance of minor misunderstandings or react to them with disproportionate aggression, which leads to the escalation of conflicts that could be resolved without violence under normal circumstances. It is indicated that an important aspect is that alcoholism affects the psychological state of all family members. Victims of violence, especially domestic violence, often feel isolated and vulnerable, which can lead to social tension and conflict in communities. Victims of domestic violence may experience constant fear and stress due to the unpredictability of their partner’s behavior, which creates a state of chronic tension that can lead to mental disorders. It is highlighted how the use of alcohol changes a person’s behavior, reducing his ability to self-control and increasing the risk of aggressive actions. Particular attention is paid to how alcoholism creates economic instability and psychological stress for victims, making it difficult to get out of violent relationships. The social aspect of the problem was also investigated, in particular the influence of the cultural legitimization of alcohol on the perception of violence. In some societies, alcohol is part of a cultural practice that can contribute to the normalization of aggressive behavior and reduce the perceived seriousness of violence. To effectively combat domestic violence, it is necessary to change social norms and raise awareness of the negative consequences of alcoholism, while providing adequate support to victims.",

      "abstract": "An axiom of medicine is to diagnose and treat a disease in its formative stages before it becomes so advanced that treatment is difficult or impossible. The same theme runs through aspects of neonatology and developmental pediatrics—organ systems and processes are laid down early in development and supportive or deleterious factors operating during these early stages can permanently influence or alter the course of development. Belief in \"formative Stages was applied to behavior by Sigmund Freud who emphasized the crucial contribution of early experiences to adult personality. A half century later, the same general principle was used to justify Head Start, an educational program that was supposed to equalize the social classes by providing an intellectual boost to disadvantaged children during their formative years. The principle of \"formative years\" pervaded theory and practice in developmental psychology for decades, but there were always dissonant findings. For example, five decades of research shows quite clearly that test scores obtained within the first year or two of life do not predict later intelligence for normal children.1 Weight and especially skinfold thickness assessed during infancy do not predict later weight or obesity, and early social disadvantage and stress do not necessarily lead to later psychosocial dysfunction. Indeed, today the emphasis in some quarters of developmental psychology is on change, modifiability, and unpredictability in development rather than on consistency.2",

Most of these characteristics were universally present where detailed information about the nature of family relationships was accessible. Before the offence, there were obvious signs in the man's behaviour indicating a deterioration in his mental health, which in turn affected his ability to cope with the separation. Apparently none of the men (with one possible exception) sought treatment for their mental illness, but I could not verify this because most of them had committed suicide.",

      "abstract": "Frotteurism is a perverted sexual behaviour wherein the person tends to rub or bring about physical contact between his genitals and an unrelated female or male to derive sexual pleasure. Moreover, frotteurism is a common phenomenon among the general population which usually goes unnoticed or overlooked. Nevertheless, public frottage has legal implications in almost all countries over the world. But, when frotteurism manifests on the backdrop of psychiatric illness or as a developmental abnormality then it is worth discussing what the legal liability would be. The present case report is based on hypersexual frotteuristic behaviour manifested on the background of a concealed psychiatric illness, featuring depression and obsessive compulsive disease. The hypersexual behaviour manifested in the form of masturbation with features of frotteurism and subsequent development of depression. Nevertheless, compulsive manifestation of frotteuristic behaviour and subsequent development of morbid depression is rare. This paper describes a 12-year-old boy having unrestrained impulsive frotteurism with his peers, school mates and with his younger brother. He was conscious of the fact and feeling guilty of what he was doing but unable to restrain himself. It was followed by the development of symptoms of depression which was treated with Sertraline. Concurrent psychiatric counseling and rehabilitation measures were taken too. There was complete remission of the symptoms 6 months after the onset of treatment and without relapse thereafter. The paper discusses the differential diagnosis and management of hypersexual behaviour.",

Generally, they are peaceful, obsessive, often hypothymic; they express disgust for the body, suffer various somatic dysfunctions due to the sexual stasis; they have difficulties in communicating with things and beings. As compared to erective impotents, it seems that the global impotents have a more rigid father, are among the younger sibblings and have more brothers and sisters.

      "title": "The Biology Of Affection",
      "abstract": "Affectionate communication comprises the verbal and nonverbal behaviors people use to express messages of love, appreciation, fondness, and commitment to others in close relationships. Like all interpersonal behaviors, affectionate communication has biological and physiological antecedents, consequences, and correlates, many of which have implications for physical health and wellness. Investigating these factors within a biological framework allows for the adjudication of influences beyond those attributable to the environment. In particular, there are observable genetic and neurological differences between individuals with a highly affectionate disposition and those less prone to communicating affection, suggesting that variance in the tendency to engage in affectionate behavior is not entirely the result of environmental influences such as enculturation, parenting, and media exposure. In addition, the expression of affection is associated with markers of immune system competence and appears to help the body to relax and remain calm. The biological effects of affectionate communication are perhaps most pronounced in situations involving either acute or chronic stress. Specifically, highly affectionate individuals are less likely than others to overreact physiologically to stress-inducing events. Whatever stress reaction they do mount is better regulated than among their less affectionate counterparts. Moreover, highly affectionate individuals—or simply those who receive expressions of affection prior to or immediately following a stressful situation—exhibit faster physiological recovery from their elevated stress. Perhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, being deprived of adequate affectionate communication is predictive of multiple physical and psychological detriments, including elevated stress and exacerbated depression, social and relational problems, insecure attachment, susceptibility to diagnosed anxiety and mood disorders, susceptibility to diagnosed secondary immune disorders, chronic pain, and sleep disturbances.",

      "title": "Hair pulling (trichotillomania).",
      "abstract": "Based on the findings in this case and common elements reported in other articles on trichotillomania, there seems to be evidence that the \"irresistible urge\" to pull out the hair has its beginnings in the early years of a child's life. The nature of the parent-child relationships appears to be especially important in establishing psychological antecedents for the later development of trichotillomania. Specifically, the trichotillomanic's mother sets the stage for the emergence of this symptom by extending the child's dependence upon her as the primary need-gratifier beyond early childhood into latency, adolescence, and adulthood. As a result the child is not gradually propelled to participate in newer and more complex learning experiences that ultimately lead to a sense of mastery and independent functioning in the environment. Important developmental stimuli are not presented at the appropriate times and the child is not exposed to certain types of interactions at the optimal times so that some very important ego functions do not develop, or develop minimally, or in a distorted manner. Simply, the mother cannot \"let go\" of her child, apparently deriving gratification of her own needs through infantilization of the child; as a result the child develops a limited or illusory sense of self sufficiency. Continuation of such an unhealthy symbiotic relationship, however, is found in many forms of psychopathology and the fact that it also underlies trichotillomania may partially account for hair pulling as a symptom associated with such a wide range of nosological categories. It is the main contention of this study, however, that the quality of the parent-child relationships impairs the ego development and causes failure of the trichotillomanic patient to establish object constancy. Without the establishment of object constancy an individual requires visible evidence that the object/person capable of gratifying basic security needs is present or available. In trichotillomania the hair seems to symbolize the need-gratifying object/person who is lost when the hair is pulled out and, more importantly, regained when it is eaten or restored. It appears to be this latter component of trichotillomania, i.e., reincorporation of the need-gratifying object/person, which reassures the patient that infantile needs can be gratified and security can be reestablished. Unfortunately, the trichotillomanic is driven to repeatedly and compulsively remove hair so that it can be regained temporarily since object constancy is never really established.",

      "title": "Jealousy in Close Relationships From an Evolutionary and Cultural Perspective",
      "abstract": "Abstract Jealousy occurs when one feels an actual or potential intimate relationship is threatened by a real or imagined rival. This chapter shows that the psychological experience of jealousy is associated with physical and hormonal characteristics. Particularly, the focus is on the distinction between possessive jealousy and reactive jealousy in humans and other species. Possessive jealousy is a preventive reaction that often results in mate guarding. Among human males, possessive jealousy aims to prevent investment in offspring sired by another male, whereas among human females, it seems to have evolved to obtain and preserve the investment of males in offspring and for disease avoidance. Possessive jealousy is related to cultural factors, such as parental control of mate choice, life history (in particular attachment style and father absence), and domestic violence. Regarding reactive jealousy (i.e., the responses to actual sexual and emotional intimacy with a third person), we discuss sex differences in emotional versus sexual jealousy, how reactive jealousy is experienced, and the variables to which it is related. Jealousy implies by definition a rival, and assessing the threat of a rival is a basic, adaptive mechanism rooted in intrasexual competition. This aspect of jealousy may also occur when one has not yet established a relationship but is trying to obtain a mate. In the context of the evaluation of rivals, we focus in particular on sex differences and similarities in the rival characteristics that evoke jealousy among heterosexual, homosexual, and transgender men and women.",

      "title": "From Experiencing Abuse to Seeking Protection: Examining the Shame of Intimate Partner Violence",
      "abstract": "Shame permeates the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV). People who perpetrate IPV commonly use tactics designed to cause shame in their partner, including denigrating their dignity, undermining their autonomy, or harming their reputation. Many IPV survivors report an abiding sense of shame as a result of their victimization—from a lost sense of self, to self-blame, to fear of (or actual) social judgment. When seeking help for abuse, many survivors are directed to, or otherwise encounter, persons or institutions that reinforce rather than mitigate their shame. Survivors with marginalized social identities often must contend not only with the shame of IPV victimization, but also with the shame that follows being stigmatized or otherwise assigned inaccurate or incomplete \"identities.\" Understanding how these layers of shame can shape a survivor's experience matters. Shame can be a destructive harm that devastates a person's sense of self-worth. It can lead to long-term psychological injury, and can be both a source and outcome of trauma. A desire to reduce shame's damaging impact can cause survivors to utilize coping behaviors that may be self-protective, but profoundly misunderstood by the people and institutions to whom they turn for help. Included among those institutions is the civil legal system. Protection orders are the most common legal intervention for IPV and can be critical tools for responding to it. Yet to obtain a protection order, survivors must enter a process that often deprives them of their privacy and ability to control their self-image—experiences anchored in shame. Without understanding shame's behavioral and psychological effects, survivors risk having their claims of victimization discredited, harming their ability to obtain necessary safety and relief. This Article explores these individual, social, and institutional dimensions of shame. It examines how those who work or interact with survivors can better understand the shame that results from traumatic experiences, and the trauma that results from shame-intensive ones. This Article further explores strategies to reduce the shame that can pervade civil litigation. These strategies include prioritizing survivor dignity and narrative control—critical antidotes to the harms that shame can cause.",

This balance includes satisfying the needs of the individual, achieving the requirements of the environment, and biologists use the term adaptation to survive the organism, in contrast psychologists use the term for the survival of the individual in mental health, and refers to the concept of adaptation to psychological events that exclude cases To restore the individual to the appropriate level of his life in his environment.\r\nThe term of the other is broad, loose and indistinguishable. As a more comprehensive expression than being restricted in a certain way, it means any character other than the self, whether identical or opposite in form and content. It may mean the enemy, friend or neutral, whether in family, tribal, Sectarianism, although it’s most common meaning means another person or group of heterosexuals with a uniform identity.\r\nThe psychological variables represent a group of factors affecting human behavior and behavior. If the person is tense and unstable, his actions and reactions are illogical and irregular. If the person is calm and balanced, his actions are studied, organized and more rational. The psychological characteristics of the groups and the patterns of social interaction and the reciprocal influences among the individuals are reflected in the actions and behavior of the individual, social factors are the sum of the surrounding of the individual circumstances and factors and the social environment in which he lives.\r\nThe slums are areas deprived of basic facilities and services and therefore they produce many problems that disturb society and negatively affect its security and safety, and spread among its population poverty, unemployment, delinquency, crime, addiction and other problems, which are the general characteristics of these areas.\r\nThe objective of the research is to study the psychological and social variables related to adaptation and acceptance of the other in the Egyptian society.\r\nThe research has reached to some recommendations, which are:\r\n1 - The need to pay attention to human relations, starting from the family, school, and institutions of work in planting the foundations of the desire to the other.\r\n2 - The need to emphasize the role of the educational system in giving young people the skills of understanding and dialogue and acceptance of the other.\r\n3 - The need to adjust the negative trends in the population of slums and popular to positive trends towards acceptance of the other.",

      "title": "Voice shame: Self-censorship in vocal performance",
      "abstract": "Voice shame is the uncomfortable feeling of being heard as ridiculous, worthless or ‘not good enough’. Voice shame arises when a subject becomes aware of an observer’s attention and believes the evaluation to be negative. It causes intensive monitoring of one’s vocal expression and of others’ perception of oneself. The effects of voice shame are largely hidden, since performers will tend to gravitate towards self-staging strategies that comply with conventions, in order to avoid shame. Worried attempts to prevent shame through self-monitoring and active control of one’s voice, body, and impact on others may cause serious difficulties with vocal performance. Voice shame can affect professional and non-professional voice users. Shame is a non-cognitive self-rejection. It presupposes internalized ideals and criteria of quality, learned through interaction with external authorities, such as parents, peers, mass media or music teachers. The self that judges and rejects itself is a product of social interaction; it is situated and reflects the demands and constraints posed by both tacit and explicit cultural values and educational traditions, ideals and methods. Triggers of, and thresholds for, shame differ between individuals, within frameworks that are largely common to members of a given subculture. Based on empirical studies of music students and professional pop, jazz and classical singers, we apply French philosopher Michel Foucault’s discourse-theory to the analysis of disciplinary mechanisms among vocal performers. The concept of voice shame is presented as a source of insight into the dynamics of singers’ self-regulation, self-staging and self-censorship, and hence as a useful tool for the voice teacher.",

Hypotheses about the cause (or causes) of such behavior have ranged widely, from organic-genetic theories to the intrapsychic or interpersonal formulations proposed by psychosocially oriented therapists. These latter formulations, when applied to male homosexuality, have included such factors as unresolved oedipal problems, castration anxiety, fear of heterosexuality, fear of women, identification with the female, role confusion, and the problem of dependency.<sup>1,2</sup> There has been an increasing and presumably more sophisticated tendency to ascribe homosexual behavior to any one, or a combination, of these factors, rather than to insist upon a unitary hypothesis, eg, that all homosexual behavior is motivated by castration anxiety, or that all such behavior is an expression of psychic masochism. In this sense, homosexual behavior may be seen as a final common pathway chosen",

      "abstract": "Various research studies have shown that prenatal diagnosis has a considerable effect on the couple, irrespective of the result of the diagnosis or the couple's decision. If a couple decides to terminate pregnancy as a consequence of the diagnostic outcome, the ensuing mourning process is known to be similar to mourning after stillbirth; either way it means the loss of a wanted pregnancy. Also, deliberate termination intensifies guilt feelings, especially if, as in Down's syndrome, the anomaly would not have affected the child's viability. For these reasons, psychological support for such couples is primarily aimed at overcoming the loss of a wanted pregnancy. Among the important recurrent topics are the couple's guilt feelings, their fear of another pregnancy with a traumatizing outcome, their insecurity regarding their relationship and sexual life, and possibly an impaired self-image. Since a certain relief may be felt in the first hours or days after the interruption and negative feelings may develop only later, it is very important to ensure long-term counseling and support. Indeed, it would be appropriate and helpful if psychological counseling could be taken up prior to prenatal diagnosis, so that the best solution for the couple can be worked out calmly in conjunction with them.",

      "abstract": "Trust is essential for a secure and flourishing social life, but many economic and philosophical approaches argue that rational people should never extend it, in particular to strangers they will never encounter again. Emerging data on the trust game, a laboratory economic exchange, suggests that people trust strangers excessively (i.e., far more than their tolerance for risk and cynical views of their peers should allow). What produces this puzzling \"excess\" of trust? We argue that people trust due to a norm mandating that they show respect for the other person's character, presuming the other person has sufficient integrity and goodwill even if they do not believe it privately. Six studies provided converging evidence that decisions to trust follow the logic of norms. Trusting others is what people think they should do, and the emotions associated with fulfilling a social duty or responsibility (e.g., guilt, anxiety) account for at least a significant proportion of the excessive trust observed. Regarding the specific norm in play, trust rates collapse when respect for the other person's character is eliminated as an issue.",

The data indicate that negative reactions to unfamiliar persons become common during the second half of the first year. Positive reactions also occur, and there is evidence that certain infant attributes, stranger characteristics, and contextual features affect whether or not the infant becomes distressed. This complex phenomenon can be best understood as a developmental organizer. The negative reactions noted in the literature have most often been construed as expressions of interpersonal wariness reflecting recognition of the stranger's unfamiliarity or novelty. The possibilities that such responses also mirror the infant's emerging sensitivity to atypical social behavior and intrapsychic anxiety about his developing sense of separateness are discussed. Examination of research methodology points to several common shortcomings in the studies.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Infidelity has always been an interesting topic to talk about amongst peers or even a viral headline on our social media. This phenomenon is also known as an undercurrent social symptom that is based on emotional connection and leans more on the doers' biological needs. The researcher is interested in finding the perception of the doers of committing infidelity despite their legal status. The research relies on the Phenomenology of Perception and Symbolic Interactionism. Narrations, stories, and wordings are being used as a qualitative analysis of the characteristics of Enklarendes Verstehen which started with silence. Analysis was carried out through an interpretive approach. The informant's status when asked for information was still (husband/wife), had or was still having an affair Silence is crucial and effective in listening and gathering valuable information to reach an understanding of the actions of other people in doing something. The research concludes that the act of infidelity results in the doers having two opposite feelings at the same time; happy yet restless, exciting but feels so challenged and addicted such as the spice of rujak. This is aligned with the phenomenology of communication that there is no conceptual schema besides an experience to reveal the truth than an observation. Keywords: Phenomenology, Perception, Symbolic Interactionism ABSTRAK Hubungan perselingkuhan kerap menjadi topik seru bahkan viral dibicarakan dalam beranda media sosial. Fenomena perselingkuhan ini juga disebut sebagai gejala sosial “Arus bawah” (Undercurrent) yang dilandasi kedekatan emosional dan cenderung berorientasi pada kebutuhan biologis. Peneliti tertarik untuk mengetahui persepsi perselingkuhan bagi pelaku mengingat kebanyakan dari mereka telah menyandang status resmi. Penelitian ini bersandar pada fenomenologi persepsi dan teori interaksi simbolik. Narasi, cerita, kata-kata dan tatanan bahasa digunakan sebagai sumber data kualitatif yang dianalisis dengan karakteristik Enklarendes Verstehen yang dimulai dengan diam. Analisis dilakukan melalui pendekatan interpretif. Status informan saat dimintai keterangan masih berstatus (suami/istri), pernah dan masih melakukan perselingkuhan. Diam adalah cara efektif untuk menangkap pengertian dan pemahaman yang berkaitan dengan orang-orang yang berada dalam pengalaman tertentu sehingga dapat memperoleh nilai dan pengalaman yang berkualitas. Hasil dari penelitian ini menyimpulkan bahwa perselingkuhan memberikan dua rasa yang berbeda dalam waktu bersamaan, senang tetapi tidak tenang, seru dan menantang bahkan menagihkan seperti pedas-pedas rujak. Sejalan dengan apa yang menjadi hakikat fenomenologi dalam komunikasi bahwa tidak ada skema konseptual diluar pengalaman langsung yang memadai untuk menyingkapkan kebenaran, hanya lewat perhatian yang sadar kebenaran dapat diketahui.

      "title": "Gender Dysphoria and Transvestism in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Schizophrenia and gender dysphoria have been linked in certain studies, but this is controversial. Transsexualism and schizophrenia, however, can coexist.[1,2] About 20–25% of people with schizophrenia have sex change delusions.[3] People with schizophrenia may experience gender dysphoria as a result of a delusional shift in gender identity or it may develop independently of psychotic symptoms. Making a distinction between these cases is difficult from a diagnostic standpoint as well as from a therapeutic perspective. A 40-year-old unmarried male from a lower socioeconomic class from an urban background with no family history of psychiatric illness and a well-adjusted premorbid personality but with a past 10 years history as a known case of paranoid schizophrenia was brought to psychiatry out-patient department (OPD) after a drug drop out. He presented with complaints of the belief that he was in the wrong body and identified himself as a transsexual, suspicious toward transsexuals that they have done this to him, shyness while talking to males and distressed due to the same, worrying thoughts about his sexual orientation, and why was he not normal like other males. Mental status examination revealed a middle-aged male dressed in women's clothes, sitting cross-legged and lip gesturing with a mood conveyed as sad with distressed affect with delusions of persecution with lack of insight and impaired judgment. He was restarted on olanzapine 20 mg on which his psychotic symptoms resolved. He was also started on fluoxetine 40 mg to which his mood showed improvement, He was psycho-educated about gender identity but was unable to accept his gender dysphoria, constantly denied, blamed the transsexuals, and considered himself a heterosexual. He showed partial improvement, psychotic symptoms reduced significantly, his confusion about his sexual orientation, and dysphoria still persists. Acceptance of gender incongruence has begun to be seen after the onset of therapy. In this case, despite the presence of delusion of sex change, there were a lot of behavioral changes like shying away when talking to males, uncomfortable in one's own body, unwillingness to marry a woman, and presence of constant denial about his biological sexual orientation, which suggested significant gender dysphoria. In this case report, gender dysphoria symptoms were present long before schizophrenia symptoms appeared, and the latter condition seemed to improve after counseling and therapy. This may imply that the belief in sex change associated with gender dysphoria is a rather stable one and that the schizophrenia symptoms are merely a florid amplification of the trait. However, whether the transvestism was a result of schizophrenia or gender dysphoria, still remains a diagnostic dilemma. However, reports of transvestism with psychosis are extremely rare.[4,5] Gender dysphoria and transvestism comorbid with schizophrenia are extremely rare and still remain a diagnostic dilemma because of the presence of sexual delusions in the course of paranoid schizophrenia itself.

      "title": "Differences in Attribution of Responsibility by Police Recruits and Their Wives",
      "abstract": "Heider (1) proposed that responsibility for an action r.ust lie in the actor and/or his environment. Prytula, Whiteside, and Davidson ( 2 ) found that life experiences affect the extent to which a person is prone to emphasize the personal factors in attributing responsibility to a negative event. Shaver ( 4 ) indicated that individuals will attribute responsibility in a defensive manner if they believe they might find themselves in a similar situation. Rafky ( 3 ) suggested chat police wives experience anxiety over the potential dangers in their husbands' profession. To believe in the random occurrence of negative events could increase her anxiety, as it would imply that her husband could not avoid the potential harmful events that might arise in the execution of his duties. It would be more comforting to believe that people bring negative consequences on themselves, thus her husband could avoid them. She should, then, tend to hold others relatively more personally responsible for negative events with which they are associated. O n the other hand, a police recruit is usually unsure about his untested prowess and possibly anxious about making an error that could hurt someone or end his job or life. It would be more comforting for him to emphasize the relative contribution of environmental factors in the occurrence of negative events. He should therefore tend to hold others relatively less personally responsible for negative events with which they are associated. Indeed Prytula, et al. ( 2 ) found police recruits were more likely to emphasize environmental factors than were veteran police officers. In an ongoing longitudinal study of police in a community a total of 16 police recruits and their wives (ages 21 to 30 yr., Mdn 24 yr.) were administered 12 scenarios representing different negative outcomes ( 5 ) . Subjects were asked to decide the personal responsibility lwel of the acting agent in rhe scenario. Data supported the hypothesis as police wives ( M = 24.99, SD = 17.72) attributed (on a 41-point scale) more pcrsonal responsibility to others for their actions than did their husbands ( M = 22.20, SD = 17.01; F = 5.19, p < .03). The recruit seems more likely to consider the role of environmental factors in attributing responsibility while his wife is more likely to emphasize personal factors in the actor. REFERENCES 1.

Since then the concept has been elaborated, and several psychosocial and demographical factors which favour a development of folie à deux have been described. Those involved are often isolated from society and have a close emotional relationship. Folie à deux has occurred most often in relationships within a nuclear family, especially between sisters, spouses, mother and child. The primary partner has been noted as being older, more intelligent and better educated.

      "title": "Assessing The Issues of Honour and Violence Against Women: A Human Rights Discourse Framework for The Detection of Violence Against Women",
      "abstract": "The term 'Honour Killing' is conventionally used to denote a specific category of extralegal killings where the act of murder is seen to have been motivated by pre-modern affiliations/sentiments of some sort. Acts of violence committed against people for marrying outside of caste/religion/ethnicity or other similar infringements where they are seen by their actions to have besmirched the honour of the family and the larger community come under the broad rubric of honour crime. Implicit in using the term are assumptions that mark it as different from other crimes. Honour is defined in terms of women assigned sexual and familial roles as dictated by traditional family ideology. Thus, adultery, premarital relationships (which may or may not include sexual relations), rape, and falling in love with an \"inappropriate\" person may constitute violations of family honour. 'Crimes of honour' as a form of violence against women does not imply that men also are not subjected to such crimes. In cases of forced marriage or interference with the right of choice and whom to marry, pressure from older family members over younger members will apply to men as well as to women. However, women remain the victims and survivors of 'crimes of honour' and have fewer available remedies.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety refers to an excessive fear of a person that he or she will be embarrassed and/or that will be scrutinized and rejected by other people, and according to the diagnostic criteria, this is one of the basic characteristics of socially anxious people. There is a strong desire for presenting a desirable image of themselves to other people, accompanied by considerable uncertainty that it can be done. Harmonious and deep relationships with family members, friends and romantic partners are very important for every person, but for socially anxious people they are a source of stress. A number of studies have shown that social anxiety disrupts interpersonal relationships. On the one hand, socially anxious, like most people, want social acceptance and intimacy and they have a desire to achieve satisfying relationships with other people. But, on the other hand, their beliefs and strategies prevent them from participating in social encounters and the disaffiliation makes them lonely and depressed. Their inhibitory and avoiding behaviors have negative consequences for developing and maintaining close relationships. Socially anxious people have strong conflict between need for affiliation and need for avoidance other people. Studies have also shown that although socially anxious people are characterized by an avoidant style of interaction there is evidence that they also develop a dependent interpersonal style.",

      "abstract": "Anorectal malformations cause life long conditions, making it necessary to find ways of communicating the disability in the social context. Incontinence, regular enemas, genital reconstruction, catheterization and scares are just some of the common difficulties affected people have to live with. Intimate disabilities like anorectal malformations cause feelings of shame and embarrassment, and are taboo in our society. Experiences of rejection or just the fear of it cause affected people to hide their disability. In a qualitative study, affected young adults talked about the impact of this disability on their lifes. All interviewees started to hide their condition sometime in older childhood and early adolescents. After a struggling process, torn between fears of discovery and rejection all of them found ways to communicate their condition. All interviewees described revealing their condition in stages and only to certain social groups. Trust is the main prerequisite for revelation. Trust has two aspects, first the person needs to trust that the information will not be spread and second there needs to be trust that the other person will be able to understand and accept the person despite their condition. Support through family, friends, and peers in a support group are helpful. Important in this process is once ability to accept their own condition.",

      "abstract": "To a healthy child who has been well trained, nothing appears more easy than to be happy; to a child who has been badly trained, whose infant years have been neglected or motherless, nothing appears more difficult. There is often something in the bodily constitution, too, which stands in the way of individual happiness, without our being sensible of any actual disease; and the mother ought to watch carefully every symptom of this nature as indications of growing evil, which may frustrate much of the good she naturally looks forward to in the future experience of her child. She ought especially to observe, if, when the family group are loudest in their mirth, there is one who falls back from the cheerful circle, and who, instead of catching the natural infection of laughter and glee, sits moping alone, with cloudy brow, and drooping head, as if incapable of partaking in the general feeling. Such a tendency as this, is generally to be attributed to some bodily indisposition, of which perhaps the child is not aware; but it may also arise from a peculiarity of temperament, only to be accounted for upon the principle that there are diseases of mind, as well as body, the seeds of which are inherent in our nature.",

      "title": "A Review on Paraphilias",
      "abstract": "Sexual deviations are disorders in which the individual has fantasies, sexual desires or behaviors that are repetitive and sexually provocative and often include inhumane issues for at least 6 months. Since these people   usually make various legal problems for both themselves and others, this disorder is of special interest. Different models have discussed on the etiology of sexual deviations among of which the special psychoanalysis of Freud have investigated this disorder more comprehensively. In Freudian’s psychoanalysis, sexual deviation has a neurosis structure and shows that sexual deviated has in fact accepted the deprivation of the mother,  but is still trying to return to the bosom of the mother and the denying father. Also, in self-psychology the sexual deviant who has had wrong repeating scenarios in regards to his/hers relationship with parents or as a sadistic seeks to create a temporary and false glorious sense of confidence, to create  a   grandiose self who is self- sufficient and does not need anyone. In many cases body organ justifications are also considered for sexual deviations. Among the examined patients in psychiatric clinics, 74% had hormone level disorders,  27% had neurologic symptoms, 24%, had chromosomal disorders, 9%  had epilepsy, 4% had abnormal EEG, 4% had major psychiatric disorders  , and 4% had mental retardation .Some sources propose 9 identifications for sexual deviation which include: Fetishism, Pedophilia, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Sexual Masochism, Sexual Sadism, Transvestic fetishism, Frotteurism and Paraphilias. The treatment of sexual deviations has great complexity due to its coincidnce with psychiatric disorders such as personality disorders, as well as other factors such as the patients’ shame and modesty and not stating their problems. The treatment of sexual deviation is considered to have four general purposes including a) reducing sexual desires b) giving insight and understanding to the patient c) controlling external stimuli d) treating concurrent disorders.The treatment of sexual deviation involves extensive ranges of biological therapies to mental therapies.  One of the major approaches to psychotherapy in the treatment of sexual deviations is the insight oriented approach that causes a person to improve his interpersonal skills and to find an acceptable method for sexual gratification. Treatment in groups through specific procedures and guidelines and practices can also help the patients. When a person has other psychiatric disorders, pharmacotherapy can treat concurrent biological problems of the individual as well as reducing sexual and obsessive desires. In rare cases where the problem is very serious or causes legal conflicts, surgical treatment is recommended. Keywords: Review, Paraphilias,  Transvestic, Justice, Frotteurism",

      "abstract": "A very powerful form of preoedipal guilt stems from a sense of having damaged the life-giving parent with one's most basic needs. A related phenomenon is the child's sense that another subjectivity has deliberately chosen to give and sustain the child's life. This experience gives rise to a compelling mixture of awe, reverence, and obligation, a sense of guilt about being born, of debt concerning the gift of life . This sense of guilt and debt are part of every child's development. Depending on how conflicts surrounding them are negotiated, the child can come to feel either an appetite for living or a crushing sense of selfishness and unworthiness. Such forms of guilt and debt may lead not only to masochism generally, but to a particularly pernicious form of negative therapeutic reaction that can sabotage psychoanalytic work. A patient may feel, for instance, that a successful psychoanalysis is a selfish indulgence and an immoral betrayal of a sacred duty to rescue his or her parents from their misery. Guilt about being born and the sense of debt concerning the gift of life are linked to various developmental, psychodynamic, interpersonal, and cultural phenomena.",

      "abstract": "A social relationship, regardless of whether it is communal or associative in character, will be spoken of as “open” to outsiders if and insofar as its system of order does not deny participation to anyone who wishes to join and is actually in a position to do so. A relationship will, on the other hand, be called “closed” against outsiders so far as, according to its subjective meaning and its binding rules, participation of certain persons is excluded, limited, or subjected to conditions. Whether a relationship is open or closed may be determined traditionally, affectually, or rationally in terms of values or of expediency. It is especially likely to be closed, for rational reasons, in the following type of situation: a social relationship may provide the parties to it with opportunities for the satisfaction of spiritual or material interests, whether absolutely or instrumentally, or whether it is achieved through co-operative action or by a compromise of interests. If the participants expect that the admission of others will lead to an improvement of their situation, an improvement in degree, in kind, in the security or the value of the satisfaction, their interest will be in keeping the relationship open. If, on the other hand, their expectations are of improving their position by monopolistic tactics, their interest is in a closed relationship.",

Fliess, the term “secret” (geheim, geheimnis) appears frequently, hence its weight and significance in psychic life, and implicitly as a form of intimacy and of confidentiality shared in the analytical relationship. The need and ability to keep a secret, but also the ability to confess, to share a secret, are mainly related to a certain elaboration of the sexual register, pre-oedipal and oedipal, of the elaboration of the traumatic, of the affects of shame, humiliation, guilt, as well as their impact on the psychic life of the subject, how they marked the subject’s existence and relationships. Another essential dimension is the inter- and transgenerational transmission of family “secrets” – often violent, incestuous experiences, such as severe diseases, genetic abnormalities, murders, suicides – transmitted over two, three or more generations, unconsciously. This work aims to reveal the secret’s dimension of life in clinical practice, as well as the deadly dimension of secrets and their vicissitudes in transfer-counter transference.",

This abuse produces many behavioral, emotional, and physical problems in adult life. One such consequence is adult sexual promiscuity. Anxiety which arises over childhood abuse may be dealt with by compulsive or addictive behaviors. Repressed or forgotten abuse may manifest itself in adult life symptomatically by out-of-control behaviors which are abusive of self and/or others. Such compulsive behaviors reflect an attempt to gain mastery over the original abuse and the abuser. Keeping promiscuous behavior secret reinforces lhe original abuse pattern and leads to guilt, shame, and isolation. Countertransference issues facing the therapist are discussed. Four case histories show examples of male and female promiscuity following childhood abuse.",

      "abstract": "According to the object relations theory, romantic partners are chosen on the basis of similar, complementary emotional needs and that creates a promise on the conscious and unconscious level that all that was missing in the previous relationships of an individual would be repaired through this relationship. However, in any longer relationship the breach of expectations is inevitable (destruction of an idealized image of the partner), which leads to disappointment. The destiny of the relationship depends on the way in which partners will deal with the frustrating knowledge that their idealisations will not be realised, or the level of maturity of the relationship and each partner, which is a test that many do not pass. It is commonly known that divorce rates are higher than ever before, and some divorces become high-conflict relationships in which all emotions caused by the breakdown of the relationship swirl into one common aspect – parental functioning. This paper is focused on the couples who experience a difficult breakdown of their relationship – with a lot of anger, hostility, distrust, and sometimes with the incidents of verbal and/or physical abuse, accompanied by lengthy and distressing court proceedings. It is noticeable that the conflict has a role of redefining the dynamics of their new partnership relation, and at the same time it serves as a defense of a person who does not have to deal with and face with complex unpleasant emotions that are a part of every divorce. Unable to accept, analyse and tolerate the unpleasantness of the emotions brought by divorce, these couples often use defense mechanisms of splitting and projections. The usage of these mechanisms leads to the dynamics which is characterised by a cycle of harassment, retaliation and failed reparation attempts that in turn lead to further splitting and projection, often with the resulting outcome of a high-conflict divorce. Couples remain connected and locked in mutual patterns of conflict interactions, in a kind of a tango of loving hate in a manner which restricts their capacity to separate on emotional and daily practical level. After presenting two cases from practice that describe the outlined psychodynamic terms and the interactions of partners differently, practical implications which are possible in direct work with former partners will be presented.",

Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to: sexual payments for wanting something, coercion of sexual activity, derogatory statements about sexual orientation or sexuality, requests for sexual favors by the perpetrator, speech or behavior that has a sexual connotation; all can be classified as sexual harassment. This action can be conveyed directly or implicitly. The effect is on the victim, who is considered to be causing problems and not the perpetrator. In general, victims will keep their mouths shut, sometimes for a very long time, for these reasons, and there is a fear that they will become targets of abuse. They don't talk about it with friends or family. The healing process will be more difficult when there is denial from the institution, distrust, or blaming the victim. The rampant sexual harassment that is happening in Indonesia is troubling most people. Even during the current covid-19 pandemic, there is an increase in sexual harassment that occurs against women, even worse, it also happens to children who are still underage. Komnas Perempuan identified that during 2001 to 2012, there were at least 35 women who were victims of sexual violence every day. Meanwhile, the data released by Komnas Perempuan during the current covid-19 pandemic is 1,902 cases of sexual harassment that have occurred in Indonesia, as of Saturday, July 3, 2021. In this case, it is clear that there is still a lack of legal protection for cases involving threaten a person's personal personality, especially in cases of sexual harassment to sexual violence.",

      "title": "Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD‐11",
      "abstract": "During the last decade, there has been heated debate regarding whether compulsive sexual behaviour should be classified as a mental/behavioural disorder. Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been proposed for inclusion as an impulse control disorder in the ICD-111. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges, resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour over an extended period (e.g., six months or more) that causes marked distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The pattern is manifested in one or more of the following: a) engaging in repetitive sexual activities has become a central focus of the person's life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and responsibilities; b) the person has made numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour; c) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse consequences (e.g., repeated relationship disruption, occupational consequences, negative impact on health); or d) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour even when he/she derives little or no satisfaction from it. Concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours are explicitly addressed in the diagnostic guidelines proposed for the disorder. Individuals with high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., due to a high sex drive) who do not exhibit impaired control over their sexual behaviour and significant distress or impairment in functioning should not be diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. The diagnosis should also not be assigned to describe high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., masturbation) that are common among adolescents, even when this is associated with distress. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also emphasize that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be diagnosed based on psychological distress related to moral judgments or disapproval about sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that would otherwise not be considered indicative of psychopathology. Sexual behaviours that are egodystonic can cause psychological distress; however, psychological distress due to sexual behaviour by itself does not warrant a diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. Careful attention must be paid to the evaluation of individuals who self-identify as having the disorder (e.g., calling themselves \"sex addicts\" or \"porn addicts\"). Upon examination, such individuals may not actually exhibit the clinical characteristics of the disorder, although they might still be treated for other mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression). Additionally, individuals often experience feelings such as shame and guilt in relationship to their sexual behaviour2, but these experiences are not reliably indicative of an underlying disorder. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also assist the clinician in differentiating compulsive sexual behaviour disorder from other mental disorders and other health conditions. For example, although bipolar disorder has been found at elevated rates among individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder3, sexual behaviours must be persistent and occur independently of hypomanic or manic episodes to provide a basis for a possible diagnosis of the disorder. A diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be made when the behaviour can be explained by other medical conditions (e.g., dementia) or by the effects of certain medications prescribed to treat specific medical conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease)4 or is entirely attributable to the direct effects of illicit substances on the central nervous system (e.g., cocaine, crystal methamphetamine). Currently, there is an active scientific discussion about whether compulsive sexual behaviour disorder can constitute the manifestation of a behavioural addiction5. For ICD-11, a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming6. For this reason, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is not included in the ICD-11 grouping of disorders due to substance use and addictive behaviours, but rather in that of impulse control disorders. The understanding of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder will evolve as research elucidates the phenomenology and neurobiological underpinnings of the condition7. In the absence of consistent definitions and community-based epidemiological data, determining accurate prevalence rates of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been difficult. Epidemiological estimates have ranged up to 3-6% in adults8, though recent studies have produced somewhat lower estimates of 1 to 3%9. The more restrictive diagnostic requirements proposed for ICD-11 would be expected to produce lower prevalence rates. In general, men exhibit the disorder more frequently than women, although robust data examining gender differences are lacking. Additionally, higher rates of the disorder have been noted among individuals with substance use disorders. Among treatment seekers, the disorder negatively impacts occupational, relationship, physical health and mental health functioning. However, systematic data are lacking regarding the prevalence of the disorder across different populations and associated socio-cultural and socio-demographic factors, including among non-treatment seekers. Growing evidence suggests that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is an important clinical problem with potentially serious consequences if left untreated. We believe that including the disorder in the ICD-11 will improve the consistency with which health professionals approach the diagnosis and treatment of persons with this condition, including consistency regarding when a disorder should not be diagnosed. Legitimate concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours have been carefully addressed in the proposed diagnostic guidelines. We posit that inclusion of this category in the ICD-11 will provide a better tool for addressing the unmet clinical needs of treatment seeking patients as well as possibly reduce shame and guilt associated with help seeking among distressed individuals. The proposed diagnostic guidelines will be tested in international multilingual Internet-based field studies using standardized case material, which will help to assess the generalizability of the construct across different regions and cultures, and clinicians' ability to distinguish it from normal variations in sexual behaviour and from other disorders. Additional field studies in clinical settings will provide further information about the clinical utility of the proposed diagnostic guidelines for the disorder among clinical populations. Shane W.

The relational systems of subjugation that maintain such states of terror must, of necessity, destroy any authentic civic space in which individuals can flourish. Similar dynamics characterize child abuse within families. Survival requires the use of varied strategies, the most extreme of which are dissociative in nature, and that result in marked distortions of developmental trajectories across all psychological domains. Such dynamics are mirrored in dissociative systems that, in the absence of intervention, perpetuate the trauma of non-recognition by subjugation and self-objectification, or by omnipotent denial of others' subjectivity. All abusive systems are facilitated by bystanders, whose awareness of what is disavowed is always partial, resulting in a state of knowing and not-knowing. As dynamics shift, bystanders may behave like victims—passive, helpless, frightened and frozen, or like perpetrators—taking vicarious and voyeuristic pleasure in abuse or actively aiding and abetting the abusers.",

Its accurate definition is therefore a prerequisite for the development of valid methods of measuring it. Because dependence is more a feature of childhood than of adulthood, a dependent person may usefully be viewed as an adult behaving as though he were a child. Dependence is best understood therefore in terms of those developmental deficiencies from which it results. These are failure to separate successfully from the principal parent figure and from the family as a whole, failure to establish a secure personal identity, failure to acquire a general feeling of competence and a realistic assessment of self‐worth and failure to feel deserving of the status of adult and to feel on equal terms with other adults. Consequently, adult dependence is characterized by the need to stay close to others, the inclination to be primarily the recipient in interpersonal transactions and the tendency to relate to others from a position of inferiority and humility. The dependent person receives from others a borrowed identity, guidance and direction, compensation for those areas in which he is incompetent and, most important of all, acceptance, approval and affirmation of worth.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Concerns around the ability of the adolescent to request and consent to hormonal treatment include the following: that adolescents are subjected to peer pressure, particularly through social media, and might come to identify as trans when they are not; that material information cannot be provided and hence informed consent is impossible; that adolescents with gender dysphoria are usually affected by mental health concerns, and might lack capacity to consent because of other inherent vulnerabilities, or because they might not suffer genuinely from gender dysphoria; that adolescents may be too young to consent to treatment, and might be unable to appreciate how they might be affected later by potential unfavourable outcomes, such as infertility. Additional reasons why consent might be deemed invalid include: complexity of the decision, emotional involvement of the family, nature of the treatment, possibility of detransitioning, and difficulties in making accurate diagnosis in this case.",

      "abstract": "Sexual disgust has been conceptualized in terms of drive theory and preoedipal dynamics. Sexual disgust can also be conceptualized from a relational perspective that draws on oedipal psychodynamics as well as recent research on disgust as a form of embodied moral cognition. From a subjective viewpoint, sexual disgust is self-affirming, as it preserves the purity, sanctity, and desirability of the self in the face of polluting sexual contact. Yet from an other-centered viewpoint, sexual disgust precludes empathic recognition when it shames the object of sexual disgust and rationalizes its mistreatment. This dialectic of assertion (i.e., refusal to submit to something sexually disgusting) and recognition (i.e., affirmation as an object of sexual desire) plays out in adult romantic relationships when one partner’s sexual delight is the other partner’s sexual disgust.",

      "abstract": "Lemah dalam berkomunikasi dan gagal dalam mengungkapkan pendapat atau apa yang ada dalam pikiran seseorang akan membuat individu tersebut merasa tertekan dan menimbulkan masalah dalam berhubungan sosial dengan orang lain. Kemampuan berkomunikasi dan penyesuaian diri yang baik dan efektif terutama sangat diperlukan oleh para remaja. Hal ini sesuai dengan salah satu tugas perkembangan masa remaja yang tersulit yaitu berhubungan dengan penyesuaian sosial. Masa remaja dikenal sebagai usia bermasalah, remaja dituntut berperilaku sesuai aturan kelompok, dimana aturan tersebut seringkali berbeda dengan cara, kebiasaan dan norma yang diterapkan oleh keluarga. Remaja harus cermat dalam membedakan yang benar dan salah. Aturan kelompok kadangkala memaksa sehingga remaja perlu berperilaku asertif untuk melindungi diri dari pergaulan yang tidak baik. Lebih dari 200 remaja perempuan meninggal setiap hari disebabkan komplikasi pengguguran, perilaku seks pranikah itu cenderung dilakukan karena pengaruh teman sebaya. Dari berbagai dampak yang ada dapat dilihat bahwa kerugian terbesar dialami remaja perempuan. Remaja perempuan kurang dapat berpikir logis disaat mendapat bujukan atau rayuan dari pacarnya, remaja perempuan juga perlu bersikap tegas terhadap bujukan atau pengaruh laki-laki untuk melakukan hubungan seks sebelum menikah. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui perbedaan asertifitas remaja ditinjau dari jenis kelamin.\r\nPenelitian ini merupakan penelitian kuantitatif. Sampel penelitian adalah remaja yang berusia antara 14-15 tahun, sedang menempuh pendidikan di tingkat SMP kelas III berjumlah 120 orang yang di ambil dengan menggunakan teknik quota sampling. Sedangkan metode pengumpulan data yang digunakan adalah skala likert yaitu skala perilaku asertif. Pengambilan data dilakukan pada tanggal 22 - 25 Februari 2011. Adapun metode analisis yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Independent sample t-test dengan program SPSS 13.00 for windows.\r\nBerdasarkan hasil penelitian yang dilakukan, diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa ada perbedaan asertifitas remaja yang sangat signifikan ditinjau dari jenis kelamin, laki-laki (157.78) sedangkan perempuan (147.63). Hasil uji hipotesis menunjukkan t = 2.925; p = 0.004. Dengan demikian hipotesis di terima, hasil ini menunjukkan bahwa terdapat perbedaan yang sangat signifikan asertifitas remaja laki-laki dan remaja perempuan. Dimana remaja laki-laki lebih asertif daripada remaja perempuan. Sedangkan pada tiap aspeknya, berdasarkan uji t-test diperoleh bahwa pada aspek mengungkapkan perasaan positif (t = 2.296; p = 0.023) menunjukkan adanya perbedaan yang signifikan antara laki-laki dan perempuan dalam mengungkapkan perasaan positif. Perbedaan yang sangat signifikan antara laki-laki dan perempuan terdapat pada aspek afirmasi diri (t = 2.810; p = 0.006) dan aspek mengungkapkan perasaan negatif (t = 3.178; p = 0.002).",

      "title": "Religious delusions: Definition, diagnosis and clinical implications",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of the biopsychosocial model in psychiatry highlights the importance of investigating the clinical significance of religiosity in patients with psychotic disorders. Due to the spiritual and supernatural nature of religious beliefs, distinguishing them from religious delusions is a challenging endeavour. The self-referential nature of the beliefs, the presence of concomitant psychiatric symptomatology and the effect on functionality seem to play a key role in differential diagnosis. Religious psychotic symptoms are common in clinical practice. The study of these symptoms often becomes difficult due to varying definitions, the fluctuation they present over time and space and the strong influences of the social and cultural environment on them. There seems to be a positive correlation between religiosity and the occurrence of religious delusions in psychotic patients, but it is not clear that this indicates a causal relationship. The content of religious delusions seems to be significantly influenced by the immediate social environment rather than cultural background of the individual, as well as by the beliefs and attitudes of the patient's family environment. Religious delusions are characterized by increased conviction and pervasiveness, permeating to a greater extent the individual's whole experience. Their presence is associated with more severe symptoms, higher medication dosage, and poorer prognosis. The increased severity of psychosis with religious content symptomatology seems to be associated with genetic factors and greater genetic load. In addition, the increased duration of untreated psychosis is a determinant of prognosis. This may reflect a reduced alertness of the immediate environment of patients who develop psychotic symptoms with religious content for the first time. Other important prognostic factors are patients' lack of adherence to treatment, their greater resistance to psychiatric approach of the disorder and their exclusion from religious communities, as well as the special characteristics of religious delusions, which seem more corrosive to the patients' psyche than other delusions. Religion and spirituality are prominent in the lives of the majority of patients with psychosis, but they are often underestimated in clinical practice. Raising the awareness of mental health professionals on issues of a religious and spiritual nature can be beneficial in both preventing and treating psychotic disorders.",

      "title": "[A case of diaper fetishism].",
      "abstract": "Some people cannot obtain satisfaction from ordinary sexual relationships; instead they prefer alternative methods. They are referred to in psychiatric terminology as paraphiliacs. Fetishism is a type of paraphilia in which a person is sexually attracted to objects and some body parts. Most fetishists do not intend to cause harm to other people, but may have problems when others become involved in the problem. Underlying personality disorders extending through childhood are thought to be the source of the etiology. Perverted people do not wish to change their behavior pattern. They never seek treatment from a therapist. Psychological issues obviously play a crucial role in determining the choice of paraphilia and the underlying meaning of the sexual acts. Psychodynamic models (object relations theory, self psychology, drive theory) can shed light on the meaning of a perversion. In this case report, a 22- year-old man with diaper fetishism is presented. When family dynamics are considered, the mother has been described as psychologically distant from her son. The fetish object was recognized during childhood at around the age of four. During puberty, the fetish object became sexually attractive. Our patient exhibited his first perverted behavior when he was six years old. Later, he could control this behavior. At the age of twelve, the perverted behavior became sexually arousing. This paper emphasizes the diaper fetishism case through the patient's past psychiatric and medical history. Diaper fetishism is discussed in the light of forensic, cognitive and psychodynamic theories.",

      "title": "The Seduction Script: Psychological and Cultural Norms of Interpersonal Approaches As Markers for Sexual Aggression and Abuse",
      "abstract": "Hardly any subjects enjoy greater – public or private – interest than the art of flirtation and seduction. However, interpersonal approach behavior not only paves the way for sexual interaction and reproduction, but it simultaneously integrates non-sexual psychobiological and cultural standards regarding consensus and social norms. In the present paper, we use script theory as a concept that extends across psychological and cultural science to assess behavioral options during interpersonal approaches. Specifically, we argue that approaches follow scripted event sequences that entail ambivalence as an essential communicative element. On the one hand, ambivalence may facilitate interpersonal approaches by maintaining and provoking situational uncertainty, so that the outcome of an action – even after several approaches and dates – remains ambiguous. On the other hand, ambivalence may increase the risk for sexual aggression or abuse, depending on the individual's abilities, the circumstances, and the intentions of the interacting partners. Recognizing latent sequences of sexually aggressive behavior, in terms of their rigid structure and behavioral options, may thus enable individuals to use resources efficiently, avoid danger, and extricate themselves from assault situations. We conclude that interdisciplinary script knowledge about ambivalence as a core component of the seduction script may be helpful for counteracting subtly aggressive intentions and preventing sexual abuse. We discuss this with regard to the nature-nurture debate as well as phylogenetic and ontogenetic aspects of interpersonal approach behavior and its medial implementation.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as “all forms of physical and emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, development or dignity.” There are four main types of abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological abuse, and sexual abuse. Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

Most adults who assure kids that a bully has emotional problems are doing so because they hope it will comfort a target. Decades ago, researchers often described bullies as children who, inevitably, functioned very poorly. They disliked themselves. Other kids disliked them. Social status is related to two different characteristics: prosocial behaviors and the ability to successfully achieve social goals. It is not necessary to have both characteristics to achieve popularity. Some see the bullies' goal-achieving aggression as effective and even admirable, while others may view the very same behaviors as cruel and self-centered. There is no clear and absolute trajectory between childhood bullying and poor or positive life outcomes. Some bullies thrive in life; others do not.",

However, jealousy is usually a condition which has a profound effect on the sexual partner of the jealous person, and they may actually suffer more from the condition than the person him/herself. While accepting that medication and other individual approaches have their place in the management of jealousy, there seem to be several advantages in seeing the problem from the standpoint of the couple relationship. Firstly, couple therapy reduces the almost inevitable labelling of the jealous person as a psychiatric case. Secondly, one might argue a priori that any changes which take place as a result of two people changing their behaviour are likely to be more stable and long-lasting than if just one person changes. There is another consideration, namely that, since the relationship is bound to be affected by the jealousy, it will need attention regardless of the means used to treat the jealousy itself.",

The real test of a relationship arises when circumstances are not so congenial-when partners encounter dilemmas involving conflicted interaction, incompatible preferences, extrarelationship temptation, or experience of betrayal. In dilemmas of this sort, the well-being of each person is incompatible with the well-being of the relationship and something must give.

Minor illnesses and family difficulties were disregarded throughout. The results indicated that 2 concepts (intrafamily conflict and mental disease in some member of the family group) are important concomitants of neurosis. The following conclusions were suggested by the data. Mental illness in parents, separation of parents or lack of adjustment between them, rejection by parent figures, parental overrestriction, mental illness in siblings or disturbed relationships between them, and disruption of the subject's marriage are indicated considerably more frequently in those students suffering from psychoneurosis than in the university population at large. Death, prolonged physical illness or foreign birth of parents, extra relatives living in the home, sibling favoritism, lack of siblings, and factors relating to size of sibship or relative ages of siblings are found no more often in the neurotics than in the others. The margin of difference between the two sets of items is great enough to suggest that the same conclusions may be true for psychoneurotic people in general.",

      "abstract": "Difficult ethical issues arise for patients and professionals in medical genetics, and often relate to the patient's family or their social context. Tackling these issues requires sensitivity to nuances of communication and a commitment to clarity and consistency. It also benefits from an awareness of different approaches to ethical theory. Many of the ethical problems encountered in genetics relate to tensions between the wishes or interests of different people, sometimes even people who do not (yet) exist or exist as embryos, either in an established pregnancy or in vitro. Concern for the long-term welfare of a child or young person, or possible future children, or for other members of the family, may lead to tensions felt by the patient (client) in genetic counselling. Differences in perspective may also arise between the patient and professional when the latter recommends disclosure of information to relatives and the patient finds that too difficult, or when the professional considers the genetic testing of a child, sought by parents, to be inappropriate. The expectations of a patient's community may also lead to the differences in perspective between patient and counsellor. Recent developments of genetic technology permit genome-wide investigations. These have generated additional and more complex data that amplify and exacerbate some pre-existing ethical problems, including those presented by incidental (additional sought and secondary) findings and the recognition of variants currently of uncertain significance, so that reports of genomic investigations may often be provisional rather than definitive. Experience is being gained with these problems but substantial challenges are likely to persist in the long term.",

      "abstract": "Since the 1960s the increase in erotic entertainment has conveyed a clear message: the more sex the better.This has resulted in myths about sexual norms, which if believed may lead to behaviour result- ing in the acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases or in sexual dysfunction, or both.The psychosexual problems seen in departments of genitourinary medicine are either secondary to sexually acquired infection or primarily psychological. General reactionsWhen genital lesions are seen, felt, or suspected most patients lose interest in sexual intercourse, or at least restrain themselves for fear of infecting their partners.Those disinhibited by drugs or alcohol or of a psychopathic nature may, however, continue to have inter- course, and particular care must be taken to explain the dangers to others of such behaviour.Marital discord-The innocently infected partner ofa patient who has had intercourse outside a stable relationship may realise the implications of a sexually transmitted disease but may not want the diagnosis spelt out.The doctor therefore should not force the diagnosis on the patient but give him or her room to manoeuvre by saying, for instance, \"Is there anything more you would like to know?\".Often the answer is \"No.\"Anger, anxiety, guilt, and depression-Under the stress of having a sexually transmitted disease the extravert may become angry and the introvert anxious or depressed.Anger may be directed at the clinic staff as well as the person who transmitted the infection.Recognition of this anger may allow the doctor to intervene and discuss the facts and feelings surrounding a patient's illness.This may prevent later violence towards the patient's sexual partner.Unfortunately, in the case of the psychopath such intervention may not alter the patient's strong feelings or the outcome.The neurotic introvert is more likely to become anxious or depressed under stress, particularly when he or she has had intercourse outside a stable relationship.When severe these symptoms must be taken seriously.Clinical anxiety may be dealt with by letting the patient voice his feelings, and later by reassurance.In some patients the anxiety is so severe that a short course ofbenzodiazepines (such as diazepam 2 mg three times a day) may need to be given.Guilt and depression often go together, though most cases of depression seen in clinics are not severe; if necessary antidepressants such as mianserin 30-60 mg at night may be given; the dose should be built up slowly to prevent undue sleepiness in a working person.When the depression is deeper, psychiatric help should be enlisted, but the patient may refuse unless the psychiatrists are on the spot at the clinic.A clinically trivial condition such as recurring non-gonococcal urethritis, as well as the more serious problems of genital herpes, pelvic inflammatory disease, acute epididymitis, and hepatitis B, may all cause anger, anxiety, guilt, and depression.Allowing such patients to air their feelings is vital.",

But not only are there many usages of the concept of privacy; there are also the numerous related and contrasting terms: freedom, autonomy, publicity, secrecy, confidentiality, intimacy, and so forth.

      "abstract": "Humans acquire much of their knowledge from the testimony of other people. An understanding of the way that information can be conveyed via gesture and vocalization is present in infancy. Thus, infants seek information from well-informed interlocutors, supply information to the ignorant, and make sense of communicative acts that they observe from a third-party perspective. This basic understanding is refined in the course of development. As they age, children's reasoning about testimony increasingly reflects an ability not just to detect imperfect or inaccurate claims but also to assess what inferences may or may not be drawn about informants given their particular situation. Children also attend to the broader characteristics of particular informants-their group membership, personality characteristics, and agreement or disagreement with other potential informants. When presented with unexpected or counterintuitive testimony, children are prone to set aside their own prior convictions, but they may sometimes defer to informants for inherently social reasons.",

Though there is a lack of uniformity, a generally accepted definition of domestic violence is the physical, sexual or emotional abuse of an adult woman by a man with whom she has or has had an intimate relationship, regardless of whether the couple are living together. Although violence can be carried out by other family members or occur in same-sex relationships, it is argued that men use violence in order to maintain dominance and control over their female partners. Physical violence is just one of the many tactics that an abuser may use to exert control over his partner. Other behaviours include isolation, intimidation, threats of violence, threats to take the children away or hurt them and emotional or economic abuse. Whilst some studies have identified demographic patterns associated with domestic violence, it can affect any woman regardless of age, race, ethnicity, social class, employment status, religion, marital status or disability.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infidelity toward obtaining a new partner is commonly abetted by the tendency, especially during the peak reproductive years, to continually assess other potential companions’ mate value, suitability, and availability. The strategy of maintaining a relationship while seeking other partners can be adaptive for several reasons: (1) Whether in service of finding a new partner or not, infidelity offers the male more potential childbearing partners and provides the female a means to obtain genes from a partner with a superior phenotype, (2) extradyadic sex potentially creates a bond with a new partner and can add to one’s perceived security in a relationship while paradoxically easing leaving it, and (3) infidelity can act to mitigate the financial or emotional risks of leaving a partner who has become less desirable. Mate switching infidelity is abetted by many intrinsic factors such as males’ tendency to reflexively attend to those with salient sexual features and females’ propensity to remain vigilant for new partners who offer superior genes, status, and resources. This chapter details these and several other cultural and evolutionary forces that underlie the mate switching hypothesis of infidelity. It also presents case studies to illuminate the psychological and clinical implications of this practice.",

It should be enjoyed and should occur with a reasonable degree of frequency, and after a conflict is over the people involved should feel better than they did before. Some psychiatrists and social scientists have given conflict a bad reputation by linking it with psychopathology, social disorder, and war. Conflict can be dysfunctional, but it also can be productive. It has many positive functions, including preventing stagnation and stimulating interest and curiosity. It is the medium through which problems can be aired and solutions developed. It is the root of personal and social change. The practical and scientific issue is not how to eliminate or prevent conflict but rather how to have lively controversy rather than deadly quarrels. A conflict exists whenever incompatible activities occur. The incompatible actions may originate in one person, group, or nation (intrapersonal, intragroup, or intranational) or they may reflect incompatible actions of two or more persons, groups, or nations (interpersonal, intergroup, or international). An action that is incompatible with another action prevents, obstructs, interferes, injures, or in some way makes the latter less likely or effective. A potential conflict exists when the parties involved perceive themselves to have incompatible values, interests, goals, needs, or beliefs.",

It encompasses various terms such as alcohol abuse, dependence, addiction, and colloquially, alcoholism. Research has consistently highlighted the significant toll that alcoholism can take on the spouses of individuals struggling with alcohol addiction. Living with a spouse who struggles with alcoholism can be incredibly challenging and emotionally taxing. It can have significant impacts on one's mental and physical health, as well as on the dynamics of the relationship and family life. The typologies of wives of alcoholics categorize the various coping and behavioral patterns these individuals may adopt in response to their spouse's alcoholism, including enabling the behavior, adopting a victim mindset, compensating by being overly competent (the hero), displaying oppositional behavior (the rebel), or withdrawing emotionally and socially to protect themselves. The dynamics of alcoholism in a marriage can erode trust, communication, and intimacy, often leading to a breakdown of the relationship if left unaddressed. Seeking professional help, such as therapy or support groups, can be crucial for both spouses to navigate the challenges of alcoholism and work towards healing and recovery, either individually or as a couple.",

This raises questions of how to define and investigate conduct problems in females as well as how to identify differential childhood antecedents. A developmental psychopathology perspective is advanced as one useful approach to understanding adaptive and maladaptive social patterns in males and females that may lead to different developmental trajectories and influence the forms of psychopathology that develop. The utility of de-emphasizing serious physical aggression as one important criteria for conduct problems is questioned. Recommendations that particular forms of deviance in females be considered as markers of their antisocial patterns (e.g., somatic complaints, friendlessness, underachievement) are also called into question. Rather than adopt sex-specific criteria to assess conduct problems, it is necessary to expand and broaden the diagnostic categories to include serious externalizing problems regardless of whether they occur in males or females.",

Child Sexual abuse will result continuously terrible impacts, not only on its victims’ health problems but also on their psychological condition, such as permanent trauma, even after they have been grown up.

      "title": "Discrimination",
      "abstract": "Discrimination refers to an act, policy, practice, or social structure that creates, maintains, or reinforces an advantage for some groups and their members over other groups and their members. Discrimination, which can occur at the individual, institutional, and cultural levels, represents unfair treatment and can be distinguished from two other forms of bias: (i) prejudice, which is an attitude reflecting an overall evaluation of a group, and (ii) stereotypes, which are associations and attributions of specific characteristics to a group. Although prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination at the individual level are generally positively associated empirically, prejudice and stereotypes do not necessarily lead to discrimination, and discrimination can occur in the absence of conscious prejudice and stereotypes. Classic contributions on this topic characterized discrimination mainly in terms of negative actions by individuals—ranging from verbal comments to physical injury—directed to harm of another group and its members. However, in addition to blatant and direct forms of discrimination, discrimination may be displayed as unjustified positive treatment of members of one’s own group relative to members of another group, or it may represent actions toward members of another group that initially appear favorable but ultimately disadvantage the other group in the longer term (e.g., patronizing behavior, such as chivalry). Discrimination is often represented in terms of the behavior of individuals directed toward members, but these acts are not necessarily consciously motivated. Moreover, individual bias expressed by individuals is not necessary for discrimination to be experienced by members of some groups. Instead, discrimination may be enacted broadly through institutional structures and policies or embedded in cultural beliefs and representations that value various groups differently. Thus, individual-, institutional-, and cultural-level processes may operate in concert to provide some groups systematic advantages and/or to impose disadvantages on other groups. Often these influences are cloaked in justifications or ideologies that obscure the unfairness of the influences and thus allow the discriminatory nature of the treatment to go undetected and unaddressed. The remainder of this examination of discrimination considers (i) personality and individual differences related to behaving in a discriminatory way, (ii) social psychological influences that promote discrimination, (iii) subtle manifestations of discrimination, (iv) institutional and cultural forms of bias; (v) the impact of discrimination psychologically and physically, and (vi) ways of combating discrimination.",

      "abstract": "In male patients having severe problems in the nucleus of their narcissistic structure, disturbed sexuality is an attempt at compensating for mental void and not a mere manifestation of \"perversion\". The complexity of the sexual life of some patients is not primarily caused by the \"acting-out\" generated by their instinctive, pregenital fixations or polymorphous and/or perverse fixations, but by an attempt of compensation of the underlying mental void. Patients with mental void have a tendency to pass from the signal of anxiety to dread. This is an indication of their ego fragility, particularly the narcissistic fragility of the organizing identifications of their psychic apparatus. Very often, sexual experiences carried out in order to shape an exaggerated masculine identity, followed by polymorphous sexual behaviour of different kinds, are attempts at evolution, an evolution that has probably been somehow interrupted during their lives.",

      "abstract": "Sexual aversion is a widespread, poorly recognized syndrome occurring in both males and females. Once diagnosed, it is relatively resistant to conventional forms of therapy. Aversion is characterized by an unwillingness to get involved in sexual activity, with avoidance of any touching or communication that might lead to sexual involvement. This syndrome usually presents as a lack of libido, low sex drive, inhibited sexual desire or arousal dysfunction. Aversion may be seen along with other sexual dysfunctions, as a precipitating cause or as a consequence. However, aversion can also be the only dysfunction present. Once aversion is correctly diagnosed, identifying the type of aversion present is a prerequisite to appropriate therapy. Primary and secondary aversion are treated differently and have a different prognosis. This article describes the Sexual Aversion Syndrome, and distinguishes between primary and secondary aversion for the purpose of treatment and prognosis.",

People with high self-esteem perceive themselves favorably. They generally like themselves and believe they are competent and capable of handling life’s challenges. Conversely, those with low self-esteem regard themselves as incapable, unlikable, or even unworthy. Low self-esteem is related to depression and a number of psychosomatic ailments such as loss of appetite, insomnia, nervousness, and headaches. On the whole, people with low self-esteem do not feel valued by themselves or by others and doubt their ability to add value. Self-acceptance and self-esteem are thus critical for mattering. Self-esteem has important implications for a host of life domains. Those high in self-esteem experience more positive emotions and are significantly happier than those with low self-esteem. In fact, high self-esteem is considered one of the most dominant predictors of happiness.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Racial violence arises when infantile anxiety and hatred of ‘difference’ or ‘otherness’ become too unmanageable within the self and are displaced into the racial arena via splitting and projective mechanisms. The body of the ‘other’, particularly skin colour differences, becomes a salient target for locating and attacking these feared and unwanted aspects of the self. Those on the receiving end can experience a profound attack on their identity, with feelings of rejection that can result in a severe narcissistic blow, puncturing and even shattering the individual's psychic skin and existing defensive organization. This failure of containment can send tremors throughout the psyche to some of the most vulnerable areas in individuals functioning, giving fresh life to both oedipal and pre‐oedipal anxieties to do with separation and loss. Where these early anxieties are felt to be unbearable, the individual resorts to encapsulating them in a portion of their mind, effectively sealing them off from conscious awareness or access, but they are unconsciously re‐enacted. A case study aims to describe some of these phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Throughout history, societies have circumscribed certain forms of intimacy in the family setting. Transgression has been punished by force of ecclesiastical rules and government statutes. However, no single definition of incest is widely accepted, as the degree of kinship in which marriage is allowed and the age of consent vary. Fueled in part by the current emphasis on child abuse prevention, the reporting of incest is increasing. The perpetrator in the majority of reported cases is a male adult, and most often the victim is a young girl. Other dyads do occur and are probably under-estimated in frequency. Disturbed family relationships generate a shift in individual responsibilities and expectations that can lead to incest. A lack of spousal sexual activity is a common preceding factor. The sequelae of this breach of family integrity are significant. Frequently, the family itself is destroyed; the destruction often begins before incest occurs. The victim faces a future characterized by emotional turmoil, diminished self-esteem, impaired interpersonal relationships, and impulsive acting-out behavior. Family and individual therapy, participation in support groups, and referral for chemical dependency treatment are essential if future problems in the lives of everyone involved are to be avoided.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to define sexual disturbance today because concepts about emotional disturbance in general and sexual disorder in particular have recently undergone signifi cant changes. Sexual disorders may be seen in terms of (a) specific aberrant acts or (b) the psychological and philo sophic causes that underlie such acts. It would appear to be more meaningful to define them largely in relation to the self- defeating ways in which and reasons for which an individual behaves sexually rather than in terms of the concrete behav iors he performs. When so viewed, the basic causes of sexual disorders seem to be quite the same as those of most general emotional difficulties. Societal reaction to disturbed indi viduals with sexual problems has improved in recent years but is still much too condemnatory and punitive. At the same time, some social thinkers, in a misguided effort to pre vent the persecution of sexually troubled and deviant indi viduals unrealistically refuse to face the facts of their intrinsic neurosis or psychosis and trace all their upsets to social persecution. Sexually disturbed persons are not easy to treat successfully for a variety of reasons, especially by conven tional psychoanalytic methods. But if a hard-headed thera pist actively-directively intervenes in their lives and induces them to challenge and work against their irrational value systems, he may achieve effective results in a relatively brief period of time.",

On learning of their infertility patients usually go through an initial emotional crisis. The male response thereafter varies depending on the aetiology of the infertility. Male factor infertility threatens the traditional male/father role and results in a feeling of personal and sexual inadequacy. This may resolve itself in extramarital affairs or by the sufferer throwing himself into his work. Unfortunately treatment for infertility often has transient negative effects on male sexuality, and is frequently believed by the recipient to be more successful than in fact it is.",

Il mancato spostamento sembra caratterizzare anche altri aspetti patologici, quali il gioco d'azzardo, le dipendenze o la criminalità. L'ipotesi dello spostamento è in realtà legata all'errore fondamentale di attribuzione, che privilegia gli aspetti disposizionali rispetto a quelli situazionali. Vengono esaminati bias collegati a questo errore di attribuzione, come la mancata stabilità e coerenza nel tempo e nelle diverse situazioni degli aspetti disposizionali, la mancata coerenza tra atteggiamenti e comportamenti, e gli errori che gli approcci disposizionali inducono nella previsione di compor-tamenti con il variare delle situazioni. Questi bias mettono in discussione il concetto tradizionale di personalità e il suo ruolo nella genesi dei sintomi o nella predizione dei comportamenti, e anche i modelli psicologici tradizionali che prevedono che i comportamenti siano sempre conseguenza degli atteggiamenti della persona. Il ruolo degli aspetti situazionali, specialmente dei cosiddetti \"fattori canale\", appare importante nella modifica di comportamenti in ambito preventivo e tera-peutico.",

      "abstract": "Depersonalization occurs in many psychiatric states but its origins are unknown. It is suggested that feelings of unreality may be unusually common in adolescents. Certain speculations are offered concerning the genesis of a sense of unreality. The neurophysiological mechanisms governing the perception of 'familiar' or 'strange' are seen to be the key to this experience. They involve the matching of events in the outer world against inner organizations of previous experience. These mechanisms are likely to be disturbed through epilepsy or other disorders of the temporal lobe, in which abnormal perceptions of strangeness and familiarity are frequently found. It is suggested that the matching process extends to include social situations, and that where an individual's identity is undeveloped or fragmented a sense of strangeness may result. The concept of identity is briefly discussed in order to distinguish it from 'self' and 'ego', and to intimate its possible fragmentation in adolescence. Finally, some reference is made to management and, in particular, to the use of the peer group.",

These struggles translate into lower marital satisfaction perceived by both intimate partners. However, this connection is bidirectional, since conflicts with a romantic partner are the most common precipitating factors of decompensation in BPD patients.This narrative review was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases with keywords \"borderline personality disorder\", \"partnership\", marital problems\", and \"marital conflicts\". Articles, books, and book chapters published within January 1980 - December 2020 were extracted and analysed. Additional sources were found while reviewing references of relevant articles. The total of 131 papers met the inclusion criteria.Patients with BPD struggle with reaching marital satisfaction. They often find themselves in disharmonic and unfulfilling relationships. The association between the relationship issues and BPD may partly come from misunderstanding one or both partners' behaviour. Individuals with BPD tend to misinterpret their partner's behaviour, struggle with communication, and sometimes be verbally and physically aggressive. They often do not recognize that their intrapersonal processes influence their interpersonal struggles. Understanding the role of the maladaptive personality traits in the relationship and their management could be beneficial for both partners.Individuals with BPD often report dysfunctional romantic relationships characterized by insecure attachment, maladaptive communication, and lower relationship satisfaction. Future studies should focus on finding effective strategies of couples´ therapy working with this population.",

      "abstract": "Surrogate mothers, illegitimately pregnant teenagers, married women seeking abortions, women convicted of manslaughter, and sister survivors of early childhood sibling loss may share a common conflict. These women may be in a state of incomplete mourning, unconsciously wishing to master a trauma by turning a passive experience into a life event they can control. Pregnancy can function as that life event. Replacement daughters and/or sister survivors can present as our patients with a search for or an avoidance of pregnancy as a crucial though unconscious issue. Literature written about this sequelae of early sibling death is reviewed according to psychosexual and object relationship stages. Common and uncommon consequences are discussed. Vignettes from the course of psychoanalytic therapy with women whose brothers had been accidently killed; whose sibling had died of metabolic disease; and those whose siblings had been relinquished to foster care are used to illustrate the immediate and long-term reactions. The range of these include varieties of separation anxiety as well as learning inhibitions in latency; exaggerated pseudo heterosexuality and other risk taking at puberty; problems in self-esteem regulation relative to either the idealized memory of the missing sibling or the omnipotence connected with survivor guilt. This paper focuses on the choice of a sexual partner and pregnancy issues as symptoms of reworking established conflicts around self-valuation and abandonment by sibling and grieving parents. As the family relationships around the lost sibling become less distorted in her analysis via transference resolution, so do the feelings about contemporary relationships. Becoming pregnant is then not an event burdened by die past.",

      "title": "The specific form of violence for constituting each relational model",
      "abstract": "People violently constitute relationships though circumcision and excision, brutal initiations, killing rivals to the throne, proving loyalty to a superior by killing someone who threatens him, and human sacrifice. People enhance their own relationships with their deities by extreme asceticism, flagellation, or amputating a digit as an offering; others facilitate a vision of their personal companion spirit by hanging themselves by hooks through their chest muscles. The conduct or performance of many relationships consists of organized, socially instituted violence such as boxing and mixed martial arts, ice-hockey checking and football tackling, or combat among warriors who fight for glory. Redressive and terminative violence in response to transgressions of social relationships includes all sorts of corporal and capital punishment: burning witches, killing adulterers, eye-for-an-eye vengeance and feuding, killing men who insult one’s honor, and honor suicide by those who have failed to do their duty. Redressive violence is ubiquitous, ranging from dueling to resolve a dishonor, judicial combat to determine guilt, lynching those perceived as disrespectful, beating wives perceived as having failed to be sufficiently dutiful, attacking husbands who are disrespectful jerks, terrorist bombing, and targeted killing by drones. Sometimes violence is intended to enforce a relationship by forestalling transgression – for example, by terrorizing subjects or slaves into submission. Torturing heretics and enemies falls somewhere in between redress and enforcement, as do violent self-defense and killing intruders. In honor cultures, killing a dishonored sister, daughter, or cousin terminates an intolerable relationship, cleansing the stain and thereby restoring the family honor. Innumerable cultures conduct, or used to conduct, trial by ordeal – for example, adjudicating witchcraft guilt by submerging the accused to see if she drowns, making her hold a hot iron to see if it burns her, or giving her poison to see if she dies. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was morally motivated violence on a mass scale, motivated by MP proportionality cost and benefit computations aimed to reduce American casualties in the most efficient way. The most massive moral violence practices in history were twentieth-century ethnic cleansings, acts of “purifying the race” or the nation, where the removal or killing of persons construed to “pollute” the shared essence of a “people” was motivated by the feeling that “mixture” or “mongrelization” is evil, unnatural, disgusting, dishonorable, and dangerous.",

Child sex offenders evoke extraordinarily strong feelings in most individuals and communities, and those who assess and attempt to manage their current and future dangerousness do so in a climate that is unforgiving and hyperbolic. The stakes in respect of sexual offenders seem higher, since a badly constructed or inadequate assessment will fail to identify the sources of the individual's problems and, thereby, deny them the opportunity to address them. The assessor needs to balance optimism about the capacity of even the most reprehensible individuals to change with a scepticism that allows for the possibility that the real and covert goal of the individual may be to avoid changing at all. Actuarial risk assessment for sexual offenders rests upon a number of researched features that are associated with reconviction.",

The aetiology of marital relationships is very complex, and the factors involved operate at different levels. Social, cultural and economic influences all play an important part. In recent years there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of disturbances in human relationships as an essential factor in many of the obscure ills of individuals and of society. Increasing attention is being paid not only by doctors but by sociologists and social workers to the problems of intimate human relationships. Professional experience in the direct study of marriage and its problems has up to now been largely confined to that class of manifestly unhappy or 'unsatisfactory' marriage which either turns to, or is willing to be directed to, professional sources for help.",

      "title": "Optimism and Its Associations with Health Behavior and Responses to Health Communication",
      "abstract": "When individuals are asked whether they will someday own their own home, enjoy a productive career, or develop a myriad of diseases, many are optimistic. Generally, they think they will experience more good than bad outcomes in life and they view themselves as more likely than similar others to experience the good things and less likely than others to experience the bad things. In the area of health behavior and communication, there are three primary types of optimism that have been defined and operationalized: (1) Dispositional optimism is the generalized positive expectancy that one will experience good outcomes. (2) Comparative optimism refers to the belief that one is either more likely than others to experience positive events or less likely than others to experience negative events. (3) Unrealistic optimism refers to an underestimation of one’s actual risk of experiencing some negative event. Although the three types of optimism may be correlated, their associations may be modest. Also, unlike dispositional optimism, which is an individual difference, comparative and unrealistic optimism are often risk perceptions about specific events and therefore can be defined as accurate or inaccurate. For this reason, the latter two types of optimism have sometimes been labeled the <italic>optimistic bias</italic>. Research on all three varieties of optimism affords opportunities to understand how optimism influences information processing in a health message or one’s behavioral intentions following the message.",

These relationships vary in expectations for and level of commitment, intimacy, exclusivity, and sexual activity. Dating relationships have often been equated with “premarital” relationships or are considered part of “courtship,” though it is recognized that most “premarital” relationships do not result in marriage, nor are they intended to. Dating as a relational form emerged in the US and has received limited research attention in nonwestern countries.",

It is generally a long-term pattern of behaviour although specific short-term interactions can be labelled abusive. Recently the following categories have been included in definitions of abusive behaviour: social, economic, intellectual and spiritual. With child abuse neglect is also an important component. Abuse cuts across all social categories and classes. It occurs in well-educated high-income areas and in low-income working-class areas; it happens in all races and religions. It can occur in families, extended families, in neighbour hoods, schools, churches, and community groups. Both men and women can be abusive and it can occur in virtually all age groups. The old can abuse the young and the young the old. While standards are different in various cultures, it occurs in virtually…",

      "abstract": "The sexual abuse and exploitation of children is a serious problem. Adult sexual predators often use strategies known as grooming to entice their victims. These include targeting particularly vulnerable youth, gift giving, and systematically engaging in desensitizing sexual behaviors. Less commonly discussed is the notion of institutional grooming, the practice of strategically placing themselves in positions of public trust where they have access to children yet appear beyond reproach. Once situated, they can abuse children for decades without deterrence in spite of the fact that individuals around them may be aware–or partially aware–of their behavior. This article examines three cases, one involving a priest, another a football coach, and the third a pediatrician and considers the institutional practices and cultures that permit (or potentially permit) abuse and exploitation to flourish. Among other things it finds: confidentiality mandates and other codes of silence and secrecy impede information sharing; departmental or programmatic silos exist each with their own independent and competing agendas; confused reporting lines within the institution often end in the hands of powerful individuals who have an interest in non-disclosure; barriers exist to investing within the institution and reporting outside the institution often including mistrust and disempowerment of law enforcement and child protective services; extreme power differences exist between and among victims, predators, reporters, and other institutional players; and finally, intense loyalties personal, professional, and institutional are present. These factors produce institutional cultures that protect pedophiles and conspire against their vulnerable, individual, child victims.",

      "abstract": "Team projects call for a blend of task and social skills. Successful completion of a group's task or goal often depends on resolving conflicts between desired task outcomes and volatile interpersonal relationships within groups or teams. Since each member forms unique social relationships with every other member of a group, these relationships may carry over to subsequent groups, as the old group completes its project and disbands. Thus, a trusting relationship between team members becomes the foundation of future cooperative efforts. Some people are so socially maladjusted they can't seem to get along with anyone. Estimates are that as many as 20% of the population have emotional distress that seriously affects their social interactions. Fortunately, most people range from well adjusted to only mildly maladjusted Stable, well-adjusted people fit well into groups, and they typically display various shades of the following four positive traits-agreeableness, assertiveness, consciousness, and openness. However, even mild personality problems can be discouraging and unsettling to others. Distressed people rarely fit well into groups, and they typically display various shades of the following four extreme, or negative traits-passivity, demanding behaviours, rigidity, and distractibility. This study examines the roles played by these stable and extreme traits in building not only trust, but the likelihood an individual would be willing to work with another individual again on a new project.",

      "title": "SOME APPLICATIONS OF DELINQUENCY THEORY TO CHILDHOOD ACCIDENTS",
      "abstract": "The past two decades have witnessed an increasing recognition on the part of the physician and the behavioral scientist that the state of a person's health—indeed, even his likelihood of surviving infancy or of being institutionalized for mental illness-is closely related to his social status and to the social, political, economic, and cultural characteristics of his community, his state, and his nation. With the growth of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, such \"purely biological\" phenomena as infant mortality, mental illness, malnutrition, and venereal disease have come to concern the sociologist and the anthropologist as strongly as they have the physician and the epidemiologist. Accidental injury and death, however, have to a large extent remained outside the sphere of interdisciplinary scrutiny. One reason for this neglect stems from the fact that data on accidental injury are so much less reliable than other health data as to be virtually unusable. Perhaps another reason is that the concept of an accident as an \"act of God\" persists in the minds of otherwise sophisticated persons—and \"acts of God\" seem somehow unrelated to the social and cultural environment in which they occur. Regardless of the reasons, however, the fact remains that, although a good deal is known about the socioeconomic and cultural conditions that influence the infant mortality rate, mental illness, and cardiovascular accidents, very little is known about the relationship between social conditions and the incidence of accidental injury and death. The following paper does nothing to advance our knowledge of this relationship. But it points out the gaps in our present knowledge, warns against pitfalls that are more familiar to behavioral than to medical scientists, and pleads for the application of sound sociological theory to a problem which is as much social as it is medical.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a mental and / or physical state of addiction to certain psychoactive substances, behaviors or situations. They can be different, and each has its own significance, degree of intensity, psychological, social and economic dimensions. Alcohol is considered to be the most commonly abused substance in Europe, including Croatia. No celebration from the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans until today has passed without the consumption of alcohol. Also, alcohol is considered to be the first psychoactive substance that people encounter, specifically young people aged 14 years. Alcoholism is an addiction to alcohol, while an alcoholic according to the definition of the World Health Organization is a person who has become addicted to alcohol through long-term drinking, mentally, physically or in both ways and has developed mental or physical impairments and social difficulties accessible to traditional medical and social diagnostic procedures. The clinical picture of alcoholism is first manifested in the very appearance of the alcoholic, and then in his change of personality, which in turn leads to the deterioration of their own health, relationships in the family and in society, job loss. All of the above components can contribute to the worsening of the condition. The diagnosis of alcoholism is made on the basis of anamnestic data of disease symptoms, medical examination, heteroanamnestic data, which are most often given by family members, laboratory tests and various questionnaires. Alcoholism treatment consists of treatment that includes strict abstinence and lifestyle changes, then outpatient treatment and inclusion in self-help and mutual aid groups such as Alcoholics Clubs and Alcoholics Anonymous. This paper will consist of two parts. In the first part I will define the concept of alcoholism, explain the epidemiology and etiology of alcoholism, then the effects of alcohol on the body, the clinical picture of alcoholism, diagnosis, treatment, consequences of alcoholism and the role of the nurse in people addicted to alcohol. The second part consists of a survey questionnaire conducted online using the Google Docs application. The main goal of the research was to determine whether alcoholism is still the leading harmful habit in the 21st century.",

An earlier view linking sex exclusively with reproductive function has given way to a holistic view of sex as vital to self-concept, the maintenance of healthy interpersonal relationships, and a sense of integrity. Older adults often have difficulty communicating sexual problems, concerns, and questions because of their conflicting attitudes and perceptions. Sexual problems often are presented covertly, expressed in vague terms, or masked by embarrassment. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of covert sexual dysfunctions, clear about their own attitudes and expectations to avoid stereotyping the elderly, and knowledgeable about pharmacological, organic, and psychosocial bases of sexual problems in older patients.",

These difficulties are underexplored in personality disorder (PD) despite their prevalence. Furthermore, little evidence exists regarding how these factors relate to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and attachment.Fifty-three participants with a diagnosis of PD completed measures including childhood abuse/neglect, invalidation, early warmth, self-compassion, shame, self-criticism, FSC, and anxious/avoidant attachment.Self-compassion was predicted uniquely by low early warmth; self-inadequacy by invalidation and abuse; and FSC by multiple ACEs. FSC and self-compassion were significantly correlated with self-criticism and shame, but not with one another.Low self-compassion and high FSC appear to be distinct problems, substantiating physiological models proposing distinct threat and soothing systems. Results are consistent with theories positing that low self-compassion has distinct origins to shame, self-criticism, and FSC.",

      "title": "Beyond Risk Theory: Suicidal Behavior in its Social and Epidemiological Context",
      "abstract": "Summary: The effect of exposure to risk factors for suicidal behavior varies from place to place and from period to period. This may be due to contextual influences, which arise if individuals' suicide risk depends not only on their personal exposure to risk or protective factors, but also on how these are distributed in their social, cultural, economic, or even physical environments. There has been relatively little explicit attention in suicide research for such contextual influences even though they are an important component of the cross-level bias, which can arise when aggregate level associations are assumed to also apply in individuals and vice versa. Contextual effects are conceptually related to the issues of social selection vs. causation, population density, and network effects. Because of a lack of prospective multilevel research, it is unclear exactly which mechanisms underlie the phenomenon that the distribution of risk factors in an individual's context may affect their suicide risk above and beyond their personal exposure. A number of mechanisms, like deviancy amplification, formalization of restraints, and buffering effects of social support are proposed. Contextual effects may result in a concentration of suicide risk in persons when the risk factors they are exposed to become rare—whether spontaneously or through focused prevention. This has important but mostly overlooked implications for population-based prevention strategies.",

It has been reported that irregularities of brain specific chemical agents known as neurotransmitters causes to developing depression. Sudden drop of high levels estrogen and progesterone observed during the period of pregnancy is considered to be an important factor in the etiology of PPD. There should be a possible link among the psychiatric symptoms and the changes in cortisol and thyroxin level in the postnatal period. Pregnancy is the first step of individuals for being parents. However, being a pregnant or a parent does not always appear as planned, conscious, and discretional decision. Even if she does not feel happy, for others she may decide to conceive. Social environment factors that shape the experience of pregnancy are listed as familial, cultural, religious, social, economical, political and intellectual conditions. Although there has been endocrine and biochemical changes in all women who give birth, but some of them develop psychiatric disorders. Fort his reason, social stress factors, interpersonal relationships, factors such as social support systems are suggested a need to be taken into consideration. It is difficult for women who are not emotionally supported, to constitute a healthy communication with their babies. At this point, family physicians have to work better.

Conflict behavior in both typical and dementia populations is frequently identified as explicit physical and verbal acts such as assault, yelling or insulting, and research often situates conflict and collaboration as opposing dimensions. The premise of this article is to examine the unfolding of moments in which individuals diagnosed with FTD and their carers demonstrate opposing orientations towards an activity in real time interaction: A home nurse needing to fulfill an institutional agenda — taking sitting blood pressure — seeks the cooperation from an individual who, in attempting to lie down, interferes with this agenda. These moments constitute sources of interactional conflict that carers attempt to resolve. However, often conflict behavior and cooperative behavior are not neatly teased apart; for instance, individuals often display conflicting orientations towards an overarching or guiding activity while cooperating in more immediate and discrete interactional tasks. These verbal/nonverbal conflicts are not large acts of aggression; rather, they may be viewed as arising within the mundane moments of life that individuals face in everyday contexts and frequently.",

Most early marriages are still middle school / high school students who do not have good emotional stability and tend to do everything they want without thinking about the impact that will occur. Many of the early marriages have children, where in educating children they unconsciously apply permissive education patterns. The personal circumstances and attitudes of each child are different, making the task of educating hard to implement, and inﬂuencing the emotional state of parents. The results showed that the emotional stability of early marriages in educating children is not good, this is because early marriages are still easily inﬂuenced by negative emotions that can be seen from the emotional response shown. Excessive emotional response is not in accordance with the notion of emotional stability, namely a permanent emotional state, not easily changed, and the response shown is not excessive. In relieving negative emotions and resolving problems that occur, early marriages more often submit to the situation assuming that emotions will be lost if left unchecked, without any effort to fnd a way out or a method of solving the problem accordingly. Although early marriages do not have good emotional stability, some early marriages have been able to maintain their emotional stability by calming themselves down and solving problems that are sources of emotion.",

      "abstract": "The article highlights the foreign aspects of psychological interpretation for the phenomenon «codependency», the most controversial yet the least studied in terms of its scientific analysis.The research defines conceptual foundation for further theoretical verification in the direction of foreign psychological studies.We consider the psychological characteristics of a co-dependent personality and the principal mechanisms of formation of similar relationships.The review of classic and contemporary research is undertaken and the approaches to definition of the given phenomenon are analyzed.The codependency is regarded as a psychological state characterized by a strong disquietude and extreme emotional, social, and sometimes physical dependence on a person or an object.As a result, such dependence on another person becomes a pathological state that affects all the relations of a codependent person.Scientists have proved that codependency is connected not just to alcoholism or chemical dependence in families but to various types of chronic family stressors.In addition to parental chemical dependency, other family stressors may include ineffective parenting styles, parental abuse, as well as parental mental and physical health.This phenomenon is also present in dysfunctional families.People from such families do not understand a role clarity, cannot express emotions, their parents often have mental health problems and that promoted the development of codependency.Researchers also point to cross-cultural limitations of this concept.There are cultures which emphasize individualism of personality, while others approve of the behavior of codependent women in the family.The analyzed works of the codependency phenomenon confirm the necessity of further research.The psychologists should be more inclined to explore larger sample sizes, varying minority groups, and more representative population with greater depth.",

      "abstract": "level can forsee the deviancy disappearing at other ages or in other contexts. Hyperactivity, for example, can be seen as both normal and abnormal depending on whether the child is a pre-schooler or an adolescent. The mother who can appreciate the discontinuous nature of her child's behavior is better equipped to make qualitative changes in her treatment of the child as the child's activities and requirements change with development. The mother who is restricted to more primitive levels of viewing her offspring enmeshes the child at later stages in obsolete social and affective relationships formed during infancy. From the low levels of social cognition found in large segments of our society (Chandler, 1973; Looft, 1972) one might expect a much higher proportion of severe caretaking casualties than appears to be the case. Possibly, the same kinds of self-righting tendencies that Wad dington (1966) postulated for biological development are operative at the psychological level. One of these self-righting tendencies might exist in the transactions between parent and child. The mother has little difficulty viewing the infant from a sensorimotor level of cognition while the infant is in the sensorimotor period. However, as the child progresses through his own development, his caretakers are forced to view him from different perspectives, potentially causing a restructuring of their view of the child. At each new level the child makes interactional demands at higher levels of complexity, frequently surprising parents by this emerging precocity. This content downloaded from 157.55.39.235 on Fri, 07 Oct 2016 06:09:55 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Early Influences on Development A second major self-righting tendency might be found at the societal level. To the extent that the scientific and educational es tablishment are limited to a concrete view that perceives developmen tal deviancy as foreordained by poor genes or perinatal complications, there is little in the way of therapy to offer mothers with problems. To the extent that society as a whole can move from a main-effect to a transactional model of development a new context is provided for educating mothers toward understanding the intricate interplay between organismic and environmental factors in the determination of developmental outcomes. To summarize, disorders in development have been retrospectively attributed to a variety of early constitutional or environmental factors. When these predisposing factors have been studied prospectively little support is given to their causal role or their predictive value for later deviancy. Evidence for qualitative continuities and stabilities in development appear to be artifacts of an incomplete analysis of the child in its environment. When the two are examined in combination, complex reciprocal transactions are found which reduce or amplify ear ly problems in behavior. Developmental outcomes must be interpreted as the products of a child's characteristics, his material environment and the cognitive levels and values of his social milieu. Where the social environment fosters rigidity, stereotyping, and concreteness in thought and behavior, early deviancies can become resistant to the normal restruc turing implicit in development. Where flexibility, openness, and adap tability are fundamental characteristics of the environment, early problems are dissipated as the child advances in his construction and organization of both his cognitive and social world.",

      "abstract": "People with disabilities (PWDs), one of the important minority groups, are exposed to certain attitudes and prejudices causing some problems in social life. Therefore, it is important to examine the causes and consequences of prejudices and attitudes toward PWDs. Our attitudes determine how we evaluate events or people. Our ideas and behaviors about a group or person are also affected by our explicit and implicit attitudes. People have different attitudes and behaviors, either negative or positive. PWDs are considered dependent, needy, incompetent, trustworthy or innocent. They can be perceived in different ways and exposed to both positive/negative attitudes and labeling. Prejudices toward PWDs are generally not shown explicitly due to social approval, but they exist implicitly and still affect the lives of the disabled through negative behaviors they cause. Implicit biases toward PWDs, caused by existential or evolutionary factors, are often not consciously noticed. Implicit biases that are not noticed cannot be intervened and intervention strategies cannot be developed. Hereby, this review aims to examine the attitudes and prejudices toward PWDs within the scope of explicit and implicit processes and to discuss the differences between explicit and implicit prejudices as well as the social-psychological effects of implicit prejudices and different ways to measure them.",

      "abstract": "Preterm birth with a high prevalence is responsible for long-term morbidities. It was reported that preterm birth can adversely affect romantic relationships in adulthood. In the present study, we aimed to assess the most important factors involved in the challenges related to romantic relationships among young adults born preterm. A short commutation study was carried out to review evidence finding important contributors. The results have shown that several reasons are involved in the challenges related to romantic performances among young adults born preterm. As all body organs form, grow, or develop during the second and third trimesters of gestation, preterm birth may cause a mild to severe range of postnatal structural and functional immaturities. Moreover, individuals born preterm are prone to main risks related to brain hypoxic-ischemic injuries. Impaired cognitive domain, psychiatric disease, emotional and behavioral problems may also affect learning abilities, educational and job opportunities. All these involving factors may influence peer relationships, social interactions, sexual intercourse, romantic partnership or becoming parents. In the present study, we reviewed evidence to show the negative influence of preterm birth on the establishment of a romantic relationship in adulthood. This challenge may correlate to physical, emotional, and mental health statuses as well as educational and socioeconomic characteristics of adults born preterm. Devoting all efforts to prevent preterm birth, long-term follow-up, and providing additional supports should be considered for such a high-risk group.",

      "title": "Dating Violence",
      "abstract": "Dating violence is characterized by any form of violence or threat from one partner to the other within a romantic relationship. This type of violence can be identified in any dating relationship regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Females are more often the targets of dating violence than males, especially in regard to severe physical and sexual violence. Dating violence includes physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. Young females may be more vulnerable to sexual violence for a number of reasons. They may avoid talking to family members in the belief that their family will not listen to their issues, or may prefer to talk to their peers, who often show sympathy but have little life experience. The situation of victims from minority cultural groups may be even worse because violence in a dating relationship may be combined with racism, sexism, and discrimination. Family members, friends, teachers, school counselors, police officers, and religious leaders can play a key role in preventing this type of violence before it occurs or in helping survivors of dating violence. Feminist scholars have played a significant role in making the academic community and the public aware of violence in romantic relationships as a result of the hierarchical form of male power and control over the lives of women. In the United States, many policy programs and projects have been successfully developed and implemented in order to prevent dating violence and support its survivors.",

People with personality disorders have substantial problems with starting and continuing a relationship with a partner. They have an unintentional ability to create and maintain problematic relationships. The association between the dysfunctional marriage and personality problems of the partners may have the basis in the insufficient understanding of the behavior of one or both partners. People with personality disorder experience numerous misunderstandings, misinterpretations, communicate poorly, and they are more alert to verbal and physical aggression in the interpersonal relations. They do not recognize that the basis of experienced struggles has a source in their intrapersonal processes and their relationship with the world. Persons with certain personality disorders tend to seek and create a pathologically stable partnership. To understand the dynamics of such relationships, examining personality traits first should be essential. Understanding the maladaptive personality patterns in the context of the relationship should be beneficial for both partners.",

      "abstract": "Publisher Summary Narcissistic personality disorder is a newly recognized diagnostic entity in clinical psychiatry. The cardinal feature of narcissistic personality disorder is heightened narcissism. Individuals with this disorder display grandiosity, intense ambition, and an insatiable craving for admiration. Their consuming self-interest renders them incapable of appreciating and understanding the independent motivations and needs of others. Consequently, they come across as cold, unempathic, exploitative, and having little concern for those around them. The clinical features of narcissistic personality disorder involve six areas of psychosocial functioning: self-concept, interpersonal relations, social adaptation, ethics, standards, and ideals, love and sexuality, and cognitive style. In each of these areas there are “overt” and “covert” manifestations. These designations do not necessarily imply their conscious or unconscious existence although such topographical distribution might also exist. In general, however, the overt and covert designations denote seemingly contradictory phenomenological aspects that are more or less easily discernible. Moreover, these contradictions are not restricted to the individual's self-concept but permeate his or her interpersonal relations, social adaptation, love life, morality, and cognitive style.",

Jealousy characteristically involves hostility if not hatred towards the person who is taking away the love one feels is due to one, and engenders bitterness, hostility, or hatred towards the person one loved. Like many emotions, envy and jealousy provide motives for action. For in both cases there are characteristic patterns of backward- and forward-looking reasons for action. There are numerous biblical tales to illustrate the evils of envy, and others that demonstrate the vice of jealousy. For the most part, qin'ah is condemned as a serious and self-destructive vice.",

Many abused children are physically handicapped, mentally retarded, or emotionally disturbed either before the abuse or as a result of it. Child abuse is often considered synonymous with child battering or the battered child syndrome. Although it may not seem important to differentiate between the two, they do differ and we should treat them accordingly. The battered child syndrome represents an extreme form of child abuse. Characteristics of perpetrators of this subgroup differ from the larger group. The prevention, treatment, and general prognosis of the victim and the perpetrator also vary greatly from those of simple child abuse. The battered child syndrome is a cross-cultural phenomenon. Abuse in this case is predetermined and can be likened to torture. In many instances, the perpetrator is psychopathic. The beatings are almost always recurrent; the prognosis, poor. Hefler and Kempe suggest that a battered child returned to this environment has a fifty-fifty chance of surviving more than one year.2 Many students of this form of abuse suggest that the child not be returned to his previous environment. Child abuse as a whole, however, presents a different set of characteristics. Even though the battered child syndrome is generally demographically included, several ecological patterns emerge which lend hope to the survival and even much improved environment of the victim.",

Furthermore, perfectionism, as a personality construct, seems to be related to various types of maladjustment. Whereas perfectionism has been characterized as being positive when an individual derives pleasure from striving for excellence yet recognizes and accepts individual limitations, it is deemed negative when the individual has unrealistic expectations and is never satisfied with his or her performance. The present study examined whether positive and negative perfectionism was associated with anger and anger rumination. The Farsi version of the Positive and Negative Perfectionism Scale and the Farsi version of the Anger Rumination Scale, as well as Spielberger's State‐Trait Anger Scale were completed by 384 Iranian students. Results showed that anger and anger rumination were, as expected, associated negatively with positive perfectionism and associated positively with negative perfectionism. Positive perfectionism enables individuals to strive for success in a flexible manner and, thus, to experience satisfaction and pleasure rather than dissatisfaction, frustration, and anger. Conversely, negative perfectionism makes individuals vulnerable to emotional distress such as predisposition to experience anger and anger rumination through setting high standards for performance, overgeneralization of perceived failures, negative self‐evaluation, self‐blame, and measuring self‐worth in terms of unachievable goals of accomplishment and productivity. Hence, perfectionism may be regarded as having both adaptive and maladaptive aspects with regard to health.",

      "abstract": "The reasons why adolescents resist the use of contraception are discussed. Some adolescents believe that their love is too ideal to be associated with the practical and mechanical nature of contraceptive use. Psychic stress can cause adolescents to refuse to use oral contraception. Fear of side effects can contribute to this refusal as can a feeling of rebellion against the family or society. Some adolescents feel that the purity of their motives is put in doubt if they take advance contraceptive precautions. Some refuse to use contraceptives to punish themselves for the consequences of their actions a type of masochism. Some adolescents who have not had family lives want to have children which they later abandon. Impulsiveness of fulfillment of sexual needs may prevent adolescents from using oral contraceptives. Adolescents are caught between being sensual and chaste and have difficulty in figuring out the consequences of their acts. Memories of infancy resurge in the minds of adolescents. Adults having experienced adolescence can have an important role to play in shaping the attitude of adolescents regarding contraception. They can perceive if the resistance to contraceptive use is normal or not and can work to give adolescents the means to make responsible decisions for themselves.",

When the paternalist's target is small children or other incompetents, it is usually thought to be morally permissible. But when it targets the fully voluntary choices of competent adults, it invites many moral objections. This article distinguishes two types of objection, consequentialist and nonconsequentialist, and discusses the merits of several examples of each type.",

      "abstract": "Homosexually active men and women are no more immune than anyone else from various types of sexual dysfunction and underlying psychopathology. Intimacy fears and conflicts, ignorance, alcohol and drug dependence and relationship issues exemplify the type of issues influencing dysfunction regardless of sexual orientation, although membership of a stigmatized minority sexuality may exacerbate causes of sexual dysfunction. The effects of discordant lifestyle and identity, homosexual identity formation, dysphoria and internalized homophobia on sexual functioning are three examples of these factors of specific relevance to being homosexual in this culture. The effects of AIDS, difficulties arising from the mechanics of safer sex and the psychosexual effects of oppression on healthy sexual functioning all indicate how factors important to (but not caused by) minority sexuality status may influence sexuality functioning. The importance of neither perceiving homosexuality solely in terms of pathology on the one hand, nor refusing to recognize unhealthy sexual functioning on the other, is emphasized throughout. Models of sexuality must be inclusive, positive and communicated to the client if future sexual dysfunction is to be limited. Finally, the role of the therapist in community development, as well as individual intervention, is addressed. Primary health care interventions are required not only to address the specific issues affecting homosexual men and women, but also to promote a more positive approach to sexuality for all.",

      "title": "Permissiveness, Permission, and Aggression: The Effect of Adult Presence or Absence on Aggression in Children's Play",
      "abstract": "It has become conventional to think of an adult's permissiveness toward a child as representing neutralization of adult control. By behaving permissively (acceptantly, nonjudgmentally, etc.), the adult is thought to be freeing the child from his presence and authority, and in some loose sense to be permitting the child to behave as he would in the absence of any adult. Such thinking has emphasized the punitive or threatening aspects of adultchild relations. Adult permissiveness is seen as a way of reducing the child's fear of adult punishment and thus as a way of encouraging him to express in behavior those impulses whose expression he knows to be normally unacceptable to adults. Such thinking about permissiveness has been the basis for explanations which have been advanced for a frequent finding about aggression in doll play. It has repeatedly been observed that aggression in doll play increases over time or from session to session (i, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9). This finding has typically been explained by reference to the adult experimenter's acceptant and nonjudgmental interaction with the child and the fear-reducing effect this interaction has. For example, in discussing recent evidence confirming the finding, Levin and Sears state that",

      "title": "F7. SEX DIFFERENCES IN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SELF-REPORTS OF CHILDHOOD ADVERSITIES AND SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY TRAITS",
      "abstract": "While it has been repeatedly documented that people with schizophrenia report higher levels of adverse events in childhood (emotional, physical and sexual abuse), this has not been extensively examined in healthy individuals who score highly on schizotypal personality traits. The continuum hypothesis of psychosis and schizophrenia suggests it is important to assess the relationship in those who are healthy but who experience some psychotic-like symptoms. Of course, it is problematic to rely upon the veracity of events that anyone might recall from their childhood, but this is likely to be compounded by the presence of well-documented memory and executive problems, as well as symptoms such as delusional thinking, in some adults with psychosis. One advantage of examining healthy participants is that recall is not affected by the condition itself or memory- and executive-function problems. As there is evidence that the expression of psychotic disorders differ between males and females, the etiological mechanisms and pathways to the development and experience of psychotic symptoms may equally differ. Indeed, sex differences in the association between childhood trauma and psychotic symptoms have been noted. The aim of this present study was to investigate any links between childhood trauma and psychotic-like symptoms in healthy individuals. Based on previous research the expectation is that associations will be found between self-reports of childhood trauma and schizotypal personality traits. These associations would be expected to differ between males and females. The sample consisted of 320 participants (221 females, 99 males) with a mean age of 28.24 (SD 12.76). Childhood traumatic events were assessed by three sub-scales (Physical Punishment; Emotional Abuse; and Sexual Events) of the Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form (ETISR-SF; Bremner et al., 2007). Schizotypal personality traits were assessed using the Five Factor Schizotypal Inventory (FFSI; Edmundson et al., 2011). This consists of nine subscales (Interpersonal Suspiciousness; Social Anhedonia; Social Isolation and Withdrawal; Physical Anhedonia; Social Anxiousness; Social Discomfort; Odd and Eccentric; Aberrant Ideas; and Aberrant Perceptions) which were constructed as schizotypic variants of respective facets of the five factor personality model. The relationship between childhood trauma and schizotypy was examined using Spearman’s bivariate correlation analyses. Males showed significant positive correlations (ranging from .28 to .39) between Emotional Abuse and seven out of nine schizotypal sub-scales. The other two childhood trauma scales were not associated with any schizotypal sub-scales in males. Females showed significant positive correlations (ranging from .19 to .34) between Physical Punishment and eight out of nine schizotypal sub-scales. Additionally, females showed significant positive correlations (ranging from .26 to .35) between Emotional Abuse and all schizotypal sub-scales. Sexual Events positively correlated with two schizotypal sub-scales (Aberrant Ideas and Aberrant Perceptions) in females. From the results of this study it appears that emotional abuse was linked to the expression of psychotic-like symptoms in both sexes across a wide array of symptomatology. Therefore, any effect of emotional abuse should not be considered sex or symptom specific. By contrast, physical abuse appeared to be sex specific – affecting only females – but not symptom specific. Finally, sexual abuse appeared to have a specific link with disorganized thoughts and hallucination-like experiences in females.",

In particular he was interested in the function of sexuality within that process. Freud's theory regarded the Oedipus complex as constituting the relations essential to our development into social beings; but he also employed it to explain breakdowns in the normal pattern of sexual and emotional development. Essentially, it is a mechanism for effecting the transition from childhood to mature independence, enabling the adult to engage in a network of social relations. In the case of a boy, his early intimate involvement with his mother's body produces an unconscious incestuous desire, which also in effect casts his father in the role of his rival. However, through fear of castration, the boy represses this desire into his unconscious, submits to his father, casts himself off from his mother and identifies more and more with his father, who comes to symbolise his own future manhood. If the Oedipus complex is not successfully overcome in this way, however, the boy may become fixated on his mother, and in Freud's view this may lead either to an inability to form proper sexual relationships with women, or to homosexuality.",

Perhaps a reason for this has been the absence of a unified model of etiology and treatment that includes the most salient motivational factors unique to various subtypes of perpetrators. Such a model would have to be sufficiently flexible to account for the various sexually aggressive modes of expression without being unnecessarily complex or simplistic if it is to be clinically useful. Specifically with respect to sexual aggression against children, a quadripartite model is proposed that includes physiological sexual arousal, cognitions that justify sexual aggression, negative affective states, and personality problems as motivational precursors that increase the probability of sexually aggressive behavior. The relative prominence of these precursors is used as a guideline for assessing and treating particular subtypes of perpetrators. Failure to consider the primary motivational precursor during the initial stages of treatment also may account for the limited success of current treatments.",

      "title": "The rejected stalker and the resentful stalker",
      "abstract": "One of the commonest forms of stalking is that which emerges in the context of the breakdown of a close relationship. Typically the rejected partner begins to stalk after their partner has attempted to end the relationship, or indicated that he or she intends to end the relationship. The overt aim of the stalking is either to attain a reconciliation or to exact revenge for the rejection. In practice the stalker not infrequently entertains a mixture of both of these goals, the dominant motivation shifting with circumstances and the ex-partner's responses. The usual relationship to give rise, at its dissolution, to stalking is an intimate sexual partnership, but the breakdown of any close relationship in which the rejected partner has invested emotional energy can usher in stalking. In our own experience we have seen stalking emerge following rifts between close friends, parents and their children, longterm work and business partnerships and even therapists and their clients (patients). The essential elements are the stalker's sense of having had his or her rights and prerogatives violated by the unilateral attempt to sever the relationship, combined, to a greater or lesser extent, with a sense of loss at the end of an important relationship. The rage at rejection is often augmented by distress at the perceived unfairness or humiliating nature of the rejection.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Paraphilia or deviance is sexual stimulation or action that deviates from normal sexual behavior, but is necessary for some people to experience arousal and orgasm. People with paraphilia have unusual sexual interests, including inanimate objects, places, or individuals (children and corpses), and animals. Another paraphilic disorder involving a disapproving individual is characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, compulsions, or behavior in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the other person being unwilling or unable to consent. However, it is not specifically described in any of the other so-called Paraphilic Disorder categories (e.g., arousal patterns involving corpses or animals). CASE REPORT: Here, we report a case of a male patient aged 37 years, unmarried status, his last education graduated from elementary school, the patient complained that he had frequent contact with cows, he had been experiencing it for 2 years, he felt lonely and had no close friends. As a child, he was often scolded and beaten by his father. He is also often teased by his friends. CONCLUSION: Zoophilia is another paraphilic disorder involving disapproving individuals characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, drives, or behaviors in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the animal. This case is rarely reported because sufferers think their actions are not harmful, lack of parental attention and supervision may be one of the causes of this disorder.",

These are the essential concepts behind the theory of relative deprivation. Because a wide range of studies on racial riots, student and feminist protest movements reveal that the participants in these events are generally not the most deprived or disadvantaged of their respective groups, the relative deprivation explanation appears to be a plausible alternative to an absolute deprivation thesis. The first use of the term 'relative deprivation' dates from the Second World War. Since then, social psychologists, sociologists and political scientists have developed a number of models of relative deprivation in order to explain various personal and collective phenomena. There is an assumed link between experienced relative deprivation and the attitudinal or behavioural consequences at the personal and collective levels.",

Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results in anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, oedipal anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine self-esteem. Mothers were more important than fathers in the development of chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with decompensation in wives.",

      "abstract": "Human beings are inherently sexual in nature. An individual's sexual behaviour can have a profound impact on the person's sexuality regardless of how this behaviour occurs, be it masturbation in isolation or penetrative intercourse with a partner. Sex per say is not always done with an aim for procreation [1]. The individual's propensity for sex can be both procreative and non-procreative. The degree of inclination and the extent of engagement in the act though will depend on the individual's society, his/her culture, upbringing, religious beliefs/taboos, other people's expectation and opportunities [2]. What constitutes a normal sexual behaviour? There is no straightforward answer. What may be normal in one culture/society may be abnormal in another. The definition of 'normalcy' is driven by society and/or cultural values, and the extent of 'deviance' is also influenced by the same. Furthermore the 'degree of deviance' in some sexual behaviours can be quantified by comparing with already established norms, but this is not possible for all sex-related behaviours and conditions [3].",

      "title": "Risk factors and prevention",
      "abstract": "Risk factors play a central part in prediction and prevention. A critical issue in any discussion of risk factors is to ensure that the term risk factor, and associated terms such as correlate and marker, are defined in a precise, consistent manner.1 The starting point is to understand that a correlate is a variable that is associated, either positively or negatively, with an outcome. The presence or absence of a correlate can be measured in each subject. The term subject need not be an individual but could be a family, classroom, school, or an entire community. The outcomes can be dimensional, but they are restricted in this discussion to binary ones. Binary outcomes are the most relevant in medical practice. The physician and patient are concerned about whether the patient has or does not have the illness or disorder. The correlate can be measured at the same time as the outcome and thus be a concomitant of it, or it can be measured after the outcome and be a consequence or result of it. A risk factor can be considered a type of correlate. It is associated with an increased probability of an outcome, usually an unpleasant one. It has, however, a major distinguishing characteristic from other correlates, which is it occurs before the outcome. This is 1 of the 2 defining characteristics of a risk factor. The measure of the risk factor is taken on each subject before the subject has the outcome of interest. The second defining characteristic of a risk factor is that it can be used to divide a population into high risk and low risk subgroups. The probability of the outcome must be shown to be greater in the high risk compared with the low risk group. Thus, the 2 defining characteristics of a …",

      "abstract": "There are several areas that contribute to the individual's predisposition to anxiety: hereditary - constitutional factors, prenatal conditions, the birth experience itself, and early postnatal experience. Several \"developmental lines\" of anxiety are described in some detail: strangeness and stranger anxiety, anxiety by contagion, separation anxiety, and anxiety through loss of love or security. Stranger anxiety can occur whether or not mother is present, whereas separation anxiety occurs in the absence of mother whether or not anyone else is present. Harry Stack Sullivan describes learning by the \"anxiety gradient\" as learning to discriminate increasing from diminishing anxiety, with alteration of activity in the direction of the latter. The self-system is an antianxiety system - not the whole self - which functions as a compass to steer the infant away from experiences of increasing anxiety and toward maximum euphoria. The dynamism of the self-system is purely a product of interpersonal experience arising from the general pursuit of satisfaction.",

      "title": "Shyness in School",
      "abstract": "People with shy temperaments or personalities tend to be anxious in social situations, especially those that are novel or in which they perceive social evaluation. The experience of shyness may include behavioural (e.g., inhibition, wariness, withdrawal), affective (e.g., anxiety, nervousness), somatic (e.g., racing heart), and/or affective-cognitive components (e.g., self-consciousness, worries about social-evaluation). Shyness is related to, but different from, solitude, social withdrawal, unsociability, social avoidance, and introversion. Although all these psychological constructs may manifest similarly in that they involve less social interaction, they differ in the motivations underlying the behaviour. Uniquely, shyness is thought to result from conflicting approach and avoidance motivations in social situations. Shyness is also related to, but different from social anxiety disorder (SAD), in part because SAD is more intense, pervasive across situations, and impairing. Shyness can be heritable. Researchers may have identified certain genetic polymorphisms associated with shyness. However, even if someone is born with a tendency to be shy, they might not actually become shy because shyness is also influenced by children's environments. Shyness has been associated with certain aspects of parenting, such as overly controlling and protective behaviours. Shyness also has been associated with aspects of peer relationships, such as rejection. However, researchers cannot determine whether these aspects of parenting and peer relationships are causes or consequences of shyness. Shy children may face difficulties in the school context. It has been related to numerous social and academic problems. Specifically, shy children may have problems in relationships with their peer group (e.g., poor acceptance), one-on-one friendships (e.g., poor friendship quality), and some aspects of their relationships with teachers (e.g., lower teacher–child closeness). In addition, shyness has been related to low school liking, and sometimes has been associated with aspects of poor school engagement and low academic achievement. Researchers and clinicians have investigated strategies to help shy or socially anxious children and adolescents avoid maladaptive socio-emotional or academic outcomes. For instance, children's social skills training in combination with parent education and training components is a promising way to improve social behaviours and reduce anxiety. School-based preventions and interventions that include parent and/or teacher components, such as FRIENDS for Life and INSIGHTS into Children's Temperament, also have been found to mitigate anxiety or improve shy children's engagement at school. Some treatments for social anxiety disorder, such as cognitive behavioural therapy may also help shy children.",

Certain other aspects are learned, such as religion, language, attitudes, values, or customs. National origin of oneself or one's kin can be a component of ethnicity. Group affliliation and participation in certain ritual and ceremony are also involved in ethnicity. Substance abuse and dependence may undermine certain aspects of ethnicity and ethnic affliliations by interferring with tradtional values, attitudes, preferred behaviors, and interpersonal relationships. Substance abuse leads to the evolution of new values, attitudes, and behaviors. These are remarkably similar (though not identical) from one chemically dependent person to another. In some cases the chemically dependent person remains a social isolate, while in other cases the individual joins with others to create a subculture in which the drug or alcohol centered values, attitudes and behaviors are shared. Treatment of alcoholism or drug abuse - if successful - produces crisis in ethnic identity for many people. Drug centered values and behaviors are directly confronted in the treatment process, and affiliation with alcohol or drug subcultures is specifically undermined. This may create a state of anomie - with its attendant confusion, anxiety, and loss. Out of this turmoil some individuals resume their original, childhood ethnic identities and affiliations (though often more accentuated than before). Others assume new ethnic identities or affiliations.",

      "title": "Interparent Hatred and Its Impact on Parenting: Assessment in Forensic Custody Evaluations",
      "abstract": "The concept of parental conflict, as it is used in the custody evaluation literature, rarely conveys the motivational complexity of chronic parental acrimony. The concept of pathological hatred better describes and explains why some parents continue bitter fighting years after their divorce. Kernberg's classificatory schema of pathological hatred is applied to high-conflict divorces in which such hatred may be viewed as an effort to destroy, while at the same time desperately needing, the other parent. Difficulties mourning the lost marital relationship, stemming from either character pathology or childhood trauma, create a fertile breeding ground for pathological hatred. The concept of parental competence is also frequently oversimplified in the custody evaluation literature, where it is viewed as an assortment of unrelated skills. From a psychoanalytic perspective, the capacity for parenting is viewed as an outgrowth of a parent's object relationships, defensive structure, ego functioning, superego functioning, and unresolved developmental conflicts. Pathological hatred of the other parent tends to erode the parent's capacity for nurturance, as the parent sacrifices support of the child's developmental needs to the goal of making the child a pawn in the interparental hatred. The negative impact on the child's development can be insidious. An understanding of pathological hatred in high-conflict divorce enables the forensic custody evaluator to assist courts in making appropriate recommendations for therapeutic intervention, as well as custodial and visitation plans that have the potential to ameliorate or at least contain the damaging impact of the interparent hostilities on the child's development.",

      "title": "Violência sexual : impactos sobre o desenvolvimento da autoconsciência e autorrepresentações do self no ciclo de vida",
      "abstract": "Sexual violence against children and adolescents, a modality of sexual violence, is characterized as any sexual act or game, established in heterosexual or homosexual relationships, involving one or more adults and a child or adolescent, aiming at sexually stimulating the victim, or using it to obtain sexual stimulation in erotic, pornographic and sexual practices imposed through enticement, physical force or threats. Considered a public health problem and violation of human rights, this phenomenon produces serious biopsychosocial consequences, including feelings of guilt, low self-esteem, impairment of physical and emotional development, making victims more vulnerable to suicide ideas and attempts, as well as psychosomatic illnesses and sexually transmitted. Although scientific studies have pointed out the consequences of sexual violence in childhood and adolescence on the physical and emotional dimensions of victims, little is known about its influence on the development of self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. Based on these assumptions, this study investigates the impacts of sexual violence on self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. It is characterized as a cross-sectional and comparative study, involving two groups of participating subjects, divided between victims and non-victims of sexual violence in childhood and/or adolescence. Its sample is composed of 236 subjects, between youth and adults, of both sexes, university students and from different economic classes. The investigation consists of three interlaced studies, the first of which is an ex-post-facto type, in which the participants answered the handout containing a sociodemographic questionnaire and psychometric instruments; and, the second and third, multiple case studies, of the phenomenal and qualitative type, based on semi-structured interviews, using a thematic script. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, Pearson, Spearman and Pearson Bisserial correlation tests, Student's t test, Multiple Regression Techniques, and Similarity Structure Analysis. The qualitative data followed the interpretative model of the double hermeneutics, proposed by Giddens (1984), by which it is possible to unveil the meanings that the subjects themselves constraint from their actions, compared with the sense that the analysts, from theoretical and methodological constructs build in relation to the actions and interpretations of their interlocutors (Geertz, 1987).. Thus, we sought broader understandings about the impacts of sexual violence on the structuring of self-awareness and self-representations of the self; as well as about the aggravating factors for the occurrence of the phenomenon in childhood and adolescence; and, on the meanings attributed to them by those who have violated their bodies and intimacy, which is fundamental to the most accurate understanding of sexual violence in the life cycle.",

      "title": "Rejuvenating Sexual Health Holistically: An Approach in Ayurveda",
      "abstract": "Sex is one of the three primary human instincts, with self-preservation and social instinct, and is thus well developed in the typical individual. Sexual Dysfunction is referred to as problems that a person or partner encounters during any phase of typical sexual activity - physical pleasure, desire, preference, arousal, or orgasm. A person’s inability to participate in a sexual relationship as they would wish is how the World Health Organization describes sexual dysfunction. It can affect both men and women and may be caused by physical, or psychological factors. Sexual dysfunction, if not addressed promptly, can significantly impacts fertility. Since sexual dysfunction usually coincides with anatomical as well as psychological factors, a comprehensive sexual history, evaluation of general health, and reproductive health, and identification of any additional sexual problems (if any) are critical while diagnosing sexual dysfunction. The concept of sexual dysfunction is not new to Ayurveda. Classics include various references to it in the context of Yoni Vyapads, Dosha Vriddhi, Kshaya, Ojus, Artava Vaha Sroto Viddha Lakshana, and Manovikaras, along with probable causative factors and solutions. Ayurveda addresses the anatomical, psychological, and endocrinological aspects of sexual dysfunctions. Following Dinacharya, Rajaswala Paricharya, Garbhini Paricharya, and Sutika Paricharya provide extensive treatment regimens by focusing on the overall health of an individual’s reproductive, psychological, and endocrinological well-being. Female sexual dysfunction is a multifactorial condition that requires a holistic approach. Modern medical treatments offer targeted solutions, while Ayurvedic therapies promote balance and long-term vitality.",

The World Health Organization recognized the importance of psychological well-being by defining health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not just as absence of disease or helplessness. Contrary to well-being, psychological abnormality can occur to everyone and greatly undermine day-to-day functioning. Prevalence of psychological disorders in BiH is similar to worldwide prevalence: mostly anxious and somatic disorders are present, followed by mood disorders, schizophrenia and personality disorders. The development of psychological disorders is caused by the presence of many risk and protective factors. One of the possible ways of looking at the risk and protective factors is through the developmental perspective which is presented in this paper. It is difficult to set the boundary between child / adolescent and adult psychopathology; it would actually be more useful when it would not exist in the conceptual sense. To truly understand the risks of developing psychopathology, it is necessary for theoreticians and researchers to take a look at psychological disorders through a lifelong perspective.",

Service members have histories leading up to a suicide analogous to those among civilians. However, separations from families, deployments, combat or other trauma, command climate, and medical and psychological injuries are also stressors and may be linked to additional risks related to substance abuse, sexual dysfunction, domestic violence, lifestyle disagreements, or secretive thoughts and behaviors, which distance couples and add to disintegration of the supportive dyad the relationship could provide. Loss of vital social supports impacts resilience and facilitates a mindset enabling suicidal or other harmful thoughts and actions. Therefore, prevention programs that build, maintain, and sustain resilience are critical, as is availability of mental health clinicians trained to address relationship issues.",

      "abstract": "Health professionals have a responsibility to become informed and raise community awareness about the nature of bullying and its link to serious health risks.The term \"bullying\" refers to a group of aggressive behaviors to which one person is exposed repeatedly and over time by one or more others.Bullying encompasses physical aggression (hitting, pushing, punching, or kicking); verbal harassment (threatening, teasing, name calling, or making faces or dirty gestures); and indirect or relational mistreatment (ignoring someone or excluding him or her on purpose).Daring a person to perform a dangerous, illegal, or inappropriate action under the threat of losing approval among the members of a group is also considered a form of bullying.What is understood as bullying varies according to human developmental stages and cultures.Many people may have experienced or witnessed bullying behaviors during childhood and adolescence that were then regarded as part of growing up or a rite of passage.Today, published evidence supports the view that bullying is a very toxic form of abuse prevalent across the lifespan on a global scale.It occurs not only in schools, but over the Internet and cellular phones, in the neighborhood, at summer camp, at home between siblings, as hazing among young adults in colleges or the armed forces, and in the workplace.During the last 2 decades, bullying episodes have been linked to hundreds of deaths due to suicide, accidental injuries, and homicide.Adolescents who are bullied and those who bully others are often subject to other serious health, safety, and educational risks including emotional and physical symptoms; eating disorders; self-inflicted, accidental, and perpetrated injuries; abusing over-the-counter medication; hurting people on purpose; and frequent absenteeism.Bullying at the workplace has been linked to cardiovascular disease, fibromyalgia, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder.The development of social phobia among adults has been shown to be associated with teasing or bullying during childhood.Recently published longitudinal studies have established that psychiatric symptoms and conditions can be antecedents and consequences of bullying.Furthermore, young males who have been frequent bullies and bully victims are at high risk for future criminality.www.virtualmentor.org",

      "abstract": "Most first-time mothers experience a decline in both their sexual and relationship satisfaction from prepregnancy, which has negative consequences for the couple and their family. Prior studies have begun to identify risk and protective factors (e.g., empathy) for postpartum sexual and relationship satisfaction. Causal attributions for postpartum sexual concerns may be important because a specific cause can be difficult to pinpoint given the wide range of postpartum sexual problems among first-time parents. In the current study, 120 first-time mothers (3–12 months postpartum) completed validated measures assessing attributions for postpartum sexual concerns, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. Attributions were measured on four dimensions: internal/external (i.e., is the sexual concern due to the self or the situation), stable/unstable (i.e., will the cause of the concern occur again in the future), global/specific (i.e., will the cause of the concern affect other situations), and partner responsibility (i.e., is the partner the cause). When new mothers reported more stable and partner attributions for postpartum sexual concerns, they were less sexually satisfied, and when they attributed greater responsibility for sexual concerns to their partners, they were less satisfied with their overall relationship. These associations remained significant after controlling for potential challenges that may also impact sexual and relationship satisfaction during this period (i.e., breastfeeding, sexual frequency, depressive symptoms, fatigue, sexual functioning). As postpartum sexual concerns are common, attributions for these changes may be a valuable target for interventions aimed at strengthening the intimate relationships of women making the transition to parenthood.",

Differences of opinion, lack of communication and various kinds of problems that trigger disputes and disputes between the two. The aims of this research are (1) to determine the factors that cause continuous disputes and quarrels and (2) to determine the consequences of continuous disputes and quarrels. This research was carried out at the Tilamuta Religious Court using a qualitative approach with an empirical research type. The results of the research show that the causes of disputes and quarrels are; a) Economic problems, household needs are not met while there are children and wife's needs that must be met. b) Third party interference, can come from families who are excessively involved in household relationships or from other people. c) Polygamy is unhealthy, the husband is unable to act fairly and is unable to take responsibility for his two wives. d) Domestic violence/abuse occurs, lack of control of each other's egos and coupled with the husband not being able to control his emotions so he takes it out on his wife. The consequences arising from continuous disputes and quarrels include: (a) Disruption in fulfilling the rights and obligations of husband and wife, (b) Problems regarding child custody, (c) Division of joint Assets",

      "title": "Psychosexual problems.",
      "abstract": "Individual anxieties about sexuality remain surprisingly repetitive despite changing public attitudes toward sexuality. This discussion includes case histories which demonstrate the indirect presentation, using nonverbal and physical cues, adopted by some patients who experience difficulty in verbalizing their sexual problems. When seeking contraceptive consultation, the patient must have no conscious or unconscious anxiety about her desire for sexual pleasure without pregnancy and is entitled to assume, when seeking such advice, that the doctor who offers it has no such prejudices either. When the presenting symptom relates to otherwise illogical contraceptive difficulty, or otherwise invites examination of the genitals, one may suspect that the problem may be sexual and too difficult to express in other than the physical language the patient expects the physician to want. For a couple whose sexual life is comfortably confident and provides pleasure, any contraceptive method will serve its purpose of removing the fear of pregnancy. Such a couple may be advised on logical grounds. For the rest, an open-ended comment such as \"I wonder what the real worry is\" usually leads to the true anxiety. Yet, at this point, the doctor's anxiety often replaces the patient's since the management of psychosomatic disorders is not part of normal medical training. The temptation to send for the partner and advise a program of relearning, or to make referral to a sex therapy clinic which will do likewise, is strong for any busy doctor who has no psychosexual training. Skill in dealing with such common dilemmas in the context of the brief period allotted to each patient cannot be obtained from a short article, but it is worthwhile for a physician, confronted with a patient whose symptoms do not make sense, to ask what the symptom itself may indicate in terms of the unspoken problem at hand. Most family doctors who understand the training of the Institute of Psychosexual Medicine find their brief psychosomatic approach more appropriate to their everyday work than time-consuming behavioral sex therapy and more appropriate to patients who present their problems in the surgery. Such patients usually are troubled with their individual vision of their personal sexuality. Those who have no inclination for such training will make more accurate diagnoses if they are aware that nonverbal clues may say more than words and that referral to a colleague trained in psychosexual medicine may be more fruitful than one which only reinforces the patient's sense of inadequacy and abnormality.",

      "abstract": "The security and well-being of older adults in the grey zone - not incapable but more vulnerable - is a key area of concern among practitioners and legislators. The diminished capability associated with disease may be gradual and spotty, a grey zone that can last for years. Other, non-medical factors are also significant: vulnerability arises by reason of an individual's total life situation, including relationships, education, experience, personality, and connection to society. Protecting the interests of the vulnerable but capable has been considered in terms of protection from abuse, and/or in terms of capacity. Each approach has significant conceptually structural problems. Unless a very narrow definition of is used (essentially replicating the criminal offences dealing with assault and theft) adult protection legislation has inappropriately paternalistic aspects; older adults are entitled to make objectively foolish choices, take risks, or prefer new, disreputable friends over older, staider ones. Older adults do not require protection from the consequences of their own choices, freely made. A finding of incapacity would resolve the difficulty by simply re-categorising the vulnerable person as incapable, a response that will often be excessive and result in an unwanted and unnecessary loss of independence. Modern least-intrusive adult guardianship legislation attempts to modify that all or nothing outcome through a scheme of graduated capacities. In reality neither paradigm - abuse or capacity - realistically captures or appropriately responds to the range of situations in which the vulnerable but capable adult requires the assistance and support of the law. Those situations are most accurately understood with reference to the conceptual framework of equitable fraud.",

Mixed-orientation couples face problems stemming from the dichotomizing of sexuality, negative myths and stereotypes, and lack of awareness of models and resources. It can be particularly problematic when a partner's bisexuality is first addressed within a committed relationship. Case examples illuminate some of the issues. Therapeutic tasks include addressing the context of oppression, assessing developmental stages of sexual identity and the relationship, clarifying personal meanings of bisexuality, providing education and resources, and, possibly, facilitating negotiations regarding safer sex and polyamory. Optimal couple therapy provides affirmation of bisexuality, validation of same-sex relationships, and reflection of the partner's and relationship's strengths.",

      "abstract": "Addiction of any kind is indeed detrimental, leading to psychological, financial, and social disorders. However, drug addiction is seen as one of the major concerns worldwide, having the most distressing consequences. This may be attributed to a number of psychosocial factors which put a person at a greater risk to develop such behavior. For some, drugs provide a kind of relief in times of distress, and for others, it increases the confidence level and improves the performance on a given task. Several studies have been carried out so far highlighting various precipitating/perpetuating factors (parental neglect, discord, peer pressure, lack of coping and resilience, and social incompetence) in maintaining such behaviors, as well as the preventive ones (authoritative parenting, extended family system, and enhanced psychological capital) to overcome this menace. What makes it more challenging is holding a fallacious belief of baking (roasting) the weed (Charas) as a skill and smoking as a means of lifting one's morale and a matter of prestige. This may be attributed to the germination of a thought of exhibiting the power of masculinity before the same or the opposite sex and thus eventually sidelines the efforts made by the stakeholders to restrict the ill effects of drug addiction on youth and on society as a whole. There is thus a pressing need to educate young minds and restructure their belief system at a very early stage of development. In that direction, all the institutions (family, school, and place of worship) must go hand in hand to ensure that youth is aware about the ill effects of such illicit behaviors, well in advance.",

Not only are they likely to be men, but many studies also show they are likely to be in their early 20’s, from disturbed, dysfunctional family backgrounds with some prior criminal experience, not necessarily for crimes of violence. These features that murderers tend to have in common, can be seen as contributing to a limited portfolio of ways of dealing with other people. Their dysfunctional backgrounds mean that they have difficulty in feeling and knowing what it means to be a person, especially in seeing the world form another’s point of view. They see the cause of their frustration, anger or jealousy, or opportunity to slake their greed, as encapsulated in the object of another being. They want to remove or destroy that entity as the only way they can relate to the individual they see as causing their reactions. Murderers therefore provide a rather exaggerated illustration of the consequences of confusing the person and their body, violating the body through acts of aggression, as a product of this confusion",

By their very nature, such relations open us up to psychological and material suffering that would not be possible absent the particular relationship; even worse, from the non‐domination point of view, is that this vulnerability seems to be structural in a way exactly analogous to (for example) workplace or social domination. If being powerless to prevent an employer causing me harm constitutes domination at work, then what relevant differences can support the intuition that being powerless to prevent my partner causing me comparable pain is not autonomy‐hostile? I argue for the reassuring view that the obligations and possibility of pain arising from such relations aren't necessarily dominating; they would be so only if we believed that any obligation we have not explicitly agreed to is a restriction on our autonomy, and that is false. I conclude with a note of caution: even though intimate relations aren't necessarily dominating, they will often be contingently so if they take place in a wider social context of domination – such as that which we currently inhabit.",

Using Laing’s studies of the family as a framework, we argue that the expression of emotion, identity, thought, belief and behaviour in social settings is subject to the formative nature of memory. The link between memory and psychological distress (of varying severity) becomes evident when individuals are exposed to either (1) an enacted ideology within the family or social group, which is transmitted across generations; (2) denial or concealment in the face of direct experience and/or empirical evidence, for example, injustices in the workplace, war crimes or (3) explicit and incontrovertible actions that destroy relationships and which create painful memories.

Hypothesized was that an unexpected death correlates with more severe psychological distress. Individuals, bereaved after an unexpected death report more severe grief specific distress. There were no differences in general psychological complaints between the groups. The loss of a loved one could become even more stressful when dealing with a murder. Hypothesized was that when the killer is not convicted (yet) more severe psychological complaints were rapported. Also, hypothesized was that when the bereaved regarded the sentence as being too lenient more severe psychological complaints were rapported as well. Both of the hypotheses could not be supported. Thus, it appears to make no difference whether the perpetrator is convicted or not. Likewise, it makes no difference whether the sentence is considered appropriate or too lenient.",

      "abstract": "Doctors and prosecutors who defend the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome (SBS) point, among other things, to the many confessions obtained from parents and other caregivers as evidence of the reality of the diagnosis. Drawing on the existing social science research, this chapter examines the questions of (1) how, if at all, interrogations of those suspected of injuring or killing a child are conducted differently than other interrogations, and (2) what, if anything, would render such suspects more or less vulnerable to confession (true or false). The chapter examines how interrogations are typically conducted, and the primary reasons suspects confess, keeping in mind that their confessions can be either true or false. In the end, this chapter concludes that suspects in alleged shaken baby cases are arguably more vulnerable to false confession than those suspected of other crimes, and accordingly one cannot assume the reliability or truthfulness of confessions in these cases.",

      "abstract": "Studies in mental health is to increase the positive emotions of the person and to reduce the negative emotions, beliefs and thoughts. Especially after positive psychology, many studies have been carried out to ensure that individuals have positive emotions. However, in recent studies, it has been determined that individuals avoid not only negative emotions but also positive emotions. Thus, you suppress your positive emotions because of fear of happiness. The individual's beliefs and cultural values also affect mental health. The person is afraid of being happy because of these beliefs and cultural values. Fear of happiness is the avoidance of happines. When people believe thet unhappiness will come immediately after happiness or that the environment will be harmed after being happy, fear of happiness occurs. Fear of happiness harms both the mental health and social relations. Morever, fear of happiness is associated with alexithymia, anxiety, stress, fear of compassion, antisocial, cognitive distortions related to relationships, panic disorder and especially depression. It is extremely important to know and define the fear of happiness for an effective treatment interventions. Fear of happiness rests in maladaptive schemas in early life, not meeting their needs warmly and sincerely in childhood, punishing them when they experience positive emotions, and growing up in a family with unhealthy family patterns. In this study, it is aimed to define fear of happiness, to determine the protective and risk factors, to determine the causative factors, to explain the related concepts, and so to raise awareness about fear of happiness.",

      "abstract": "Bias crime statutes establish increased penalties for crimes committed because of race, color or religion. The Article examines various possible justifications for bias crime statutes to elucidate ways that thought in general, and bias in particular, may be relevant to punishment. The Article takes a generally retributivist perspective on punishment. Under retributivism, increased penalties are justified only for greater wrongfulness or greater culpability. Bias crimes might be considered intrinsically more wrongful than other crimes because they violate a person's interest in not being discriminatorily harmed. But such an interest implies an interest in another's thoughts inconsistent with established notions of autonomy. Alternatively, bias crimes might be considered contingently more wrongful because of their secondary effects on the victim's community and society. Uncertainties concerning under- and overinclusiveness, however, weigh against employing bias as a proxy for such effects. Mental states, such as intent, are traditionally relevant to culpability. Culpability, however, is a matter of an actor's attitude toward morally relevant features of an act or person. Bias is an attitude toward features, such as race and religion, that are morally irrelevant. Bias thus cannot increase culpability. Based on these analyses, the Article concludes that bias crime statutes are more problematic than generally recognized.",

Loneliness is not linked with social isolation, solitude, or aloneness. When low levels of social contact are desired, they may be experienced as positive. Loneliness is associated with mental illness. Loneliness is an emotionally unpleasant experience. It causes dissatisfaction, unhappiness, and depression.

Physical separation from family and friends drives one at risk for loneliness. Retirement, unemployment, and reduced satisfaction may also precipitate loneliness.",

At a minimum, illness can be thought of in biological, social, psychological, moral/religious, and probabilistic terms. Various aspects of illness maybe understood to be embedded in a number of explanatory contexts or theories. Any one \"fact\" about illness may involve a number of theories. For example there are several (partial) explanations for why sick children do not go to school. There is a biological rationale: sick people may be contagious and so may contaminate others they contact. There is also a social prohibition. It is a social norm that sick people are released from certain obligations and enjoined to others: one gets to stay home and should avoid making others ill. There also may be a psychological rationale: sick people feel bad and weak and so do not want to go to school.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy is widely regarded as an opportunity for a drug-using woman to give up drugs and become rehabilitated into society. Drug dependence is, however, a chronically relapsing condition and progress is easily disrupted. The motivational forces need to be strong to withstand the challenges presented by a new baby. From earlier chapters we have learned that drugdependent women tend to come from deprived backgrounds in which they may have been subjected to neglect, abuse and a variety of other stressors that leave them low in self-esteem and prone to anxiety and depression. As their dependence increases they may become detached from the usual support systems of family and stable friendships. Their need for support increases when they become pregnant. The frequency of premature births and NAS among the children creates the potential for additional strain. There is evidence that babies that are premature or have feeding problems are more at risk of neglect and abuse (Browne and Saqi, 1988). A crying child can be perceived as a rejecting child, the rejection is regarded as unnatural and the mother is confirmed in her belief that she is a failure, the tensions increase and their interactions become unrewarding. This is a pattern seen in non-drug-using mothers and is linked to symptoms of anxiety and depression. It is likely that the impact on the drug-using mother is much greater. If she is also without informal support from partner, family or friends she is particularly vulnerable to self-medication at this time with her own form of therapy and may resume using the drugs that have worked for her in the past.",

The so called sexual revolution of the last 20 years has brought about a dissociation of the traditional psychosexual behavior, where eroticism, affection, and desire of a child do not integrate as harmoniously as before. Narcissistic libido, inherent in all of us, can make an individual want a baby for reasons other than normal, but as a reflection of a parent, as a toy for an infantile mother, as a termination to free, sexual life, felt as sin, for a young couple, as a hope for the future, as the rival of one of the parents, as a remedy for something lost. These are just some of the reasons why contraception, completely accepted on a conscious level, can be rejected on an unconscious one, leading to unwanted pregnancies. Family planning, through a better and deeper psychological preparation of its personnel, should better identify patients more at risk of contraceptive failure, and the unconscious resistances of individuals and couples. This very important task can be started in schools with sex education, and in family planning centers with sexual therapy for the couple. This new approach would imply an increased interest for psychology on the part of doctors assisting young couples.",

The latter, it is argued, requires that the partners have each attained an adequate degree of separateness and at the same time are able to allow themselves to become physically and emotionally close. Relationships which are not intimate are characterized by excessive degrees of dependence, directiveness or detachment. The equilibrium in a non‐intimate relationship is maintained by fears in the respective partners about the other becoming too separate, too close, too influential, too assertive, too capable etc. Therapy involves persuading each to try cautiously giving ground in one direction whilst the other is giving ground in a complementary direction. Intimacy will follow if neither is too controlling from above nor too clinging from below and both partners are able to relate on an equal adult to adult basis.",

When there is a lack of identity verification (discrepancy), individuals experience negative outcomes such as psychological distress. Most adults hold multiple identities, and discrepancies in certain identities may cause more distress than others. Moreover, reflected appraisals come from various sources, and discrepancies with certain sources may be more influential than others. Yet most research on identity verification has not included multiple identities or multiple sources of reflected appraisals. We use structural equation modeling to simultaneously investigate associations between identity discrepancies with four sources of reflected appraisals (spouse, family, friends, and others in general) and distress (depressive symptoms) in a sample of 735 respondents who occupy three identities (spouse/partner, parent, and religious). We find that discrepancies in more obligatory identities and those involving reflected appraisals from more proximal sources of feedback are most consistently associated with depressive symptoms. Implications of these findings for advancing identity theory and research are discussed.",

      "abstract": "If a mother is stressed or anxious while pregnant her child is more likely to show a range of symptoms such as those of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, aggression or anxiety. While there remains some debate about what proportion of these effects are due to the prenatal or the postnatal environment, and the role of genetics, there is good evidence that prenatal stress exposure can increase the risk for later psychopathology. Why should this be? In our evolutionary history it is possible that some increase in these characteristics in some individuals was adaptive in a stressful environment, and that this type of fetal programming prepared the child or group for the environment in which they were going to find themselves. Anxiety may have been associated with increased vigilance, distractible attention with more perception of danger, impulsivity with more exploration, conduct disorder with a willingness to break rules, and aggression with the ability to fight intruders or predators. This adaptation for a future dangerous environment may explain why stress and anxiety, rather than depression, seem to have these programming effects; why there is a dose–response relationship with prenatal stress from moderate to severe and it is not only toxic stress that has consequences; why not all children are affected and why individual children are affected in different ways; and why the outcomes affected can depend on the sex of the offspring. An evolutionary perspective may give a different understanding of children in our society with these symptoms, and suggest new directions for research. For example, there is some evidence that the type of cognitive deficits observed after prenatal stress have specific characteristics; these may be those which were adaptive in a past environment.",

Past sexual abuse is often discovered in adolescents and adults consulting for mood or sexual identity disorders and addictive behaviors. These patients did not receive any psychological treatment because their parents quickly “forgot” the event. Thus, recovery is impossible: judicial redress has not been started and there is no family recognition of the harm and trauma. The reactions of parents can promote or block the “healing” process, and unsupported children can feel resentment towards their parents. The request for clarification is left hanging and will influence the psychological makeup of the future adult and the quality of their relationship with their parents. Parental silence is generally underpinned by sociocultural considerations, such as the judgment of others, resignation, or divine will.",

      "title": "Review and Prospect on the Research of Self-serving Bias",
      "abstract": "It is very common that people often attribute desirable outcomes to their ability or efforts, and attribute undesirable outcomes to others or situation. The tendency that people take personal credit when they succeed and deny their responsibility for failure is called self-serving bias. Today, the theoretical explanations for this bias have not been reached unified conclusion. The debate mainly focuses on whether the self-serving bias was produced by cognitive drive or by motivation, or by both. Lots of research shows that self-serving bias is widespread in the daily life and affected by age, gender, culture, and psychopathology. However, the research on its brain mechanism is relatively rare. Future research should extend the study of the self-serving bias to non-depressed psychopathological groups and other different populations. In addition, the brain mechanism of self-serving bias, its cross-cultural research, and the applicability of foreign research results in China will also be emphasized in the future.",

      "title": "CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ACUTE CONFUSIONAL STATE IN COLLEGE STUDENTS",
      "abstract": "An acute confusional state has been described, occurring in young adults in colleges in the Chicago Area with specific characteristics as to genesis, presenting complaints, onset, course, and treatment. Psychodynamic reconstruction is as follows: In childhood these patients were bound in an extraordinarily strong dependent relationship to their parents through guilt and fear, engendered by parental instability and disharmony. With subsequent dependent gratification and support these patients were able to achieve a conforming type of adjustment and gain success in academic and social achievements. However, in young adulthood when they attempted to find their own identity, through choice of heterosexual partner and choice of career, in the college environment, devoid of dependent gratification, their previous adjustment was inadequate to meet their needs. Sexual temptation or commitment led to guilt, which led to retreat. Retreat, in turn, led to shame and ridicule from the peer group. To avoid the shame, another attempt at conforming sexual behavior is attempted, and once more guilt, retreat and shame. In this way, either thrusts toward accomplishment or retreat from it are associated with anxiety. Under these circumstances, if the dependent gratification from parents is cut off due to their criticism or disapproval, the patient regresses to an early childhood fixation point, associated with primary anxiety, rage, and confusion, where he feels isolated, worthless, mistrustful and depressed. Recovery from the confusion occurs when the patient, who desperately seeks help, finds someone to lean upon. If inadequate help to meet his needs is found, introjection or projection of rage may result. Further study to delineate this confusional state would include: 1. Psychological tests for independent verification of our results, 2. biochemical tests to compare the chemical changes in this condition with that found in anxiety states associated with other conditions, 3. further understanding of treatment and preventive measures, 4. sociological study of the college community to elucidate factors related to the development of security in young adults in college, 5. study of the background (family as well as the community) from whence these patients came and 6. control studies on college students without confusion.",

Affected patients need a comprehensive assessment that includes taking a sexual history, medical evaluation and, if appropriate, a manual examination in order to diagnose, treat or identify factors relevant for each individual woman. There may be biological, psychological, emotional and relationship issues. Any biological factors such as vaginal dryness, pelvic floor dysfunction or chronic pain need to be addressed first to help prevent more complex problems developing. Sexual problems may be the cause of or the result of dysfunctional or unsatisfactory relationships. Psychological and emotional factors can create difficulties in sexual response and, equally, they can be the result of unaddressed or untreated biological/medical issues. Nurses working in urology need to be aware of the physiology involved in sexual response and know which conditions and illnesses are likely to affect sexual functioning and which treatments can help.",

      "title": "The wills of older people: risk factors for undue influence",
      "abstract": "Background: As people live longer, there is increasing potential for mental disorders to interfere with testamentary distribution and render older people more vulnerable to “undue influence” when they are making a will. Accordingly, clinicians dealing with the mental disorders of older people will be called upon increasingly to advise the courts about a person's vulnerability to undue influence.Method: A Subcommittee of the IPA Task Force on Testamentary Capacity and Undue Influence undertook to establish consensus on the definition of undue influence and the provision of guidelines for expert assessment of risk factors for undue influence.Results: International jurisdictions differ in their approach to the notion of undue influence. Despite differences in legal systems, from a clinical perspective, the subcommittee identified some common “red flags” which might alert the expert to risk of undue influence. These include: (i) social or environmental risk factors such as dependency, isolation, family conflict and recent bereavement; (ii) psychological and physical risk factors such as physical disability, deathbed wills, sexual bargaining, personality disorders, substance abuse and mental disorders including dementia, delirium, mood and paranoid disorders; and (iii) legal risk factors such as unnatural provisions in a will, or provisions not in keeping with previous wishes of the person making the will, and the instigation or procurement of a will by a beneficiary.Conclusion: This review provides some guidance for experts who are requested by the courts to provide an opinion on the risk of undue influence. Whilst international jurisdictions require different thresholds of proof for a finding of undue influence, there is good international consensus on the clinical indicators for the concept.",

      "abstract": "The phrase 4*wrongful life has been coined to cover several kinds of tort claims which have some resemblance to each other, but which also have important differences. The first of these is a suit by an il legitimate child asking for damages from his parents or others to compensate him for the stigma or deprivation which the status of il legitimacy generally carries with it. These cases have been discussed elsewhere.1 Another kind of suit to which the same label is some times attached is that which arises when a man or woman engages a physician to perform an operation for sterilization or to supply con traceptive devices and a child is later born as a result of the physi cian's alleged negligence in performing the operation or in pro viding the contraception. This claim is made by the parents, not the child, and therefore involves quite different issues from those in the suit by the illegitimate child. It is sometimes also referred to as a suit for wrongful or wrongful conception. A third type of claim arises when a woman gives birth to a defective or deformed or mentally retarded child as a result of the alleged negligence of her physician either in not preventing the birth or in not informing her",

      "abstract": "It is sometimes hard to know our own intentions when we act-much less those of someone else.Many actions leading to injury occur in moments of distraction, high emotion, or under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.Intent to injure may be peripheral to the action.Cheng et al make a useful distinction between intending to act and intending the damage caused by the act. 1 Determination of intentWithin the criminal justice system, guilt is determined by a judge and/or jury convicting a defendant of breaking a law.Within the health care system, the process is far less rigorous.For fatalities coroners and medical examiners depend upon police reports, testimony of witnesses or family members, or notes left by the deceased to code underlying cause of death.A judgment about intentionality must be made before one knows even what section of the coding system to use.This code is then appended to the death certificate, and sent to the vital statistics oYce.Rarely if ever is that code on the vital statistics data file revised to reflect criminal proceedings or new information.For cultural or religious reasons, suicide may be less likely to be coded in some countries than others.When we see an injury data table with columns marked \"unintentional\", homicide/ assault, and suicide/self inflicted, or when the World Health Organization lists these three as essentially diVerent \"causes of death\", it is tempting to think that these numbers invariably represent reality.However, research suggests otherwise, particularly for infants and young children across a number of causes of death. 2 3 One study using information from multiple sources estimates that between 7% and 27% of fatalities of young children classified as unintentional by the medical examiner or coroner should have been classified as due to abuse and neglect, an \"intentional\" classification. 3etermination of intent is much more subjective for non-fatal injuries when a health care provider judges motives while taking a history of circumstances causing a patient's injury.This is particularly problematic when the child, adolescent, caretaker, or other participants are reluctant to discuss their intentions.In most non-fatal coding systems, unintentionality is assumed unless noted otherwise.",

      "title": "Adolescents as victims of family violence. Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association",
      "abstract": "Adolescents experience maltreatment at rates equal to or exceeding those of younger children. Recent increases in reported cases of maltreatment have occurred disproportionately among older children and adolescents. However, adolescents are less likely to be reported to child protective services and are more likely to be perceived as responsible for their maltreatment. Adolescent girls are reported as victims more often than boys, especially in sexual abuse. However, boys may be less likely to be identified or reported and often are abused by nonfamily members. Parents of adolescent victims have higher average income and educational levels and are less likely to have a parental history of abuse than parents of younger children. A wide range of serious adolescent risk behaviors is associated with maltreatment. These include increased risk of premature sexual activity, unintended pregnancy, emotional disorders, suicide attempts, eating disorders, alcohol and other drug abuse, and delinquent behavior. Incarcerated youth, homeless or runaway youth, and youth who victimize siblings or assault parents have been shown to have high rates of prior maltreatment. Signs of maltreatment are often ambiguous for adolescents. Screening questions have been effective in prompting self-disclosure of abuse. Adolescents also experience problems in the child welfare system that offers fewer and less appropriate services for this age group. Recommendations are made regarding screening of adolescents for maltreatment, the development of better services for adolescents, research on parenting to prevent maltreatment, and training of school staff to identify and refer victims of maltreatment.",

      "abstract": "Extract All human beings who spend any time on this planet face the challenges of sex and affectionate love. Indeed, even if one realizes that being sexually or affectionately intimate with others is something that one neither needs nor wants, one has not thereby avoided the issue; rather, one has found a way to engage these complexities that is good for oneself. Others do not want (intimate) sexual interactions with the same partners (only); one way they address their needs and wants is to pay others for sexual experiences. It is not an exaggeration to say, however, that many or even the majority of people (also) try to realize ongoing, longer-term, intimate affectionate and sexual relations with others, and that they experience this striving as a central concern in their lives. It seems fair to say that it is in these more intimate relations many people experience some of their most precious encounters as well as some of their most devastating failures and losses. We fall in love and we fall in lust; we sometimes live together as partners, and some of us marry, and some of us have children. At the same time, we break each other's hearts, we betray each other's trust, we need each other's forgiveness, or we must learn to deal with the fact that loved ones sometimes die far too early. A theory that could account for all these ever-so-common human experiences and challenges would be an improvement to existing theories, because most theories currently on offer aspire to explain only one or selected issues.",

Adolescents do value friends, but it is not clear if the functions of friendship are unique or whether they might be served in other human relationships. There is much concern about the mental health implications of males having less intimate friendships than females, yet little data to clarify this issue. There is growing evidence to indicate poor peer relationships in adolescence are predictive of social incompetence and maladjustment in adulthood. There is increasing attention being given to the complexity of what is involved in peer acceptance, peer rejection, the selection of friends, social incompetence, and the negative and positive consequences of friendship. Research and theoretical implications are discussed.",

We know that recognition of the psychological sense of self as distant from the other is achieved in most infants during the second half of the first year of life. The child's dyadic relationship slowly merges into the oedipal triadic relationship with the parents by the end of the fourth year, ushering in a severely conflictual situation for children of both sexes. Curiosity about sexuality gives way, under reasonably adequate psychological conditions, to curiosity about the wider aspects of the world, a sublimation of a portion of sexual as well as aggressive wishes that continues into adult life unless inhibitions arise because of psychological conflicts that were insufficiently resolved during the pre-oedipal and oedipal periods.",

The sexes did not differ on measures of depression, dysfunctional attitudes, perception of important interpersonal relationships, experience or perceived impact of life events. Women scored more highly on measures of neuroticism, were more dependent and were more likely to engage in self‐consoling behaviours and coping styles. Recklessness as a coping style was the only item endorsed more frequently by men, posing the question of whether current measures take into consideration the male experience of depression. The findings suggest that many putative depressiogenic risk factors over‐represented in women do not, by themselves, create depression but require a triggering factor or certain social conditions for their expression.",

With older men are at greatest risk, near by equal incidence of attempted and completed suicide. Lot of variables in different domains (mental, physical, and social) have been correlated with Self directed violence in older adults. Affective disorder is most powerful independent risk factor for suicide in elders. Other mental illnesses play less of a role. Social ties and their disruption are significantly and independently associated with risk for suicide in later life, relationships between which may be moderated by a rigid, anxious, and obsessional personality style. Stressful life events, such as family conflicts, separation, bereavement, somatic illness and financial problems are common antecedents of suicide.\r\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To estimate multi-dimensional risk factor for suicidal self directed violence in elderly.\r\n2. To compare the risk factors between subjects with suicidal self directed violence and that of age and sex matched controls (with no history of suicidal self directed violence).\r\nMATRERIALS AND METHOD:\r\nThe current study was a case control study, conducted at, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Chennai.

Such aggression does not leave physical marks but nonetheless predicts invisible harm, including unhappiness and psychological distress. Most individuals do not end their relationship the moment a partner becomes aggressive. Instead they may deny, minimize, or justify the aggression, particularly when they are strongly committed to their relationship. Perceptions that downplay a partner’s aggression may protect and prolong a relationship, putting individuals at risk for greater harm. This article presents a model of the causes and consequences of downplaying partner aggression and describes the relevance of commitment for understanding aggression-related perceptions and interventions.",

      "abstract": "What is child sexual abuse?Child sexual abuse is any use of children for the sexual gratification of adults.Who abuses and who is abused?The abuser is almost always a male known to the child: a relative (father, grandfather, uncle, or older brother); a member of the household (stepfather or mother's cohabitants); or a temporary carer -for example, teenage male babysitters.Note that abusing males may move after the discovery of abuse to another household of similar composition.Child sexual abuse may occur in any part of society but is discovered more commonly in poor families.Children of all ages and either sex may be sexually abused. What happens?Sexual abuse entails all types of sexual activity often with escalating intrusiveness.Children may be exposed to indecent acts, pornographic photography, or external genital contact in the form of being fondled, masturbating an adult, or being used for intercrural intercourse.Finally, they may be penetrated orally, vaginally, or anally.How often does sexual abuse occur?Nobody knows how often sexual abuse occurs.It is certain that a lot of abuse is undiagnosed and equally certain that false diagnoses may be catastrophic.Five main risk factors predispose to child sexual abuse.* Previous incest or sexual deviance in the family * New male member of the household with a record of sexual offences * Loss of inhibition due to alcohol * Loss of maternal libido or sexual rejection of father * A paedophilic sexual orientation, especially in relation to sex rings and pornography. Do children tell?Sometimes children tell other people, but many are threatened to stop them telling.They may receive compensatory treats or presents.",

      "title": "Friendship jealousy: One tool for maintaining friendships in the face of third-party threats?",
      "abstract": "Friendships can foster happiness, health, and reproductive fitness. But friendships end—even when we might not want them to. A primary reason for this is interference from third parties. Yet little work has explored how people meet the challenge of maintaining friendships in the face of real or perceived threats from third parties, as when our friends inevitably make new friends or form new romantic relationships. In contrast to earlier conceptualizations from developmental research, which viewed friendship jealousy as solely maladaptive, we propose that friendship jealousy is one overlooked tool of friendship maintenance. We derive and test—via a series of 11 studies (N = 2918) using hypothetical scenarios, recalled real-world events, and manipulation of on-line emotional experiences—whether friendship jealousy possesses the features of a tool well-designed to help us retain friends in the face of third-party threats. Consistent with our proposition, findings suggest that friendship jealousy is (1) uniquely evoked by third-party threats to friendships (but not the prospective loss of the friendship alone), (2) sensitive to the value of the threatened friendship, (3) strongly calibrated to cues that one is being replaced, even over more intuitive cues (e.g., the amount of time a friend and interloper spend together), and (4) ultimately motivates behavior aimed at countering third-party threats to friendship (“friend guarding”). Even as friendship jealousy may be negative to experience, it may include features designed for beneficial—and arguably prosocial—ends: to help maintain friendships.",

      "abstract": "It has been argued by a number of commentators that those who would fabricate data or engage in outright plagiarism must be suffering from some sort of mental impairment. But a more sociological view of scholarly misconduct suggests that the competitive structure, not individual pathology, is ultimately responsible for these departures from the norms of science. There have been studies, however, pointing to personality traits such as narcissism and psychopathy as possible explanations. It is important to note that not all individuals offend for the same reasons. Individual scholars can also have major stressors in their lives such as family illness or death, relationship problems, and financial strains among other stressors. The authors argue that the structure of academic work and cultural issues can interact with individual and situational factors to increase the likelihood of departures from acceptable practice.",

      "title": "Terror, Trauma and Healing",
      "abstract": "Trauma can be defined as a stressor which overwhelm someone s ability to cope, characterised by feelings of helplessness in the face of some kind of personal danger. This can be the result of natural events, or more often circumstances such as the abuse of power, betrayal of trust, entrapment, pain or loss. It is not overly dramatic to claim that most people have some kind of personal trauma in their background. This may be the result of childhood experiences of abuse (or witnessing abuse), neglect or degradation; it may be related to adult experiences of violence or humiliation. Psychological effects worsen with chronicity, unpredictability, multifaceted sources, of a sadistic nature, and perpetrated by someone one has a relationship with. Even single events can have a significant and lasting impact. When you take into account rape and domestic violence (25% of women 2 ), sexual abuse of children (20-30% for females, 7-15% for males) and the fact that 25% of children in the US are living with an alcoholic parent 3 , it can be understood that trauma is widespread. Nature has evolved a dual brain system. The left brain deals with logical and verbal matters. The right brain stores experiences which are unconscious, emotional, somatic (non-verbal) and timeless. It organizes our motives and meanings. When it functions well it is the source of inspiration, intuition and creativity. When faced with trauma, it attempts to make sense of fearful or crazy situations, and in doing so offers up seemingly illogical emotions, illusions and delusions. Not all trauma results in damage; people survive and even thrive – more on this later. But when a trauma is not integrated it can be triggered; the right brain dominates and the left brain rationality recedes. We operate out of a traumatised state of mind, resulting in a narrowing of functioning. If I experience too much criticism, a lack of my needs being met when I am feeling vulnerable, or too much stress then I can tip into this TSM. When I do, a whole lot goes out the window: my sense of perspective, my rationality, my communication skills, even my caring for the other. I move",

      "abstract": "Marriage and other committed relationships typically include a stated or implied commitment to sexual and emotional fidelity to one's partner. Adultery refers to a violation of sexual fidelity within marriage. Infidelity is defined more broadly as a betrayal of the commitment to sexual or emotional exclusivity in a relationship without the partner's consent. Infidelity is also known by other terms, such as affair, cheating, unfaithful, extramarital sex, and extradyadic relationship. Infidelity applies to a variety of relationships such as dating, cohabiting, heterosexual, homosexual, and marriage. Contemporary technological advances have created new avenues for cheating, such as the Internet, cell phones, and social media. Although most societies and nearly all major world religions have standards that discourage infidelity, there are cultural variations in terms of attitudes and behaviors. Additionally, there are historical and cultural differences between the attitudes and behaviors of men and women regarding infidelity.",

The neonate is nondiscriminatory as to the identity of the agent.

      "title": "OF MICE AND KIN: THE FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF KIN BIAS IN SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR",
      "abstract": "Summary 1. Sharing recent ancestry (kinship) increases the degree of genetic similarity between individuals, where genetic similarity could mean anything from sharing a particular allele to sharing an entire genome. 2. Genetic similarity can influence behavioural and other responses between individuals in a number of ways, discriminatory and non‐discriminatory. All are likely to result in kin bias, because of the correlation between genetic similarity and kinship, but only some should be regarded as involving kin discrimination. 3. Non‐discriminatory kin bias could arise through close relatives sharing, for instance, physical characteristics (such as those influencing competitive ability), thresholds of behavioural response or requirements for particular resources. 4. Discriminatory kin bias could arise through the direct perception of genetic similarity between individuals (direct similarity discrimination) or the use of cues likely to correlate with genetic similarity (indirect similarity discrimination – of which kin discrimination is one form). Alternatively, it could arise incidentally through mistaken identity or discrimination at some other level, such as species identification. 5. Experiments with laboratory and wild house mice have revealed kin bias in a number of contexts, including ( a ) parental and infanticidal behaviour, ( b ) sexual development and behaviour and ( c ) investigatory behaviour and passive body contact among juveniles and adults. 6. While kin bias in mice has been interpreted as evidence for kin discrimination, there are several problems with such an interpretation. These include ( a ) pronounced and complex effects of familiarity on discrimination, ( b ) a high risk of error‐proneness in the indirect cues used in apparent kin discrimination and ( c ) weak and easily disrupted kin bias effects in certain contexts. 7. Consideration of social structure and discriminatory responses within populations of wild house mice leads to an alternative explanation for some kin bias in terms of incidental discrimination based on social group membership. 8. Several results from laboratory experiments suggest incidental discrimination is a more parsimonious explanation than kin discrimination for some intrasexual kin bias in behaviour. However, kin or direct similarity discrimination appears to be the most likely explanation for other aspects of intrasexual kin bias and for intersexual kin bias.",

      "abstract": "Recognition of sexual and gender diversity in the 21st century challenges normative assumptions of intimacy that privilege heterosexual monogamy and the biological family unit, presume binary cisgender identities, essentialize binary sexual identities, and view sexual or romantic desire as necessary. We propose a queer paradigm to study relationship diversity grounded in seven axioms: intimacy may occur (1) within relationships featuring any combination of cisgender, transgender, or nonbinary identities; (2) with people of multiple gender identities across the life course; (3) in multiple relationships simultaneously with consent; (4) within relationships characterized by consensual asymmetry, power exchange, or role-play; (5) in the absence or limited experience of sexual or romantic desire; (6) in the context of a chosen rather than biological family; and (7) in other possible forms yet unknown. We review research on queer relational forms, including same-sex relationships; relationships in which one or more partners identify as transgender, gender nonbinary, bisexual, pansexual, sexually fluid, \"mostly\" straight, asexual, or aromantic; polyamory and other forms of consensual nonmonogamy; kink/fetish relationships; and chosen families. We argue that a queer paradigm shifts the dominant scientific conception of relationships away from the confines of normativity toward an embrace of diversity, fluidity, and possibility.",

      "abstract": "A combination of biological factors such as earlier age at puberty and fecundity, and social factors such as the disappearance of the extended family and of rites of passage and the development of a youth culture have encouraged adolescent sexuality at the same time that length of schooling is increasing and adolescents have not yet become socially autonomous. Adolescents employ contraception relatively infrequently and tend to choose less reliable methods. Reasons for this include ignorance of the biology of reproduction and of contraception methods; the fear of secondary effects, encouraged by the mass media; lack of access to family planning facilities or fear that parents will be informed; and the cost of contraceptives. An adolescent requesting contraception should be treated as a adult, taking into account the degree of maturity; the attitude of the medial practitioner will influence motivation and success in using the method. The medical history will indicate cases in which a hormonal contraceptive is contraindicated. The gynecological examination reveals the gynecological age of the patient, which is more important than chronological age. The frequency of sexual realtions should also be considered in the choice. Because motivation of adolescents is less reliable than that of adults, such methods as rhythm and withdrawal are not appropriate. Condoms or diaphragms are disliked because of the necessity of repeated manipulation before each act of intercourse, but may be acceptable to highly motivated individuals. Condoms are indicated when relations are unexpected and infrequent. IUDs are indicated only when hormonal contraceptives cannot be used and when forgetting of pills is likely to occur. Nevertheless, IUD use in adolescents can entail serious problems of expulsion or of infection that may lead to later infertility. Little is known of the effects of oral contraceptive use on sexual maturation and growth of very young adolescents, but because of the growth inhibiting effects of estrogens, they should not be prescribed earlier than 2 years postmenarche. Low dose pills should be chosen. Sequential pills are preferable for patients with irregular cycles. High doses of steroids administered within 48 hours should be available in cases of unprotected intercourse. Alternatively, an IUD may be inserted within 5 days.",

One sign of this growing interest is the proliferation of instruments available to measure the two constructs (see table 12.1 for a brief overview of the instruments most widely used to measure adults' self-reports of guilt and shame). Although the instruments differ greatly, they reflect a growing consensus regarding fundamental differences between the two emotions in terms of their situational antecedents, appraisals, experiential aspects, and action tendencies. Shame involves a focus on one's global self – who I am and who I do not want to be – with its source being an unwanted identity. Because of the focus on one's own or others' (imagined) evaluation of the self as inferior or deficient, the ashamed person feels exposed, small, passive, and unable. We frequently hide or privately manage shame, because of its painful nature. At the same time, \"being\" ashamed communicates an awareness that we are somehow inadequate and need to defer or change lest someone launch further attacks on our identity and bases for our mutual relationships.",

Approved traits such as altruism may not be projected by the non-insightful; they may, however, be projected by the insightful. 11. Altruism is related to the relative value with which relationships are regarded. Relationships which, while prevalent in lay or professional thinking or both, have not been substantiated by the present study include: 1. The individual who attends church or synagogue regularly is apt to be more altruistic than one who does not. 2. The inhibition or control of impulses or desires involved in altruistic behavior is conducive to neurotic symptomology. 3. Those attracted to the sciences are more altruistically inclined than those attracted to law, business, or engineering. 4. The political liberal or leftist is apt to be more altruistic than the conservative or rightist. 5. Professed ease in relationships is correlated with altruism. 6. An child is apt to be significantly more egoistic than the average. Perhaps in the long run the most rewarding product of this study is one that had not been consciously hypothesized: the precipitation from the matrix of a configuration of variables that appears fully consistent with Becker's concept of the sacred pole of the sacred-secular continuum. Appearing as it did as the first dimension to be extracted and accounting for a larger amount of the matrix variance than any of the other seven dimensions which followed (including configurations consistent with the constructs socioeconomic status and social acceptability), it would seem to grant considerable support to Becker's contention that the construct sacred is not only objectively possible but objectively probable.22 If the sacred can be shown by factor analysis to be a dimension underlying the surface relationships between many of the variables of interest to the contemporary sociologist and psychologist, then the construct warrants considerably more attention from the quantitatively-oriented investigator than it has received to date.",

Men is considered to possess honour and women considered to possess shame. Men’s honour is therefore dependent on their control of, or lack there of, women’s dishonourable behavior. Honour related violence can in general terms be described as violence which is used to reestablish lost honour. The possibility to consider honour motives in relation to the value of a punishment (straffvarde) exists within Swedish legislation. There is no other expressed possibility to use this kind of motives as means to mitigate or aggravate punishment. Cases of honour related violence are however connectable to other aggravating circumstances due to its course of action with a specific focus on the close relation between victims and their perpetrators. The courses of action are also harsh to a point of applicability of other aggravating circumstances. Courts have in recent years gone from using synonyms and not explaining their effect on judgement to using honour by its name and explaining its position as an aggravating circumstance in itself. They have also suggested that it can not be used as a mitigating circumstance while establishing value of punishment (straffvardering). They have although expressed that the perpetrators cultural background can be used as such when measuring a particular punishment (straffmatning). Due to inadequate argumentation the legal position is still slightly unclear. By now considering honour motives as an aggravating circumstance in courts I consider the Swedish application of laws to be in correlation with demands set up by the principle of legality (legalitetsprincipen) in criminal justice in relation to murder at least. The legal position is still somewhat unclear and should be clarified by a ruling of Sweden’s supreme court or by new legislation. (Less)",

      "abstract": "Abstract Abstract The lack of an effective HIV vaccine or other biomedical intervention means that behavioural change will continue to be critical to the prevention of HIV infection. Despite near universal knowledge of HIV and sexual safety, and widespread intentions to be safe, rates of unprotected sex and HIV sero-conversion remain high among gay and bisexual men. Explanatory models that link risk-taking and prevention to rational processes such as knowledge, social norms, behavioural intentions, or perceived vulnerability to infection, cannot fully account for the continued risk behaviours observed in virtually all cohorts of gay men. We feel that innovative conceptions of risk and risk prevention are needed, that emphasize non-rational, affective processes in risk-taking and decision-making. Consistent with recent models from social psychology, we propose that for many people sexual risk does not stem from a lack of community norms or personal standards, but from a desire to escape cognitive awareness of very rigorous norms and standards. Being self-aware of HIV risk arouses anxiety and precludes highly-desired activities: fatigue, fatalism, or other negative affect over HIV may lead people to 'cognitively disengage' within the sexual situation, and not to follow their norms or intentions toward safety. We propose that both substance use and the approach of high stimulation or other sexual settings facilitates this cognitive disengagement, wherein people enact 'automatic' sexual scripts and or become more responsive to external pressures toward risk. We briefly review current psychosocial models of HIV risk behaviour, outline a cognitive escape model with particular emphasis on substance use as a behavioural risk factor, and discuss implications of an escape model for behavioural interventions among gay and bisexual men.",

      "abstract": "Prematurely born preschoolers show developmental cognitive delay compared to full-term children. There are important neurological networks developing at preschool age related to perspective taking about the attribution of belief and to deduction with contrary-to-fact situations. Other deductive abilities may be completed during that period.A group of very prematurely born children (N = 35) aged between 4 and 5 years was compared with a control group of children born at full term (N = 35). They completed different cognitive tasks that required making inferences about possible true facts and false facts, and about others' beliefs.Results showed that preterm children had more difficulties with false beliefs and counterfactual tasks than the controls but they did not differ in equivalent deductive tasks.We discuss the possible difficulties of preterm children when they first reach primary school age, not only with social perspective taking, but also with considering nonsocial contrary-to-fact alternatives. Prematurity is not a syndrome, but could be a risk condition. Therefore, these results are relevant in the field of differential diagnosis-in particular, for children with difficulties in perspective taking, a condition with which children born prematurely could share some characteristics.",

Unusual cultural beliefs are usually inadequate explanations for symptoms, no matter how bizarre the belief may be. Other parameters — genetic, family interaction, role expectation and so on — must be considered. Cultural beliefs can mask anxiety-laden intrapsychic dysfunction as well as maladaptive family behavioural patterns. Fulfilment of role expectation is a significant determinant of psychological functioning. Persistent awareness of psychopathology, together with a thorough familiarity with cultural aspects of an individual's background, is of utmost diagnostic importance. The absence of the latter leads to the danger of labeling and misunderstanding ‘symptoms’; the absence of the former can lead to the situation described in this case report.

      "abstract": "Sexual addiction has become the catch-all for infidelity, cheating, promiscuity, and rape. Recently it has become the newest claim for rapists and child molesters. Sexual addiction was defined similarly to how the DSM-5 has defined substance use disorders. Following the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, as well as how Carnes et al. defined sexual addiction, it sometimes appears as though sexual offenders are sex addicts and are therefore not responsible for their sexually abusive behaviour. Sex offenders may have a sexual addiction in addition to being a sexual offender; however the sexual addiction has nothing to do with sexual offending. No different than a sex offender having a substance use disorder- the drugs or alcohol used never cause the offender to rape, rape is a choice the offender makes whether sober or intoxicated. Sexual addiction involves having intense thoughts involving sexual activities and may include engaging in numerous promiscuous sexual encounters and frequent masturbation. However, those sexual encounters are not about forced sex, just about sex. Sexual offenders rape and molest because of thoughts involving the use of physical or psychological use of force to obtain sex and/or because of sexual thoughts involving children or adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Men's sexual overperception bias-where men tend to perceive greater sexual interest in women's behavior than actually exists-is a well-documented finding in previous research. All of the existing research, however, has tested this effect in the context of initial encounters or for fictitious or unknown targets. No research currently exists on how people perceive their romantic partner's sexual desire in the context of ongoing, intimate relationships. In 3 dyadic studies, we provide evidence that men in established romantic relationships err in the direction of the opposite bias and underperceive their romantic partner's sexual desire. We also demonstrate that this underperception bias is functional (particularly for men) in that it is associated with their partner feeling more satisfied and committed to the relationship. In addition, people are particularly likely to underperceive their partner's desire on days when they are motivated to avoid sexual rejection, and men's underperception bias is, in part, accounted for by men's higher general levels of sexual desire than women. The current studies extend previous findings on sexual perceptual biases and demonstrate the important role of context in men's judgments of a partner's sexual interest. (PsycINFO Database Record",

      "abstract": "Sexual behaviors in children are common, occurring in 42 to 73 percent of children by the time they reach 13 years of age. Developmentally appropriate behavior that is common and frequently observed in children includes trying to view another person's genitals or breasts, standing too close to other persons, and touching their own genitals. Sexual behaviors become less common, less frequent, or more covert after five years of age. Sexual behavior problems are defined as developmentally inappropriate or intrusive sexual acts that typically involve coercion or distress. Such behaviors should be evaluated within the context of other emotional and behavior disorders, socialization difficulties, and family dysfunction, including violence, abuse, and neglect. Although many children with sexual behavior problems have a history of sexual abuse, most children who have been sexually abused do not develop sexual behavior problems. Children who have been sexually abused at a younger age, who have been abused by a family member, or whose abuse involved penetration are at greater risk of developing sexual behavior problems. Although age-appropriate behaviors are managed primarily through reassurance and education of the parent about appropriate behavior redirection, sexual behavior problems often require further assessment and may necessitate a referral to child protective services for suspected abuse or neglect.",

They become cynical, malicious, and mean; that is to say, their libido regresses to the 'pre-genital stages of development', and sometimes expresses itself in undisguised anal and urethral eroticism, voyeurism, exhibitionism, and a tendency to masturbation. The process is apparently the same as that which Sigmund Freud describes as underlying paraphrenia; in both cases there is the same abandonment of object-cathexis and the same regression to narcissism. The exaggerated dissipation of sexual interests of many people at the climacteric is a symptom of over-compensation, of the healing tendency, while the real state of the distribution of the libido is represented by the ideas of impoverishment and guilt which accompany the patient's depression.",

      "title": "Belonging, Respectful Inclusion, and Diversity in Medical Education",
      "abstract": "Belonging is the experience of being accepted, included, and valued by others. A fundamental human motivation, belonging positively influences an individual's health, abilities, relationships, and overall well-being.1 Belonging is an interpretation of cues that suggests that one fits in and is welcome in a given context; it is an inference based on observations, interactions, values, and past events that define the culture and environment.2 Encountering discrimination, exclusionary practices, bias, and microaggressions interferes with the experience of belonging. Uncertainty about belonging, or worse, certainty of not belonging can contribute to isolation, diminished capacity for trust, emotional distress, lessened effectiveness, exhaustion, and serious health issues.2–5 Individuals who identify as members of underrepresented groups can be profoundly and disproportionately affected by these concerns.3 Respectful inclusion in the health professions of individuals with a wide range of backgrounds, identities, and life experience is increasingly understood for its primacy in preparing an innovative and representative workforce, addressing health disparities, advancing science, and serving the needs of the public.6,7 Respectful inclusion is vital to the future of medicine and requires new ideas and new practices, as illustrated very thoughtfully in several articles8–17 appearing in this issue of Academic Medicine. Committing to a more diverse and vibrant future requires self-honesty, creativity, and courage in tackling aspects of the culture of medicine that may interfere with people from all backgrounds feeling welcomed, included, and valued—namely, feeling that they truly belong. Belonging Cues Individuals may experience certain aspects of medical education as threats to a secure sense of belonging. For example, the populations of students and faculty of U.S. medical schools do not reflect our country's general population. Poor representation or nonrepresentation may suggest that some people are valued over others in the culture of medicine. This year, for the first time, women outnumber men enrolled in medical school,18 with a gender balance that more closely matches that of the general population. And yet, individuals enrolled in medical school in 2019–2020 identify as 50% white, 22% Asian, 7% black or African American, and 7% Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin,18 while the U.S. population identifies as 60% non-Hispanic white, 6% Asian, 13% black or African American, and 18% Hispanic or Latino.19 Decades of effort to promote diversity in admissions have led to uneven results. To illustrate, between 1980 and 2016, the proportion of black or African American medical school matriculants rose only slightly, from 6% to 7%, and the proportion of Hispanic matriculants rose from 5% to 6%. American Indian/Alaska Native matriculants declined to 0.3% in 2016 from 0.4% in 1980, despite increasing year after year in the general population.20 In 2018–2019, 24 of 53 applicants who identified as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander were accepted to medical schools, and 44 of 109 who identified as Alaska Native/American Indian were accepted.21 Postgraduate medical education overall tends to be more diverse, especially in primary care fields, although certain fields of training22 are very narrow in terms of demographic characteristics. Bringing greater representation to all specialty fields poses challenges. In 2019, for example, there were more black or African American and Hispanic applicants to family medicine programs than to dermatology, neurology, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, pathology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, radiation oncology, and urology combined.23 The composition of medical school faculty is evolving, with greater numbers and proportions of women and individuals who identify as traditionally underrepresented in medicine (URiM), especially among earlier career faculty members.24,25 That said, in a recent survey26 inquiring about the major professional activity of medical school faculty members, only 516 individuals who identified as black or African American reported medical teaching as their primary focus, and only 294 reported research. In this survey, only 2 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander individuals reported administration as their main professional activity. Persistent underrepresentation of some groups in medical schools may lead to the perception that some groups are less welcome and their presence less supported, impeding the experience of belonging. As noted by Walton et al,27 this perception should not be denied or dismissed, as it is not unjustified: \"it reflects the external world, and the risks a person faces\" when a group that has been historically excluded encounters stereotype threat or, for whatever reason, experiences disadvantage or negative repercussions in a given context. In her essay28 entitled \"A Dark Spot on a White Canvas,\" Dr. Lia Thomas describes this inner experience from when she was a medical student: The thought was there, gnawing in the back of my mind, whispering at me when gross anatomy got tough…. \"You do not really belong here; you took someone else's spot.\" I would not dare voice these feelings to my friends or to my advisors. A part of me was afraid that they would think less of me for feeling inadequate; another part of me knew with certainty that they already knew I was inadequate.28(p455) As Dr. Thomas assumed leadership roles as a faculty member, she felt paradoxically both visible and invisible. When stressed, she found that the voice of lonely self-doubt returned. Did I not know my place? Had my reach exceeded my grasp?…. And, most importantly, where would I belong?28(p456) Baumeister and Leary1(p521) have cautioned that \"cultures use social inclusion to reward, and exclusion to punish, their members as a way of enforcing their values.\" It is no wonder, then, that feeling out of place causes self-critique, isolation, and feelings of being an \"imposter\" in academic medicine. Moreover, in the presence of other factors, ruptured or thwarted belongingness can contribute to heightened risk for physical health problems as well as emotional distress and self-harmful behaviors.5 Better understanding of the role of belonging in medical schools may help us to understand the distinct and often very serious health care needs of URiM students, as documented in a number of empirical studies.29–31 Another barrier to feelings of belonging among medical students is the observation that that learning environments are not free from hostility, exploitation, and unequal treatment, despite efforts to ensure otherwise. The 2019 Medical School Graduate Questionnaire32 (n = 19,933), conducted by the Association of American Medical Colleges, documented that many respondents (23%) had been \"publicly humiliated\" once (13.1%), occasionally (8.8%), or frequently (0.8%) during their undergraduate medical training. Twenty-one percent reported other students being subjected to such behavior. More than 60 respondents reported being asked during medical school to exchange sexual favors for grades or other rewards. Nearly 1,000 respondents reported being denied opportunities for training or rewards based on gender, and more than 1,100 reported receiving lower evaluations or grades based on gender. A total of 8.5% of respondents had personally experienced \"racially or ethnically offensive remarks/names\" once (4.1%), occasionally (3.9%), or frequently (0.5%) in medical school. More than 500 respondents reported being denied opportunities for training or rewards based on race or ethnicity. A similar number reported receiving lower evaluations or grades based on race or ethnicity. A small proportion of respondents overall reported being subjected to offensive remarks/names (2%) or to unequal treatment (0.7%) at least once related to sexual orientation. It is unclear which students had these experiences, but it should be noted that a total of 7.2% of respondents in the survey self-identified as bisexual, gay, or lesbian, and 0.4% stated that they had a different gender identity from the sex assigned at birth. Many respondents did not report negative experiences such as these to their institutions because they felt that nothing could be done or because they were fearful of reprisal.32 Further, demonstrations of respect for diversity by faculty were reported as occurring either never, almost never, or sometimes by 5.4% of respondents. Demonstrations of respect for students by faculty were reported as occurring either never, almost never, or sometimes by 6.5% of respondents. These findings suggest that the learning climate is not yet fully supportive of our students. While some may argue that these percentages have improved over time—and they clearly have—it is important to remember that a trend does not feel wholly relevant for individuals who are directly experiencing humiliation or unequal treatment. Beyond these threats and barriers, the experience of belonging may be affected, positively or negatively, by rituals and signs of recognition and status in the culture of medicine (e.g., honors, awards, invitations, opportunities). Whether evaluations and letters of recommendation predominantly describe personal attributes (as is more common for women and members of groups traditionally underrepresented in medicine) as opposed to strengths and areas of competence (as is more common for men and members of majority groups in medicine) is a cultural signal that influences opportunities for students and reinforces either belonging or exclusion.33 Students who identify as members of underrepresented minority groups in some settings may carry greater financial debt,34,35 may encounter structural barriers to performance on standardized examinations,36,37 and may be at risk for slower progression and greater attrition.38 How such disparities are addressed will affect students' sense of affiliation, safety, and feelings of either being out of place or \"at home.\" The presence of leaders, mentors, and near-peers who identify as members of underrepresented groups, along with perceptions of their scope of responsibility, power, and control or access to resources, can serve as cultural indicators that augment or lessen feelings of belonging. Whether individuals who identify with underrepresented groups are asked to carry disproportionate burdens of service and representation (the \"minority tax\") can be another environmental cue for students.39 The presence of meaningful and relevant policies, along with evidence of their faithful implementation, can serve to communicate a commitment to respectful inclusivity in a given context. For instance, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education40 has 2 standards pertaining to diversity and inclusion. The first states that each medical school must develop programs or partnerships aimed at broadening diversity among qualified applicants for medical school admission. The second states that each medical school must have policies and practices to achieve appropriate diversity among its students, faculty, staff, and other members of its academic community, and must engage in ongoing, systematic, and focused efforts to attract and retain students, faculty, staff, and others from demographically diverse backgrounds. The existence of concrete manifestations of such ideals is very important, including, for example, intentional curriculum design; adequacy of knowledgeable, sensitive, and well-prepared faculty; the existence of all-gender facilities; and the dedication of spaces for individuals with religious and spiritual beliefs or distinct backgrounds. Opportunities to receive specialized resources, financial assistance, career counseling, and culturally attuned health services, along with the absence of physical symbols that are experienced as objectifying certain groups, further fortify the message of respectful inclusion for medical students. Toward a Culture of Belonging, Respectful Inclusion, and Diversity In this issue of Academic Medicine, our authors take on some of the most difficult challenges that pertain to belonging, respectful inclusion, and diversity in medical education. Several articles offer insights into experiential and cultural issues, and some also offer strategies and practical approaches for implementation. Three articles relate to the selection of students for Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA), a prestigious national honors society in medicine. Byyny et al8 of the AOA Honor Medical Society articulate their society's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity, emphasizing humility as expressed in the organization's ideal that its members \"Be Worthy to Serve the Suffering.\" The authors acknowledge that the AOA has certain restrictions (e.g., no more than 16% of a medical school's graduating class can be selected) and yet make clear that each of the 132 AOA chapters at medical schools in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Lebanon have the ability to develop and enact selection criteria for medical students, residents, and physicians at different career stages. In a second article, Teherani et al9 describe how the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine examined and changed selection processes for the school's AOA honor society, adopting holistic review, as one effort among many, to dismantle existing inequitable educational structures. Arguing that selection to the AOA reinforces structural biases and social privilege in medical education and runs counter to core tenets of equity and wellness, a third article by Lynch et al10 describes what many will consider a courageous decision to suspend student selection to the AOA at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The authors state that a return to selection of students for the AOA at Icahn will only occur when all students are treated equitably in medicine. The cultural symbolism and influence of the AOA, and of similar honors, are reflected in these 3 articles. In a remarkable qualitative study performed by Ackerman-Barger et al11 at the University of California Davis School of Medicine and Yale University School of Medicine, medical students and nursing students who identified as members of underrepresented groups were interviewed to better understand the role and effects of racial microaggressions in health professions education. This research report is exceptional for its clarity and thematic organization, its engagement of students in 2 health domains, and its sensitive selection of narrative examples to convey, movingly and richly, students' experiences. This project follows on the past work by Orom et al38 documenting, for example, that URiM students face distinct challenges socially and academically, experience their learning environments as less positive, encounter discrimination and racial harassment, and are more likely to see race as negatively affecting their education. An important contribution of the study by Ackerman-Barger et al is the set of recommendations offered by the students themselves related to diversity and allyship, curriculum change, open conversations, and safe spaces. The insights of trainees in bringing forward respectful inclusion practices in the culture of medicine are invaluable, as seen in the example described elsewhere41 of the innovative adoption of 2 new chief resident roles for diversity and inclusion in one clinical department at Yale University School of Medicine. Cook et al12 consider key issues and relevant resources and provide a set of thoughtful recommendations to help academic institutions develop more respectful, supportive, and attuned approaches to trainees who identify as transgender and nonbinary. The authors comment on administrative challenges and recommendations, touching upon culture, policies, data collection, health and wellness, and gendered spaces, and on educational challenges and opportunities in the classroom, clinical teaching, mentorship, and evaluation activities. The AM Last Page13 in this issue of the journal, entitled \"Creating Affirming Health Care Environments for Patients Who Are Gender Diverse,\" complements the valuable contribution by Cook et al12 and builds on the relatively small literature base on this emerging topic.42,43 In their careful review of 89 published articles, Brottman et al14 sought to understand how health care professionals and medical students learn about topics such as implicit bias, health disparities, and the needs of diverse patient populations. Eleven educational strategies for fostering cultural competence were identified in the articles. Few of the published projects demonstrated favorable outcomes. Similar results have been found in studies of college students, in which some strategies for inclusion resulted in feelings of inauthenticity and exclusion among certain groups, despite their opposite intent.27 The review by Brottman et al highlights the important role of faculty expertise and skill and states that the adoption of more clearly articulated goals and refinement of best practices are needed. That review also serves as a reminder of the value of empirical work in informing curricular innovation and campus interventions. In another article in this issue's collection, Sukhera et al15 suggest that transformational learning theory may serve as a useful lens for advancing education on implicit bias and related topics. Focusing on graduate medical education, Gonzaga et al16 propose an approach for meeting Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education standards on creating a diverse and inclusive workforce. The approach features 5 interrelated components: setting diversity as a priority, seeking out candidates, implementing inclusive recruitment practices, investing in trainee success, and building the pipeline. Gardner et al17 describe the use of a new tool, the Situational Judgment Test, in addition to a scoring algorithm, to identify candidates for residency interviews in 7 residency programs. A number of candidates selected in this manner had United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores that previously would not have reached a \"cutoff\" threshold, and the candidates invited for interviews were more diverse than in the past. Respectful inclusion and diversity in health professions education are essential to the learning, well-being, and effectiveness of our early-career colleagues. Respectful inclusion and diversity, furthermore, are essential to the health of the people and populations we are entrusted with serving, now and in the future. The role of belonging in health education, systems, and workforce is also essential, even though that role has thus far been underrecognized. Greater understanding of belonging, Dear Reader, is the key to respectful inclusion and diversity in the health professions. Such understanding will allow us to tackle the hardest issues we together face related to equity and well-being. Laura Weiss Roberts, MD, MA",

Due to the absence of significant appraised persons in this kind of kinship analysis, grandparents, siblings or collateral relatives are required to participate in the analysis. Complex kinship analysis is widely used and the demand is increasing year by year. This paper analyzes the main types of complex kinships, the genetic markers of complex kinship analysis and their advantages and disadvantages and the calculation methods for complex kinship analysis by referring to the relevant literatures at home and abroad in recent years. At the same time, the shortcomings of the present research on complex kinship and its future development are prospected.复杂亲缘关系鉴定的研究进展.复杂亲缘关系鉴定是指由于父或（和）母已亡，或因为其他原因不能参加检验，为了民事或刑事案件中的个体识别等而进行的特殊亲缘关系鉴定。这种亲缘关系鉴定案件由于重要被鉴定人的缺失，需要隔代、同胞或旁系亲属参加检验。复杂亲缘关系鉴定应用普遍，鉴定诉求逐年增加。本文参考近年来国内外的相关文献，对复杂亲缘关系的主要类型、复杂亲缘关系鉴定检测的遗传标记及其优缺点、复杂亲缘关系鉴定的计算方法等进行分析，并对复杂亲缘关系研究现状中存在的不足及其未来发展进行展望。.法医遗传学；遗传标记；亲缘关系；综述.",

      "abstract": "Is husbands’ wife‐directed aggression related to unusual accuracy (hypersensitivity) or to bias (being likely to inappropriately infer criticism or rejection) when they infer women’s critical/rejecting thoughts and feelings? Results of a study using the empathic accuracy paradigm and signal detection analyses revealed that the greater the husbands’ bias to overattribute criticism and rejection to the thoughts and feelings of women they had never met, the more the husbands reported behaving in a verbally aggressive way toward their own wives. This finding discourages the conclusion that maritally aggressive men are uniquely provoked by their own female partners, and instead suggests that they are biased to overattribute criticism and rejection to women in general. The strength of this overattribution bias correlated negatively with the men’s accuracy in inferring the actual content of the women’s thoughts and feelings. On the other hand, the husbands’ thematic accuracy (their ability to accurately specify which of the stimulus women’s thoughts and feelings really were critical or rejecting) was associated with their self‐reported marital satisfaction.",

Offender(s) may deny homosexuality and confuse an aggressive active behaviour with a masculine (even macho) behaviour. They may project their homosexual feelings onto the victim. In the aftermath of rape, the victim may be ashamed of having lost control and may question himself about his real sexual identity. An aspect of female or male rape by a group of males may be an attempt to annihilate latent homosexual tendencies existing between members of this group. Surprisingly, in the short term, post traumatic disorder related to rape and pre-existing psychiatric disorder may develop separately, without substantial interaction. In the famous case of Schreiber described by Freud, homosexuality is assumed to play an important role in the development of paranoid schizophrenia. Cases in which schizophrenic patients (of both sexes) imagine being raped by a member of the opposite sex, may possibly challenge this opinion.",

I felt desexualised in my body, unaware of my autism but deeply aware of my alienation and social position. Unable to find a sexual reflection in popular culture and bombarded with tropes of toxic masculinity I turned my sexual desires inwards. Only with my closest confidant, my partner, did any semblance of sexuality emerge, mediated by images and symbols imbibed as a teenager. My deep desire for connection that extended into sexuality felt ossified and unaired—kept in an air-sealed wrapper, like a vintage toy to be sold in the future or admired on a shelf. The sexuality that emerges from within me doesn't feel constrained and defined by borders or the models used by the dominant culture. It is lush, verdant, warm, damp. It is not a shape defined by others. It is not attached to gender. It is not a taxonomical category to which I ascribe. My sexuality extends from the love that I easily feel towards other bodyminds like mine and the intimacy with which I seek to imbue relations. It need not be segregated and distinct.",

      "title": "Bye-bye, sexuality",
      "abstract": "The psychoanalytic concept of sexuality continues to be misunderstood and confused as something else. For Freud, sexuality does not offer any firm ground where the subject can stand up, walk steadily, move forward easily and travel comfortably to a given destination. It does not ever represent some \"thing\" that men and women can conquer and/or possess. As a concept, it cannot be compared to gender, which offers culturally and socially reassuring explanations. In contrast, Freudian sexuality, bisexuality and sexual difference cannot be fitted into any model; they do not constitute a guide or a map full of recognizable signs to follow, like heavenly bodies in the firmament. Just the opposite: they produce confusion, anxieties, uncertainty. Sexuality is problematic and conflicting; unconscious desires will never be fully realized. If anything could be said about sexuality, it would be to characterize it as infantile and polymorphous; perverse and not gender-specific. It is also, in part, an unconsciously remembered event: it belongs to a previous moment in the subject's infantile life, now repeated, never forgotten: … once upon a time. … Suckling at the breast or playing and experimenting with different orifices of the body, for example, reappear in the foreplay of adult sexuality. This link is necessarily unconscious; paradoxically, the knowledge of this connection is not accepted by our consciousness, because it never existed in the first place – except, rather ironically, nachträglich. This irony can also be understood as a tragic joke: sexual pleasure is possible because the connection was, from the beginning, only there in the negative – completely unknown to the subject. 1",

At present, empirical support favors the premise that solitude, when expressed in social contexts, is a risk factor for peer adversity. It remains unclear, however, whether this risk applies equally for solitary-anxious versus unsociable children, or varies by type of adversity (i.e., peer rejection, exclusion, victimization). Less well examined is the premise that that negative peer experiences precipitate or exacerbate social withdrawal and solitude. Available evidence implies that peer adversities maintain or exacerbate rather than instigate children's solitary propensities. Theoretical and empirical innovations are considered as a means of further illuminating the interplay between solitude and peer adversities within and across developmental epochs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract People's choices of food and drink, the attitudes they express, and the beliefs that they state are influenced by their political and other identities. At the same time, people's everyday choices depend on the context of available options in ways that are difficult to explain in terms of the choosers’ preferences and beliefs. Such phenomena provoke various questions. Do partisans or conspiracy theorists really believe what they are saying? Given the systematic inconsistency of their choices, in what sense do consumers prefer the items they purchase? More generally, how “flat” is the mind—do we come to decision‐making and choice with pre‐existing preferences, attitudes, and beliefs, or are our explanations for our behavior mere post‐hoc narratives? Here, we argue that several apparently disparate difficulties are rooted in a failure to separate psychologically different types of preferences, attitudes, and beliefs. We distinguish between underlying, inferred, and expressed preferences. These preferences may be expressed in different coordinate spaces and hence support different types of explanatory generalizations. Choices that appear inconsistent according to one type of preference can appear consistent according to another, and whether we can say that a person “really” prefers something depends on which type of preference we mean. We extend the tripartite classification to the case of attitudes and beliefs, and suggest that attributions of attitudes and beliefs may also be ambiguous. We conclude that not all of the mental states and representations that govern our behavior are context‐dependent and constructed, although many are.",

      "abstract": "The weak evidence base and profound consequences of gender-affirming interventions for youth call for a particularly sensitive and complex psychoanalytic exploration. However, prohibitions on knowing at the individual and social levels significantly constrain psychoanalytic work with trans-identified youth. Barriers to exploration and thinking that patients bring to treatment are reinforced and reified by the dominant socio-political trends that saturate the contexts in which young people dwell. These trends increasingly frame any attempt to deeply explore why a young person is seeking medical or surgical gender-affirming interventions as \"off-limits\" and a form of conversion therapy. Furthermore, politically driven clinicians who promote medical gender-affirming interventions misrepresent and attempt to discredit clinicians who explore the meaning and function of trans identification, or who express concern that transitioning may be a drastic solution to various forms of psychic pain. In doing so, they minimise the significance of the weak evidence base for these interventions and their serious, known risks. At the same time, they obscure or deny the psychic pain that is sometimes humming beneath the experience of gender dysphoria. The author asks: If there are significant uncertainties and risks of harm associated with medical interventions for young people,",

This chapter argues that such intimate relationships can make a normative difference to paternalism, in virtue of some of the constitutive elements of intimate relationships. These difference-making elements include shared history, mutual knowledge and understanding, joint identification and projects, and reciprocated trust and vulnerability. Thus, the chapter argues, the presence of an intimate relationship can generate additional or stronger reasons for one to paternalistically interfere. Moreover, the presence of such a relationship can also weaken or cancel some of the presumptive reasons of respect one would otherwise have not to interfere. The discussion also reflects generally on the nature of intimate relationships, on the normative significance of paternalism, and on normative differences between paternalism in the institutional and interpersonal contexts.",

      "abstract": "Many executives lack an effective framework for accurately classifying - let alone developing strategies for - their work relationships, leading to bad misjudgments and costly mistakes. The authors contend that professional relationships should be defined along one of two continuums: unconditional and conditional. Many career-ending mistakes can be traced back to a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference. Relationships that are independent of situation and context are called unconditional. At one end of this spectrum are friends; at the other end are enemies. A friend inspires unconditional trust, whereas an enemy is someone who continually works against another person's interests regardless of the circumstances. Although the most intense (and often the most time-consuming) connections are those with friends and enemies, the vast majority of business relationships are conditional, with allies and adversaries on opposite ends of the spectrum. Allies will promote another's interests as long as doing so also serves their own self-interest. In contrast, adversaries will work against someone because their self-interest conflicts with the other person's interests. The most important thing about such relationships is their transitory nature: An ally can easily turn into an adversary (and vice versa) given a change in circumstances.",

      "title": "Different Forms of Violence – Selected Issues",
      "abstract": "Violence has been part of the human history since its very beginning. As some believe, it is “Cain’s sin” that determines violent human behaviour. Though this belief is obviously simplified, it reflects the nature of man. We are eager to seek evil in others, in individuals and in social structures. It is not just the family that is oppressive. Violence is ubiquitous; it is inflicted by peer groups, social classes, organisations, and by the state. Violence is commonly defined as social behaviour against someone or something, the aggressor being on one side and the victim on the other. Usually, a narrow definition of violence is used; i.e., violence is understood as the use of force to obtain from others what they are not willing to give or what they do not want to do. However, violence is a more complex phenomenon. Some forms of violence are sophisticated and difficult to discern, not only in the behaviour of others but also in our own actions. Violence occurs on a micro-scale in the form of pressure, extortion, inducement, or restrictions, and on a macro-scale – as wars, crises, terroristic acts, or revolutions. Violence is not only physical and psychological; it may also be personal, structural, hidden, explicit, emotional, and rational. What follows, it takes place in a wide array of spaces: in culture, sport, politics, the media, in the public space and at home. Therefore, the narrow definition of violence fails to include many of its aspects, and as such it is not practical. Using such a definition, we are left with extreme cases, so in fact we define pathologies. A serious difficulty in defining violence is connected with defining human rights in a unified way. These vary from culture to culture and have been evolving throughout history. Violation of these rights constitutes the essence of what is referred to as violent behaviour. Each society defines and attempts to prevent violence differently, and also in its own way indicates those who judge the perpetrators of prohibited acts.",

      "title": "Child Abuse and Neglect (Nursing)",
      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as “all forms of physical and emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, development or dignity.” There are four main types of abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological abuse and sexual abuse. Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

      "abstract": "Aim To address and discuss the weaknesses of age at first drink (AFD) as a concept in alcohol research and prevention. Methods Narrative literature review. Results Varying from one sip to the consumption of several full drinks, and sometimes including the specification of particular conditions (e.g. without parental consent), no exact definition and operationalization of AFD was found. Evidence reveals poor test–retest reliability when the same individuals report their AFD two or more times. Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence fail to explain why having one sip or one drink earlier than peers should cause heavier drinking and related problems later in life. Alternative explanations such as self-selection, third variable effects and systematic report bias are not considered in most studies. These shortcomings also make AFD unsuitable as an indicator or marker of underlying problems such as conduct problems and academic failure. Together with unjustified causal inferences, this has led to an over-emphasis on the relevance of postponing AFD as a way to prevent problems later in life. Conclusion We argue in favour of shifting the focus of alcohol research and prevention away from AFD towards a better understanding of the progression from infrequent, low-quantity drinking to more detrimental drinking patterns and the prevention of associated acute and short-term harm.",

Perselingkuhan yang telah diketahui oleh suami, istri atau keduanya dapat memberikan dampak besar dan terjadi dalam jangka panjang karena komitmen yang mengandung kepercayaan satu sama lain telah rusak. Agar dampak perselingkuhan tidak terlalu serius, pengampunan menjadi pilihan paling penting untuk menghadapi perselingkuhan yang dilakukan oleh salah satu pasangan. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui pengampunan seorang istri dan komitmen pernikahan seorang istri setelah suaminya berselingkuh. Peneliti pada penelitian ini menggunakan penelitian kualitatif dengan pendekatan fenomenologi. Teknik pengambilan sampel Purposive sampling digunakan untuk mendapatkan subjek penelitian yang sesuai dan metode pengumpulan data yang digunakan adalah wawancara mendalam dan observasi terkait dengan empat subjek istri yang dikelilingi oleh suami. Subjek pertama, H tidak bisa memaafkan perselingkuhan suaminya sepenuhnya dalam aspek kognitif, afektif dan perilaku, sehingga komitmen setelah suaminya berselingkuh kurang kuat. Subjek kedua, S tidak bisa memaafkan suaminya dalam aspek kognitif dan afektif, sehingga komitmen setelah suaminya berselingkuh kurang kuat. Subjek ketiga, MR bisa memaafkan suaminya dalam aspek kognitif dan perilaku, sehingga komitmen pernikahan setelah berselingkuh kuat. Subjek keempat, NB tidak bisa memaafkan perselingkuhan suaminya dalam aspek kognitif, afektif dan perilaku, sehingga komitmen pernikahan setelah perselingkuhan suaminya kurang kuat.",

      "abstract": "Families of patients with cancer shape and share in the many and difficult decisions faced following diagnosis, with significant involvement in decisions regarding complementary and alternative medicine. Such decisions may be particularly difficult due to conflicting opinions regarding complementary and alternative medicine and relative lack of medical guidance. Family may act as information seekers, advocates and/or role models, either prompting, enabling or discouraging use by the patient. Complementary and alternative medicine use within a family may promote familial cohesion and functioning, or increase familial distress and conflict. Where outcomes are poor, the ability of the family to care for themselves and the patient may be compromised, adding to the burden of cancer within the community. Some complementary and alternative medicine may offer benefits to family members themselves, either with or without patient use. Evidence is lacking, however, regarding the effect of differences in the experiences or perceptions of complementary and alternative medicine use by individuals in different familial relationships to the patient, or in differences associated with gender, socio-economic or geographical status, ethnic or cultural background, or non-traditional family structure. Morever, little is known about how families negotiate decisions about complementary and alternative medicine, nor of the long-term consequences of these decisions upon family well-being and functioning. Such knowledge would enable clinicians to better advise patients and their families on treatment choices following a cancer diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Does affirmation of familial self have a distinct buffering function compared to affirmation of close other (friend, partner) self or individual self? We addressed this question in an East-Asian culture (China) that places particularly high value on familial self. Familial self-affirmation (compared to other forms of self-affirmation as well as low affirmation) curtailed the mortality salience–induced intolerance to birth-control policy (Experiment 1), reduced female participants’ performance detriments—due to stereotype threat—on mental rotation (Experiment 2), and diminished the disadvantageous influence of negative feedback on further interest in information about one’s weaknesses (Experiment 3). Close other self-affirmation, devoid of family context, was no more potent than individual self-affirmation or low affirmation. The findings underscore the utility of distinguishing among different sources of self-affirmation, highlight the relevance of familial self-affirmation to self-affirmation theory, and call for research testing the germaneness of familial self (and, more generally, the construct of family) in other Eastern, as well as Western, cultures.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Negative labels affect the way people view themselves; and these unbeneficial habits involve non-acceptance. It is assumed that individuals encounter branding with stigma due to the negative features associated with their affiliations based on dispositions and values that are widely agreed upon. There are cases that happen because of the environment's discriminatory attitudes, prototyped expectations, and biased judgments. Some individuals are labeled for their substance abuse, physical abnormalities, sexual orientation, or deviant actions. Discussed here are coping mechanisms under the premises of attachment theory, which puts forward the existence of an eternal psychological connection between human beings. Consequences of these negative habits depend on the response of the target agents and their self schemas. Moreover, the study asserts that stigmatized people are relatively better at coping with prejudice compared to non-stigmatized ones because these labeled individuals are exposed to opportunities to discover and to improve themselves.",

Psychological effects on rape victims appear with symptoms that appropriate to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), including sadness, depressed mood, insomnia, loss of interest in usual activities, negative self-concept, self-blame, feeling useless and guilty, difficult to concentrate, often think about suicide or death. Compensation for rape victims needs to be obtained by considering the psychological condition. There has not yet been any compensation for the psychological impact on rape victims. About compensation has been regulated in Law No. 31/2014 Regarding Amendment to Law No. 13/2006 concerning Protection of Witnesses and Victims. the regulation does not include compensation for psychological effects. In this regard, it is necessary to address the urgency of regulating compensation for psychological effects on rape victims.",

      "title": "Event Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetration Against Romantic Partners Versus Non-Romantic Partners",
      "abstract": "Tactics used to perpetrate sexual violence may be crucial to understanding when and why sexual violence occurs. Moreover, most sexual violence occurs between people who know each other—including in the context of dating or sexual relationships. Little is known about the context of sexual violence that occurs with non-romantic partners. To address these research gaps, we examined online survey data from 786 young adults (weighted n = 763) aged 19 to 27 years, living across the United States. Findings suggest that 60% of sexual assault, 40% of attempted rape, 42% of rape, and 67% of coercive sex were perpetrated against a romantic partner, defined as a current or ex-boyfriend, girlfriend, spouse, or domestic partner. Contextual differences were noted by relationship type: Those who perpetrated against romantic partners were more likely than those who targeted non-romantic partners to report that it occurred because they were feeling sad or angry. They were also more likely to say that the other person was completely responsible for what happened. Conversely, those who aggressed against non-romantic partners were more likely to say that someone else found out about what happened. Making the other person feel guilty was the most common tactic for both groups. The most frequently endorsed reason for perpetrating sexual violence was “feeling really horny,” although feeling “good” or being drunk/high were also common reasons noted by aggressors. Afterward, many said they felt guilty or ashamed and were worried about the other person’s feelings. Fear of getting caught was universally absent. Findings support the importance of building emotion regulation and emotional awareness skills in sexual violence prevention programming. Prevention programs should also discuss coercion as a violence tactic, since perpetrators may not always recognize this to be sexual violence. More generally, violence prevention programs should also address healthy relationships, consent, and taking responsibility.",

Their decision to establish a sacramental marriage has not been properly thought over by them. All this makes them unable to establish permanent interpersonal ties with their marital partners.

Failure to recognizing a delusional hoax can delay treatment for the perpetrator of the hoax. Failure to recognize a child's fabrication can subject the family to unnecessary legal action and unwittingly support the use of a similar manipulative technique by other susceptible children.

Prior to the ultimate loss of the relationship, there may be intermediate losses that undermine relationship stability. Research on social allergies, or extreme responses to minor annoyances, suggests that relatively mild antigens, if frequently repeated, can gradually cause a loss of feelings of idealization of the partner, comfort with the partner, or feelings of being cared about or respected by the partner. Larger problems may cause loss of major elements of love. The loss of physical attractiveness may, depending on the partner's attributions, be associated with the loss of passion. The loss of desired levels of social support may lead to the loss of intimacy, whereas the loss of customary levels of interdependent behavior may lead to a loss of commitment. The loss of honesty in the relationship may lead to a cascade of other losses. Finally, the partner's differing perspectives on the loss can lead to account-making and the deriving of meaning from the loss.",

In this chapter, we examine respect as a case study of such behavioral codes or norms. By respect, we mean that people are impelled to treat each other as individuals of goodwill and competence, even if they do not privately believe it. This norm explains why people, including strangers, trust each other much more than the underlying rational economic analysis would suggest. It also explains a host of other interpersonal behaviors, such as helping and avoiding confrontation. The anatomy of respect is complex. It works often against a person's underlying preferences rather than for them, constitutes what people think they should do rather than what they want to do, is driven by anxiety, focuses on regulating actions rather than their outcomes, comprises avoidance motivation rather than approach motivation, and is more moral (ie, private and personal) than social (ie, honored only because it is actively enforced by others) in nature. Despite the range and power of its influence, the norm of respect itself receives too little respect, in that people commonly underestimate its impact on human behavior.",

Additionally, many doctors are uncomfortable with the patient's questions about sexuality and feel uneasy about broaching the subject themselves. In some cases, they feel that such questions are an intrusion on the patient's privacy, even though they realize that bowel and drug habits, cigarette and alcohol use and reproductive status are also private matters. In other cases, they believe that the patient's sexual concerns are not of medical significance or that their own ability to treat such concerns is limited. In this way, they ignore or dismiss the patient's concerns.",

However, observation of the child and the work of psychoanalysts have updated the role of jealousy in the origin of the sociability of a very young child. Jealousy in the pre-Oedipus stage does not represent an essential rivalry, but rather a mental identification. Similar to the experience of a mirror where the child recognizes his image (mirror stage), when the young child meets someone similar, he links this to the mirror experience, in other words. When jealousy takes a pathological turn, it manifests itself in the child, when personal identification in this child still falters. It can take mytho-manic turns, but can be transitory. It can also take a paranoid turn when the ego regresses to an archaic stage where something like \"or him or me\" is played out.",

For example, under imprinting, a risk‐conferring allele may only be expressed in an individual if it is inherited from a particular parent. Alternatively, a mother's genotype, even if not transmitted to her offspring, may influence in utero conditions and increase risk and/or interact with genetic predisposition for particular diseases among those offspring. The existence of such parental effects may lead to incorrect interpretations of the (marginal) effects of particular genes when performing human genetic studies at the individual level, unless such effects are accounted for in the analysis. We discuss potential scenarios of such parental effects, and present an overview of current methods for accommodating these effects when performing segregation analysis, linkage analysis, or genetic association studies.",

      "abstract": "This work makes an approach to the understanding of the construction of sexuality in a subject, how culture, history and biology are involved in the process of choosing sexual orientation, and the importance of the different situations that occur throughout life, which leave exceptional marks in the psychic structure and how these are related in the determinations established by each subject, without leaving behind the importance of the previous and new narratives around the different sexual orientations as a life choice, and the role played by the mental health professional in the different ways of intervening in each person, respecting his or her particularity, although nowadays for the health system these clinical criteria are not of major importance, since it seems that the ideal of mental health does not allow people to function from their rarity and particularities but rather obliges the subject to fit into an idea of mental well-being that seems increasingly impossible to achieve, leaving the subject without the possibility of recognizing himself or herself, in order to reach the established illusion of mental health. Leaving in the background the perspective that our rarities and choices do not represent, nor do they point to any kind of pathology or abnormality, therefore, they are themes that are inscribed in each subject based on singular representations. It is important to highlight that the case study you will read below attempts to approach Freudian thought, drawing on Freud's enormous intellectual work on the subject.",

      "title": "The Psychology of Sexual Deviance",
      "abstract": "There is one topic that is guaranteed to polarise any group that discusses it, and that is sex. The perception of what is sexually perverted shifts dependent on who is talking about it. A person’s profession, gender, age, race, proclivities, education and even which century they live in, have all effected the viewpoint on sex and sexual perversions. For example, homosexuality has long been stigmatised as sexually perverted, (and remains so among some portions of society), but psychological and medical professionals no longer consider it pathological. Even the term perversion is controversial. Psychologists generally refer to non-traditional sexual behaviour as sexual deviation or, in cases where the specific object of arousal is unusual, as paraphilia. There are a number of clinically recognised disorders of sexual or paraphiliac function, including fetishism (the object of sexual desire is either an inanimate object or a non-genital part of the human anatomy), voyeurism (the covert viewing of other individuals who are naked, undressing, or engaged in sexual activity) and chronophilia (the primary sexual attraction is to a particular age group). Many of these behaviours are punishable by law. Although rape is not classified as a paraphilia, it is a serious sexual deviance, and perhaps the most highly reviled form of sexual gratification. \r\nThis lecture will explore forms of sexual deviance and sexual violence that come to the attention of forensic psychology, and outline the psychological theories that attempt to explain why some people find sexual gratification in unusual and illegal ways. You may be surprised at the ways in which the law impinges upon sex.",

      "abstract": "The quotes are proved by unjust and inhumane action of killing in the name of false pride. Honour killings or crime against humanity has risen to prominence in recent years and is a global phenomenon. The punishments for cases obviously vary from society to society as per the nature and extent of the defiance and dishonour. Honour killing is the result of  socio-psychological milieu of cynical societies where some acts of the behavior of human beings especially of the females are recognized as making dishonour to their families and communities and the lost honour is recovered by killings them. Honour killing is the homicide of a member of a family or social group by other members due to the perception of the perpetrators that the victim has brought dishonour upon the family or community. The pseudo dishonour is generally the result of the unaccepted behaviors or the suspicion of such behaviors like desiring to terminate or prevent an arranged marriage or inter-caste marriage, inter-religion marriage, ‘sagotra’ marriage, desiring to marry by own choice or against the wishes of their family especially if to the member of a society deemed inappropriate, engaging in hetero-sexual acts outside marriage, adultery and engaging in homosexual acts etc. It is the menacing phenomena of repressive social practices in the name of honor triggering violent reaction from the influential members of community who are blind to individual autonomy. The ‘honour killings’ or ‘honour crimes’ are not peculiar to our country. It is an evil which haunts many other societies also and a global problem. Honour killings, for whatever reason needs immediate attention. Law needs to be used as a weapon to curb social evil. What is needed is a firm decision by the government for a separate law. There is paucity of research studies in this area. The networking of the police, judiciary, government, NGOs, human rights activists, sociologists, social workers, and psychologists is to be done in order to mitigate this social evil. Honour killing cannot be accepted in the name of culture or tradition. Honour killing is unjust and inhumane action. It is crime against mankind. The paper analyses the menace of honour killing, causes and legal framework.",

      "title": "Relationship closeness and trauma narrative detail: A critical analysis of betrayal trauma theory",
      "abstract": "Abstract Betrayal Trauma Theory (BTT) holds that certain traumas, such as incest, should be uniquely categorized as betrayal trauma: a subcategory of trauma in which the violation of trust, within a close relationship, occurs in the context of a traumatic event. According to BTT, betrayal trauma results in either partial or complete traumatic amnesia because repression is adaptive when a victim depends on a perpetrator for physical or emotional needs. In a test of BTT, undergraduates screened for betrayal and non‐betrayal trauma histories provided detailed accounts of these events. In order to account for threats to internal validity that are often overlooked by traumatic amnesia researchers, we also assessed factors known to compromise narrative detail. Consistent with BTT predictions, more betrayal was associated with less detailed trauma narratives. However, this relationship was no longer significant after controlling for survivor age, avoidance symptoms, gender and purposeful omission of detail. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "A theory of pseudomaturity or precocious development has been suggested to explain how mis-timing of adult transition events (occurring too early) can generate difficulties later in life. In a community sample, the age at which 30 adult activities (including various types of drug involvement) were begun were examined for an underlying factor structure, sex differences, and general and specific correlates with various aspects of adult functioning. Five factors were identified, confirmed, and moderately correlated including age of; drug initiation, financial autonomy, independent living, intimacy involvement, and deviant activities. Age at puberty did not load on any factor and was only significantly related to age of intimacy Involvement. Men were involved in drug use, financial autonomy, and deviant activities earlier than women, whereas women began puberty and intimacy at younger ages than the men. Pseudomaturity as reflected in a general construct and specific scales was significantly associated with numerous aspects of later adult role functioning, including drug abuse, socioeconomic status, intimacy involvement, emotional distress, divorces, criminal activities, and job instability. Although certain pseudomature behaviors consistently had adverse later consequences (early drug initiation to later drug abuse), others had differential impact on adult role functioning based on whether the transition event occurred in isolation (financial autonomy alone had beneficial long-term effects) or whether it was associated with a general lifestyle of pseudomaturity (with overall negative consequences).",

      "title": "Marginalization through social ostracism: Effects of being ignored and excluded",
      "abstract": "Humans rely on social interactions with others to fulfill fundamental social, psychological, and survival needs. These interactions provide basic survival needs for mating, food, and protection, but also provide the higher-order socioeconomic advantages of cooperation and reciprocity. Perhaps most importantly, however, social interactions provide individuals with a sense of belonging and recognition from their mates. Not all social interactions are pleasant, yet they still provide a sense of recognition, and in some cases belonging. For instance, aversive forms of interpersonal interaction such as bullying and overt forms of rejection still provide the individual with a sense of recognition and importance. Others must go out of their ways to bully, to overtly reject, and this expended effort alone is substantiation that one deserves recognition. However, another aversive interpersonal behavior deprives the individual of the sense of recognition and meaning: ostracism. We define ostracism as being ignored and excluded (Williams, 1997, 2001, 2007, 2009). Ostracism can occur through the physical banishment or exile of an individual or group to venues that are separate from the others. In this sense, extreme forms of segregation could be viewed as physical ostracism. Ostracism can also occur without physical separation. When society's actions communicate to individuals or groups that they are psychologically invisible and inaudible to the larger society, they become socially ostracized. By being marginalized in this way, they have no measurable impact on their society. They are not recognized, nor do they have voice.",

Involvement in treatment of the whole original family might therefore be considered a logical approach, if this were either possible or practicable. Rarely, however, is this the case, save when the patient happens to be a child or adolescent. On the whole, mental hospitals and psychiatric units are populated by adults, many of whom, voluntarily or otherwise, have gained a considerable degree of physical independence from their first families. Many too have already committed themselves to a second family. In these cases the selection of a spouse has often been determined by unconscious pathological needs and expectations, resulting in a ‘neurotic’ object choice, and an unsuccessful ‘sick’ marriage. Thus the second family can frequently be seen as a precipitating factor in the development of mental illness, although not ultimately as causative in the true sense of the word.",

      "abstract": "Certain common features emerging during the therapy of a number of children in care have suggested that it would be helpful to direct attention to the appearance of markedly precocious or perverse sexuality as a significant feature of a child's relationships and activities. In these ways it can be recognised as a precursor of the disturbances of sexuality which have been more commonly studied as manifestations of adult emotional life. From the beginning of life physiological growth and functioning can be seen as interrelating with the growth of personality, sensory and sensual experience with infantile 'pre-genital' sexuality, and all linking in many complex ways with the development of character traits and personal relationships. Whereas infantile sexuality is characterised as being experimental and imitative in terms of phantasies about the parental relationship, and predominantly masturbatory in aim, adult sexuality is envisaged as essentially creative and reciprocal.",

Using findings from our own research programmes we show that schadenfreude is intensified when people are chronically or momentarily threatened in their self-worth, whereas it is attenuated when their self-evaluation is boosted; that malicious envy, but not benign envy, intensifies pleasure at the misfortunes of others; that these emotional responses are manifested in intergroup contexts via the same mechanisms; and that mere stereotypes, in the absence of any interaction or overt competition, are sufficient to elicit schadenfreude via such mechanisms. Together, these findings suggest that self-evaluation and envy both play an important role in evoking schadenfreude; people feel pleasure at the misfortunes of others when these misfortunes provide them with social comparisons that enhance their feelings of self-worth or remove the basis for painful feelings of envy.",

However, alienation is suffered, loneliness is dreaded, ostracism and isolation are borne with resignation or panic, while privacy is sought after. The case for reducing privacy to some other less desired or actually averted condition is apt to be especially compelling in a social order which grounds self-definition in human relationships and interactions. The case for reducing privacy to some other condition has been argued along two lines. First, privacy may be interpreted as a fall from the primal condition of social communion or personal wholeness. Second, privacy may be interpreted as an anonymity which allows a person to escape from his social responsibilities. Again privacy is evil and its pursuit as a good a rationalization. The most striking aspect of the two arguments for depreciating privacy is the fact that they conceal theoretical interpretations of human nature.",

      "title": "Some Relations Between The Negative Oedipus Complex And Aggression In The Male",
      "abstract": "The conflictual problems that accompany the Oedipus complex, in both its positive and negative (normal and inverted) forms, have long been recognized. It has also been well established that normal and pathological identifications derive from bisexual tendencies and from the complications of early life experiences that reinforce love or hate toward father and mother respectively. In the male, two mechanisms that can operate to bring about a predominant feminine identification and hence a negative or inverted Oedipus complex have been described. First, there is that of a primary identification with the mother, and the seeking of the father as object, with castration anxiety as a consequence. Alternatively, the sequence has been considered to involve positive oedipal wishes with mother as object; accompanying castration anxiety based on expectation of punishment; submission in a negative oedipal position as an attempted defense, only serving, however, to reinforce castration anxiety; and ultimately, a reversion to reactive aggression against the father. The links between unconscious homosexuality and paranoia in light of the foregoing dynamics have been indicated. The influence of preoedipal experience has long been presumed, though not systematically traced. With the advance of understanding of the earliest phases of childhood development, further clarification has become possible. Several factors are discussed in this paper, with illustrative clinical material. Included are the parental roles in perpetuating infantile conflicts of each libidinal phase, and in progression from symbiosis to successful separation-individuation. The resultant difficulties in ego development and in the establishment of mature object relations are described. The subsequent problems in mastering the tasks of the oedipal phase are detailed, showing the effects in terms of alternating positive and negative oedipal strivings. The adolescent-phase struggles are touched on, including the unrealistic ego-ideal structuring based on the negative oedipal stresses. Finally, the relation between unconscious homosexuality, beating fantasies, and paranoia is discussed, with the implications regarding aggression and its effects on psychopathology.",

Before them lies mental despair,—even insanity and suicide,—at the very least, nervous disease; behind them, shame, loss of position, etc. It cannot be doubted that, under these circumstances, states of necessity and compulsion may be created by the unfortunate natural disposition and constitution.

      "title": "Resilience",
      "abstract": "Resilience is the capacity to maintain stable levels of functioning, as well as positive emotions and generative experiences, following or under conditions of significant adversity. Resilience researchers have largely focused on two broad types of adversity: (1) acute and time-limited events that are outside the range of ordinary experience, such as physical or sexual assault, traumatic injury, disease, natural disaster, mass casualty events, war, and interpersonal loss; and (2) chronic enduring stressors, usually experienced in childhood, such as neglect, socioeconomic disadvantage, oppressive political conditions, and physical or mental abuse. Although these two types of adversity necessarily entail different methods and theoretical frameworks, research findings from both literatures have converged on a common conclusion: resilience is common, even under the most extreme adversity. The empirical study of psychological resilience as such is a relatively recent phenomenon—until about thirty-five years ago it drew almost no serious scientific attention. Recently, however, the resilience literature has burgeoned at an exceptional rate. Unfortunately, the study of resilience has been plagued by definitional controversies and methodologically uninformative research. One important cleavage concerns the way resilience is defined and measured. A substantial body of research defines resilience as a personality construct; another literature insists that resilience is defined as an outcome (or process) in response to the experience of significant adversity. Although both approaches have produced relevant and informative research, it is worth noting that, in sheer volume, most resilience research is now devoted to the personality-as-resilience approach. Because these studies often do not study reactions to a marker event, rely exclusively on self-report scales, and employ cross-sectional designs, they are usually (but not always) of inferior methodological quality. Consistent with the suggestions of a number of scholars, this latter approach is described here as “resiliency,” not resilience. Although this bibliography includes high-quality studies that define resilience as a personality construct, most of the research and scholarship listed here operationally defines resilience as an outcome or process that unfolds following acute adversity or during chronic forms of adversity.",

In the intervening decades, research has shown that although essentialism sometimes leads to prejudicial beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, it does not always, sometimes even leading to decreased prejudice toward stigmatized groups. The relation between essentialism and prejudice is clearly complex, but this review proposes four questions that will help clarify how and when essentialism leads to prejudice: (1) What precisely is essentialism and how might a more nuanced understanding of its components and structure shed light on the mechanisms by which essentialist beliefs contribute to prejudice?; (2) Do essentialist beliefs orient group-based prejudice toward out-groups or toward stigmatized groups, and what are the consequences of essentialist beliefs among those with minoritized identities?; (3) Do essentialist beliefs engender group-based prejudice directly, or must essentialist beliefs interact with additional information or belief systems to lead to negative consequences?; and (4) Do essentialist beliefs lay a foundation for group-based prejudice to develop, or is essentialism strategically invoked to justify existing prejudice? By posing these questions, describing what is currently known about each, and proposing future lines of inquiry that focus on the importance of including participants from a diverse set of backgrounds and across developmental periods, this review aims to stimulate research studies best designed to fill the gaps in our knowledge. By understanding how and when essentialism contributes to prejudice, we will be better equipped to use this early-emerging, but malleable, aspect of cognition to decrease prejudice and create a more equitable society.",

      "title": "Loneliness and abuse as risk factors for suicide in older adults: new developments and the contribution of the <scp>WPA</scp> Section on Old Age Psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Suicide is a major public health problem, with 817,000 cases worldwide in 2016. The incidence is highest in those aged 70 years or older, among both men and women, in almost all regions of the world1. Effective interventions that mitigate iden­tified risk factors and sustain protective fac­tors are relevant across all age groups, but re­search specifically focused on suicide pre­vention in older adults is still in its early stag­es. The evidence on the effectiveness of suicide prevention interventions for older adults remains limited. The International Association for Suicide Prevention Interest Group on Suicide in Old Age2 recommended multi-component approaches, based on the available scientific evidence, with an organized system of distribution of resources and the monitoring of the effectiveness of each intervention. Loneliness occurs when a person feels disconnected from his/her closest social circle: partners, family members, peers, friends and significant others. It often affects older adults, particularly men when single, widowed or divorced3. It may result from the loss of an important intimate relationship or a social role that previously used to give a person his/her sense of self-esteem and dignity. In case of negative life events or other psychological stressful situations, when the person has nobody to share his/her feelings with, loneliness can have particularly negative consequenc­es. This, in combination with other risk factors, can lead to an increase of the risk for suicidal behaviour. A particular expression of loneliness among older adults is the fact that suicides more often occur when the person is alone at home4. The consequences of the COVID-19 pan­demic have resulted in new challenges for older adults, and we are just beginning to see the effects on morbidity, mortality and suicide rates worldwide5. Many government policies to tackle the pandemic that include social isolation, lockdown and social distancing have resulted in increased distress in older adults. We therefore need to develop strong primary care and commu­nity assets to support older adults. A rise in suicide deaths in older adults as a result of the pandemic is not inevitable6. The traditional approaches to suicide prevention need to be re-considered7, so that we can develop innovative ways to address this issue in older adults in the new context. The voices of people with lived experience should be heard to inform developments in strategies. Previous traumatic experiences (e.g., history of abuse during childhood, loss of a parent) can have consequences in later life and be associated with increased likelihood of suicidal behaviour. But present traumatic experiences may also increase the risk for suicide. According to the World Health Organization, around 1 in 6 older people experienced some form of abuse in the past year8. However, the prevalence rates reported in existing population-based elder abuse studies likely underestimate the true population prevalence. Not only this field of research suffers from methodological and comparability challenges, but elder abuse prevalence surveys also carry substantial participation bias, in that they exclude individuals with cognitive impairment, who could potentially be most vulnerable to abuse, especially in institutions. Older adults with mental health problems are at high risk for abuse. There are many forms of elder abuse, including psychological, physical, sexual, financial and social abuse, as well as neglect and abandonment. Abuse should never be condoned, whatever the mitigating circumstances. What may not be considered abusive towards a healthy, competent person may be so in a vulnerable older adult. This is mainly explained by the high risk of older adults to be dependent (financially, emotionally, physically) from the persons who perpetrate acts of violence, abuse or neglect against them. Each form of elder abuse represents a risk factor for suicide. Several psychosocial risk factors found in severely abused older adults are also frequently present in older adults who attempted or completed suicide. Abused older adults have been paid inadequate attention in suicide prevention efforts. This omission must be remedied, as the aged global population will dramatically increase in coming decades, which, in the absence of meaningful preventive efforts, may drive a sharp rise in the incidence of older adults' abuse and suicide9. Help to establish strong social relationships and an effective legal frame to protect the individual against any form of violence are common protective factors against suicide. However, in the case of older adults, we should recognize that efforts to sustain these protective factors have been weaker than for the younger population. Considering the high potential of loneliness as a risk factor for suicide, the WPA Section on Old Age Psychiatry has supported the establishment of an End Loneliness Day. The Section is also going to become partner of the Campaign to End Loneliness. Having the friendship and support we need is a fundamental part of our well-being. When loneliness becomes entrenched in later life, it can be hardest to overcome. The campaign aims to involve academics, front-line practitioners, decision-makers and businesses (see https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org). Considering that all forms of elder a­buse are a violation of basic human rights, the WPA Section on Old Age Psychiatry is contributing to the effort to develop a new United Nations Convention on the Rights of Older Persons. A first action was a webinar organized in collaboration with the International Psychogeriatric Association on December 10, 2020, on the occasion of the Human Rights Day. The Section also organized an intersectional symposium on Threats to the Dignity of Older Adults with Mental Disorders during COVID-19 Pandemic within the 2020 WPA Thematic Meeting on Intersectional Collaboration. A Position Statement on Human Rights and Mental Health of Older Adults is now in preparation.",

However, jealousy, verbal fighting, and problems regarding sexual access are commonly identified as precipitators of violence, and may be considered risk markers. This study of dating problems (\"discontents\" and \"dilemmas\") in samples of high school and college students reveals very low rates of voluntary mention of violent activity in dating, but much higher rates of voluntary mention of its precipitators.

      "title": "Marital Problems of the Middle Aged Group",
      "abstract": "Very frequently the psychiatrist is confronted in his practice with having to deal with marital difficulties that occur during the climacteric and post-climacteric age in marriages that, until then, seem to have been more or less reasonably satisfactory. In many cases, these difficulties are not very serious though troublesome; enough to make the relationship between the spouses unpredictable and shaky. In others, however, the marital relationships are completely disrupted, misunderstanding between husband and wife is complete, every constructive communication and intimacy disappears and they feel that no way out is left for them but separation or divorce, that when really accomplished proves practically always to be catastrophic for both. On the basis of clinical observation, the author tries to show how these difficulties are the expression of inability, in varying degrees, of the ego in both spouses in facing and/or solving successfully the crisis of the typical nuclear conflict of this stage of life: “generativity vs. stagnation”. As a result, a regression occurs that manifests itself in a great impairment and impoverishment of interpersonal relationships and a lack of mutuality. In the individual one observes a diminishing of productivity that often leads him to anger and despair.",

      "abstract": "Failing to recognize someone or misidentifying someone can have important personal and social consequences. The perceiver may suffer feelings of embarrassment or stupidity. The target may feel insulted, stereotyped, or in extreme cases may be falsely identified as a criminal. If the perceiver and the target are of different ethnic groups, misidentification can increase intergroup hostility, stereotyping, and intergroup anxiety. Laboratory and field research demonstrates an own‐race bias in recognition accuracy. People are better able to identify members of their own race than members of another race. The significance of own‐race bias in the criminal justice system and intergroup contact situations is reviewed, and cognitive and motivational correlates of own‐race bias are discussed. Four possible explanations for this differential recognition effect are presented. The explanation derived from intergroup contact theory—that differential recognition stems from limited experience with members of other groups—has received surprisingly weak research support thus far, Greater attention to assessing different types of contact may increase our understanding of the ways in which intergroup contact can affect intergroup perceptions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infidelity means having any secret emotional, sexual, virtual relationship, or a combination of them outside the marital relationship. Infidelity has a significant prevalence as one of the major reasons of divorce, which causes psychological traumas in victims. Various studies in different cultures have revealed that extramarital affairs in each culture can have different meanings and, consequently, different effects, but what is obvious is that extramarital affairs in any form (emotional, sexual, online, or a combination) as a stressful event have detrimental effects on the family unit and various dimensions of victim’s and his/her spouse’s mental health. Research has shown that infidelity has many psychological effects on its victims. Affective experiences and reactions, cognitive experiences and reactions, psychosomatic and physical experiences and reactions, communication experiences and reactions, as well as spiritual experiences and reactions are among the psychological reactions and complex problems encountered by the victims. If the victims of infidelity are not treated, harmful consequences can last for a long time. Moreover, experts have acknowledged that couples involved in infidelity can be helped out. In this report, in addition to presenting the effects and psychological consequences of infidelity, effective factors for the treatment of these clients are discussed.",

If the couple learns attitudes and skills of intimacy, nondemand pleasuring, and multiple stimulation, these will hopefully inoculate them against sexual difficulties with age. Cognitions about being an intimate team, accepting variability in individual and couple sexual expression, and setting realistic expectations are crucial to prevent relapse.",

      "abstract": "The idea of reincarnation is presented as having considerable explanatory value for several features of human personality and biology that currently accepted theories do not adequately clarify. Reincarnation is not offered as a substitute for present knowledge derived from genetics and understanding of environmental influences; it may, however, usefully supplement such knowledge. The present paper does not present evidence from cases suggestive of reincarnation. It does, however, cite cases of subjects who have claimed to remember previous lives, most of whose statements have been verified in the course of detailed investigations. For each case, a reference is provided to a detailed published case report furnishing the evidence in that case. The idea of reincarnation may contribute to an improved understanding of such diverse matters as: phobias and philias of childhood; skills not learned in early life; abnormalities of child-parent relationships; vendettas and bellicose nationalism; childhood sexuality and gender identity confusion; birthmarks, congenital deformities, and internal diseases; differences between members of monozygotic twin pairs; and abnormal appetites during pregnancy. Empirical studies of cases of the reincarnation type have so far not provided any evidence that justifies using reincarnation as an explanation for the occurrence of child prodigies or the large inequities in socioeconomic conditions of humans at birth.",

Further hypothesized as secondary causes of premarital anxieties were interaction style, orientations towards relationships and past relationship experiences. These hypotheses were tested with questionnaire data from 364 never-married, college undergraduates regarding their anxieties about the institution of marriage. Factor analysis and scale validity tests verified the existence of a marriage-anxiety syndrome composed of three substructures: security, fulfilment and excitement. Security and excitement anxieties were interpreted as reflecting serious doubts about being able to have both security and excitement in the same relationship. Fulfilment anxieties were interpreted as being due to realistic expectations, modern marriage needs or romanticism. However, very little support was found for linking premarital anxieties with interaction style, relationship orientations or past experiences.",

Neither necessary nor sufficient conditions can be synthesized from the risk factors identified from psychological analyses. Furthermore, the involvement of mother-fetus interactions cannot result only from psychology causes in the mother. Although instructive, the few available evolutionary and systemic explanations proposed remain insufficient. This article synthesizes and extends previous knowledge within a systemic model which is fully compatible with clinical observations. Methods: A systemic intrapersonal conflict theory opposing primitive, evolutionary-inherited forces to psycho-sociological forces embodied across individual’s childhood is developed. Results: As members of a social species, human beings have a dual character of independent organisms and of social group members that is a source of customized intrapersonal conflicts.

As long as the woman’s brain is unable to renounce one option in favor of the other, denial of pregnancy offers a standby-in-tension means to postpone conflict resolution. It may thus be considered as temporarily adaptive response. Conclusions: The proposed systemic psycho-evolutionary explanation of denial of pregnancy is fully consistent with clinical observations.

      "abstract": "Increasing use of internet has numerous reflections on relationships. Within the range of chatroom friendship and flirting to shared sexuality, cybersex addiction and criminal behaviours are among the most intriguing. Searching for sexual satisfaction on internet may have a number of functions such as decreasing anxiety and distress; expressing emotions such as loneliness, depression, anger and disappointment; or providing support to not being able to judge the level of intimacy in a realtionship. The incredible ease with which one obtains sexual content on the internet, at home, at the work place or even through mobile phones is one of the most important reason for its widespread prevalence. Another important allure of the cybersex is its anonimity, the relative ease to disguise normally disturbing characteristics and its being mostly ignored by others. It is also low-cost. On the other hand it causes increased social isolation, damages trust in relationships, and causes the individual to seek for help due to dramatic consequences following a period of virtual mirroring, when the feeling of finding a soulmate causes mutual adoration and idealization. This review examines the definition of infidelity in the context of internet use, its characteristics, types and various aspects; its negative consequences on relationships; its effects on couples and families; and treatment alternatives. The problems caused by increasing compulsivity of cybersex are also highlighted.",

      "title": "Adopting a Stigmatized Label: Social Determinants of Identifying as an Atheist beyond Disbelief",
      "abstract": "An individual's identity may not appear to correspond to his or her beliefs and behaviors. Such incongruence may be particularly likely when an identity is stigmatized. We examine this dynamic in the context of atheists. Being an atheist has often been equated with stating a disbelief in God, but this ignores the distinct phenomenon of identifying as an atheist. This study asks what influences the likelihood that an individual will identify as an atheist beyond saying that he or she does not believe in God. Drawing upon research examining the social dynamics of stigma and identity, we hypothesize that having close friends who are atheists will support an individual's own adoption of the atheist label. On the other hand, we hypothesize that the presence of other stigmatized or at least competing identities, beliefs, and behaviors will serve as a barrier to an individual's adoption of the atheist label. These expectations are largely supported in an analysis of unique survey data offering separate measures of atheist self-identification and belief in God. This study provides a framework for future research to examine these dynamics in the context of other identities, particularly those that are stigmatized.",

      "abstract": "In article author discussed results of research on the basis of the data obtained during social and psychological research of an index of vital style of the child in a family. During adaptation, both at stable, and at unstable families the mismatch of requirements for certain spheres of family life takes place: at stable couples it insignificant, at unstable considerable. This insignificant divergence at stable couples gives them opportunity of gradual development and improvement of the relations. Young families are very unstable educations, feelings to the spouse bear both powerful positive, and a negative charge (ambivalence of feelings is great). For many families extremes in behaviour and in feelings are also characteristic. Constant life near other person inevitably leads to accumulation of disagreements, tantrums and the conflicts. All couples face troubles in the course of marriage: all happens sometimes painfully, sometimes people are disappointed and don't understand each other. The love cools down, dies away or disappears; about it forget, in its revival any more don't believe. Without love the happiness of family life, satisfaction with marriage disappears. In case of a conscious dissatisfaction there is usually open recognition by the spouse of that the family relations don't satisfy it. The instruction on global character of a dissatisfaction that family life doesn't conform even to the most minimum requirements thus is indicative. The conscious dissatisfaction is quite often accompanied by the conflict between spouses. Otherwise «the smoldering dissatisfaction» acts. The spouse expresses relative satisfaction with family life. The true dissatisfaction comes to light an indirect way. First, through expression of feelings and states: monotony, boredom, dullness of life. Secondly, the dissatisfaction appears in numerous complaints to various private parties of family life. The dissatisfaction, quarrels, the conflicts inevitably lead changes in behaviour, character and attitude of spouses. Thus, the considered features of a modern matrimony and family relationship show a wide palette of the determinant, defining matrimonial satisfaction with marriage both providing formation and development of intra family relationship and influence on vital style of the child in a family. The psychologist participates in inspection addressed in the health Center within complex screening inspection, applying a hardware-software complex for screening assessment of level of psycho physiological and somatic health, functional and adaptive reserves of an organism with a set of the equipment for measurement of parameters of physical development which includes: personal computer; complex software. Within complex inspection research of married couples on a technique «LSI questionnaire (an index of vital style)» is conducted. The obtained data allowed to draw a conclusion on inability of a modern family to provide realization of satisfaction of vital style in a modern family.",

Method : This qualitative study with a conventional content analysis was conducted in 2014 and 2015 wherein 26 Iranian married men and women were individually interviewed. Results: Sexual talk with the spouse is the conversation about planning, performance and evaluation of sexual relationship that leads to sexual agreement, intimacy, resolving the existing problems and greater sexual compatibility and satisfaction of the couple. Sexual talk should be romantic, pacific, clear, continuous, with admiration and without shame, sarcasm, anger, comparison, reproach. Couples can express their views about the partner's sexual behavior, but expressing partner's incurable physical problems is not helpful. Shyness, fear of being stigmatized as impolite and promiscuous, fear of being rejected or breaking pride, to expect the spouse to read minds, lack of opportunities, presence of children and failing to receive sexual conversation skills from adolescent are among the main barriers against sexual talk with the spouse conclousion : Sexual talk with the spouse is necessary throughout the marital life: During the early days of marriage, in order to attain initial sexual coordination and agreement and to avoid early divorce and after several years of marriage, in order to give variety and freshness in relationship and to resolve the problems.

      "title": "SHAME AND ANGER CONTROL AS MEDIATORS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE AND PERPETRATION OF TEEN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE",
      "abstract": "OF THE THESIS Shame and Anger Control as Mediators in the Relationship between Childhood Sexual Abuse and Perpetration of Teen Relationship Violence by Jamie Lynn Kissee Master of Arts in Psychology San Diego State University, 2012 Teen relationship violence (TRV) is defined as physical, sexual, or psychological/emotional abuse within a relationship. There are many risk factors that can lead to the perpetration of TRV; one of these is childhood sexual abuse (CSA). CSA is defined as any interaction between a child and an adult (or another child) in which the child is used for sexual stimulation of the perpetrator or an observer. Past research has provided evidence that CSA is a significant predictor of TRV, however, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not well understood. One possible explanation accounting for this relationship may employ the construct of shame. Shame as a personal trait is defined by the characterization that the self is fundamentally bad. It is a global experience in that the self is the problem, not the object or event that may have triggered these feelings. Past research has provided evidence for the “shame-rage spiral” theory in which shame can produce feelings that result in aggression and defensiveness in order for the individual to regain feelings of self-worth and control. Therefore, a related pathway that may help explain the relationship between CSA and TRV is through the inability to control one’s anger, termed anger control. The current study assessed inner-city high school adolescents in San Diego County. The sample consisted of a total of 153 students including 131 female students and 22 male students. Mediation was analyzed by testing four regressions and each indirect effect of shame and anger control in the relationship between CSA and the perpetration of TRV. Although there were no specific hypotheses about victimization, the same models were tested using dating violence victimization in place of dating violence perpetration as exploratory analyses. There was partial support for the hypotheses tested. CSA significantly predicated shame and shame significantly predicted the perpetration of TRV. Lastly, the final regression indicated that shame is a partial mediator between CSA and perpetration of TRV. The same pattern held for the exploration of dating violence victimization. Namely, regressions revealed a relationship between CSA and the victimization of TRV as well as the relationship between shame and the victimization of TRV. Sobel tests of the indirect effect further provided support for presence of shame as a partial mediator of the relationship between CSA and dating violence. Regression analyses did not provide support for anger control as a mediator between CSA and TRV. An alternative statistical technique (structural equation modeling) was also used to test the shame and anger control mediation models. However, none of the models fit well according to the model fit indices, but the results of the SEM analyses are inconclusive due to low statistical power for this type of analysis. This study provided further evidence for the main effect from past literature of a strong relationship vi between CSA and the perpetration and victimization of TRV, and additionally, provided some support for the hypothesis that shame helps to explain a significant portion of both these relationships. This study provides new insight into how shame results from CSA and can lead to maladaptive behaviors, such as perpetration or revictimization in adolescent relationships, that should be explored further in future studies.",

      "title": "Accommodation Processes During the Early Years of Marriage",
      "abstract": "Sometimes married life is blissful – intimacy and companionship are easy, feelings of trust and commitment are strong, partners treat one another with love and consideration, and the marriage seems indestructible. Unfortunately, many couples encounter periods when life is not so easy – times when intimacy and companionship are hard work at best, good times are a distant memory, trust and commitment are sorely strained, and the marriage verges on collapse. Much of married life unfolds in a middle ground between these extremes, in a state where good times are punctuated by dissatisfying incidents of greater or lesser intensity. The manner in which couples negotiate this intermediate state appears to be crucial to maintaining a long-term, enduring marriage. This chapter deals with one important feature of the \"middle ground\" of marriage by analyzing an interaction phenomenon termed accommodation. Interaction sequences involving accommodative behavior are initiated when one partner engages in a potentially destructive act, such as behaving in a thoughtless manner, saying hurtful things, yelling at the partner, or worse. Accommodation refers to an individual's willingness, when the partner has enacted a potentially destructive behavior, to (a) inhibit impulses to react destructively in turn and (b) instead behave in a constructive manner.",

It is empirically linked with sexual offending against children: Child pornography offenders and sex offenders with child victims are more likely to be pedophiles based on self-report or objective measures of sexual interests. At the same time, some pedophiles have not had any known sexual contact with children, and perhaps half of sex offenders against children would not meet diagnostic criteria for pedophilia. Pedophilia can be diagnosed using a variety of methods and is an important factor to consider in the assessment of sex offenders because pedophilic offenders are more likely to sexually reoffend and require different interventions. There is no evidence to suggest that pedophilia can be changed. Instead, interventions are designed to increase voluntary control over sexual arousal, reduce sex drive, or teach self-management skills to individuals who are motivated to avoid acting upon their sexual interests.",

      "abstract": "Violence is nothing more than the intentional use of physical force by people with the aim of causing harm to other living beings or to material goods that manifests itself through injury, pain, disability, damage, death. The World Health Organization shows that violence is \"the intentional use of physical force or power - threatened or actual - against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in physical harm, death, psychological suffering, impaired development or deprivation\" (World Health Organization, 2015). It follows from this definition that violence is not limited to obvious physical aggression. It includes subtle and systemic forms of exercising power. Violence causes psychological trauma, economic inequality and/or social marginalization. Intention is the essential element, the fundamental distinction between an act of violence and an accidental event lies in the will or conscious acceptance of the risk that harm may be caused. Even in the absence of immediate bodily harm, violence has serious consequences, lasting consequences on physical, mental and social health (Krug et al., 2002).",

The woman sometimes responds calmly, trying to de-escalate the situation or she may attempt to defend her position in the relationship. They may both attempt to rationalize away his behavior as stress reactions related to work or finances, etc. Often the woman believes her adapting behavior will act to control his violence. This tension building phase time lapse varies greatly from the relationship to relationship. For some it may be days or weeks, for others there may be years of tension building between acute incidents. As the tension builds, her coping skills may become less and less effective at protecting herself or de-escalating the tension. It is during this phase that women will often reach out for help or support since they are aware of the increasing danger. Other than services designed for battered women, many community services do not recognize her need at this stage since there is not “evidence of violence.”",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have found that shame increases individuals' anger at others. However, according to recent theories about the social function of shame and anger at others, it is possible that shame controls individuals' anger at others in specific conditions. We replicated previous findings that shame increased individuals' anger at others' unfairness, when others were not aware of the individual's experience of shameful events. We also found for the first time that shame controlled or even decreased individuals' anger at others' unfairness, when others were aware of the individual's experience of shameful events. The results were consistent when shame was induced by either a recall paradigm or an imagination paradigm, and in either the ultimatum game or the dictator game. This suggests that shame strategically controls individuals' anger at others to demonstrate that they are willing to benefit others, when facing the risk of social exclusion. Our findings highlight the interpersonal function of shame and deepen the understanding of the relationship between shame and anger at others.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe roots of deviance are often sought in the family of origin, and the families of male heroin addicts have not escaped such attention. (See Seldin, 1972, for a review of this literature.) A composite picture derived from the previously reported findings summarized in Table 1 suggests that the addict's mother is typically the dominant and pathological parent, while the father is either weak or absent. Yet it is usually the mother who is seen in positive terms by the addict himself, and the father who is viewed negatively. Presumably in many cases the addict simply accepts his mother's negative view of his father. Some common consequences of this family situation have been reported: (1) the addict's mother may depreciate her son because she sees him as like her husband, and the addict may incorporate his mother's negative appraisal into his self-concept; (2) the addict may experience unusual difficulty in achieving independence from his mother; (3) when he does, he may then select a similarly deviant woman for a mate; and (4) both wife and mother may unconsciously attempt to perpetuate the addict's drug use.",

The extent to which individuals experience anxiety about or avoidance of intimacy can impact how they perceive and respond to relationship conflict, which can powerfully predict relationship satisfaction and longevity. Both attachment anxiety and avoidance are associated with problematic conflict resolution strategies but in different ways and to different degrees. Whereas anxious adults may perceive benign or ambiguous behaviors as threatening, engage in more aggressive partner blaming, and experience lower levels of empathy, avoidant adults may withdraw from conflict, inhibiting open communication and compromise. Gender also emerges as a moderator between attachment style and conflict dynamics, although the patterns are not consistent across studies. New research areas focus on physiological underpinnings of attachment, and the role that new media (e.g., Facebook) plays in reproducing or exacerbating attachment dynamics.",

      "title": "Anger in Relation to Alienation in Young Adults of Punjab",
      "abstract": "Anger is defined as a natural and mature emotion. It is one of the natural ways to express negative feelings yet excessive anger may cause various kinds of bio-psycho-social problems in an individual. It is known to be associated with blood pressure, family discord, difficult in thinking, and impaired mental health. Anger is often associated with suspicion and mistrust, and can manifest itself in feelings of hostility, frustration, exasperation and even fury(Watson, 2011). Anger is an emotion that strikes all people at one time or another. It is crucial to focus on how one manages the felt anger so that its impact may be monitored. The impact may be at the personal level when the individual indulges in binged eating as a result of being angry, yet there are others who refuse to eat when they are angry. Similarly, when overwhelmed by anger the interpersonal reactions may not be appropriate wherein some refuse to talk when angry while others experience a decrease in their frustration tolerance and engage in verbal battles. The way one reacts to anger, however, is more important than whether one becomes angry frequently. People often respond violently and uncontrollably to anger. A healthier approach to this emotion is to examine and attempt to resolve the underlying issues that led to the anger in the first place. In either case, the angry individual may experience Alienation. is the process whereby people become foreign to the world they are living in. In other words it is the estrangement of the self from the society as a whole. It is a state in which an individual feels relatively powerless, norm less, cynical, meaningless, dissatisfied and develops a sense of loss of relationships with others. Alienation is a word that describes what happens when one does something, or says something, that separates them from the crowd. One becomes separated from family or friends, for whatever reasons and is no longer welcome in their close circle. The word is usually used in reference to a bad situation (Ryan, 2008). The body mass index is a measure of body weight relative to height that is associated with body fat and health risk. It was developed in mid 1800's by Belgian mathematician named Adolpehe Quetelet. It is equal to weight in kilograms, divided by height in meter square. It is the measure which describes the healthy range of weight in the context of the individuals' height, age, and gender. Individuals who are fat tend to avoid company and being self conscious of their weight may feel alienated from those around them as the current socio-cultural expectation of smartness is not obesity. Yet it is believed that fat people are more jovial and far from being irritable.Hence the current study was planned to explore the same in young adults of Punjab region, where the population is known to be gregarious, outspoken with low threshold for anger outbursts; yet very high on emphasis on fatty foods.Aim of the studyThe aim of the current investigation was to study anger in relation to alienation and BMI, also referring to the socio-demographic variables.Hypotheses of the studyThe following hypothesis were proposed in the current study* There would be a positive relationship between anger and alienation.* There would be a negative relationship between anger and BMI.* There would be a positive relationship between BMI and alienation.* There would be gender differences in the variables under study.MethodThe research was performed by using standardized psychological measures on a sample of 70 individuals as described below.ParticipantsThe total sample was 70 which included 35 males and 35 females from age group of 18 to 25years. These individuals were post graduates belonging to different parts of Punjab.InstrumentsFor the purpose of current study the following tools were used to assess the participants on the variables under investigation. …",

      "abstract": "Is the child reared by one parent at risk for psychological maladjustment? Four decades of research have not provided conclusive information. Design errors include poor control over extraneous natural covariates of family type, particularly socioeconomic status; unrepresentative samples; and invalid dependent measures. Conceptual blind spots include equation of conventional with healthy behavior and failure to anticipate either developmental lag or beneficial effects among children reared by one parent. Should findings of no difference attributable to number of parents and cause qf parent absence continue to result from well-controlled studies, the hypothesis of risk among children with one parent will have to be judged without empirical support.",

      "abstract": "There is little consensus on the extent to which psychiatric disorders or syndromes are universal or the extent to which they differ on their core definitions and constellation of symptoms as a result of cultural or contextual factors. This controversy continues due to the lack of biological markers, imprecise measurement and the lack of a gold standard for validating most psychiatric conditions.Empirical studies were used to present evidence in favor of or against a universalist or relativistic view of child psychiatric disorders using a model developed by Robins and Guze to determine the validity of psychiatric disorders.The prevalence of some of the most common specific disorders and syndromes as well as its risk and protective factors vary across cultures, yet comorbid patterns and response to treatments vary little across cultures. Cross-cultural longitudinal data on outcomes is equivocal.The cross-cultural validity of child disorders may vary drastically depending on the disorder, but empirical evidence that attests for the cross-cultural validity of diagnostic criteria for each child disorder is lacking. There is a need for studies that investigate the extent to which gene-environment interactions are related to specific disorders across cultures. Clinicians are urged to consider culture and context in determining the way in which children's psychopathology may be manifested independent of their views. Recommendations for the upcoming classificatory system are provided so that practical or theoretical considerations are addressed about how culture and ethnic issues affect the assessment or treatment of specific disorders in children.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide, children can be found who reported that they have memories of a previous life. More than 2,500 cases have been studied and their specifications have been published and preserved in the archives of the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia (United States). Many of those children come from countries where the majority of the inhabitants believe in reincarnation, but others come from countries with different cultures and religions that reject it. In many cases, the revelations of the children have been verified and have corresponded to a particular individual, already dead. A good number of these children have marks and birth defects corresponding to wounds on the body of his previous personality. Many have behaviors related to their claims to their former life: phobias, philias, and attachments. Others seem to recognize people and places of his supposed previous life, and some of their assertions have been made under controlled conditions. The hypothesis of reincarnation is controversial. We can never say that it does not occur, or will obtain conclusive evidence that it happens. The cases that have been described so far, isolated or combined, do not provide irrefutable proof of reincarnation, but they supply evidence that suggest its reality.",

Shame emerges as one becomes aware of oneself in relationship to others. This study related individual experiences of shame, inferiority, alienation, self-esteem, and gender to perceptions of equity, intimacy, and competency in marital relations. The study involved a heterogeneous sample of 199 subjects. There were no significant gender-based differences in shame intensity. Intensity of shame was positively correlated with perceptions of complementary and symmetrical marital equity styles and negatively correlated with perceptions of parallel marital equity styles, intimacy, and competency. Alienation was a robust predictor and accounted for more variance than inferiority, self-esteem, or gender in perceptions of marital relationships. Findings suggest that shame is a different experience from low self-esteem and influential in perceptions of marital dynamics.",

      "title": "A Tribute to Adaptability: Mental Illness and Dementia in Intimate Late-Life Relationships",
      "abstract": "In pondering how to conceptualize the challenges that mental illness and dementia pose to intimate relationships, an overwhelming number of permutations and combinations have occurred to me. These are very complex issues, encompassing marital and nonmarital couple relationships, family relationships, samesex relationships, and multigenerational relationships. Some are extremely stable, long relationships, such as fifty- and sixty-year marriages or partnerships. Others are much briefer, such as a second marriage after the death of a spouse in old age. Some relationships have been what I call stable incompatible relationships of long-standing duration, in contrast to the kind of comfortable and rewarding relationship that we prefer to imagine predominantly occurs in our parents' generation. Furthermore, mental illness and dementia affect relationships in rather different ways. Often, mental illness has persisted throughout adulthood (for example, in the case of schizophrenia, manic depression, major depressive disorders), and the relationship has adapted and accommodated through the years. Or not. Aging will present special challenges to those relationships, and to the intimacy that has existed. In contrast, the dementing illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, may occur where there has been no previous serious psychopathology, so the emergence of the illness may cause a departure from the intimacy that had developed over the life of the relationship. Consequently, this paper is a discussion of variability and individual differences. Ultimately, it is also a tribute to the adaptability of the human spirit. In clinical practice, it is important to feel hopeful about a positive outcome, and over the twenty-plus years that I have been in practice, I have found that there is always a way to conceptualize a problem that allows for hope. In order to focus the discussion, I will limit this paper to dyadic relationships: couples, primarily in the context of caregiving. Several principles should be kept in mind when working with older adults. Variability among people increases with age, so it is best to avoid preconceived notions about individuals and their relationships. We like to say that human beings are most like each other at birth and become progressively more varied with each passing year. Second, regardless of whether a relationship looks desirable from some ideal point of view, some part of it has been working for this couple, and whatever that is should be the starting point for any intervention. Third, people vary tremendously in their ability to face the realities of aging, whether it is their own physical aging, health threats, or other threats to continued independence. Where one couple will retire to a life-care community as a way to accept and plan for their future needs, another will be unable to fully accept the possibility that they may well need significant assistance at some time in the future. WHAT IS INTIMACY? A dictionary definition of intimacy is, marked by very close association, contact or familiarity, of a very personal or private nature (Webster's Dictionary, r975). This definition can characterize a wide variety of relationships, from marital to family and friends and includes therapists. Intimacy has been described as having five aspects: commitment, affective intimacy, cognitive intimacy, physical intimacy, and mutuality (Moss and Schwebel, 1993). An element of closeness and self-disclosure in communication is often associated with healthy intimacy (Moss and Schwebel, 1993). In clinical practice, we see a range of abilities to communicate and, particularly, a wide range of self-disclosure in relationships. Further, cultural values are in play, particularly in the population that is now elderly, and many long-term relationships have navigated through troubled waters despite maintaining fairly superficial levels of communication. It is most useful to accept our client's or subject's perception of the success or failure of intimacy as an expression of the relationship that the person has been able to fashion over time. …",

      "abstract": "Sexuality with a disabling disease, or serious disabling or disability: a sensitive subject probably due to the association of the two words: sexuality and disability. The question of the emotional life, the life of a couple, the sexuality of a person living with a disability remains a real social and cultural problem. This necessarily impacts on the people concerned because they are victims of their states of disability. This is a subject that is difficult to address both by the couple, by society and by health professionals. In addition, it should be noted that regardless of their physical or psychological state, their visible or invisible disability, their chronic, serious, rare, disabling or disabling illness, or simply their difference, everyone has their own sexual identity. The feeling of love, the affective life, the sexual life of a person with a disability, their life as a couple, pleasure, do not disappear with the onset of illness or disability, it is accessible to all, disabled, sick, in a couple or single, married or not, all have the right to sexuality, to an emotional life regardless of their physical appearance, their mental handicap or other differences... However, for many people in a situation of disability, living one's sexuality remains a difficult aspect in their life as a couple, or not, or in their daily lives. Disability, whatever its origin, can contribute to the alteration or changes in the sexual life of a lambda individual, thus affecting his sexuality, his sexual pleasure... Health professionals are often confronted with suffering, physical and/or psychological pain. However, even today the question of the fulfillment and sexual serenity of people with disabilities remains a silent subject, an unresolved issue, not popularized, not a priority if I can put it that way, but the question of pleasure sex is often overlooked. It would seem that social representations approach the subject of the affective relationship and the love life of sick or disabled people, their life as a couple, their intimacy as a couple, their affective and love life, as being abnormality in the face of what they consider \"normal\".",

Inappropriate sexual behavior (a common cause of disruption among children who are hospitalized for psychiatric disorders) may be caused either by hypersexuality or by simply ill-regulated behavior: a definition of hypersexuality is proposed that can be applied at the bedside (namely, sexual behaviors or fantasies that have abruptly increased in frequency by comparison with a previous baseline, are of sufficient excessiveness to disrupt expected or usual social, academic, or occupational functioning, or constitute a source of distress), so that this distinction can be made promptly, and we present a differential diagnosis for hypersexuality to direct its evaluation. Virilization does not seem to be a common cause of hypersexuality in children and adolescents, but it should not be overlooked when it does exist.The differential diagnosis of hypersexuality in adults, which we present for comparison, is much larger than it is in children.",

Some cultures implicitly support a man's right to have affairs, or even several wives, while others have a moral stance against infidelity. Severe marital strain may precipitate extra-marital liaisons or affairs. Frequent travel, overwork, sexual difficulty, or accumulating chronic anger all pose different risk factors from those stemming from individual developmental vulnerability. A man or woman using the internet for sexual interest may be spending time on internet sites and finding heterosexual or homosexual internet partners for emotional exchange and/or for internet sex. For one couple, having a normal but oedipally sexualised child will feel like an attack on the same-sex parent, while for another couple the developmental sexualisation of a teenager threatens. Long-standing sexual difficulty or inactivity pose risks. These surface factors then trigger unconscious issues.",

The more widespread issue of prejudice is an individual attitude which may invoke race, but is as likely to be related to some other 'stigma'-generating marker. In normal practice it is unusual to find evidence of discrimination consequent on prejudice in open every-day therapeutic contact between workers/therapists and patients.

      "title": "Life Satisfaction as a Correlate of Death Anxiety among Elderly",
      "abstract": "Aging is a natural phenomenon that refers to changes, which occur during the span and result in differences in structure and function between the youth and the elderly. Traditionally the term has been referred to people who have attained certain age chronologically. Ageing is an inevitable process in which physiological, emotional and mental changes are observed in declining form. It is also known as a closing period of span. It is moving away from more desirable period. Life satisfaction is a sum total of the perception of an individual towards his various aspects of life. It is his in family, society and the environment he lives in. It is a composite measure comprising of physical, mental and social well being as perceived by each individual or by group of individuals. Life satisfaction includes happiness, satisfaction and gratification as health, marriage, family, work, financial situations, belongingness and trust in others. Life satisfaction of an individual is influenced by various factors. Amongst them death anxiety is one of the major influencing factor. Death anxiety (Thantaphobia) refers to fear and apprehension of one's own death. It is the neurotic fear of loss of the self, which, in intense state, parallels feelings of helplessness and depression. Man's awareness of his own death produces anxiety in him. Death anxiety is feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude when one thinks of what happens after death, the process of dying or ceasing to be. The study life satisfaction as a correlate of death anxiety among elderly was conducted on 360 persons (180 males and 180 females) residing in Punjab state. Only those were selected for the sample who were leading a retired life, were not suffering from any deadly disease, living with their spouses and belonged to middle socio economic status families. Socio-Economic Status Scale developed by Bharadwajwas used to assess the socio economic status of the respondents. Death Anxiety scale by Chouhan and Tiwari and Life satisfaction scale by Alam and Shrivastava were used to assess the death anxiety and satisfaction of the respondents respectively. The results revealed that significant differences existed in death anxiety and satisfaction among males and females. A significant and negative correlation between satisfaction and death anxiety was found indicating that with increase in satisfaction there is a decrease in death anxiety.",

      "abstract": "The view that behavioural development is continuous, with the child's state at each point in time influencing future behaviour, has recently been challenged. However, the evidence for radical discontinuities between underlying organisations at different stages varies greatly in character and is often equivocal. Apparent discontinuities may appear for trivial reasons. Furthermore, an unequivocal sudden change in behaviour in the course of development may arise from continuous change at an underlying level of organisation. There need be no straightforward relationship between behaviour and the underlying 'psychological structure'. In addition, the complex interaction between sources of variation, and the existence of negative and positive feedback mechanisms in development, make the effects of a given experience difficult to predict. For these different reasons it is argued that a polarisation of views about whether development is continuous or discontinuous is distracting and liable to impede understanding of developmental processes.",

      "title": "Domestic violence during pregnancy: a neglected and unseen public health problem",
      "abstract": "According to World Health Organisation (WHO), domestic violence (DV) is defined as psychological/emotional, physical, or sexual violence, or threats of physical or sexual violence that are inflicted on a woman by a family member: an intimate male partner, marital/cohabiting partner, parents, siblings, or a person very well known within the family or a significant other (i.e. former partner) when such violence often takes place in the home. Intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence against women are major public health problems and violations of human rights. They result in serious short- and long-term physical, sexual and reproductive, and mental health problems, including increased vulnerability to HIV. Near about 15-71% of women experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives. Violence against women (VAW) affects all phases of lifecycle of a women, as rightly pointed out by WHO, starting from sex selective abortion in prebirth period; female infanticide, female genital mutilation, child marriage or prostitution in childhood; physical, sexual, psychological abuse, rape, sexual harassment, dowry murders, forced pregnancy in adolescence and adulthood period; ending in physical and psychological abuse in elderly.",

      "abstract": "Trust involves making oneself vulnerable to another person with the prospect of receiving some benefit in return. Contemporary theoretical accounts of trust among strangers emphasize its instrumental nature. People are assumed to trust to the extent that they can tolerate the risk and are sufficiently optimistic that their trust will be reciprocated. We describe evidence from laboratory economic games showing that this account empirically fails. Participants often trust even though their risk tolerance and social expectations suggest they should not. We propose, instead, that trust is largely an expressive act. People trust because of dynamics that surround the act itself rather than its potential outcomes. Evidence for the expressive nature of trust comes in two forms. First, studies of the emotions surrounding trust indicate that it is significantly predicted by how people feel about the act itself, not how they feel about its potential outcomes. Second, trust rates rise significantly if people are placed in a relationship with another person, no matter how anonymous, fleeting, or minimal that relationship is – presumably because being placed in a relationship evokes social norms that promote trust. We end our discussion by explaining a curious fact that participants grossly underestimate the trustworthiness of others. We also discuss possible motives for reciprocating trust and questions for future research.",

These risks remain true regardless if the victim is directly or indirectly targeted (as a witness) during the violent episodes. However, these risks are also modulated and moderated by a series of variables, such as the parental emotional and social support, the family’s structural integrity and cohesion and victim’s age and sex.",

Also sexual abuse in children is defined as engaging a child in sexual acts that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the taboos of our society. Sexual abuse may involve direct acts perpetrated against children as well as other non-touching abuses, which include exhibitionism, voyeurism, or the use of children for pornographic purposes.Although precise incidence and prevalence rate data are lacking, sexual abuse of children is common in our country and throughout the world. Child sexual abuse is a universal problem that has frequently passed unrecognized and its victims (both children and perpetrators) untreated. Child sexual abuse results in significant social damage. The physical and psychological consequences of child sexual abuse may result in trauma and has implications throughout the lifespan. Experiencing sexual abuse as a child also has the consequence of contributing to an increased risk of violent victimization, perpetration, self-directed violence and suicide later in life.Despite the importance of the issues, information about sexual abuse in children and amongst adults has not been commonly shared by health professionals. The purpose of this review article is to assist the physician in their investigation of child sexual abuse by exploring the important topics.",

Time is an important factor in the equations linking isolation and loneliness. Townsend has shown that loneliness among the widowed tends to decline with the passage of time. Since isolation and loneliness are usually the product of fundamental changes or processes in the life situation of old person, it would be unrealistic to expect social visiting and support to do more than mitigate these problems in any but the most exceptional cases. Provision for old people in need of social visiting and support is largely piecemeal. The local authority provides support in some crises and caring situations, but in others it seems to be uninformed of the needs of old people, or unable to provide the staff to help.",

Sex of the absent parent was found to be correlated with the type behavior manifested; absence of the father with acting-out and absence of the mother with acting-in behavior. This relationship existed regardless of whether parental absence precipitated the problematic behavior or merely aggravated and caused pre-existing problems to become worse. The propensity of children of absent fathers to act-out and of absent mothers to act-in was shown to be related to whether children were aware of their parents' incarceration. This association was true of those children who were told their parents were in prison but untrue of those offspring who were led to believe that their mother or father was absent for other more socially acceptable reasons.",

      "title": "Predicting and preventing youth violence: understanding and disrupting developmental trajectories and risk",
      "abstract": "The relationship between age and crime is well known and has been documented throughout history. Although different types of offenses tend to peak at different ages, violent and delinquent behaviour typically increase during adolescence and the early years of adulthood, and taper off with advancing age. There also appears to be little specialisation in the types of offenses committed by young people. Young people generally commit a variety of violent and non-violent offenses. In recent years, researchers have begun to explore whether violent and delinquent behaviour in adolescence and young adulthood is part of a general pattern of antisocial and aggressive behaviour that emerges during childhood or whether it is the result of certain personal, situational and environmental factors. Some children, for example, exhibit stubborn, defiant, and disobedient behaviour at very young ages, and progress to mild and eventually more severe forms of aggressive and delinquent behaviour by adolescence and young adulthood. Other children either do not exhibit serious problem behaviour until they reach adolescence or seem to outgrow aggressive behaviour by the time they enter primary school. For violence prevention purposes, it is important to know the extent to which patterns of aggressive and antisocial behaviour in childhood are predictive of violent and delinquent behaviour at later ages and also to know which factors increase or buffer the risk for violent and delinquent behaviours at different ages. Understanding this continuity or change in behaviour during different developmental periods is important for identifying appropriate points for intervention. The purpose of this presentation is, thus, threefold: (1) to describe the developmental pathways of aggressive, violent and delinquent behaviour, (2) to describe the factors that increase or buffer against the risk for violent and delinquent behaviour at different ages and across developmental periods and (3) to discuss the implications of the different patterns of behaviour and risk for designing preventive interventions.",

In a recent national poll, 95 percent of Americans professed a belief in God, and 67 to 75 percent of respondents reported that they pray on a daily basis [1]. Research findings showed that although regular attendance at church was not necessary, a strong personal importance placed on spirituality or religion was most protective against major depression in people who were at high familial risk. Religious beliefs serve an important function in the daily lives and attitudes of most of us. Religious activity embraces beliefs, experiences, and practice. Conversely, a person’s fervent religious practices can also signify other, gloomier facets of his or her mental health. The term used to define such a case is hyperreligiosity in the case of religious beliefs. The question of excess or hyper becomes a factor when the religion begins adversely affecting people’s social behavior and their ability to function rationally. A number of potential genetic and pathophysiological causes of violence and aggression have been investigated over recent years. Research now points to the discovery that impulsive aggression and violence arise as a consequence of defective emotion regulation circuitry in the brain.",

This research investigates how preschoolers weigh these two sources of information when they are in conflict. Children watched as an adult hid a toy in one location. Then the adult told children that the toy was in a different location (i.e. false testimony). When retrieving the toy, 4- and 5-year-olds relied on what they had seen and disregarded the adult's false testimony. However, most 3-year-olds deferred to the false testimony, despite what they had directly observed. Importantly, with a positive searching experience based on what they saw, or with a single prior experience with an adult as unreliable, 3-year-olds subsequently relied on their first-hand observation and disregarded the adult's false testimony. Thus, young children may initially be credulous toward others' false testimony that contradicts their direct observation, but skepticism can develop quickly through experience.",

Representatives samples for research cannot be drawn from members of boy-love organizations. The incidence of violence is very low in pedophile contact with boys. The influence can be strong in lasting relationships; it can be either wholesome or unwholesome. Within a relationship, sex is usually only a secondary element, although it can be important in sexual instruction and education. The impact of the law, the hostility of parents and the problem of teh partners' inequality are discussed.",

      "title": "Psychosocial aspects of sexuality in adolescents with visual impairments",
      "abstract": "According to the ecological model, all sexual activity results from experiences gathered during the biologically based process of socialization. Therefore, analysis of the impact that visual impairment has on the psychosexual functioning of adolescents should consider not only the functional aspect but mainly the sociocultural aspect. Specific upbringing and education conditions in childhood and adolescence (e.g.: compulsory schooling in a special center - often in a live-in environment, parental overprotectiveness, lack of or unadapted sexual education curricula, etc.) may hinder learning of typical interpersonal interaction patterns and delay one’s sexual identification process. The limited range of social experiences may result in a low mentalization of the need, and, in consequence, a lack of its stimulation, which manifests itself, for instance, in a lower frequency of autoerotic behaviors among blind adolescent boys as compared to their nondisabled peers. Moreover, a lowered self-esteem and sense of interpersonal attractiveness relating to the lack of acceptance of one’s disability, awareness of being dependent on others, and negative reactions of people around which are based on false beliefs about blind people’s sexuality can also make it difficult to build close relationships and form emotional and sexual bonds. A review of studies on the sexuality of blind and visually impaired adolescents does not allow unambiguous conclusions to be drawn about the course of this group’s development. The data collected are generally descriptive in nature and do not fully reflect the specificity of sexual functioning in the whole population of adolescents with visual impairments as, frequently, the studies were conducted with small samples and did not take into account different types and severity of visual impairment. Also, discrepancies in the findings relating to individual aspects of psychosexual development may be due to differences in instruments used by researchers as well as to the sociocultural nature of the approach to sexuality that is specific to the country where the study was carried out.",

      "title": "Personality and Interpersonal Characteristics Within Distressed Marriages",
      "abstract": "Considerable research has established that particular partner characteristics have a negative impact upon marital quality and that marital distress often results from the failure of partners to resolve personality differences. This study assessed personality and interpersonal differences related to marital distress within 92 clinical couples. Husbands in marriages of 6 years or less reflected distant, apathetic, hostile, and domineering features, while their wives reflected a greater need for attention and stimulation. Husbands in marriages of 7 years or more reflected greater distant and apathetic, self-focused, hostile, and domineering characteristics, while their wives reported greater passive dependency. The shorter married wives’ and husbands’ marital distress was most strongly associated with their own avoidant and self-defeating characteristics. The longer married wives’ marital distress was associated with their husbands’ dominant and self-involved characteristics. The longer married husbands’ marital distress was most strongly associated with their own dominant and self-centered characteristics, but with none of their wives’ characteristics. Partner ratings supported interpersonal theory expectations that distressed couples would reflect noncomplementary interaction patterns. Marital therapists may increase the likelihood of remediating/preventing marital distress by helping couples to recognize that their own and their partner’s personality traits, and interpersonal styles can be linked to marital distress, that these links seemingly differ for males and females, and that these links are likely to change over the marital life cycle.",

      "title": "Hubungan Antara Konsep Diri dengan Depresi Wanita Dewasa yang Mengalami Putus Cinta",
      "abstract": "Depresi dapat menimpa siapa saja tanpa memandang status sosial, ekonomi, suku\r\nbangsa, agama dan kepercayaan, serta tidak mengenal usia. Sejumlah penelitian yang\r\ndilakukan di Amerika Serikat dan Eropa menunjukkan bahwa wanita mempunyai\r\nkemungkinan mengalami depresi dua kali lebih besar daripada pria. Depresi yang dialami\r\noleh kaum wanita (khususnya ketika mengalami putus cinta) sangat mempengaruhi rasa\r\npercaya dirinya, karena wanita cenderung menggunakan perasaannya daripada pikirannya\r\ndalam menghadapi suatu masalah. Namun ada beberapa wanita yang dapat menggunakan\r\npikirannya daripada perasaannya dalam menghadapi suatu masalah dan wanita seperti\r\nitulah yang mampu mengontrol tingkat depresinya sehingga tidak mempengaruhi rasa\r\npercaya dirinya dalam bergaul dengan lingkungannya.\r\nWanita yang mengalami depresi akibat putus cinta cenderung merasa bersalah,\r\nmenganggap dirinya tidak berharga, tidak patut dicintai dan mencintai, hingga akhirnya\r\nmembatasi dirinya dalam bergaul terutama dengan lawan jenisnya. Hal ini tidak perlu\r\nterjadi jika seseorang mempunyai konsep diri yang positif, sebab konsep diri dapat\r\nmempengaruhi cara individu dalam berperilaku dan bereaksi terhadap rangsangan\r\nlingkungannya. Konsep diri seseorang tidak muncul begitu saja dengan sendirinya,\r\nmelainkan dikembangkan melalui proses belajar dan membutuhkan kehadiran orang lain.\r\nPada wanita yang mengalami putus cinta cenderung memiliki konsep diri yang negatif\r\nsehingga membuat individu tersebut susah bergaul atau membatasi dirinya dalam bergaul\r\ndengan lingkungannya, dan hal ini akan menyebabkan munculnya depresi. Dengan\r\ndemikian, dapat dikatakan konsep diri erat kaitannya dengan depresi. Apabila konsep\r\ndiri yang dimiliki oleh seseorang cenderung positif, maka tingkat depresi seseorang\r\ncenderung rendah, sebaliknya konsep diri yang negatif menyebabkan tingkat depresi\r\nseseorang cenderung tinggi.\r\nPopulasi penelitian ini adalah mahasiswi Universitas Surabaya yang berusia 21-25\r\ntahun, yang mengalami putus cinta 1-3 bulan terakhir dari pengambilan data, sebanyak 50\r\nsubjek penelitian. Teknik pengambilan sampel adalah purposive sampling. Pengumpulan\r\ndata dilakukan dengan menggunakan angket, sedangkan teknik analisis datanya\r\nmenggunakan product moment dari Pearson.\r\nBerdasarkan analisis data, diperoleh hasil r = - 0,807 dan p < 0,01 yang berarti\r\nterdapat hubungan negatif yang sangat signifikan antara konsep diri dengan depresi. Hal\r\nini berarti semakin positif konsep diri yang dimiliki oleh seseorang maka tingkat depresi\r\nyang dialami cenderung rendah, sedangkan semakin negatif konsep diri yang dimiliki\r\noleh seseorang maka tingkat depresi yang dialami cenderung tinggi. Berdasarkan hasil\r\nperhitungan koefisien determinan diperoleh r2 = 0,651 yang berarti konsep diri\r\nmempunyai pengaruh yang efektif sebesar 65,1% terhadap depresi, dan sisanya 34,9%\r\ndipengaruhi oleh faktor-faktor lain selain konsep diri.",

When prematures catch up with their birth age they are likely to vanish into the general child population, and the fact of their premature birth is no longer regarded as particularly significant in their behavioral development. The possibility that premature ejection of an individual into a world he has not yet grown up to fit may have lasting social and emotional consequences is an intriguing problem for the student of personality.

This will determine the extent to which experience can continue to be engaged with creatively and intimacy, including sexual intimacy, can be sustained. The importance of the capacity to adapt and adjust to the changes and losses of old age and to sustain intimacy is highlighted in research that shows that marital closeness moderates the negative psychological impact of functional disability in later life in terms of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem.

      "title": "Western Sport and Spiritualism",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sport activity of achievement-oriented (professional, Olympic, spectacular character) is first of all exposition of rivalry and striving for variously understood sports success (resulting from measurable or discretionary criteria). It refers to winning a competition or taking another expected place as well as to other forms of satisfaction, such as financial gratification or social (political, ethnic, professional) recognition. Spirituality is here neither an aim, nor an expected value - it constitutes rather an additional or redundant quality. A competitor focuses his/her attention first of all on the main aim assumed in planned or current rivalry. Emotional sensations which are experienced by athletes before, during or after competitions testify to mental and emotional stress which accompanies sports combat. It is also difficult to associate spirituality or spiritualism with sport for all - like, for example, that of health-oriented character - sport of the disabled, physical education, sport of playful character or physical recreation. That difficulty results from the fact that neither spiritualism, nor spirituality inspires for physical activity in the abovementioned fields; neither spiritualism, nor spirituality is the outcome of activity in the realm of sport for all. Exceptions are constituted by ancient Olympic Games as well as by some experiences connected with recreational forms of tourism mediated through achievement-oriented sport (also by pre-Columbian Native American societies and Maoris aboriginal population of New Zealand). For example Hellenic Olympic Games were a highly spiritualized form of sports rivalry - including also rivalry in the field of art, and especially in the field of theatre. They were one of numerous forms of religious cult - of worshipping chosen gods from the Olympic pantheon. On the other hand, during mountain hiking and mountain climbing there can appear manifestations of deepened spirituality characteristic for the object of spiritualization of non-religious, quasi-religious or strictly religious qualities. I would like to explain - at the end of this short abstract - that spiritualism (which should not be confused with spiritism) is - generally speaking - first of all a philosophical term assuming, in ontological and axiological sense, that spiritual reality, self-knowledge, consciousness or mental experiences are components of the human being - components of a higher order having priority over matter. They constitute, in the anthropological context, beings of a higher order than the body. Spiritualism according to its popular interpretation means spirituality. Qualities which are ascribed to that notion in particular societies can be determined on the basis of empirically oriented sociological research. They make it possible to determine various ways of interpreting and understanding that notion as well as views or attitudes connected with it.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Uncertainty is inextricably linked to relationship development. People enter initial interactions with a considerable lack of information about their communication partner. Whether partners seek further interaction and develop their relationship depends on their ability to communicate effectively despite this uncertainty and in ways that decrease this uncertainty. As relationships escalate, partners continue to gather and provide information that alleviates uncertainty as they assess the viability and desirability of further relationship escalation. Uncertainty persists within mutually committed relationships, contributing to dialectical tensions and manifesting as questions about a person's own interest in the relationship, the partner's involvement in the association, and the nature of the relationship in general. Because uncertainty can arise whenever conditions within and surrounding a relationship change and because uncertainty complicates interpersonal communication, it influences the development and maintenance of intimacy across the relational lifespan.",

Much of the broader association between psychopathy and offending of all types including sexual deviance relates to psychopathy's general Antagonism. Disproportionately attributing sexual offending to psychopathy belies the many pathways into sexual offending, which is itself a very broad criminological classification, ranging from hands-off, remote offenses to hands-on/contact offenses (rape and sexual assault). Moreover, some aspects of psychopathy are more associated with sexual offending than others; the core traits (affective and interpersonal) are less strongly associated than behavioral and criminal lifestyle facets. Also, concurrent sexual deviation is a key risk-increasing factor, as are emotional–neurotic elements emerging from with secondary psychopathy such as obsessionality and compulsivity.",

      "title": "Developmental social vulnerability as the intrinsic origin of psychopathology: A paradigm shift from disease entities to psychiatric derivatives within human diversity",
      "abstract": "How a social episode is perceived by a person and how the experience affects her/his subsequent behaviors will inevitably and sometimes accidentally vary in each case on the developmental trajectory from the birth of consciousness to death. Both the preceding developmental conditions and the social impact of the episode become a starting point for the following states of human complex conditions, creating the extraordinary diversity that characterizes our complex society. In this evolutionarily carved landscape, genetic factors including stochastic epistasis, environmental modification, and gene-environment interactions are all active. In these processes, interactions between developmental social vulnerability and environmental influences can lead to the emergence and persistence of some derivative states with social maladaptation. In our model, every psychiatric condition including aberrant paranoid-hallucinatory states is classified as a derivative state. The probability distribution curve for these derivative states has a non-linear relationship with the liability in the population, and there is none with probability 1.0 or zero. Individuals with trivial social vulnerability or high resilience may develop the derivative states in tremendously stressful circumstances, and individuals with huge social vulnerability may not necessarily develop the derivative states in the presence of adequate social supports. Social skillfulness/unskillfulness and behavioral flexibility/inflexibility form the core of the vulnerability-related dimensions. The clinical picture of a derivative manifestation is profiled depending on the individual trait levels in the derivative-related dimensions. Each derivative state has a requisite lineup of dimensions and each dimension can contribute to multiple psychiatric conditions. For example, aberrant paranoid-hallucinatory states and bipolar condition may share some developmental conditions as the derivative-related dimensions. Therefore, multiple derivative states can co-occur or be sequentially comorbid. Although the 'learned strategies' can ostensibly mask the clinical manifestation of developmental deviations, the change of the true dimensional position to the socially skillful direction is efficiently obtained through social experiences in a supportive environment. The liability-probability model makes it impossible to discriminate individuals with psychiatric diagnosis from individuals without the diagnosis and allows all of us to reside in the same human complex diversity.",

It has for long been considered a whim of a disturbed mind. However, it may be a true biological disturbance that needs correction earlier better than later in the age of the person who shows the desire of transition to the opposite sex. Objectives: To highlight the issue of trans-sex, its incidence and prevalence, and its biological causes, to remove the confusion and the many wrong concepts about this medical problem. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search for the data, in the search engines using the key words, using a repeatable method; appraising the data (and the quality of the data) with filtration to exclude duplication and a synthesis of research data. Trans-sex individuals exhibit persistent and authentic differences from the cis-sex individuals. The early decision is better because of the psychological, social and job consequences of sex in the life of the person. Societies’ intolerance to trans-sex persons may be very challenging and can cause anxiety disorders, depression, and other psychologic disturbances. Conclusion: Trans-sex is a true biological disorder that needs proper diagnosis and management. Reaching a diagnosis in cases of trans-sex requires physicians to be oriented of the rare, but an existing, biological disturbance and how to approach for reaching a diagnosis of trans-sexualism. HY-antigen typing, brain imaging for the anatomical differences between male and female brains, and other investigations that are useful in such cases and are discussed in this review.",

      "title": "Uncertainty and Public Health Research Ethics",
      "abstract": "Uncertainty is a necessary condition for the sound moral and scientific conduct of research involving human subjects. If the expert scientific communities, medical or otherwise, lacked uncertainty about the interventions under investigation, it would be unethical to knowingly subject individuals to inferior or harmful treatment. Moreover, if the relative merits of the interventions were previously established, as indicated by the lack of uncertainty within the relevant expert community, the results of the trial would be of little, if any, scientific value. Despite the important role that uncertainty plays in the formulation and conduct of research involving human subjects, the concept has received inadequate treatment in the research ethics literature. To the limited extent that uncertainty is addressed, much of the emphasis remains on the ethical, not epistemic, aspects of uncertainty. What is left insufficiently examined is the nature and scope of the uncertainty. Often, uncertainty is glossed as agnosticism, indifference, and conflict. Yet these terms represent distinct types of uncertainty, and the type that obtains impacts the epistemic and ethical justifications for a proposed trial. A failure to recognize and clearly articulate the parameters of uncertainty in particular situations compromises our ability to respond to important moral and scientific concerns in the development and conduct of research. This problem is particularly pronounced in public health research that investigates problems resulting not only from uncertainties in scientific knowledge but from institutional failures, economic and social constraints, and lack of political will. Indeed, the role of research in public health is tied to its capacities to successfully navigate such complex questions. The way in which a study is designed and carried out, as well as ethically and scientifically justified, must reflect a robust and systematic characterization of the uncertainties present. Using an example from a study examining the efficacy of using treated sewage sludgeto remediate lead-contaminated soil, I explore and analyze the aforementioned deficiencies in understanding uncertainty among researchers and ethicists. The case study serves as a vehicle through which to illustrate (1) important considerations in characterizing and addressing uncertainty; (2) the influence of the uncertainty characterization on the formulation of parameters used to evaluate the ethical permissibility of the research; and (3) ways in which these parameters might be operationalized in the context of a particular study.",

Three hundred and fifty teenagers, attending three upper secondary schools in a medium‐sized Swedish town, completed a questionnaire. Although the teenagers were prone to agree with all three types of bullying explanations, they were more inclined to think that bullying occurs because the bully wants power or status. Girls were more inclined than boys to think that bullying takes place because the bullies have their own problems. The more the teenagers thought that bullying occurs because the victims are odd, different or deviant, the more they have been involved in bullying situations as bullies or reinforcers. The more the teenagers thought that bullying occurs because the bully has psychosocial problems, the more they have been involved as defenders and the less as bullies or reinforcers in bullying situations.",

      "abstract": "The interpersonal dimension of privacy refers to the things one does to manage social interaction and information. Long-term behavioral responses to invasion of privacy vary, depending on the individual; in relatively powerless and emotionally immature persons, withdrawal and acting out are frequent compensatory mechanisms for lack of privacy. Just as privacy is relative to many other factors, invasions of privacy are similarly often relative to other factors. Invasions of privacy may be random or accidental events, but more typically they are deeply rooted in the situation. Privacy is so relative to other aspects of one's experience, personal development, culture, and physical environment that present-day earth dwellers would be naive to assume that they could accurately anticipate those conditions and those needs. A few problems of privacy that early space inhabitants may encounter are outlined and suggestions are offered for ameliorating these problems.",

      "title": "Gender Differences in Subjective Distress to Emotional and Sexual Infidelity: Evolutionary or Logical Inference Explanation?",
      "abstract": "Sex-linked mate selection criteria have, more recently, been logically and empirically linked to differences between women and men in subjective distress to violations-of-trust, such as emotional and sexual infidelity. When a woman learns that her partner has formed an emotional attachment to another person, for example, she is especially distressed because she has learned that, if her partner is emotionally unfaithful he is sexually unfaithful as well. The sex differences in subjective distress to a partner's sexual and emotional infidelity were consistent with an evolutionary perspective and the alternative analysis. Gender differences in subjective distress to emotional and sexual infidelity result, according to an evolutionary perspective, from asymmetries in mating strategies pursued by women and men. Sexual infidelity is less distressing because she recognizes that \"men often have sex without being in love\". Men are more distressed than women by sexual infidelity because, for men, sexual infidelity serves as a basis for inferring that a partner is also emotionally unfaithful.",

During a divorce trial, almost always the mothers and the children, become joint in a sort of folie au deux, in a denigration campaign of ex-husband/father. From a review on this issue it seems evident its theoretical roots lie on a theory that justify gender violence and children sexual abuse. The bias that both of them are layers and that he children have not autonomy block their possibility of any defence in front of a Court. In severe cases, PAS becomes a new and efficient tool of intra-familiar violence. The treatment of severe cases is to stop any contact between mother and children. The resort to PAS in Courts must be strongly rejected.",

Researchers have generally assumed that childhood sexual abuse causes borderline personality disorder, but there are other possible interpretations of the association. We surveyed psychologists about the likelihood that patients with various personality disorders would engage in behaviors relevant to several alternative interpretations. Relative to patients with other personality disorders and to the \"typical outpatient,\" patients with borderline personality disorder were rated as especially likely to misinterp-et or misremember social interactions, to lie manipulatively and convincingly, and to have voluntarily entered destructive sexual relationships, possibly even at young ages.

Some might even consider happiness to be a personality trait or something that approximates a consistent individual difference. When something bad happens, happiness may be replaced by less pleasant feelings like sadness, anxiety, or fear. Therefore, it's no myth that this first type of happiness—the emotion of happiness—is strongly determined by situational factors. Daily emotional responses or momentary feelings are clearly tied to situational factors. Once psychologists and other social scientists started conducting empirical studies on the topic, they began to realize that external, situational factors—the things that people strive for and the things that they hope to avoid—did not seem to play a large role in the levels of subjective well-being that research participants reported.",

ISD is multicausal and multidimensional and manifests differently for males and females. Precipitating factors include traumatic sexual experiences, negative self-image, sexual guilt or shame, deviant or variant sexual behavior, relationship difficulties, and a chronic sexual dysfunction. Regardless of whether the male or female experiences ISD, the effect on the couple is that the cycle of positive anticipation, pleasure-oriented intercourse, and a regular rhythm of sexual contact is replaced by anticipatory anxiety, unsuccessful intercourse, self-consciousness, and avoidance.

      "title": "Friendship jealousy: One tool for maintaining friendships in the face of third-party threats?",
      "abstract": "Friendships can foster happiness, health, and reproductive fitness. However, friendships end—even when we might not want them to. A primary reason for this is interference from third parties. Yet, little work has explored how people meet the challenge of maintaining friendships in the face of real or perceived threats from third parties, as when our friends inevitably make new friends or form new romantic relationships. In contrast to earlier conceptualizations from developmental research, which viewed friendship jealousy as solely maladaptive, we propose that friendship jealousy is one overlooked tool of friendship maintenance. We derive and test—via a series of 11 studies (N = 2,918) using hypothetical scenarios, recalled real-world events, and manipulation of online emotional experiences—whether friendship jealousy possesses the features of a tool well-designed to help us retain friends in the face of third-party threats. Consistent with our proposition, findings suggest that friendship jealousy is (a) uniquely evoked by third-party threats to friendships (but not the prospective loss of the friendship alone), (b) sensitive to the value of the threatened friendship, (c) strongly calibrated to cues that one is being replaced, even over more intuitive cues (e.g., the amount of time a friend and interloper spend together), and (d) ultimately motivates behavior aimed at countering third-party threats to friendship (“friend guarding”). Even as friendship jealousy may be negative to experience, it may include features designed for beneficial—and arguably prosocial—ends: to help maintain friendships.

      "abstract": "The young infant's attitude towards frustration is revealing. Some infants—among them good feeders—may refuse food when a meal is delayed, or give other signs of a disturbance in the relation to the mother. The author observes that young infants—even as early as in the second month—would in wakeful periods after feeding lie on the mother's lap, look up at her, listen to her voice and respond to it by their facial expression; it was like a loving conversation between mother and baby. Such behaviour implies that gratification is as much related to the object which gives the food as to the food itself. A very slow taking of food often implies lack of enjoyment of libidinal gratification; this, if coupled with an early and marked interest in the mother and in other people, suggests that object-relations are partly used as an escape from persecutory anxiety attaching to food.",

      "abstract": "Sibling rivalry is a natural manifestation based on instinct. It is pathological in two cases only: 1) when it is excessive and dangerous; 2) when it is inhibited. Little study has been made of the latter case. Inhibition of aggressivity suppresses the latter from conscious living, and sibling relationships are then marked either by indifference, a rare occurrence, or much more often by tenderness. But this tenderness, over-compensating for aggressivity persisting in the unconscious, has special characteristics. In the frequent case of rivalry between an elder and a younger child, this tenderness can be seen, a result of ego defence against aggressivity, culminating in a regressive identification with the rival. Such a defence has the advantage of suppressing any aggressive behaviour, but it has the serious disadvantage of impeding progress and, frequently, such children are brought to us due to a stop in their progress at school. In the first place, nothing draws attention to a problem of sibling rivalry. When this rivalry has been suspected, however, behind the defence regression, the whole clinical problem is brought into sharp focus. To achieve such a result, projective exploration through tests and psycho-dramas is more often than not, necessary. Aggressivity until then repressed is then discovered and it is possible to clearly elicit the defence mechanism through regressive identification with the rival. Tests such as Blacky Pictures and especially the PN Test, developed by the author, permit here to throw light on the problem in depth and to bring about some understanding of the dynamic motivation of regression with backwardness at school. The problem is exposed to several paedagogical incidences which the author develops in the latter part of his study.",

      "abstract": "Any statement or phrase that disparages a group of people because of their gender identity, religion, ethnicity, national origin, race, sexual orientation, or is referred to as a racial slur. Hate, mistrust, and intolerance are often propagated via hate speech. It may also be used to harm or frighten others. People may feel alienated, anxious, and exposed as a result. Hate crimes may also result from it. Furthermore, hate speech may undermine intergroup trust. It is crucial to identify hate speech since doing so may assist to stop these negative impacts. Social media has recently developed into a haven for hate speech. Social media hate speech may be detrimental to society. Free speech, racial slur, and laws not for it have all been striving issues. Any speech, behaviour, writing, or display that encourages violence or other unpleasant deeds against a cohort of people or an organisation based on that person's subscription in the group, or that defames or affects that person or personal based on that membership, is considered racial slur under the laws of most countries. The laws may designate a category based on particular identities. Many countries do not consider racial slur to be a legal word. Additionally, the constitution permits the majority of what is seen as \"hate speech\" in many countries, including the US. In different countries, a sufferer of racial slurs may seek justice through civil lawsuit, convict lawsuit, or both. As communications are delivered and received virtually instantly, social media networks (SMNs) are the quickest form of communication. The emergence of social media platforms has irreparably altered how people interact in our society, and one result of these changes is an increase in unacceptable behaviours like the use of nasty and angry language online. It might be challenging to express harsh or disrespectful ideas to someone right in the face. People believe it is safe to abuse people or publish harmful content online. Hate speech may be harmful to an individual or a community. For improper material on the Web to be changed or blocked, it must be detected. Massive amounts of text data need human processing and classification, which takes time and effort. But since there is so much data released each day, automated approaches are crucial for recognising this kind of material.",

Apparently, human behavior can be explained only in terms of suppressions, frustrations, rejections, identifications, feelings of hostility, feelings of inferiority and inadequacy and the like. That these conflicts are potent and frequent factors in the causation of abnormal behavior no one can deny; neither will any one deny that the psychologic approach to the study of human behavior has been fruitful of great results.

If any object, be it twin, mother, nurse or sibling, retards individuation, there may be instability of the self-representation as well as faulty development of ego and superego structures.

      "abstract": "Abstract How do people learn about things that they have never perceived or inferred–like molecules, miracles or Marie‐Antoinette? For many thinkers, trust is the answer. Humans rely on communicated information, sometimes even when it contradicts blatantly their firsthand experience. We investigate the early ontogeny of this trust using a non‐verbal search paradigm in four main studies and three supplementary studies ( N = 208). Infants and toddlers first see where a reward is, and then an informant communicates to them that it is in another location. We use this general experimental set‐up to assess the role of age, informants’ knowledge, cue's familiarity, and communicative context on trust in communicated information. Results reveal that infants and toddlers quickly trust familiar and novel communicative cues from well‐informed adults. When searching for the reward, they follow a well‐informed adults’ communicative cue, even when it contradicts what they just saw. Furthermore, infants are less likely to be guided by familiar and novel cues from poorly informed adults than toddlers. Thus, reliance on communication is calibrated during early childhood, up to the point of overriding evidence about informants’ knowledge. Moreover, toddlers trust much more strongly a novel cue when it is used in a communicative manner. Toddlers’ trust cannot be explained by mere compliance: it is highly reduced when communicated information is pitted against what participants currently see. Thus, humans’ strong tendency to rely on familiar and novel communicative cues emerges in infancy, and intensifies during the second year of life.",

      "abstract": "Using traditional clinical approaches and the results of extensive statistical researches of recent years, the author comprehensively analyzed the development and the functioning of a romantic relationship with a narcissist. Love is one of the most popular means providing narcissistic aspirations. Probably, this way is chosen by individuals with the appropriate potential (attractiveness, charm, sexually inviting behavior) to satisfy their own narcissism. It is relatively easy to achieve an idealization from a romantic partner, her/his emotional dependence and power over him/her. Such perspectives create hope for a narcissist to transform his/her life by filling him/herself with the love of the partner, which should compensate childhood emotional traumas and reinforce the narcissist's extremely inflated but fragile self-esteem. Narcissists are extremely successful in the relationship initiation and its initial phase, creating an impression of ideal love. However, they experience significant problems in the later stages of relationship development. They do not want to build a partnership at all, always remain opened to new relationships. When it is no longer possible to increase admiration by his/her partner, they switch to the strategy of rivalry. Through the use of various forms of abuse, exploitation and infidelity, the narcissist strengthens his/her self-esteem, feeling power over his/her partner and her/his emotional dependence. This causes the partner's emotional injuries, who over time also begins to reject and avoid the narcissist. The consequences for the narcissist are: reduced quality of life, low relationship satisfaction and feelings of loneliness. But since narcissism is largely determined genetically, by a history of significant relationships in childhood and provides partially successful adaptation, the prospects for changing the narcissistic style of romantic relationships through psychotherapy are pessimistic. However, psychological help is necessary and effective for a narcissist's romantic partner.",

On the other hand, if the anxiety exhibited is disproportionate to the objective situation and adjustive behavior involves repression and the development of symptoms, the anxiety factor is thought of as abnormal, or neurotic anxiety. 1 Thus the individual's definition of the situation determines the kind of anxiety generated. It seems doubtful that this distinction between normal and abnormal anxiety should be utilized in reference to nationality groups or social classes. However, the comparative frequency of expression of generic anxiety by individuals composing a group or class can be ascertained and inferences may be drawn about existing differences in their definitions of objective situations. term anxiety as used in this study does not imply pathology (although anxiety may have been present in some individuals). Rather, it refers to an emotional expression of uncertainty, unusual concern, or apprehension. In this generic sense, it is assumed that the response worried me a lot to a check-list item indicates the presence of some degree of anxiety in the respondent. respondents were samples of English and American thirteenand fourteen-year old boys, thus permitting comparisons to be made by nationality groups as well as by social class. English sample consisted of 600 boys from selected Grammar and Secondary Modern Schools in greater London. United States sample was taken from the same age group in high schools in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, and numbered 744. In selecting the samples in both countries, an attempt was made to approximate representativeness in terms of the occupations of the boys' fathers. After study of the ecology of the cities and with a general knowledge of the socio-economic characteristics of various school populations in each city, a selection of schools was made. All thirteenand fourteen-year old boys in attendance when the questionnaire was administered constituted the samples.2 Each nationality group was divided into three social-class groups upon the basis of the prestige of the occupations of the boys' * Paper read at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Society, August, 1955.

Such a posture likely falsifies the clinical perception of the individual referred for \"treatment.\" Assessment and interventions for these youth must be holistic and idiosyncratic, considering numerous multiplex developmental variables (i.e., overall human sexual development, gender identity, sexual identity, sexual orientation, erotic development, intimacy deficits, adverse childhood experiences/trauma), as well as sociological and anthropological fundamentals. The lens for assessing and intervening with youth must also include in its focus the constantly changing Zeitgeist, that is, the spirit or the mood of the times. The proposed lens is applicable to all youth, adjudicated and non-adjudicated. Specific considerations are discussed related to those youth with a history of significant child maltreatment who later engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or sexually abusive behaviors.",

Individuals or groups experience social disjuncture due to poverty, discrimination, loss of employment, relationships with relatives, imprisonment, illness, and addictions. One of the groups experiencing social disjuncture is men, and the stereotypes of society towards men further increase the risk of exclusion of this social group. Due to men’s social disjuncture, their social and professional life becomes very limited; their repulsive experience limits decisionmaking, and disrupts the expression of socially acceptable behavior. Men in social disjuncture suffer from social rejection, inferiority; self-doubt, diminished self-esteem, their social skills, and social expression are often unacceptable in society. They often refuse to make positive decisions that can improve their quality of life, do not recognize their uniqueness, otherness, and avoid socially significant changes, bold decisions. Men who have been separated for a long time exhibit aggressive behavior and become even more isolated as a result. The social disjuncture of men can be successfully reduced in the group of social changes aimed at men’s self and knowledge of the environment, development of social skills, development of suitable alternatives for socially unacceptable behavior, increasing social inclusion in society.",

Instead, I propose that the ethics of justice and care are simply descriptions of the virtues of justice and care, understood richly and broadly. Each prescribes perceptions, values, self–conceptions, etc. as well as actions and passions in every sphere of human life. Like other actual (rather than idealized) virtues, justice and care sometimes conflict with each other. They demand incompatible actions, passions, perceptions, etc. The available options in conflict situations feel both right and wrong because they are admirably immoral acts and/or dirty hands acts. I argue that these conflicts do not undermine the primacy, practicality or consistency of morality.",

Researchers have generally assumed that childhood sexual abuse causes borderline personality disorder, but there are other possible interpretations of the association. We surveyed psychologists about the likelihood that patients with various personality disorders would engage in behaviors relevant to several alternative interpretations. Relative to patients with other personality disorders and to the \"typical outpatient,\" patients with borderline personality disorder were rated as especially likely to misinterp-et or misremember social interactions, to lie manipulatively and convincingly, and to have voluntarily entered destructive sexual relationships, possibly even at young ages.

Venereal diseases are the diseases which above all others are concealed from public observation; both social sentiment and the code of professional ethics have always protected them from exposure. The motive for concealment is emphasized by the element of shame with which they are invested by popular prejudice, from the erroneous idea that they have their exclusive origin in licentious indulgence. In the popular conception they are essentially<i>les maladies rèvelatrices</i>, affording proof positive or presumptive of immoral relations. Bearing these distinctive traits of shame, secrecy and immorality it is perhaps not surprising that the conventional attitude toward this class of diseases is the very antithesis of all that is implied by publicity.

When hate is denied it can have an insidious effect on the relationship. Hate arises as part of the problem of being with an “other” who challenges our perceptions and sense of truth about our self and the other. It also arises with the limitations on being able to understand and feel understood by another. The disillusionment that follows the “in love state” can also give rise to a grievance which is not worked through. Aggression and transgression are part of sexual intimacy, but unless contained by love, they can be denuded of love and become hateful. But the splitting-off of all aggression can lead to a loss of desire and capacity for intimacy.",

Everyone, whether rural or urban, has its own health and illness beliefs and practices. The only way to provide culturally sensitive health care is to be aware of, listen to, and be attentive to each patient, as well as to inquire about personal needs and wishes when appropriate. Spiritual well- being is regarded as the fourth dimension of health. It helps people realize their greatest potential, find meaning and purpose in life, and find fulfillment from within. The individual's lifestyle may have a significant impact on his or her oral health behaviour. Caries and plaque-induced periodontal illnesses are linked to personal hygiene, food intake frequency, motivation to preserve oral health, and in certain circumstances, religious commitment Dental myths are widespread and unquestioned misleading ideas that often arise as a result of a lack of education, spiritual beliefs, and traditional factors based on non-scientific information. Despite global advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, some people continue to hold on to their traditional values, practices, beliefs, and myths. If these myths are exposed in a timely manner, it may be possible to reduce the costs and time required for dental treatment, thereby converting an operative treatment into conservative dental management and improve patient satisfaction.",

      "title": "Developing Sensitivity to Complex Facial Expressions in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "The ability to produce and interpret facial expressions enables humans to communicate vital information in reciprocal social exchanges. In the first years of life, human infants begin to develop the ability to perceive and categorize basic emotional expressions (e.g. happy, sad, angry); however, these abilities continue to improve throughout childhood and into adolescence. Interestingly, very little is known about the developmental trajectory of sensitivity to more socially complex emotional expressions such as resentment, envy, or contempt. Importantly, the research that does exist has been conducted almost exclusively in atypical populations. In this project, we hypothesized that adolescence would be a key period for the emergence of sensitivity to socially complex expressions, largely because a subset of these expressions tend to provide signals about the status of more intimate relationships (i.e., with sexual and romantic partners and/or competitors) that adolescents are only beginning to form with their peers. We also hypothesized that sensitivity to these complex expressions would be fundamentally related to pubertal maturation, which likely influences the motivation to form more intimate, romantic, and sexual relationships in adolescence. To evaluate these hypotheses, we conducted two experiments to measure developmental changes in perceptual sensitivity to detect both basic (e.g., happy) and complex emotional expressions in four groups: pre-pubescent children (ages 6-8), adolescents in early versus later stages of pubertal development (ages 11-14), and sexually mature adults (ages 20-25). We report several age-related changes from childhood to adulthood as well as puberty-related changes in the absence of age-related changes from early pubertal development to late pubertal development.",

Results failed to support a number of previous findings and common views as to the factors which influence the success of marriage counseling. In addition, the questionnaires were analysed with a view to discovering the relative importance of various potential marital conflict areas. With the possible exception of a new born infant, no human being rates himself an amateur when it comes to considering the whys and wherefores of interpersonal relations. Everybody seems to have opinions, and usually strong ones, about how to get along with others, about how, in short, to handle others. These opinions are based on personal experience rather than on systematic study of the factors related to satisfactory interpersonal relations. In this respect, professionally trained counselors can hardly be distinguished from their amateur counterparts. In no field can this be better illustrated",

Physical aggression and many other forms of antisocial behavior appear during the first few years after birth. Although most learn to regulate them by the time they enter the formal school system, a substantial minority of children do not. This lack of socialization on their part often has important consequences well into adulthood. This chapter will not only review studies of antisocial behaviors globally, but will focus on subtypes of conduct disorder. Indeed, although there may be commonalities between antisocial behaviors, these may not necessarily follow the same developmental course, share the same correlates, or develop jointly. Further, these may be manifested differently in boys and girls. It is only with a better understanding of these developmental factors that we may improve the effectiveness of prevention and corrective interventions.",

      "abstract": "Summary. Central conflicts in woman-to-woman psychoanalysis seem to harbour a higher aggression factor than in the case of man-to-woman analysis. This paper examines central aggressive conflicts between patient and analyst, situated in a field charged by tensions between the considerable potential for understanding “from woman to woman” and the intense aggression engendered by transference and counter-transference. Exemplary case sequences from the author’s own practice are used to illustrate the various aspects of this issue. Some more recent psychoanalytical concepts regarding the mother-daughter relationship (but also Freud’s reflections on the same subject), with its characteristic features and difficulties form a theoretical framework for evaluating the clinical material. The hypothesis is put forward here that the specific intensity and quality of female aggression in analysis in which both participants are women sometimes manifests itself as soon as certain critical threshold situations or junctions in the mother-daughter relationship are revived. In pathological cases, this intensified aggression can be traced back to the specific illness constellation or to other influential factors, but even in the absence of a pathological constellation, the aggression derives above all from the specific character of the pre-oedipal mother-daughter relationship. The constellation of the “lesbian complex”, moreover ‐ according to the author’s hypothesis ‐ does not contribute to an escalation of aggression but acts rather toward moderating its intensity.

      "title": "Early Life and the Development of Resilience",
      "abstract": "Can J Psychiatry. 2011;56(8):445-446. Resilience involves resistance to the negative effects of tragic loss, serious failure or insult, or disturbance of the available social frame. Such experiences may be brought on by loss of valued relationships, abilities or functional level, or sources of support, and is likely to be reflected in symptomatic increase in mental disorder. Thus resilience as an issue is critical at one time or another in a probable large majority of human lives; it refers to the ability to cope with life's nontrivially difficult or unpleasant tasks, situations, or experiences with attitudes and actions that minimize or overcome their negative effects. Such coping involves strategies that include reasonable evaluation of the situation, weighing alternative actions, mechanisms of self-control and confidence, obtaining interpersonal comfort and collaboration, and other help seeking. Abilities to employ such strategies vary among individuals, as does the sensitivity to different kinds of negative experiences. Although these differences are likely influenced by genetic variation, social interactions that shape their development begin in the immediate postnatal period,' when the neonate seeks comfort, warmth, and nourishment. Neonatal offspring of depressed mothers are less responsive to social stimuli2 and biological indicators of these early behaviours1 may be early signs of nonresilient patterns of processing social-behavioural options. In the pre-school period, and increasingly thereafter, children need to understand the origins of their own emotional reactions to positive and negative experiences, as well as those of their peers.4 This understanding will arise from frequent and positive interaction with parents, siblings, and (or) other caretakers, and, normatively, will develop into skills for communicating appropriately with peers. Such understanding and skills may well serve as a basis for resilience in the face of a range of problematic experiences, peers, or negative environments. The papers in this section5,6 provide evidence regarding environmental and developmental processes in later childhood that may promote such resilience. In the first paper, by Dr Jeffrey G Johnson and colleagues,5 substantial and positive parenting during the developmental years, by either or both parents in a general population sample, is shown to be related to a much lower rate not only of the DSM Axis I disorders into young adulthood but also of the personality disorders, which themselves indicate problems in likely resilience skills. The second study, by Dr Stephanie D Stepp and colleagues,6 shows that social competence among inner-city boys as they begin adolescence serves as a protection over time to ongoing exposure to the problematic behaviour and minimized academic efforts that characterize many of their peers in low-income neighbourhoods. Again, this study6 suggests the importance of early training in the understanding of the emotional reactions of peers, as well as one's own, and reinforcement of constructive responses both to peer and to adult expectations. It is likely that these relatively resilient children may also have experienced more positive parenting than those in the same study who failed to show resilient outcomes, but such data were not part of these analyses. …",

      "abstract": "In spite of the fact that masturbation involves almost all human beings in every culture, comparatively little has been written on the subject. Until very recently masturbation was defined in the medical literature as a sexual perversion and a damaging activity to be prohibited at all costs. In the beliefs of certain religious faiths masturbation is considered a sin. The evolution of masturbatory activity as observed from infancy through adolescence is presented. Masturbation can be understood as a \"discharge phenomenon\" undertaken to relieve a state of tension existing in the human body. As the child develops he is normally subjected to increased tensions due to restrictions and frustrations forced upon him by the family and culture. Being permitted no normal outlet, he resorts to the release he has known from infancy, and has the fantasy that certain forbidden or temporarily impossible wishes take place. The feelings of guilt, increased by parental attitudes, are associated with a fear of having damaged their sexual organs and a fear of consequent ill health. Excessive masturbation as defined, must be viewed as a symptom of the child's unhappiness or emotional instability. The role of the pediatrician is to explain ordinary masturbation to the parent as a normal physiologic function. When the physician is presented with the problem of a child with excessive masturbation he should attempt to detect factors responsible for an emotional upset.",

These affect the perceptions of professionals who deal with older hearing impaired or visually impaired individuals, the individuals themselves, and their families and friends. Myths distort the communication process by giving people incorrect information or by giving information in an incorrect manner. Thus, myths adversely affect interpersonal communication between professionals and older people or between older people and family members or friends. Myths may prevent older people from seeking and obtaining assistance with hearing and vision problems because they believe the misinformation inherent in the myths associated with these disorders. Five myths common to hearing loss and five myths common to vision loss are discussed. Each myth is contrasted with its reality. Implications of the effects of these myths on older people and those associated with them are considered.",

      "title": "The Evolutionary Basis for Human Tolerance – Physiological Responses",
      "abstract": "For most animals, unfamiliar members of other groups present more of a threat than an opportunity, and are best avoided or even attacked. In contrast, our attitudes are markedly different. There is no denying that we are capable of being hostile to people we do not know, particularly if we feel anxious or threatened. However, compared to other animals, we are unusually open to new relationships, and form strong bonds with individuals outside our family group. Although we tend to focus on the ‘thinking’ part of our minds, or our cognitive appraisal of social situations, our physiological responses and emotional reactions play a central role in how we build and maintain relationships. Subtle changes in ‘gut feelings’ can have an important influence on our attitudes to people around us, particularly to unfamiliar outsiders or people we have not seen for some time. An understanding of how different hormones affect social behaviour in other species, as well as in humans, provides insights into the type of changes that led to increasing human ‘friendliness’. Genetic and anatomical evidence documents subtle changes in neuroendocrine function in recent human evolution after 300,000 years ago that appear to have played an important role in increasing tolerance of unfamiliarity, and abilities to forge new external bonds. Being able to make external connections, and form new relationships based on give and take despite lengthy periods apart, seems to have been important to our success as a species. Friends in distant communities may often have been important to survival by providing resources or help that could buffer the effects of crises and resource shortfalls. We find that it is genuine emotional commitments to distant friends, rather than strategic alliances, that allow modern hunter-gatherers to survive in times of crisis. Changes in emotional dispositions towards being less aggressive and more tolerant of unfamiliar individuals might seem to be progress, but we should be cautious in thinking in these terms. Increased ‘friendliness’ is not without its disadvantages. It also brings downsides in terms of social sensitivities and emotional vulnerabilities that influence much of human behaviour.",

As características das crianças que serão tratadas referem-se à ausência de ingenuidade e à correlação entre o êxito ou fracassos obtidos das curiosidades sexuais como determinantes do caráter. Referem-se também à posição do sujeito frente ao acesso, à intelectualidade e à distinção entre o saber sobre a morte para a criança e para o adulto. Ademais, dizem respeito ao esclarecimento sobre como o conhecimento da própria imagem para a criança que, ainda não é capaz de controlar seus movimentos psicomotores, a torna capaz de fazer laço. A presença da sexualidade na criança tende a ser tratada pelo adulto como algo irrelevante e, em alguns casos, como patológico. Freud atribui esse comportamento à amnésia infantil. Assim, o adulto, frequentemente, faz uso de inverdades por meio de histórias fantasiosas para omitir ou adiar o esclarecimento das curiosidades apresentadas pelas crianças, sejam elas sexuais ou sobre a morte. Através da curiosidade sobre a sua origem e a morte, a criança inicia sua exaustiva busca pelo saber. As informações a que tem acesso, muitas vezes, apresentam-se censuradas ou escamoteadas, de forma que só adiam sua aproximação do saber. Por intermédio do contato com os outros, entretanto, sejam eles crianças, adultos ou animais, ela se sente instigada a buscar esclarecimentos para suas curiosidades. Para Freud, essa busca pelo saber será determinante para a criança no desenvolvimento da sua intelectualidade.Palavras-chave: Freud. Criança. Sexualidade. Saber.",

At the age of 3 or 4 a child starts to make claims about his past which clearly do not correspond to anything that has happened in his present life. He claims to remember living in a certain place, doing certain things, being with certain people, and so on. It is then found that these memory claims fit the life of a person who died shortly before the child was born. The accuracy of the memory claims is striking and there seems to be no possible normal explanation of this. The child also has certain character traits, interests and skills which correspond closely to those of the one who died; and, perhaps, a physical characteristic, such as a birthmark or wound, which closely resembles a characteristic of the earlier individual.",

Believing that one knows one’s own or certain others such measurements also may. Therefore the social sciences need to detect, avoid, and overcome these problems of reactivity to their measuring and measurements if they are to obtain valid measurements and generalizations from these. This requires the cooperation of the measured and so an understanding of the social psychology of measuring on such dimensions, of how persons participate in being measured on such dimensions and react to being informed about their own or some others measurements on these dimensions. These are matters that physical science measurement theory has no reason to be concerned with, is not, and so cannot properly provide a model for measurement of persons on social science dimensions.",

      "abstract": "Gender identity refers to the way humans view themselves and perceive themselves to be attractive both sexually and romantically. It is an individual's appreciation and satisfaction of being heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual, or cisgender. It refers to an individual's sexual understanding of himself and is part of one's identity, which is different from the sexual understanding of oneself. Gender identity disorder means a robust desire of pertinence towards the opposite sex and robustly insistence on this otherness. Avoidance is classified within the framework of cluster 3 of personality disorders, which is identified by The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Hence, one can argue those who have this kind of personality disorder may appear in them withdrawal behavior; and they view themselves as restless, and they feel that they are rejected and despised by others. The researcher argues that homosexuals in Kurdish society are not accepted, and a large majority of people see them as sick, and others as victim due to their vulnerability to social and psychological problems. This study aims at finding relations between gender identity disorder and symptoms of avoidance in homosexual persons. The descriptive and relational methodology is used to intentionally select 108 subjects, 84 males and 24 females. Based on literatures and contemporary studies in the field, the researcher prepares the items of the gender identity disorder, yet for symptoms of avoidance, the researcher relies on and takes its terminologies from The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The terminologies in both variables are presented to groups of experts in education, psychology, and psychiatrics, and for extracting stability from both the measures, (split-half) and (alpha Cronbach’s) is used. After applying the last measures on individuals from the sample of the study, statistics of the data is analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The study concludes that there is a robust, positive and significant correlation between gender identity disorder and avoidance symptoms among homosexuals.

      "title": "Bullying in School and Cyberspace",
      "abstract": "For students, bullying is a significant problem, especially in middle school: up to half of students are involved, either as a bully, a victim, or a bystander. The effects of bullying range from negligible to very severe, including individual psychological difficulties as well as consequences for criminogenic behavior. Theories to explain multidetermined bullying behavior include ecological as well as family-based approaches. Bullying must contain the following elements: unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or groups of youths who are not siblings or current dating partners that involves an observed or perceived power imbalance and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated. This definition describes traditional bullying, in which a person or persons can be seen to be engaged in bullying behavior. Since the late 1990s, cyberbullying has been on the rise. Traditional bullying and cyberbullying differ in the following ways: (a) cyberbullying often means the victim does not know who the bully is; (b) cyberbullying is not a discreet incident; it can be preserved in cyberspace indefinitely; (c) anger rumination, anxiety, depression, and suicidality are more prevalent among cyberbully victims; (d) cyberbullies can exhibit decreased empathy for others relative to traditional bullies; and (e) longitudinal research has found some support that cyberbullies may develop delinquent behaviors in adulthood. Bullying affects a significant proportion of students, between 18% and 31% of students in the United States are likely to be involved in traditional bullying, whereas rates of cyberbullying involvement are close to 59%. Any participation in bullying can affect youth negatively. Being either a bully or a victim can lead to depression, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Being a perpetrator of bullying and cyberbullying may also increase the likelihood of criminal activity in young adulthood. According to the path analytic model of juvenile delinquency, it is likely that association with delinquent peers and parenting style are related to bullying behavior. Prevention and intervention programs have had some positive effects. Prevention and intervention efforts should concentrate on universal dissemination of effective strategies, including that cyberbullies are not really anonymous. Family and school-based interventions can strengthen adult support while encouraging programs that teach children to respect each other, promoting prosocial development. For traditional bullying, school climate programs in primary school have shown positive effects. Interventions for traditional bullying that are based in family therapy have shown success. Due to the novelty of cyberbullying, few intervention studies are available as yet. Efforts to prevent cyberbullying include setting up anonymous tiplines in schools and sharing up-to-date technological advances with parents so that they can implement those blocks that are available. Finally, there are no specific federal laws in the United States addressing bullying; however, federal regulations do exist to provide frameworks for anti-discrimination laws pertaining to protected classes. Although there are no explicit federal regulations that address bullying, state and local policies have been key components in addressing bullying issues. There has been some evidence that suggest that anti-bullying laws and policies in schools may decrease bullying perpetration. Countries including New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden have passed specific laws to address bullying, while some countries apply laws created to address other infractions to include bullying.",

The chapter argues that the theoretical traditions which have shaped the field of CSA disclosure – and particularly theories that seek to explain non-disclosure – are firmly rooted in an understanding of sexual abuse as something occurring to younger children within the family. Child-related barriers are those which arise from developmental characteristics of the child and/or emotional turmoil experienced by the child as a result of the abuse. Relational barriers are those which arise from the nature or characteristics of a relationship or set of relationships which can be actual or perceived. Social barriers are those which arise from broader societal responses to or messages about sexual abuse that may prevent disclosure.",

      "title": "Disappointment : When Things Turn Out Wrong or Worse Than Wanted",
      "abstract": "This chapter explores the relatively neglected emotion of disappointment. Despite the fact that feelings of disappointment are undoubtedly widespread, the interest in the study of disappointment so far – at least within sociology and related disciplines – has been rather disappointing. Disappointment, as this chapter shows, is an important emotion in human and social life, not least because it is so recognizable to most of us due to our own experiences with it. Disappointment is closely connected to past experiences and our expectations for the future, and it arises when reality somehow turns wrong or worse than what we wanted or expected. The experience of disappointment can be related to a variety of different areas of life such as education, career, love life, one’s relations to self, to others or to life in general. Disappointments can be minor or major, but they need to be managed and processed in order for us to learn from them or leave them behind. Disappointment is not only an individual experience but also a cultural and collective thing that may characterize the feelings of groups or entire populations. In this way, collective experiences of disappointment may serve as an important trigger for calls for social change or event revolt. This chapter provides an overview – however far from exhaustive – of how we may initially understand disappointment from a primarily sociological and subsidiarily from related perspective as a platform for further investigation.",

      "abstract": "As has been the pattern worldwide, the provision of donor insemination (DI) - and\r\nsubsequently other forms of donor conception - in the UK has traditionally been\r\ncharacterised by withholding the identities of donors and recipients and of donors\r\nand their donor-conceived offspring from each other. Furthermore, recipients of\r\ndonor gametes were frequently advised not to tell anyone, including their children,\r\nof their recourse to donor conception.1 Inter-related factors promoting such practices\r\ninclude:\r\n• the dubious legal and moral status of donor conception (including explicit\r\ndisapproval from several major world religions) – with consequent concerns\r\nabout the impact on the child and other family members if knowledge of\r\ndonor conception became “common knowledge”.2\r\n• suspicions about sperm donors’ personality and motivation.3\r\n• recipients’ ambivalence about the use of donor conception – especially DI.4\r\n• uncertainties about the impact on the child of knowledge of the circumstances\r\nof their conception (or assumptions that such knowledge would be\r\ndamaging).5\r\n• uncertainties about the donor’s legal or financial responsibilities towards the\r\nchild and to protect them from unintended/undesired contact or responsibilities.\r\n6\r\n• uncertain legal status of the child – and fears of prosecution/conviction for\r\nfalsification of birth registration information.7\r\n• stigma associated with male infertility in particular and families desires - and\r\nthe opportunity - to “pass as normal”.8\r\n• potential consequences of the parents’ imbalanced genetic relationship with\r\nthe child and fears of the child’s rejection of the non-genetic parent.9\r\n• fears of unwanted intrusion by the donor in family affairs.10\r\n• initial reliance on fresh sperm, requiring management of the geographical\r\nand temporal proximity of donor and recipient.11\r\n• parents’ uncertainties about the timing and method of telling their child and\r\nthe lack of information to give the child, making “not telling” – at least superficially\r\n- an easier option.12\r\n• physicians’ concerns about their potential exposure to critical external scrutiny,\r\nincluding risk of claims of unprofessional/illegal practice.13\r\n• need to maintain donor services in the face of the assumed adverse impact\r\nof disclosure on supply.14",

However, it is still pertinent to ask what proportion of a given characteristic<i>in a total population</i>is determined by specific hereditary or environmental influences.

      "abstract": "A health policy which concentrates scarce resources on high risk individuals or groups theoretically should lead to earlier diagnosis of the condition at a lower cost for the collectivity. Pregnancy and birth the physiological processes that usaully unfold normally. Risk may be defined as increased probability of a complication such as abortion, stillbirth, prematurity, hypotrophy, or delayed death as a function of certain indicators or risk factors related to maternal age, marital status, partiy, obstetrical history, health status before and during pregnancy, nutritional status, and socioeconomic situation. There are no completely risk-free pregnancies, and not all risk factors are equally serious. It is rare that only 1 risk factor is present; several risk factors usually coexist and their combined action aggravates and risk. Social indicators and factors such as poverty, low sociocultural level, and heavy work have a particularly great weight in cases of multifactorial risk. Some elements creating increased risk, such as small maternal size, are not avoidable, while others such as smoking during pregnancy may be avoided. In each case, risks should be carefully specified in terms of the possible pathology associated with them. The medical history and first prenatal consultation can disclose events prior to the pregnancy that would threaten it, including morphological anomalies such as small size or insufficient or excessive weight; illnesses such as heart or kidney disease, epilepsy, or diabetes, and complications during previous pregnancies or deliveries, such as abortion, premature delivery, or toxemia. Anomalies of the current pregnancy observed at the first prenatal visit might include too short pregnancy interval; unfavorable conditions related to maternal age, spacing, or ages of existing children, illegitimacy, or heavy work; anomalies in the general condition such as toxemia, excessive fatique, or use of alcohol, tobacco, or drugs; and obstetrical anomalies such as hemorrhage, infection, or excessive fetal volume. Lack of prenatal care constitutes a risk factor in itself. A strategy to furnish adequate preventive and curative services for high risk women requires at the national level better health planning, definition of the functions of different categories of health personnel, and development of appropriate training programs. In concrete terms, the strategy may translate into such activities as more frequent prenatal visits, increased household assistance by family members or paid workers, bed rest, or early transfer to a well-equipped hospital. In developing countries, better basic health services and corrdination between levels of care will probably be the most important interventions for controlling infant morbidity and mortality, but improved maternal nutrition and other measures to assure adequate birth weight should not be overlooked.",

The analyses of dyadic panel data of adults in Germany including about 1,000 infidelity events showed that infidelity was preceded (but not followed) by a gradual decrease in relationship functioning in perpetrators and victims. There was little evidence of rebound effects in the aftermath of infidelity, with the exception of unfaithful women and individuals with lower initial relationship commitment who returned to the pre-event level of well-being or even exceeded it, providing support to the expectancy violation theory (vs. the investment model of infidelity). By showing that well-being starts to decline before infidelity happens, this study provides a differentiated view on the temporal dynamics of infidelity and well-being and contributes to the literature on romantic relationship dynamics and major life events.",

      "abstract": "Background Homicide is an important cause of premature mortality globally, but evidence for the magnitude of homicides by intimate partners is scarce and hampered by the large amount of missing information about the victim–offender relationship. Intimate partner violence is a serious, preventable public health problem that affects millions of Americans. Violence between intimate partners ranges from verbal abuse to physical violence, with lethal outcome at the far end of the spectrum. The term ‘intimate partner violence’ describes physical, sexual, or psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse. Partner homicide differs from other form of mass murder in that the murder kills a family member who is a loved one rather than an anonymous person. Aim To identify sociodemographic and criminological characteristics in perpetrators of intimate partner homicide (IPH); to identify personality traits of those who commit IPH; to identify to what extent IPH experienced mental illness and mental disorder, before or in connection to the offense; and to investigate the associated risk factors to commit homicide of an intimate partner, such as substance use. Patient recruitment After taking a written approval from Al-Azhar University Faculty of Medicine Ethical Committee and from Ministry of Health General Secretariat of Mental Health Training Department and an oral consent from the offenders, a sample was taken of all male (35) and female (two) individuals, aged 18 years or older, who were convicted of homicide of their intimate partner. These were new admitted cases who were evaluated after being referred from public prosecutor to check for the mental state of the offenders. Methods Each offender was subjected to the following: (a) clinical psychiatric assessment, (b) Homicide Questionnaire, (c) standardized psychiatric assessment by Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview PLUS, and (d) standardized psychological assessment by Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Wechsler adult intelligence scale, and the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test. Results The result revealed that sex is a risk factor for partner homicide, as of 37 offenders, only two were females compared with 35 males. Abusive parent and violence within the family were the most common risk factors inside the families. Overall, 51.4% of IPH offenders were highly educated, with significant relation between educational level and the crime, and most of them were employed at the time of crime. Of the sample, 32.4% were diagnosed as having antisocial personality disorder, 67.6% schizophrenia, and 32.4% mood disorders. Moreover, 29.7% had a past history of previous admission in a psychiatric hospital, and 40.5% were taking psychiatric medication. All offenders are tobacco smokers, and the most common substances used were cannabis, then opioid and sedative, and the least was alcohol beverages. Sharp instruments were the most common weapon used by the offenders, and the crime usually was done at night.",

Moreover, female inmates charged with murder and other crimes were examined focusing on their family functions, as well as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and personality, including borderline personality disorder (BPD), which are considered to affect reasons of committing crimes. The results indicated that murderesses with ADHD tendencies, poor family ties, and maladaptation tended to deny themselves, have the feeling of abandonment, are unable to believe others, and have difficulties in interpersonal relationships. These factors are considered to lead them to commit murder. Furthermore, age differences in family functions, ADHD, and BPD were observed only in female inmates charged with murder.",

      "title": "Trauma and Stress-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Traumatic events have permeated our lives throughout history and across the globe, inflicting profound losses on individuals, families, and communities during warfare, armed conflict, natural disasters, and relational violence. Although many survivors of these events harness their resilience and cope without long-term negative mental health effects, others experience a range of physical and mental health conditions, including trauma- and stress-related disorders. With an emphasis placed on adult trauma survivors, the conditions of posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorders, complex trauma, and other stress-related conditions have been explored within a social context. Starting with a historical context, the following topics were addressed. The typologies of trauma were introduced including the definitions of Type I trauma—a single discrete event including natural catastrophes; Type II trauma—chronic and repetitive traumatic physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse; and Type IIII—severe and multiple abusive events with multiple perpetrators. Historical and intergenerational trauma reflect a collective of complex traumatic events throughout generations that resonate in subsequent generations in terms of ungrieved losses and survivor guilt, among other psychosocial issues. Cultural and racial trauma include chronic verbal and/or physical assaults that involve racialized bigotry. Combat trauma involves a combination of deployment stressors that have affected servicemembers in distinct ways with “signature injuries” associated with different wartime conflicts. The next section addresses the current typology of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>—V, noting the changes in diagnostic criteria, in particular related to the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mental health responses to trauma vary a great deal based on a balance of risk and protective factors, often revealing noteworthy resilience and the absence of negative aftereffects. The neurobiological effects of trauma are addressed along with mental health conditions or disorders (e.g., acute stress response, PTSD, complex trauma, and anxiety disorders). Specific phase-oriented and multimodality treatment interventions are reviewed that focus specifically on the mental health conditions presented. These approaches are research-informed, culturally responsive, and theoretically grounded Finally, the responses experienced by clinicians who work with traumatized clients are outlined along with recommendations for ways to minimize the effects of secondary, or vicarious, traumatization. Clinical <underline>v</underline>ignettes based on case composites have been utilized to illustrate central points.",

      "title": "STATE CHILD EMOTIONAL ABUSE LAWS: THEIR FAILURE TO PROTECT CHILDREN WITH GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER",
      "abstract": "Emotional abuse of children with Gender Identity Disorder by parents is very difficult to identify and prevent. State investigators of abuse and neglect often have a hard time determining if the reasons for mental illness and psychological harm in children are due to the actions of their parents, or if they stem from other sources. Once identified, it becomes even harder to prove in court for purposes of ordering services or removing the child from the home if the abuse is severe enough. With children who are gender non-conforming, this task becomes exponentially more difficult due to the low prevalence rate, discrimination, stereotypes, and a parent's right to bring up their child as they choose. These youth face discrimination and violence in school, work, their communities, and also within their own families. Emotional abuse statutes are too vague to protect youth who are gender non-conforming. The vague and unclear laws lead to inconsistency in the application of the law and lack of protection of the children because judges and investigators are not aware of how parent's actions harms youth with gender identity disorder. Therefore, states should adopt the model statute within this Note which defines specific actions by parents which would not qualify as abuse when involving gender conforming youth but qualifies as abuse for children with gender identity disorder. Many states already have statutes which define physical abuse, sexual abuse and abandonment by specific actions by parents towards their children. This proposal will enable both the state and the judges to properly identify victims with gender identity disorder of emotional abuse and provide for their protection.",

      "title": "From self‐medication to intoxication: time for a paradigm shift",
      "abstract": "The self-medication hypothesis (SMH) seeks to explain why some individuals use addictive substances in moderation, whereas others do not, and postulates that those who use substances in problematic ways are seeking relief from a priori psychological suffering that non-addicted people do not experience 1, 2. The SMH has infiltrated medical and lay culture to such an extent that many providers and patients today invoke the SMH as the cause of substance abuse and dependence, despite the lack of robust scientific evidence to support it 3. The thought-provoking paper in this issue by Shane Darke 4 suggests that ‘the extraordinarily high levels of childhood trauma and psychopathology that … occur before the initiation of heroin use’ support the SMH in the population of heroin users he describes. I disagree. Trauma and psychopathology may be risk factors for the initiation of substance use and the subsequent development of addiction, just as family dysfunction, unemployment, chronic pain, genetic predisposition and access to substances are risk factors for the above; but none of these causes addiction. Addiction results from the complex interplay between risk factors, the reinforcing properties of the substances themselves and the learned behavior and rituals associated with habitual use. Darke acknowledges that ‘given the complexity of the phenomenon [addiction], no single theory is likely to explain all cases’, and ‘once dependent, other factors such as neuroadaptation and withdrawal relief clearly come into play’. Yet his emphasis on self-medication as a ‘major path to heroin dependence’ perpetuates the myth that ‘self-medication’, a misnomer if ever there was one, is the driving force behind addiction, and that treating the underlying psychopathology will target the addiction. On the contrary, the SMH undermines the treatment of addiction by ignoring the intrinsically reinforcing properties of addictive substances, misdirecting treatment away from treatment for addiction and contributing to the current epidemic of prescription medication abuse. Addictive substances are reinforcing. They work through both positive reinforcement (the pleasure associated with use) and negative reinforcement (the pain associated with cessation of use). Reinforcement is a well-documented biological phenomenon that occurs with chronic administration of all addictive substances 5. The negative reinforcement of withdrawal is often confused with the psychological distress implied by the SMH, encouraging addicted individuals to regard symptoms of withdrawal as evidence of an underlying psychiatric condition, which ‘justifies’ their ‘need’ for continued use of substances. The SMH promotes wrong-headed treatment strategies by health-care providers. In turning to psychological distress to explain addiction, and directing treatment to this putative underlying pathology, providers are liable to ignore the disease of addiction. There is little evidence that treatment of co-occurring psychopathology, without treatment for addiction, leads to long-term improvement of substance misuse, and strong evidence that chronic substance use exacerbates co-occurring psychiatric disorders and symptoms; i.e. is not medicinal 3. The SMH contributes to the escalating problem of prescription medication abuse by promoting pharmacotherapy for subjective states of distress such as anxiety and cognitive problems, instead of regarding addiction as the potential cause of distress. Physicians are generally poorly trained in recognizing and treating addiction, yet are heavily trained and incentivized to diagnose and treat all manner of maladies which require a prescription, which further exacerbates the phenomenon of lax prescribing. Independent of its scientific validity, which I dispute, the SMH of addictive disorders does not provide a useful heuristic for understanding and treating addiction. ‘Self-medication’ minimizes the biological importance of negative reinforcement due to withdrawal, misdirects treatment to ‘underlying psychopathology’ rather than addiction and contributes to the growing burden of prescription medication abuse. For all the reasons cited above, the SMH is the wrong paradigm for our time. As Darke insightfully observes, the SMH ‘is a theory of the individual’; yet we are living in an era when addiction, in particular opioid addiction, has become an epidemic, influenced as much if not more by cultural context as by the subjective vulnerability of the individual 6. The tragic plight of Darke's heroin-dependent patients, with their ‘shattered childhoods’, surrounded by heroin users and having no alternative coping strategies available to them, begs the question: ‘How did any of them manage to survive without developing addiction?’. What is needed now are more models of addiction that illuminate how cultural context and environmental factors influence addiction from the outside in, rather than perseverating on how the subjective experience of the individual engenders addiction from the inside out.

      "title": "SOCIAL VALUE-SOCIAL BEHAVIOR INCONSISTENCY AND EARLY SIGNS OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY IN ADOLESCENCE",
      "abstract": "It is generally recognized that the development of social behavior is in large measure mediated by the identification process through which the child adopts the values of both parents to some extent but the same-sexed parent in particular. Although Freud's (5) formulation of identification involves an incorporation of the same-sexed parent as a way of reducing the retaliatory fears associated with competition in the Oedipal or Electra situation (identification with the aggressor), others (2, I1, 13) have relied on learning principles to account for the gradual transition from asocial infancy to the highly socialized behavior of the young adult. Although American childrearing practices vary in specific detail, the inculcation of parental social values in the offspring often progresses by associating behaviors which violate such values with anxiety through punishment or threat of punishment. Thus, behaving in socially desirable ways not only elicits positive rewards from parents and other adults but also allows the child to avoid the anxiety cued by socially undesirable behavioral alternatives. The later adolescent years (18 to 2o) appear to be a period during which the maturing child might experience particular difficulties in maintaining a consistency between his own behavior and what he has learned to perceive as socially desirable behavior. For one reason, his adult strivings for greater independence may lead the adolescent into conflict with parental or other authority figures and his social behaviors may reflect intentional violations of parental social sanctions. Another reason why the later adolescence period may reflect inconsistency between social values and social behaviors is that the adolescent may find that he does not as yet have the social skills appropriate to behaving in a socially desirable adult manner. A third possibility would be that a change in the adolescent's social values occurs through nonparental influences but he is unable to change the well-established social behavior patterns which had been consistent with the prior set of values. No matter what the source of social value social behavior inconsistency, one would expect on an a priori basis that a heightened level of anxiety would be a common product because of the previous history of punishment associ-",

      "abstract": "Along with several social institutions, the family has its unique place as the foundation of a strong state. For this reason, family problems are at the center of research in modern psychological science aimed at identifying key factors of health, well-being and a prosperous life in the family. The purpose of this work is to identify the ability of spouses to cope with family difficulties or conflict situations and to study their correspondence to the manifestations of a person's emotional intelligence as a guarantee of satisfaction and family health. At different stages of its development the family very often faces problems, for which the spouses use a conscious toolkit. Emotional intelligence, being one of the fundamental components of personality, influences the choice of a person's coping strategy in conflict situations: Studies have shown that a person's high levels of emotional intelligence (EQ or EI) have a reciprocal relationship with coping, a rational problem-solving orientation. It also leads to personal satisfaction, creating the basis for family well-being and a healthy psychological atmosphere. We can conclude that the higher a person's perception and recognition of his own and others' emotions, emotional states, the easier and faster he distinguishes between his own and others' emotional manifestations and expressions, and of course is able to freely manage them, the more a person is able to show organization when facing various difficulties, the better he can regulate actions, as well as control the current situation. As a result, the person experiences satisfaction with family life.",

      "abstract": "The placebo effect is traditionally viewed as a positive outcome resulting from a person's belief that an inert substance is in fact an active drug. In this context, it is often viewed as an intrapsychic phenomenon. However, most placebo effects reported in scientific research result from social interactions. These might be explicit, such as the description and administration of a treatment by a practitioner, or less explicit, for example, the recipient's perceptions of the practitioner's credibility, expertise, or confidence. On this basis, placebo effects are arguably social in origin. Many phenomena in sport are likewise social in origin, from the facilitation effects of a home field crowd or a cohesive team, to anxiety induced by an expert opponent or perceived underperformance. Such social effects have been the subject of research not only in social psychology, but also in experimental physiology. Emergent research in cognitive and evolutionary anthropology suggests that these social effects can be examined as a form of placebo effect. This suggestion is not a speculative position predicated on social and placebo effects sharing similar environmental cues and outcomes, but one based on a growing database indicating that drug, placebo, and social effects operate via common neurobiological mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the theoretical and empirical overlap between placebo and social effects and describe emergent research reporting specific brain pathways activated by socio-environmental cues as well as by drugs and placebos. We do so from three perspectives: the competitor, the teammate, the researcher.",

However, from a review of the cases of 53 male self-mutilators, it appears that a significant number involve individuals not psychotic at the time of the act but rather having character disorders and rageful feelings toward themselves or women, and transsexual males who premeditate their own gender conversion surgery. The psychiatric consultant's role in the management of such an individual in the general hospital setting includes not only care of a patient with a psychotic or impulse disorder but also involves support of the house staff, who are distressed by the fear, guilt, hopelessness, anger, and revulsion that the patient's act of genital self-mutilation causes.",

Given the fact that the criminal offence of rape is characterised by a high incidence of false reports and accusations, frequently indicating specific persons as the perpetrators, certain caution is necessary in the investigation in order to avoid false accusations and/or convictions. As regards the personality of the rapist and motives for committing a forcible sexual act, certain types or rather certain categories of perpetrators can be distinguished, although it should be noted that a large number of rapists do not belong to one category only, but rather combine characteristics of several different types. During a criminal investigation it is of vital importance to differentiate between a rape as a surprise attack and a rape as abuse of trust, as they are compatible with the nature of the suspect's defence. The suspect shall be subjected to a forensic examination in the course of the investigation in order to find traces which prove vaginal, anal or oral penetration, coerced sexual intercourse and identity of the rapist. While conducting an interrogation of a suspected rapist, a crime investigating officer shall use either factual or emotional approach to his interviewee, depending on his psychological and motivational characteristics. In this regard, the factual approach is believed to be more efficient with anger rapists and sadistic rapists, whereas the compassionate approach gives good results with the gentlemen-rapists and partly with the power asserting rapists.",

Interestingly, they are fairly uniform in failing to find differences in rates according to social class or race. However, several other factors have emerged from community studies as being consistently associated with higher risk for abuse: (a) when a child lives without one of the biological parents; (b) when the mother is unavailable to the child either as a result of employment outside the home or disability and illness; (c) when the child reports that the parents' marriage is unhappy or conflictual; (d) when the child reports having a poor relationship with the parents or being subject to extremely punitive discipline or child abuse; (e) when the child reports having a stepfather. The article draws some implications from these findings and makes recommendations for ways to improve subsequent studies of risk factors.",

Are there danger signs or triggers that we can be alert\nto? How can we work with youngsters who are violent? These are some of\nthe questions addressed in this chapter, which considers violence perpetrated by an individual, rather than in groups or gangs. (For a psychoanalytic account of adolescent group violence see Hyatt Williams 1997.)Basically, yes! Aggression is a natural part of life and a major source of\nenergy. It is vital for progressive development but without appropriate\ncontrol and management, it can get out of hand and lead to violence.\nWithout aggression we would not be able to assert or protect ourselves or\nothers, learn or work effectively, separate or develop autonomy (Winnicott\n1963). Like sexuality, aggression can be used constructively and progressively, or destructively and regressively. Its appropriateness in any speci®c\nsituation depends on the manner of its expression and the developmental\nlevel of the individual. In situations of very real danger, violent aggression\nto protect the self or others may be entirely appropriate. On the other\nhand, such behaviours as sadism, contemptuous denigration, bullying and\nwanton destructiveness are largely regressive and arise from pathology\nnot health.",

On the other side, sexuality can be maintained up to high age. In any case is the demand for affection, tenderness, love and sexual relations nearly always present, and its realization should not be inhibited. The sexual reactions are decreased and retarded. Therefore often a change of the role and behaviour pattern of the partners is necessary in the sexual contact. The partners should know their mutual problems and desires, show understanding and should adjust to each other. Counselling, behaviour therapy and treatment with sexual hormones can help to solve the problems.",

      "title": "Social Dysfunction in Psychosis Is More Than a Matter of Misperception: Advances From the Study of Metacognition",
      "abstract": "Many with psychosis experience substantial difficulties forming and maintaining social bonds leading to persistent social alienation and a lack of a sense of membership in a larger community. While it is clear that social impairments in psychosis cannot be fully explained by symptoms or other traditional features of psychosis, the antecedents of disturbances in social function remain poorly understood. One recent model has proposed that deficits in social cognition may be a root cause of social dysfunction. In this model social relationships become untenable among persons diagnosed with psychosis when deficits in social cognition result in inaccurate ideas of what others feel, think or desire. While there is evidence to support the influence of social cognition upon social function, there are substantial limitations to this point of view. Many with psychosis have social impairments but not significant deficits in social cognition. First person and clinical accounts of the phenomenology of psychosis also do not suggest that persons with psychosis commonly experience making mistakes when trying to understand others. They report instead that intersubjectivity, or the formation of an intimate shared understanding of thoughts and emotions with others, has become extraordinarily difficult. In this paper we explore how research in metacognition in psychosis can transcend these limitations and address some of the ways in which intersubjectivity and more broadly social function is compromised in psychosis. Specifically, research will be reviewed on the relationship between social cognitive abilities and social function in psychosis, including measurement strategies and limits to its explanatory power, in particular with regard to challenges to intersubjectivity. Next, we present research on the integrated model of metacognition in psychosis and its relation to social function. We then discuss how this model might go beyond social cognitive models of social dysfunction in psychosis by describing how compromises in intersubjectivity occur as metacognitive deficits leave persons without an integrated sense of others' purposes, relative positions in the world, possibilities and personal complexities. We suggest that while social cognitive deficits may leave persons with inaccurate ideas about others, metacognitive deficits leave persons ill equipped to make broader sense of the situations in which people interact and this is what leaves them without a holistic sense of the other and what makes it difficult to know others, share experiences, and sustain relationships. The potential of developing clinical interventions focused on metacognition for promoting social recovery will finally be explored.",

      "title": "Shame and Male Gender Identity.",
      "abstract": "The literature on the male gender role portrays as lacking weakness, need, doubt, or any of the female values such as sympathy, concern, or empathy. It is contended that Western society develops, reinforces, and maintains gender roles by the emotion shame; many males are motivated in part by an effort to avoid or escape shameful feelings. Shame is basically the felt variation between one's self and one's idealized self--the feeling of not measuring up. Shame arises in early childhood, before the development of certain language skills, so shame may not be readily accessible to verbally organized adult cognitions. Ironically, certain avoidance behaviors maintain many masculine stereotypes: (1) strong and brave; (2) competitive; (3) emotionally unexpressive; (4) problem solver; (5) isolated; (6) sexual, not sensual; (7) dynamic, decisive, and aggressive; (8) controlling; (9) tough and autonomous. These attributes of real men are desirable to some degree but when they are positioned as absolutes and are maintained by shaming and avoidance of shame then these behaviors become dysfunctional and destructive. The author argues for a removal of the limits on behavior and feeling and the re-incorporation of the so called non-male parts back into men's psyches.

Uno de los factores implicados en manifestaciones de situaciones violentas es la autoestima. Ante la exposición continuada de violencia en su relación de pareja, se tornan más vulnerables de presentar manifestaciones psicopatológicas como un trastorno depresivo y ansioso. Es en esas últimas variables expuestas en las que esta investigación pretende basarse. Se realiza una investigación bibliográfica acerca de las publicaciones científicas que refieren implicaciones psicológicas de ansiedad y depresión desencadenada en mujeres víctimas de violencia. A través del análisis de la información, la semántica y el resumen se expone de manera general la información encontrada como más importante a considerar. Superar la violencia de pareja es un proceso no solo individual, sino social, con avances y retrocesos. Las repercusiones en la salud no se limitan al sexo o al género. Entonces, se puede concluir que existe una relación directa entre el diagnóstico de ansiedad o depresión o la combinación de ambas en mujeres que son víctima de violencia de pareja en donde se destacan elementos como la autoestima, edad de las víctimas, estado civil, dependencia económica, cultura y creencias religiosas. La violencia psicológica suele ser la más común. No existe, hasta ahora, un conceso o protocolo que defina como se supera el cuadro psicológico de una víctima de violencia de pareja.

      "title": "Homosexuality",
      "abstract": "Abstract The etiology of sexual orientation can be viewed from a scientific, ethical, or socio-politico-religious perspective. The latter view makes the question of etiology more consequential because of the prejudice and hostility against homosexuals in our society. Societal homophobia rests on four basic assumptions: (1) it is sinful/immoral, (2) it is “unnatural,” (3) it is a chosen form of behavior that can therefore be unchosen, and (4) it is potentially contagious. The first assumption is a religious view for which dissemination of current research findings can help to undermine the irrationality of religiously based homophobia. The second assumption that homosexuality is contrary to the biological norm is not based on contemporary zoological research. The third and fourth assumptions that homosexuality is chosen and can be spread to others similarly lacks a scientific basis. If therapists believe homosexuality is an acquired behavior pattern (even if they consider themselves to be neutral with regard to homosexuality), their conscious or unconscious bias in favor of a heterosexual way of life may lead them to exert subtle but significant pressure on the patient towards a heterosexuality which does not come naturally. Such pressures can amplify self-rejection and inferiority. For that reason, the new views on the etiology of homosexuality are indeed important.",

      "title": "[Psychological aspects of voluntary induced abortion among fathers drafted into military service].",
      "abstract": "This work examines the symptomatology of 4 young men recently drafted into military service in France who had negative reactions to their partner's abortions. The men ranged in age from 19-21 years. In all cases there was frank depression, accompanied or not by activity illegal in the eyes of the military (unauthorized leave) or of the common law (theft, use of drugs). The abortion was either a pretext for a rapid decompensation of a pathological personality, or it occasioned a crisis in personalities previously relatively well adapted despite immaturity, psychopathology, or weakness. The organization of the couples tended to be recent, unstable, precarious, and without a promising future either affectively or socioeconomically. Either the woman decided to seek an abortion herself and presented the father with an accomplished fact, or the couple tacitly made a joint decision to seek an abortion, in which case the subsequent illegal activity of the father tended to be more serious. Each of the men had conflictive family relationships with their fathers especially perceived as hostile and rejecting. All of the men had attempted suicide or had considered it. Induction into the army has traditionally been seen as a rite of passage to adult life, but in some cases the emotional distances it causes and the socioeconomic difficulties it aggravates prevent the man from undertaking the responsibilities of fatherhood. In these cases it is as if social maturity can be acquired only at the expense of fatherhood; the 2 states cannot coexist. Frustration and sacrifice of fatherhood nevertheless may occasion loss of the social maturity stemming from military service. The abortion is followed by guilt, psychic suffering, and behavioral problems leading to expulsion from the military. On the symbolic level the man does not become either man or father. Another point is that depression, anxiety, and guilt are an affective expression of the idea of death; the embryo is thought of as an infant when in fact it is only potentially an infant. On the unconscious level the father may identify with the aborted fetus in the belief that his own parents may have wanted to destroy him. The abortion may also contain a suicidal element to the extent that the fetus represents a prolongation of the parent. The anxiety and guilt of the father find expression also in auto- and heteroaggressive acts. Through a mechanism of projection, responsibility of the army is substituted for that of the individual.",

The social worker is confronted by such issues as—how can one help a person who rejects the intrusion of others in his life, without diminishing the dignity of that individual? How can one avoid the autocratic qualities of direction and the threatening constraint over behaviour which can not only demean, but also rob a person of making an unfettered choice? Is it possible to aid constructively the development of attitudes which line up with what society demands, when, for example, the individual knows that his liberty or the receipt of welfare assistance, or the custody of members of his own family, is contingent on his strict conformity with the advice of the social worker? Is there ethical justification for involvement in a situation where the client cannot withdraw without often serious personal loss and where frequently there is not full comprehension on his part of what conditional liberty, or the granting of assistance, or compliance with social sanction, means by way of his own commitment to the relationship?",

Just as we have learned that child abuse and neglect are not the simple product of any one factor operating uniformly in all situations, so we are beginning to see that to understand adolescent maltreatment we must identify the special blend of circumstances surrounding and enveloping troubled youth in troubled families. In understanding the origins and significance of adolescent maltreatment, we need to go beyond nostalgic images of adolescents to recognize the sinister images of adolescents as a class. Adolescence constitutes by definition an interruption of peaceful growth which resembles in appearance a variety of other emotional upsets and structural upheavals. The adolescent manifestations come close to symptom formation of the neurotic, psychotic or dissocial order and merge almost imperceptibly into borderline states, initial, frustrated or fully fledged forms of almost all the mental illnesses.",

      "title": "Risk adaptation: A continuous learning process in the context of unrepeatable phenomena",
      "abstract": "Humanity is periodically affected by natural disasters, medical, environmental or military crises with an impact on large sections of the population. The reality observed by the population and the intervention modalities have influenced the way in which the notion of “risk” is perceived. Many everyday events are not taken into account by people, as the negative consequences are less likely to occur. Therefore, the subjectively perceived gravity of the consequences of certain events increases the attention paid to the presumed risks. Situations in which the causal relationship is directly perceptible, such as natural disasters, are usually appreciated. Suspicion and ignorance of risks increase with the imperceptibility of causal relationships or where understanding requires a high level of expertise. In the case of the current coronavirus pandemic, we are dealing with the situation of feeling effects directly (through personal infection or from someone we know) and indirectly through the information collected through the media, without knowing the generating causes. The explanations are heterogeneous, from various sources, unverifiable, often unsupported and scientifically unfounded. The explanations from the scientific world are complex, resulting from the interpretation of a multitude of scientific aspects, each of which is the subject of complex research, and the explanatory mechanisms are not accessible to the general masses due to lack of medical knowledge. If we add to the complexity of medical explanations the explanations provided by media channels by sensory-oriented public sources, manipulation, representation of foreign interests to some states, we find that the current picture of the structure of astounding and disturbing public information is created for a large part of the population it becomes suspicious under the influence of destabilizing messages. This article aims to initiate an approach to know how risks drive the creation of protection strategies in the context of unique or rare phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Slippery slope arguments appear regularly whenever morally contested social change is proposed. Such arguments assume that all or some consequences which could possibly flow from permitting a particular practice are morally unacceptable. Typically, “slippery slope” arguments claim that endorsing some premise, doing some action or adopting some policy will lead to some definite outcome that is generally judged to be wrong or bad. The “slope” is “slippery” because there are claimed to be no plausible halting points between the initial commitment to a premise, action, or policy and the resultant bad outcome. The desire to avoid such projected future consequences provides adequate reasons for not taking the first step. Thus the legalization of abortion in limited circumstances is asserted to lead down the slippery slope towards abortion on demand and even infanticide; and the legalization of assisted suicide to lead inexorably to the acceptance of voluntary euthanasia and subsequently to the sanctioning of the practice of nonvoluntary euthanasia – even involuntary euthanasia of “undesirable” individuals.",

Such practice is contrary to recommendations in the 2006 Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders. When psychological preparation is lacking for aspects of DSD such as uncertainty about future gender identity, a false sense of urgency can propel parents to agree to genital surgery or removal of gonads without adequate understanding of the long-term consequences in adulthood. If physicians are uncomfortable discussing gender and sexual issues, they may not explore the feasibility of, or offer support for, alternative approaches towards sex atypicality. Families may draw unrealistic conclusions regarding the extent to which such interventions will relieve their distress and improve quality of life for the child and family. Failing to offer adequate psychosocial support to parents making irreversible decisions about DSD can raise significant ethical and legal concerns. Families may experience regret and anger when they make decisions on the basis of limited or even biased information while in an emotionally vulnerable state. Children's autonomy is violated when they are completely excluded from decision-making. We propose adoption of a holistic approach to emotionally and cognitively informed consent in this setting, with inclusion of psychosocial and peer support from the earliest stages.",

It covers gender-identity disorders, paraphiliac disorders (perversions), and ego-dystonic homosexualities. Gender-identity disorders and paraphilias are usually described as occurring less frequently in women than in men because of differing vicissitudes in separation-individuation. Recent hypotheses about etiologies for both gender-identity disorders and paraphilias in women stem from analysis of specific female developmental vicissitudes. Paraphilias have classically been viewed as related to oedipal castration anxiety, but recent writers have emphasized distortions of both gender and sexuality. The literature on female homosexualities encompasses many etiological explanations, among them oedipal issues; castration anxiety; excessive aggression; triumph over traumatic experiences or gender prejudices; disturbances in gender identity, feminine identification, or separate identity; ego adaptations to disturbed preoedipal maternal object relations; an adaptive search for greater intimacy; and normal biological variance.",

The relationship between self-neglect and safeguarding in the UK is a difficult one, partly because the current definition of abuse specifies harmful actions by someone other than the individual at risk. Safeguarding Adults Boards’ policies and procedures commonly contain no reference to self-neglect; occasionally they explicitly exclude it or set criteria for its inclusion\r\n\r\nThe perceptions of people who neglect themselves have not been extensively researched, but where they have, emerging themes are pride in self-sufficiency, connectedness to place and possessions and behaviour that attempts to preserve continuity of identity and control. Traumatic histories and life-changing effects are also present in individuals’ own accounts of their situation.\r\n\r\nSelf-neglect is reported mainly as occurring in older people, although it is also associated with mental ill health. Differentiation between inability and unwillingness to care for oneself, and capacity to understand the consequences of one’s actions, are crucial determinants of response. Professional tolerance of self-neglect as lifestyle choice is higher than when it accompanies physical/mental impairment. Professionals express uncertainty about causation and intervention.",

I rely on an understanding of adequate parental love which includes several characteristics: parents should not make children feel they are loved conditionally, for features such as intelligence, looks or temperament; they should not burden children with parental expectations concerning particular achievements of the child; and parental love is often expressed in spontaneous enjoyment and discovery of children’s features. This understanding of parental love provides a reason to question the legitimacy of parental use of selection and enhancement and to explain why parents should not engage on a quest for the ‘best child’.",

      "abstract": "OFTEN ENOUGH members of one social class have been viewed as struggling with members of other classes, as excluding others from membership in their own class, or as aspiring to become members of higher social classes. Whatever the precise formulation of the situation, the general tone of descriptions of interclass relationships has often been one of competition, antagonism, exclusion, tension, or conflict. Yet ordinary experience suggests that most individuals direct some positive affect toward social classes other than their own in any functioning and enduring system of social stratification. This paper is concerned with a measure of part of this affect (here termed affinity),' and it offers a description of some of the antecedent conditions contributing to different affect distributions. No member of a complex, stratified society carries a cognitive map of the full social system in his head, but surely he always has some general understanding of his own social position in relation to the positions of others. At the very least he will be aware of categories of statuses which are roughly higher, lower, or equal to his own. Again, at a realistic level, his conscious preference for his own or some other may be perfectly clear to him and to others. Yet at the same time his affective attitudes toward positions within the array of positions known to him may not be so clear. A consideration of these often more ambiguous affective attitudes is our concern here. The attraction felt by people for various social positions can be termed status affinity. If a person is primarily and strongly attracted to a specific or set of statuses, his affinity may be said to be focused, but if his primary attraction to a specific position is relatively weak and if he allocates positive affect to other positions as well, his affinity may be described as distributed.2",

Not surprisingly, the psychological stressors of going through adolescence, coupled with major hormonal, physiological and identity development and peer pressure (to fit in with dominant peer norms), result in enormous stress levels that sometimes lead to a variety of mental health disorders, e.g. inadequate coping and/or support structures.",

Because many couples fail and do not have the ability to understand the roots of rejection experienced by their partners, or do not really know the dark past the partner can also be due to the lack of openness from the couple related to the past in the family of each partner. Negative effects will be seen after a few months or a few years in marriage then comes the original negative nature that causes anger and hatred towards the couple. The problem is not only that the impact of refusal can lead to sexual immorality or live in uncleanness in the household and even many infidelities occur because of dissatisfaction from each partner. The point in building a partner's household is not to be blind to see and pay attention to their partner enough just to fall in love to see the appearance and sympathetic nature and attention shown by their partner, but more importantly we can see the background of the past and are ready to accept all the weaknesses that are owned by his partner and completes and helps both partners to build a harmonious and happy home.",

      "title": "A Differential Analysis of the Subtypes of Unresolved States of Mind in the Adult Attachment Interview",
      "abstract": "Abstract Disorganized attachment is most prevalent among high-risk populations, such as maltreated children. Recent attachment literature has demonstrated that one of the best predictors of attachment disorganization is an “Unresolved” parental state of mind regarding a loss or an abuse in the parent's own attachment history. However, although classification in the Unresolved (U) category is always accompanied by specification of the type of trauma that is unresolved (loss, physical abuse, or sexual abuse), much of attachment research has focused on unresolved attachment as one category. The current paper reviews the empirical literature on the parenting outcomes associated with different subtypes of U. The literature demonstrates that parents who have experienced loss or abuse in childhood, which remains unresolved, exhibit atypical care-giving behaviors. Specifically, a history of loss or childhood sexual abuse is found to be associated with more passively withdrawn parental interactions, whereas a history of physical abuse is related to increased negative and hostile interactions. In addition, there appears to be differences in caregiving behaviors between parents whose underlying attachment state of mind is secure versus insecure.",

Expressions of sexuality include style of dress, values, and attitudes as well as hugging, touching, kissing, acting out scenarios/fantasies, sex toys, masturbation, sexual intercourse, and oral genital stimulation, either alone or with another. Regardless of one's role in providing care to patients, most practitioners do not have experience about discussing sexuality and intimacy in a frank, direct, and authentic manner. Addressing sexuality issues early on in the assessment and treatment of the patient allows the practitioner to open up a line of communication with the patient so that these issues can be addressed as they come up in the future. People with advanced cancer reported a high prevalence of unmet needs related to their sex lives and a high prevalence of sexual dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is a public health problem that affects children worldwide in all ethnic, educational, and socioeconomic groups. These assaults are extremely dangerous not only due to their direct physical traumas received at the time of the abuse, but they also have long-term consequences that can worsen the future quality of the victim’s life. A retrospective study of all cases related to child sexual abuse for five years was performed by materials of the Clinic of Forensic Medicine and Deontology, Sofia, Bulgaria. Ninety-five cases involve children from both genders. The traumatic injuries were carefully examined and classified according to their localization over the victim’s bodies and based on the time that had passed after the reported assaults. In cases of sexual violence, the most informative and pointing at the exact type of violence are the injuries situated in the anogenital area. Too often, there is a lack of physical findings, depending on the type of sexual violence or associated with the prolonged time that passes after the crime. Children are unaware of what they have to do after suffering such traumas, or they are scared to share their experience with different family members, which can lead to late forensic examination and lack of physical and biological findings, which are the most critical traces in the criminal prosecution of the crimes and this can be a possibility for the perpetrator not to be charged for his unlawful actions.",

These attributions have social causes and emotional consequences (Seeman 1959; Wheaton 1980). Theory and research indicate that belief in personal control is associated with low levels of psychological distress compared to the belief that outcomes are determined by forces external to oneself. Less is known about the varieties of these external forces. If people do not attribute success to pesonal control, they may attribute it to luck, family background, connections, or God I examine the relationship of various attributions of success with distress, as measured by symptoms of depression and anxiety. I find that attributing success in life to luck and to good connections with others significantly increase distress. However, attributing success to God and to family background are not significantly associated with distress. The internal attribution of success to personal control significantly decreases distress. I discuss possible reasons why some external attributions increase distress, while others do not.",

      "abstract": "Prejudice is a broad social phenomenon and area of research, complicated by the fact that intolerance exists in internal cognitions but is manifest in symbol usage (verbal, nonverbal, mediated), law and policy, and social and organizational practice. It is based on group identification (i.e., perceiving and treating a person or people in terms of outgroup membership); but that outgroup can range from the more commonly known outgroups based on race, sex/gender, nationality, or sexual orientation to more specific intolerances of others based on political party, fan status, or membership in some perceived group such as “blonde” or “athlete.” This article begins with the link of culture to prejudice, noting specific culture-based prejudices of ethnocentrism and xenophobia. It then explores the levels at which prejudice might be manifest, finally arriving at a specific focus of prejudice—racism; however, what applies to racism may also apply to other intolerances such as sexism, heterosexism, classism, or ageism. The discussion and analysis of prejudice becomes complicated when we approach a specific topic like racism, though the tensions surrounding this phenomenon extend to other intolerances such as sexism or heterosexism. Complications include determining the influences that might lead to individual racism or an atmosphere of racism, but also include the very definition of what racism is: Is it an individual phenomenon, or does it refer to an intolerance that is supported by a dominant social structure? Because overt intolerance has become unpopular in many societies, researchers have explored how racism and sexism might be expressed in subtle terms; others investigate how racism intersects with other forms of oppression, including those based on sex/gender, sexual orientation, or colonialism; and still others consider how one might express intolerance “benevolently,” with good intentions though still based on problematic racist or sexist ideologies.",

The orientations, ideologies, beliefs, and schemas held by a parent regarding his or her gender, or the idea of gender as a whole, become a part of his or her personality. As agents of personality development for a child, including his gender identity, these ideologies held by a parent, as well as that of the other members of the family, play an essential role, which will be discussed in detail. The psychological viewpoints on the development of a person's gender identity, and how behaviors are shaped by the gender gaps that are brought about or play an important role in child rearing, are some of the other subsequent themes that will be looked into in depth. Gender gaps can be exhibited primarily in two ways. Firstly, the gap between the parents (or immediate family members) in terms of their gender, and secondly, the gap is found due to the biological sex of the child and his or her subsequent gender identity.",

      "title": "Psychodynamic Perspective of Sexual Obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder that is characterized by the presence of obsessions and compulsions. OCD can occur in a wide range of subtypes, which may include sexual OCD, i.e., the occurrence of intrusive sexual thoughts. People with sexual OCD may experience unwanted obsessive sexual thoughts about a family member, dead or inanimate objects, animals, God, or children, which can range from mild to severe levels of occurrence. The psychodynamic perspective on OCD suggests that the content of obsessive thinking is commonly drawn from primitivized sexuality and aggression. It further suggests that in the absence of key relationships that include emotional proximity, mirroring and containment, and attunement, a child experiences a void-like state. Consequently, the anxiety that arises in the child leads to a form of liveliness in a “dead” inner world. However, it occurs out of a sense of abandonment and loss of good objects, and ultimately out of fear of annihilation. As a result, the child resorts to maladaptive defense mechanisms. The study attempts to explore the adverse early childhood experiences such as parental neglect, mother–father conflict, and lack of parental love and care leading to fixation in psychosexual stages of development, which further leads to the adoption of maladaptive defense mechanisms that in turn further contribute to the development of obsessional personality traits. This study aims to explain the psychodynamic perspective on the emergence of sexual obsessions by proceeding with a case study approach by taking a diagnosed case of OCD. A comprehensive psychodiagnostic assessment was conducted with the help of Draw-a-Person Test, Thematic Apperception Test, Rotter’s Incomplete Sentence Blank, and Million’s Comprehensive Multiaxial Inventory. The analysis of the assessment protocol revealed a strong relationship between the defense mechanism, personality traits, and the development of obsessive symptoms.",

Preventing low-level stressors developing into pervasive stress requires identifying and sharing the nature of the stress that each partner is under. This helps to build empathy and adds resilience to their relationship. Stress may come from, or be expressed through, sexual functioning. The impact of comorbid conditions and interactions between prescribed and non-prescribed substances need to be taken into account in understanding sexual problems. Enabling couples to have a satisfying-enough sex life, and to cope with each partner's differences about this, requires them to understand more about their sexual make-up. This applies to gay and lesbian as well as heterosexual couples. The former are likely to have to cope with additional stresses arising from external and internal homophobia.",

      "title": "Young adults' attachment styles and beliefs about the \"true love\"",
      "abstract": "During their lives, people show different attachment styles in their close relationships, depending on inner working models about themselves and others they have formed in childhood. These working models reflect on two attachment dimensions – anxiety and avoidance. Depending on the level of anxiety and avoidance in their romantic relationships, people show one of four attachment styles: secure, preoccupied, dismissive and fearful (Bartholomew, 1990). People also have different beliefs about l true lover - what true love is, how difficult it is to find it, what does one need to obtain it or what has to be done in order to develop and maintain it. Most of these beliefs are misconceptions about love and could lead to dysfunctional emotional and behavioral consequences (Milivojevic, 2002). When in love, every person would like that his/her conception about love would become a reality. If this conception is actually a misconception, a person may conclude that his/her relationship does not represent true love. He/she may become unsure and anxious about the relationship or even may leave the partner and try to find a better one. The purpose of this study is to determine the level of dysfunctional beliefs about love among young adults and to relate them with their style of attachment with romantic partners. This was analyzed in the context of participants’ gender, age, previous experiences, and satisfaction with current relationship. The sample of students from University of Zagreb was tested with two instruments: Beliefs about true love questionnaire (Milivojevic, 1995) and Experiences in Close Relationships Inventory (Brennan et al., 1998). Results have shown complex relations between the level of misconceptions about the true love, the attachment style, and satisfaction with current relationship, leading to a conclusion that people having secure attachment with their romantic partners have less misconceptions about love and are more satisfied with their relationship. Results on the anxiety and avoidance dimension of attachment were differently related to beliefs about true love, which may help to predict the behavioral consequences of unfulfilled beliefs and expectations from a romantic relationship. The implications for the cognitive therapy are discussed.",

      "title": "Some Evidence Bearing on the Aim-Inhibition Hypothesis of Love",
      "abstract": "ONE OF THE more tenacious but, curiously, not very provacative issues centering around premarital sexuality concerns the consequences of coitus on established love relationships. Although sexual involvement between meaningful pair members is sometimes advocated in the folk culture, it is usually with the intent of precipitating a commitment for marriage; the generation of feelings of obligation and guilt, not love, become paramount. With respect to enhancing love, we find little encouragement for sexual activity. Quite to the contrary, our culture abounds with expressions admonishing the young, especially the female, of the unhappy consequences of premarital intercourse. Premarital concessions, she is warned, bring rejection and vitiates the love relationship. Generations of daughters have been cautioned that he won't love (respect) you anymore. This avenue of thought is by no means unique to the layman. Significant figures in sociology and psychology have also invested belief in the hypothesis that sexual intercourse corrupts love. Contemporary family writers, influenced by the works of Freud (1960) and Waller (1938), perpetuate with varying degrees of commitment the aim-inhibition hypothesis: romantic love is the consequence of sexual inaccessibility of the love object. Although a wide variety of explanations are offered concerning the psychological mechanics underlying this hypothesis, the central idea is essentially that romantic love is a subliminal phenomenon emerging from the social frustration of biological impulses. For our purposes, aim-inhibition is synonymous with the idea that romantic love and sex are incompatible, the dynamics accounting for that incompatibility being ignored. There has been a paucity of research on the consequences of sex on love in American society. The existent studies, however, do not support the aim-inhibition hypothesis (Burgess and Wallin, 1953:239-242; Kirkendall, 1961:chapter 8). For some of the more devout proponents of the hypothesis, the coup de grace has simply been the observation that romantic love tends not to survive long into marriage.' Efforts have also been exerted to bring anthropological materials to bear on this issue. These investigations have, at best, produced mixed evidence (Blood, 1952; Stephens, 1963:207; Chard, 1961). It is possible, moreover, that these cross-cultural studies have been aimed at a conceptually alien question, i.e., not whether the introduction of sexual intercourse vitiates love but rather do the two elements tend to co-exist on a societal level at any given time.

In those ways, they are like more ordinary sexual preferences, generating sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals are strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them are unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet, since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct to not trust the individuals with such preferences and to attempt to monitor or control them. However, most such efforts appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome. The possibility of voluntary castration for such offenders, in lieu of preventive detention or other more restrictive measures, is explored.",

      "abstract": "The generality of failure theory links arrest – a \"failure\" at crime – to other failures later on in life such as getting a sexually transmitted disease or losing a job. Yet, this theoretical orientation also suggests the opposite may be true. Early life failures such as failing a class in school and becoming an underage parent may be a marker of an individual likely to fail at crime later in life. We test this theory using eleven waves of data from the Pathways to Desistance survey. Findings demonstrate that both personal failures (e.g., becoming an underage parent, failing a class) and public failures (e.g., being fired from a job, suspended from school) early in life are significantly associated with failing at crime later in life. Results persist even after accounting for a wide range of potential confounding factors such as criminal offending, illicit substance use, IQ, and self-control. Findings highlight the utility of the generality of failure theory in understanding deviant behavior.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Love is a complex emotional state that can be used to describe relationships between family members, friends, or romantic partners. Love‐like states that are not, strictly speaking, love are often confused with love and are termed “love” by those who experience them. There are several major theories that explain how romantic love develops and is maintained, each of which helps to shed light on how the experience of love varies from person to person, from relationship to relationship, and even within a relationship. Romantic love is idealized in some cultures, and marriage without love is deemed shameful or unthinkable. Love is generally seen as a requirement when one is choosing one's own mate, though historically this was not always the case. Love as a motivation for marriage is a relatively recent phenomenon, made reasonable by increases in life expectancy. Love also seems to be a physiologic state, capable of causing visible difference in reactions on magnetic brain imaging.",

      "title": "Discrimination and stigma",
      "abstract": "Abstract Discrimination and stigma operate as two distinct but concomitant phenomena and, as a result, affect attitudes, behaviours, and policies against underprivileged populations and often those with mental illnesses. Stigma has been defined as the ‘social devaluation’ of an individual or group. This is based on certain characteristics that such an individual or group is identified with and is an outcome of cognitive processes and negative attitudes that lead to rejecting behaviours at physical, social, or psychological levels. Stigma arises from the implicit belief and bias (conscious or unconscious) that individuals with certain undesired characteristics are inferior and therefore unworthy of equal treatment, respect, and dignity. Discrimination entails a range of behaviours, practices, laws, or policies that result in the marginalization of certain individuals or groups in society. It may manifest as unequal treatment, human rights violations, and social exclusion. Discrimination often can be tackled in law; therefore, it is important to understand the role of laws and policies in addressing discrimination. Persons with psychosocial disability are often discriminated against, do not have equal rights, and, in many countries, cannot marry, vote, make a will, or have employment rights. Preventing discrimination requires a range of anti-discrimination laws, policies, and decisions that address specific disadvantages and harms caused to such individuals. This needs a fundamental transformation of existing social structures and the removal of barriers to ensure that people with mental illnesses and consequent psychosocial disabilities have equal rights.",

      "abstract": "Chronic disease is not a strictly defined term and includes a large number of illnesses ranging from physical to mental impairment. It is estimated that between 10% and 20% of adolescents have a chronic disease. Independence and new relations, acceptance of a new body image and sexuality, career plans and cognitive maturation are core topics in development to adulthood. Chronic disease may interfere with these developmental tasks. Most often there is no specific psychopathology, but the type of impairment, its influence on family life and functioning, age at onset, gender, and other factors will interact with psychosocial maturation. Because of the important role of the family, not only the adolescent patient him/herself, but also parents and siblings need to be included in all major decisions. As hospitalizations may be disruptive they must be planned, taking in account the patient's plans and opinions. Chronic disease may lead to death during the period of adolescence. It is believed that the concept of one's own mortality develops at age 14 to 17 years, a fact that will influence care during the terminal stage of a disease. Whatever the problems and questions raised by the family, the developmental stage of the adolescent has always to be considered when dealing with specific issues of chronic disease. Periodic reassessment of psychosocial development is therefore one of the main tasks of the primary care physician. Counselling will address not only the disease but also the developmental tasks of any teenager.",

Many of them struggle with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sexual dysfunction, and self-harming tendencies. Research shows that children who experience such abuse are significantly more vulnerable to being revictimized sometimes not just once, but repeatedly throughout adolescence and even adulthood. Alarmingly, studies indicate they are up to 35 times more likely to be abused again than those who have not faced childhood sexual trauma. This increased susceptibility is often rooted in feelings of self-blame, worthlessness, and shame.This issue becomes even more disturbing when we look at children who live on the margins of society those without shelter, family care, or institutional protection. Children on the streets, in slums, or those forced into child labor such as rag-picking or begging are especially exposed. With no stable home, adult supervision, or legal protection, these children are not only easier targets for sexual predators, but they also lack the means to report abuse or even understand what is happening to them. For many of them, trauma becomes a silent companion unspoken, untreated, and slowly destructive.",

Secondary vaginismus occurs often after vulvovaginal trauma such as infection, childbirth, malignancy or its treatment, or sexual trauma such as rape or abuse.

      "abstract": "School failure is pervasive. Its impact extends beyond the classroom and can contribute to emotional turmoil, social difficulties, delinquent behavior and lifelong maladjustment. School failure does not qualify as a disease, a syndrome, or a unique pathogenetic process. It is rather the product of constitutional predispositions that have interacted with environmental factors and life events in an ongoing process. Intrinsic handicaps may be subtle. Their outward manifestations are likely to vary from child to child and evolve with age, shaped by neurologic maturation, experience, and changing external expectations. Children with school problems form a heterogeneous group with diverse etiologies, symptom complexes, diagnostic findings and service needs. Nine common precursors of school failure are suggested in this review. Although presented individually, these precursors are not necessarily discrete, nor are they mutually exclusive; they may themselves stem from multiple factors. They are conceptualized as \"risk factors\" that may predispose to or foreshadow later failure. These, in turn, interact with a set of variables we have characterized as sources of \"developmental buoyancy.\" The latter may neutralize or counteract early susceptibility to academic problems. Individual children may have one or multiple identifiable precursors of variable severity and differ in the extent to which they can minimize or overcome these potential predispositions to school failure.",

The necessary diagnostic criterion for gender identity disorder of childhood is the presence of a constant desire to belong (or the conviction of belonging) to the opposite sex, coupled with a strong denial of the behavior, characteristics and/or clothing specific to the registered sex. Usually the disorder is manifested in the preschool years, but for diagnosing it is necessary that it manifests before the onset of puberty. Both sexes may have a rejection of anatomical structures inherent in his own sex; however, such unusual display is rare. Patient V. came to the appointment with psychiatrist with parents 3 years ago. During the interview reported that she starts to feel the boy at the age of 9 years. This announcement provoked outrage from parents. With the beginning of the critical days began to position herself in a male person. The patient met all diagnostic criteria for gender identity disorder of childhood. The patient underwent a course of systemic therapy combined with nootropics. Currently, patient name is the name of a female, the patient wears women's clothing, identifies herself as a woman. The patient continues to meet with a psychotherapist, is satisfied with the treatment, thoughts on sex change does not express. Thus, in the case of diagnosis of this disorder can become effective systemic therapy in combination with nootropics.

The theory focuses primarily on parental love—its expressions, impact, and origins. Nearly 2,000 studies in the United States and cross‐culturally confirm the widely held belief that children everywhere need acceptance (love) from parents and other attachment figures. Evidence has shown that when this need is not met, children worldwide—regardless of variations in culture, gender, age, or ethnicity—tend to self‐report a specific form of psychological maladjustment. Additionally, individuals who perceive themselves to be rejected appear to be more disposed than accepted persons to develop behavior problems, depression or depressed affect, substance abuse, and other mental health‐related issues. Finally, children and adults appear universally to organize their perceptions of acceptance‐rejection around the same four classes of behavior. These include warmth/affection (or coldness/lack of affection), hostility/aggression, indifference/neglect, and undifferentiated rejection.",

      "title": "Parental Support, Delinquent Friends, and Delinquency: A Test of Interaction Effects",
      "abstract": "A central focus of control theories of delinquency is the relationship between a youngster's attachment to his parents and his delinquent involvement. Of particular interest is the notion of sensitivity to parents' wishes or opinions. Simply, the greater the sensitivity, the more likely the child is to consider the wishes and opinions of his parents when contemplating a deviant act. Consequently, major developments of these theories have explored the significance of family relationships in generating a bond to society or stake in conformity.' These theories assume that delinquent behavior results when an individual's bond to society is weak or broken. Thus, lack of family support is viewed as conducive to delinquency. This weak or broken bond ostensibly minimizes one's sensitivity to the opinions or expectations (i.e., norms) of others, freeing the individual to deviate.2 Conversely, the presence of control via parental support is seen as inhibiting delinquency. According to many theorists and researchers,3 a significant effect of a weak bond to parents is the enhanced importance of delinquent friends. Hirschi,4 for example, reported that boys with a low stake in conformity were more susceptible to delinquent peer influences, while boys with a high stake in conformity were relatively immune to these influences. In other words, the greater the stake in conformity, the less the impact of delinquent companions. Stanfield5 presented data consistent with this interaction hypothesis. He found that frequent peer activity was more strongly associated with delinquent behavior among those boys whose fathers' discipline was erratic or low than where it was consistent. Stanfield suggested that lack of consistent or supportive discipline (i.e., control) made boys more vulnerable to the influence of delinquent friends.6 Although both Hirschi and Stanfield demonstrated that family relationships condition the impact of delinquent friends, recent efforts to test propositions derived from control theory have neglected this interaction hypothesis.7 For example, Hepburn8 attempted to assess the empirical consistency of a control theory model of delinquency based upon Hirschi's formulation of the causal structure of the relationships between parental support, delinquent associates, delinquent definitions, and delinquent behavior. However, he failed to incorporate Hirschi's qualifying condition that the effect of delinquent peers on delinquency is contingent upon the level of family support.9 Such an * Assistant Professor of Sociology at Western Carolina University.

Obviously, this new relationship system demands both negotiations and arrangements, while bearing on your emotional state. Hence, the importance of the daily psychosocial stress, since stress is related to the relationship between an individual and his or her environment--an environment likely to outmatch personal psychosocial resources. The present work is aimed at identifying a relationship between some social daily stressors, depressive disturbance, and suicidal ideation among Mexican adolescents. Findings suggest that among male and female adolescents, conflicts with the best friend correlate strongly with a depressive mood also tending to somatizing discomfort: Besides enduring negative affect and somatization, females also tend to feel awkward in their interpersonal relationships, and also suffer from suicidal ideation. So, it could be assessed that a depressive disturbance assumes a different psychopathoplastic expression according to subjects' gender.",

This chapter argues that the evolutionary approach can provide valuable guidance to psychological investigations, and illustrates the thesis with particular reference to our own studies of homicide. An impediment to evolutionary sophistication within psychology has been a suspicion of explanations that invoke ends. The evidence for functional design of violence is multifarious. The social utilities of threats and assaults depend on the relationship-specific conflicts, the social contexts and the parties’ skill in using violence as a tool. Competition amongst same-sex rivals is not the only context for violent conflicts. Men assault wives - the very resource for which rivals compete. In view of the costs of prolonged ‘parental’ investment in non-relatives, it may seem remarkable that step-relationships are ever peaceful. Psychiatrists have identified a personality disorder which is particularly likely to engage in violent aggressivity: the antisocial personality.",

      "title": "Actions that protect: Promoting sexual and reproductive health and choice among young people in India",
      "abstract": "This paper synthesises the evidence on the sexual and reproductive health situation of young people in India, and explores what we know about underlying factors that place them at risk of or protect them from unsafe and unwanted sexual and reproductive health experiences. The picture that emerges suggests that substantial proportions of young people experience risky or unwanted sexual activity, do not receive prompt or appropriate care, and experience adverse reproductive health outcomes. Contextual factors such as poverty, gender imbalances and lack of education or livelihood opportunities clearly increase the vulnerability of youth. Other factors at the family, community and facility level may also exacerbate risk. While young people’s knowledge and awareness about sexual and reproductive health is increasing, much of this knowledge remains superficial and ridden with myths, misperceptions and a sense of invulnerability. Gender power imbalances make risky behaviours acceptable, encourage secrecy and fear of disclosure, and inhibit negotiation among partners. Lack of communication with parents and other trusted adults, similarly, keeps young people ill informed and unlikely to receive parental support or counsel in relation to sexual matters. Sexuality education remains inadequate and irrelevant to young people’s needs, and services remain inaccessible, unacceptable, unaffordable and of indifferent quality. Several encouraging signs are, however, evident. The sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents and young people are on the national agenda. There is growing recognition that young people themselves must be given a role in articulating, designing, implementing and evaluating such programmes. Finally, experiences of a few programmes already exist that appear to successfully respond to young people’s sexual and reproductive health needs in innovative and acceptable ways. The paper concludes by recommending, on the basis of available evidence, a core set of promising actions that protect.",

      "title": "Conceiving a Child to Save a Child: Reproductive and Filial Ethics",
      "abstract": "I conclude that Mary and Abe's decision to conceive a child to save a child does not impose harm on persons or on relationships in the family. Nor does it evince a lack of respect for the child they have conceived. The ethical guidelines that support this conclusion can now be summarized. First, actions should not depersonalize or otherwise endanger personal relationships. Second, although ideally personal relationships are initiated and continued for their own sake, after a personal relationship has been established and sustained the motives for establishing it recede in importance. Third, the requirement of honesty looms especially large in the context of personal relationships. Fourth, privacy protects personal relationships in the family from intrusion by the state. Fifth, even if those with whom we stand in personal relationships are not fully rational or self-conscious, we should treat them with respect. Finally, persons often are called upon to make greater sacrifices in personal relationships. These principles represent only the barest beginnings of an ethics for filial relationships. Nonetheless, they mark progress in the direction of developing a more complete account. We should not suppose that ethics in the family always will be spontaneous or natural. Over a century ago, Mill warned that nature and natural are one of the most copious sources of false taste, false philosophy, false morality, and even bad law. Especially in the wake of medical advances, such as recombinant DNA and new reproductive technologies, the complexity of filial ethics will only increase. The demographics of an aging society will add further complexity to filial contexts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "On-again/Off-again Dating Relationships",
      "abstract": "Breakups do not always mean the end of a romantic relationship. Ex-partners often remain in contact for practical reasons (e.g., they work together, have children), they redefine their relationship into a friendship, and sometimes they reconcile their romantic relationship. This entry reviews the research on on-again/off-again dating relationships (also termed cyclical relationships). Although personality characteristics or relationship dispositions do not differentiate which couples develop a cyclical nature in their relationships and which do not, the evidence suggests they do differ in their interaction dynamics. On-off partners are more likely to report less positive and more negative (e.g., conflict) interactions. They are also more likely to report psychological and physical aggression. They also experience less satisfaction and more relational uncertainty than their non-cyclical counterparts. In post-dissolution phases, however, ex-partners in cyclical relationships have greater sexual satisfaction and more ambivalence about their relationship, which might help explain their repeated reconciliations. Yet, despite on-off partners reporting lower relational quality in general, there are some partners who capitalise on the transitions to improve the relationships. Additionally, the seemingly unstable fluctuations in these relationships might actually denote a stable pattern for some partners.",

      "title": "Principles of Toxicology: A Clinical Review",
      "abstract": "Toxicology can be defined as that branch of science that deals with poisons, and a poison can be defined as any substance that causes a harmful effect when administered, either by accident or design, to a living organism. In short, it is the study of toxic kinetics and toxic dynamic. Poison is a quantitative concept, almost any substance being harmful at some doses but, at the same time, being without harmful effect at some lower dose. Between these two limits there is a range of possible effects, from subtle long-term chronic toxicity to immediate lethality. Vinyl chloride may be taken as an example. It is a potent hepatotoxic at high doses, a carcinogen with a long latent period at lower doses, and apparently without effect at very low doses. The measurement of toxicity is also complex. Toxicity may be acute or chronic, and may vary from one organ to another as well as with age, genetics, gender, diet, physiological condition, or the health status of the organism. Exposure of humans and other organisms to toxicants may result from many activities: intentional ingestion, occupational exposure, environmental exposure, as well as accidental and intentional (suicidal or homicidal) poisoning. The toxicity of a particular compound may vary with the portal of entry into the body, whether through the alimentary canal, the lungs, or the skin. The initial approach to a person who has been poisoned should be to assess the airway, breathing, and circulation, and to take a thorough history. Less than 1 per cent of poisonings are fatal; therefore, management in most cases is supportive unless a specific antidote is available. Treatment for poisoning depends on the type of exposure (e.g., ingestion, inhalation), the specific toxin (poisonous substance), and the severity of the person's condition. Childhood poisoning that involves a foreign object (e.g., small toy, battery) may require surgery to remove the object. This review article gives you an overall view on toxicity, its principles, management and treatment.",

There are two main types of rape fantasies: aversive rape fantasies, which usually involve the use of force to coerce sex and often contain painful violence with no sexual arousal; and erotic rape fantasies, which typically involve low to moderate levels of fear with no realistic violence. Rape fantasies seem to be a social enigma. There are various theories that attempt to rationalize the occurrence of rape fantasies.

      "abstract": "Purpose of review The review assesses recent research and its impact on understanding of intimacy and sexuality in older adults with dementia. Recent findings There is no universally accepted definition of inappropriate sexual behaviors (ISBs), but they have been divided into overt acts associated with increased libido and uninhibited sexual behaviors directed at oneself or other people. Couples affected by dementia frequently maintain physical intimacy. Nonintercourse intimate activities may be preferred over intercourse. Early therapeutic interventions may assist partners in modifying activities, behaviors, and expectations about the future of the relationship. Inappropriate sexual behaviors are commonly due to the disruption of interconnected brain structures. Trauma to the temporal lobes may lead to hypersexuality and ISB. Trauma to the limbic system can produce changes in sexual preference. Both temporal and frontotemporal dementias, or either of them, often present with socially and sexually inappropriate behaviors. Huntington's disease can exhibit hypersexuality, pedophilia, promiscuity, and marital infidelity. The involvement of the medial striatum of the basal ganglia in this disease explains the prevalence of ISB. There is no consensus regarding first-line pharmacotherapy for ISB. Little information is known about the adverse effects. Summary Clinicians and society need to consider how dementia might affect physical intimacy.",

      "title": "Loss of the 'Supplementary Spouse' in Marriages in Later Life",
      "abstract": "An important but often unrecognized relationship must be taken into account. When problems arise in a of many years (marriage here refers to all long-term relationships of committed life partners), one cannot help but ask, Why now? What has happened to challenge and stress the marital bond? What challenge with which they cannot cope is the couple facing now? Is the challenge itself so daunting, or rather, are the resources available to address it inadequate? After all, the couple has a long history of individual and dyadic coping that has been strengthened and refined over the years, and has been applied to numerous challenges. So why now? As a clinician, I often train a diagnostic lens on the individual, appraising what change might have served as precipitant to the current distress. The same questions can be posed when looking at a couple. Is there a new personal challenge for one of the partners? A change in medical condition or medication? Or did something happen to the couple to engender the distress? Has the couple been unsettled by a move, perhaps? Or retirement from work? These frequently occurring events in older age can contribute to structural changes within a marriage, often of sufficient power to cause distress in one or both spouses. The clinical literature addressing these events is extensive. The theme of loss and its impact on the is of continuing importance in later life-most significant, of course, with the eventual death of a There are, however, other losses, often connected to transitional events, that are powerful yet less well identified as contributors to significant structural change in the in later life. These are para-spousal losses, that is, losses of a significant person who plays a very important role in the life of one of the partners in the couple, but is not the spouse-thus the idea of the spouse. While many, perhaps most, marriages in later life are most fittingly thought of as dyada, some are more appropriately described as triads. An apt metaphor could be that of a tripod, a frame with three legs supporting something, in this case a marriage, wherein sturdiness and stability rely on functional intactness of all three legs. In these marriages, the supplementary spouse is the third leg of the tripod. While the specific relationships are different, all supplementary spouses serve a common function of supporting the marriage. When this critical support is lost, the effect is to bring stress upon the marriage. Consider the supplementary spouse as a supporting beam in a building structure. If this beam becomes damaged or collapses, the consequence can be that the entire structure becomes damaged or collapses. Sometimes the loss of a supplementary spouse is behind the presenting problems that come to clinical attention. The major functions of in older age (truly, at any age) are collaboration, companionship, support, intimacy, and self-continuity; the supplementary spouse serves to fulfill these functions well. The supplementary spouse, thus, is an integral segment of the marital triad. Included in this collection of relationships, among others, are the long-term lover, the intimate friend and confidante, the companion, the work wife,'' and the recreational buddy? In the case of the long-term lover, an affair often develops over the years into a marriage with defined rules, roles, and responsibilities and the lover now aparallel. What begins as a relationship outside the primary evolves, over the long term, into a parallel defined as a committed life-partner relationship. Over time, the edges of the two marriages-once having been parallel, maintaining a constant distance apart and thus never meeting-often become increasingly comparable and, not unusually, meet and cross. …",

      "abstract": "When individuals collectively challenge authorities via social movements, they typically do so over matters about which they are deeply troubled, have considerable concern, and feel passionately. These troublesome matters or conditions, and the feelings associated with them – such as dissatisfaction, fear, indignation, resentment, and moral shock – can be thought of as grievances. They provide the primary motivational impetus for organizing social movement campaigns and for engaging in social movement activities. Although there are various sets of conditions that contribute to the emergence and operation of social movements – such as some degree of perceived political opportunity, organization, and resource acquisition, none of these factors is more important than the generation of mobilizing grievances. After all, it is difficult to imagine most individuals engaging in social movement activity without feeling deeply aggrieved about some condition that is regarded as contrary to the interests, rights, moral principles, or wellbeing of themselves or others. Consider the adherents of the pro‐choice and pro‐life movements, and of those advocating for and against same‐sex marriages in the United States or immigration and tighter border control throughout much of the developed world. Not only are the adherents of one movement deeply aggrieved by the prospect of the other movement achieving its goals, but their passions about their movement are often palpable and thus worn, metaphorically, on their sleeves. Certainly, other motivational factors – such as curiosity, the desire for approval, and peer pressure – may come into play when considering why people align themselves with a particular movement, but these usually are secondary and largely irrelevant in the absence of deeply felt grievances.",

      "title": "MEN’S AND WOMEN’S LANGUAGE: INQUIRIES ABOUT HEALTH IN JORDANIAN ARABIC",
      "abstract": "This paper investigates some of the strategies used by Jordanian men and women to ask about each others' health. Jordanian women usually inquire more than men about the hearer's health and about his children's and relatives' health simply to establish social contact and to show sincere concern for the well-being of the addressees' family. There are some situations on which the asker cannot talk about directly especially in mixed-dyads; therefore, he should use some euphemistic terms or use indirect expressions to avoid offence to the askee. For example, the fact that a male asking about a sick female's health improperly may be considered a social mistake because mentioning a female's name in front of foreign or marriageable people or mentioning the name of some diseases are taboo; this may cause embarrassment to the speaker and his addressee. Therefore, men tend to use more euphemistic terms due to their wider experience and other's sensitivity of men's speech upon using non-euphemistic terms Inquiries about health normally encompass proper forms of address. Women tend to use more relational forms and less formal formulas due to their real sincerity to increase intimacy and rapport with their addressee. Jordanian women use inquiries accompanied with kin terms of address more frequently than men do. They use such terms to address foreign or acquainted people either to express solidarity with the well-acquainted or to increase solidarity with the foreign addressees. Some forms of address are almost sex deictic and non- reciprocal. They are used by old Jordanian women to express intimacy even when the relationship is not intimate. The recipient of the inquiry normally replies ilHamdu lillaah (Praise be to Allah) in bad or good conditions. Men don't usually give a detailed reply about their real conditions; they give a conventional response while women normally give a prolonged answer.",

      "abstract": "Almost 4% of the UK population have some form of physical, sensory, or intellectual impairment—almost 2.5 million people. Many of these disabling conditions can produce sexual problems of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain in men and women. Sexual difficulties may arise from direct trauma to the genital area (due to either accident or disease), damage to the nervous system (such as spinal cord injury), or as an indirect consequence of a non-sexual illness (cancer of any organ may not directly affect sexual abilities but can cause fatigue and reduce the desire or ability to engage in sexual activity). The two main points for consideration are how disabling conditions affect sexual function and behaviour and which sexual difficulties most commonly arise. Women who undergo radical mastectomy or a disfiguring trauma often report concerns about their femininity and self image such as feelings of lowered self worth or the fear that men will find them less attractive. Similarly, young men with erectile dysfunction often avoid meeting potential partners because of their embarrassment over their inability to perform. \"Sexuality\" describes how people express their view of what is sexual. That awareness is the result of all the physical, emotional, intellectual, and social factors that have influenced their development up to that point in their life. Defining sexuality as wider than just physical functionis particularly important for people with disabilities. A person who is not able to use part of his or her body still has an equal right to full sexual expression. ### Key questions in cases of disability Present condition Effect of condition on sexuality",

Some say that there are no willing addicts, only unwilling addicts who are trying to stop but not succeeding, or resigned addicts who are so demoralized they have stopped trying to stop. Willing addiction reminds us that addiction is a phenomenon that involves a person-with-a-lifestyle-inside-an-ecology, that there are good-making features of using even addictively, and that addiction involves many of the same complex, negotiated features (experiential, personal, interpersonal, structural, and cultural) of other person-level lifestyle choices. Willing addiction shows that concepts such as choice, voluntariness, and reflective endorsement have a place in the psychology and phenomenology of addiction. There are implications for the psych-bio-politics of addiction and for the implausible idea that addiction is a brain disorder. Addiction is not a brain disorder, although certain aspects or features of addiction involve brain disorders.",

      "title": "Identification in healthy and pathological character formation.",
      "abstract": "The character of the ego is built up via a series of identifications carried out in the course of development. As infants are forced by experience to give up the 'internal illusion' of primal identification with the powerful mother, the sense of helplessness that ensues leads to secondary identification to create an 'external illusion' of oneness with the mother during heightened stress or tension. Adequate experiences, leading to increasing trust and tolerance of frustration and tension, promote ego structuralization, self-object differentiation, and oedipal, triadic object relations. Inadequate experiences lead to pathological identifications that interfere with ego development. Oedipal conflicts produce new problems, which are dealt with in part by complex identifications that contribute extensively to the child's personality structure. Superego crystallization derives largely from these later identifications. In optimal circumstances, the identifications out of which the child's character is built become reworked and modified so that it becomes increasingly unique and independent of its sources in others. Stability is never absolute, however. Under stress, reversion is possible to dependence on powerful, charismatic leaders that offers return to the illusion of identificatory union with a powerful, protective, parental 'other'. This can be exploited by potentially dangerous, destructive leaders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Whether one is speaking of the qualities that make life worthwhile (such as love, health, friendship, recognition) or the things that define the wherewithal of life (food, clothing, possessions), they are all scarce, and unequally distributed. Villagers may perceive migrants or city dwellers as more fortunate than they are. Women in arranged marriages may envy those who married for love. Men may be regarded as having greater authority than women, and the old as having unfair advantages over the young. Scarcity and inequality are also affective phenomena. A powerful chief may be oppressed by his sexual impotence. A husband will be seen to favor one wife over another. A young man will resent the privileged position of his first-born brother. And though the young are enjoined to respect the old, the old are not always deserving of respect. In other words, speaking one's mind or expressing one's true feelings is often incompatible with the demands of etiquette, and this puts people in double-binds.",

      "abstract": "Looked after and adopted children are among the most vulnerable in our society and it is well established that they present with a higher prevalence of mental health problems than children who live with their birth family. In their histories, they frequently have birth parents who have lived chaotic lives, some with mental health problems and substance misuse, and have experienced disruptions of care as well as exposure to neglect and/or abuse. However, often when they try to access mental health services, all their problems are formulated as ‘trauma and attachment issues’ with lack of data to support these. This article presents a case study of a 15-year-old boy whose severe difficulties were understood and formulated in terms of ‘attachment problems’ for many years. Neuro-developmental issues, unrelated to his being removed from his birth parents and adopted, had not been considered as the biological factors of the formulation (e.g. genetics and intra-uterus events) were ignored. Because there are no evidence-based interventions for a vaguely defined presentation such as ‘attachment problems’, he was given non-evidenced therapies for years and the parents felt blamed. Understandably, there was then little progress with his difficulties and this in turn had a very detrimental impact on his family, academic and social life. It is recommended that looked after and adopted children have their presentations formulated using a biopsychosocial model that takes into account their complexities to personalise future interventions, just like children who live with their birth parents. It is imperative they stop receiving mental health services where ‘one size fits all’ and that the training of staff working with this group ensures that children’s whole life experiences are understood.",

      "abstract": "People often act hypocritically. One form of hypocrisy occurs when people blame others for transgressing moral principles – such as profiting from harming others – that they themselves have violated in the past. However, the psychological processes associated with this hypocritical blame are largely unknown. One possibility is that hypocritical blame is related to the costs of being prosocial, such that a person could have the intention to help but might not be willing to put in the effort. Here, we test whether a measure of hypocritical blame that quantifies the discrepancy between how willing people are to profit from another’s harm, and how much they blame somebody else for similarly profiting, is associated with a task measuring how willing someone is to choose and then exert physical effort to benefit themselves or an anonymous other. Results revealed that hypocritical blame is associated with reduced prosocial motivation specifically, and not with how willing people are to exert effort for their own benefit. This effect was found in both a reduced willingness to choose to be prosocial and for energising prosocial acts. This suggests that the discrepancy between moral standards and actions is related to the willingness to overcome the costs of being prosocial, with some people being simply unwilling to exert the effort required to live up to their moral principles.",

The shared aetiology not only aids understanding of the co-occurrence that has been documented between animal cruelty and other aggressive and antisocial crimes, it also highlights the dangers over and above those to animals that are lurking where animal cruelty offenders remain unidentified and their crimes remain unsanctioned. This article reviews current understandings about the development of antisocial behaviors, including human aggression, and animal cruelty behaviors. Available research leads one to ask, when individuals have been found to be guilty of animal cruelty, what other aggressive behaviors might they be guilty of? For young children, one must ask, are they victims of child abuse, are they living in circumstances of domestic violence, and/or what is the aggression or violence that they may have been witness to? Animal cruelty, and most aggressive behaviors from the later childhood years onward, are indicators of non-normative development. Early detection of such behaviors can provide a valuable opportunity to engage in preventative intervention for young people or for appropriate sanctions to be applied for adults. Such interventions would be beneficial for all, humans and animals alike.",

One does not give in publicly to a group, or modify one's way of viewing the environment, without resistance and confrontations. When two points of view appear irreconcilable their respective sponsors are inclined to engage in conflict. They do not do so light-heartedly, since any questioning of the social consensus on this or that issue promises trouble and suffering for the future. What is more, as reality does not generally tolerate two definitions at once, this conflict will lead either to abandonment of the position and public conformity (during the interaction) to a norm not really accepted so as to reach agreement on the issue, or to the maintenance of the position (coming to terms only with oneself or one's own group), the other viewpoint being treated as the deviant or abnormal one.",

Among women experience orgasm during intercourse or masturbation is not a goal in itself.

Having a high level of self-disclosure to a romantic partner can increase positive relationship outcomes, including liking, love, trust, and relationship satisfaction. However, too much self-disclosure may negatively affect relationship outcomes. When one person discloses too much and too intimate information to another person, the self-disclosure may arouse anxiety in the other. In addition, people with a secure attachment style or an ambivalent attachment style, tend to self-disclose more than people with an avoidant attachment style. Further, people with a secure attachment style tend to reciprocate self-disclosure more than people with an ambivalent or avoidant attachment style. A romantic partner's responsiveness to self-disclosure is also important in relationship outcomes, suggesting that the partner needs to respond to the discloser in an understanding, caring, or validating way in order to develop the relationship.",

The exciting cause may not always be discoverable, but would be sought, if wanted, in the period immediately preceding the onset. Contributory causes can occur throughout life, from birth to the date of onset. It is agreed, also, that in addition there must be a predisposition (though the strength of this as a causal factor varies, roughly, in inverse proportion to the others). It is in the localization of the predisposing (and specific) factors that authorities differ. The older psychiatrists confined it to the lifetime of the ancestors; psychoanalysts accept, in general, what they have been told about ancestral responsibility, but have focused attention, as regards predisposition for subsequent breakdown, on a later period, namely the first five or six post-conceptional years. This they regard as the developmental period of the psyche, and they consider that influences at this time modify the organization in process of formation in a way that cannot occur later, but is not entirely predetermined in the germ-plasm. The difference is not merely temporal but also qualitative, for while other causes are mainly general (with perhaps some exception as regards heredity), the infantile predispositions are specific. That is, they not only partly determine liability to a breakdown under stress, but play the chief part in determining the kind of breakdown to be expected should one occur, and also the basic layers on which various character formations are built, although the superstructures may be very varied.",

      "abstract": "Each of these religious beliefs shares in the same functions as follows: explanation of various misfortunes; moral sanction; and maintenance of a social structure.Besides each of them stands in a complementary relationship with one another in its functions indicated above. In many societies sudden death or serious diseases are thought to be caused by witches. Whereas ancestores give misfortunes of less severity, for ancestors do harms only when their descendants fail to observe their traditional way of living or their duties towards their kinsmen or ancestors, so that the descendants may correct their misbehaviors.Witches are generally associated with such character that tends to bring troubles into human relations. In this way people succeed in rejecting and banishing the persons of too much envious, competitive or uncompromising character from their society. Consequently witch-craft belief regulates the relationship between co-wives, neighbors and co-workers. Ancestor worship, on the contrary, gives sanction upon the relationship between a senior and a junior member of a kin group. Unless a son obeys his father's command, misfortunes fall upon the son, for the irritated father would not sacrifice to the ancestor in favor of his son.Witchcraft belief contributes to the maintenance of the solidarity of a group in two ways: it gives a safe way of dissolving frustrated feelings of the members which are created by conflicts that institutions and systems of the society might inevitably produce; and it prohibits the accusation of a witch within an intimate, cooperative kin group in which a collaborate relationship should be retained lest the fundamentally required stability of the society as a whole should not be broken. On the other hand ancestor worship considerably reinforces the authority of heads of kin groups of various size. The right of giving sacrifices to the ancestor is ascribed only to the heads, and thus the rest of the members must depend upon the heads in order to secure their ancestor's favor. In these ways the solidarity of the cooperative relationship among the members of a society is effectively strengthened and maintained by witchcraft belief and ancestor worship.",

      "abstract": "Great instability in the roles, wide fluidity in the theater of love, which is contrary with stable world of yesterday, can not be transferred or impact on children growing up in space of fluid love. Parents who were given the right to determine the kind of pleasure and imposing a form of love to the children entries the confusion eliminating of those clear standards that were present in earlier periods. Pathological manifestations, especially of girls in the pre-puberty and puberty, which was reported on the psychotherapies undertaken because of the difficulty in adapting and education, can provide insights into normal processes such as are difficult to obtain with direct observation. Understanding any phase or any level within phase of development implies a clear insight into the history of the previous phases and level of the structure built by then. Even when it comes to revolutionary changes or about flurry in development process that is actually about amplifying evolutionary process. The theoretical problem with puberty, as a phase that can be defined as new edition of the infantile period, is that it comes after a period of so-called latency is illogical that after the (apparently) peaceful development can reach such large, revolutionary changes. It seems that even the development theory has not paid the necessary attention to something that could be defined as preparatory activities from which puberty depends. It is clear that this is the one invisible dynamics present in the psyche is in this quiet, pre-puberty period.",

The frequency of current debate about children may attest to their centrality and importance. The tradition that ascribes primitiveness to the child, as untamed/savage, or as innocent, or both, is one that predates the rise of the Human Sciences. Psychoanalysis's recognition of the continuing importance of childhood and the child, and its central place in the lives of adults, is a continuing challenge to adults' claims to know themselves and the world. The recognition of the interdependence of adult and child involves the stubborn intractability of the unconscious and the ongoing centrality of fantasy.",

      "abstract": "I conclude that Mary and Abe's decision to conceive a child to save a child does not impose harm on persons or on relationships in the family. Nor does it evince a lack of respect for the child they have conceived. The ethical guidelines that support this conclusion can now be summarized. First, actions should not depersonalize or otherwise endanger personal relationships. Second, although ideally personal relationships are initiated and continued for their own sake, after a personal relationship has been established and sustained the motives for establishing it recede in importance. Third, the requirement of honesty looms especially large in the context of personal relationships. Fourth, privacy protects personal relationships in the family from intrusion by the state. Fifth, even if those with whom we stand in personal relationships are not fully rational or self-conscious, we should treat them with respect. Finally, persons often are called upon to make greater sacrifices in personal relationships. These principles represent only the barest beginnings of an ethics for filial relationships. Nonetheless, they mark progress in the direction of developing a more complete account. We should not suppose that ethics in the family always will be spontaneous or \"natural\". Over a century ago, Mill warned that nature and natural are \"one of the most copious sources of false taste, false philosophy, false morality, and even bad law\". Especially in the wake of medical advances, such as recombinant DNA and new reproductive technologies, the complexity of filial ethics will only increase. The demographics of an aging society will add further complexity to filial contexts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Battle feelings of rejection and isolation may lead to the development of internalized homophobia (IH). Objectives To elucidate the risk factors of IH and how the latter affects mental health. Methods Literature review (PubMed). Results IH has been associated with lower levels of emotional stability, rejection sensitivity, impairments in emotion regulation and a tendency to turn against the self. Studies have connected IH to depression, poor self/relationship wellbeing, sexual discrimination, addictions, shame, body dissatisfaction, suicidal ideation, binge eating/drinking, partner violence and victimization. Higher levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance, outness, religiosity and internalized stigma were correlated with higher IH levels. The key factors relating to suicide include lack of acceptance by family and/or self, negative feelings about sexuality/gender and appearance dissatisfaction. In traditional/religious societies, heterosexual orientation is a strong norm and homosexuality is considered unacceptable leading LGBT individuals to report higher depressive symptoms and increased levels of IH. Due to heterosexist ideals, IH is a predictor for heterosexual marital intention, protests against LGBT and use of masculinity as a compensatory strategy. Conclusions Policies in support of individuals who have recently come out should be improved to reduce the development/effects of IH and take the social and sexual environments of rural gay men into account considering ways to increase service accessibility (e.g internet). Future research is needed to further understand the association between IH and mental health, social and cognitive mechanisms.",

Research finds that younger children’s peer and sibling victimizations are indeed not less serious than the older youth on the dimensions of injury, being hit with an object that could cause injury, or being victimized on multiple occasions. Younger children and older youth also had similar trauma symptom levels associated to both peer and sibling victimization.",

The undesired Other is both known and unknown, dangerous and in danger, inferior and superior. He or she may be modelled as the ethnic and social Other, and ultimately as inhuman.

      "abstract": "Abstract When individuals collectively challenge authorities via social movements, they typically do so over matters about which they are deeply troubled, have considerable concern, and feel passionately. These troublesome matters or conditions, and the feelings associated with them—such as dissatisfaction, fear, indignation, resentment, and moral shock—can be thought of as grievances. They provide the primary motivational impetus for organizing social movement campaigns and for engaging in social movement activities. Although there are various sets of conditions that contribute to the emergence and operation of social movements—such as some degree of perceived political opportunity, organization, and resource acquisition, none of these factors is more important than the generation of mobilizing grievances. After all, it is difficult to imagine most individuals engaging in social movement activity without feeling deeply aggrieved about some condition that is regarded as contrary to the interests, rights, moral principles, or well‐being of themselves or others. Consider the adherents of the pro‐choice and pro‐life movements, and of those advocating for and against same‐sex marriages in the United States or immigration and tighter border control throughout much of the developed world. Not only are the adherents of one movement deeply aggrieved by the prospect of the other movement achieving its goals, but their passions about their movement are often palpable and thus worn, metaphorically, on their sleeves. Certainly other motivational factors—such as curiosity, the desire for approval, and peer pressure—may come into play when considering why people align themselves with a particular movement, but these usually are secondary and largely irrelevant in the absence of deeply felt grievances.",

      "abstract": "Growing up of a teenager in modern conditions of informatization of society and socio-economic instability is a very complex multi-factorial process that introduces specifics in emotional, motivational, need-based and other areas of personal development. The deficit or distortion of these developmental conditions blocks the satisfaction of the needs of the adolescent's personality, which are the source of sociogenesis. The most vulnerable in the development process are adolescents with developmental disabilities, which is associated with the specifics of the socio-biological conditions in which they grow up. Disorders sensory (visual or hearing), motor or mental spheres in adolescents with disabilities, as well as the specifics of the social situation of their development lead to difficulties in communication, expression of emotions, lower levels of self-control, possession of verbal and nonverbal communication in adolescents of this group. Deprivation or delay in the development of social needs in adolescence can lead to frustration, impoverish the conditions for the development of the individual as a whole. Solving the experimental task of identifying the main social needs of adolescents with developmental disabilities in three different groups (mentally retarded, visually impaired, and hard of hearing) in comparison with normatively developing adolescents, we assume that they will differ in their specificity and severity.",

      "title": "“Terrible Twos” and “Terrible Teens”: The Importance of Play",
      "abstract": "In the process of individuation, toddlers and their adolescent parents share similar dynamics; that is, both are involved with anxiety-laden preoccupations about difference and separateness and about bodily changes, loss of control, and containing aggression. Both experience internal struggles between emotional vulnerability and a sense of invincibility; both make fierce self-assertive bids coupled with a powerful need for guidance. When synchronized, such teen-toddler similarities can create a bond of mutual excitement; when their intentions clash, however, a terrible battle of wills erupts, fuelled by furious frustration or intense despair. It is suggested that play can provide an essential bridge between teen parent and toddler, enabling each to work through his/her anxieties and passionate reactions of love and hate. Joint play increases reciprocal understanding. However, a teen deprived of play in childhood, or one who resents her/his own playtime being curtailed by parenthood, may become intrusive or controlling, projecting disowned aspects of her/his self into their mutual play. The parent thus breaks the play frame, creating confusion in the child between pretence and reality. By providing a safe space to explore conflictual feelings through joint play, thoughtful practitioners can foster better emotional awareness and mentalization in troubled young parents and their toddlers.",

      "title": "PATERNALISME DALAM TINDAKAN MEDIS",
      "abstract": "Abstract: In an ethical context, paternalism means any act that limits someone’s freedom, without his/her consent, for the purpose of either preventing the person from doing himself any harm, or carrying out something positive in a way that can not be achieved by himself/herself. The principle of paternalism must be distinguished from the harm principle. The principle of paternalism says that one’s freedom may be limited if one will inflict the harm on oneself due to one’s attitude, or will not be able to achieve something beneficial for himself/herself. Meanwhile, the harm principle says that someone’s freedom may be limited if the purpose is to protect another person from the harm inflicted by the first party. In medical service sector, paternalism causes conflicts between the principle of beneficence and the principle of autonomy. This is evident if a doctor takes a certain medical action based on the principle of beneficence without giving any information to the competent patient, or the doctor gives the information only to the family. In this situation, there is no informed consent. However paternalism can not cause conflict between these two ethical principles if the patient is not autonomous, so that he/she is not competent to make a decision that can be justified. Key words: paternalism, patient, doctor, competent Abstrak: Dalam konteks etika, paternalisme dimaksudkan setiap tindakan yang membatasi kebebasan seseorang tanpa persetujuannya, yang bertujuan mencegah terjadinya kerugian baginya, atau melakukan sesuatu yang baik, yang tidak dapat diperolehnya dengan cara lain. Prinsip paternalisme perlu dibedakan dengan prinsip kerugian. Prinsip paternalisme mengatakan bahwa kebebasan seseorang boleh dibatasi, jika orang itu akan merugikan dirinya sendiri karena kelakuannya sendiri, atau tidak akan memperoleh sesuatu yang sangat baik bagi dirinya. Sedangkan prinsip kerugian mengatakan bahwa kebebasan seseorang boleh dibatasi untuk melindungi orang lain dari kerugian. Di bidang pelayanan medis, paternalisme dapat menimbulkan konflik antara prinsip berbuat baik dan prinsip otonomi bila dokter mengambil tindakan medis tertentu atas dasar prinsip berbuat baik (the principle of beneficence) tanpa memberi informasi kepada pasien yang kompeten, atau hanya menyampaikannya kepada pihak keluarga. Dalam kondisi seperti ini tak ada informed consent atau informed choice dari pihak pasien, dan paternalisme ini tak dapat dibenarkan. Namun terdapat situasi di mana paternalisme tidak menimbulkan konflik antara kedua prinsip etika ini, yakni apabila pasien memang tidak otonom sehingga tidak kompeten untuk mengambil suatu keputusan rasional yang dapat dipertanggungjawabkan.

      "abstract": "Abstract “Misgendering” is a term used broadly to mean referring to someone using the wrong gender. In the transgender context, it usually refers to cases where a transgender person is referred to using the gender assigned at birth, rather than according to gender presentation. Misgendering is sometimes a form of anti-trans aggression, but can also be accidental or otherwise unintended. “Self-misgendering”, where transgender speakers unintentionally misgender themselves, is apparently previously unstudied, seems mainly to occur in a foreign-language context, and may bear some similarity to language-interference effects observed in the study of multilinguals, a “first-gender effect” analogous to first-language effects. One may also hypothesise social gender bias, variable gender-identity, or similar factors. This article quantitatively surveys self-reported self-misgendering among multilingual transgender speakers to identify factors of correlation or causation. Using data and respondents’ comments from an online survey, it shows strong correlation between self-misgendering by full-time transgender speakers and (lack of) fluency in the language spoken, with no significant correlation to other linguistic or social gender-related factors. This suggests the self-misgendering phenomenon is primarily a fluency effect, independent of social or identity factors such as attitude to gender in language, attitude to being misgendered, or “default” masculine gender.",

      "abstract": "A child's death profoundly affects family dynamics, stories, and even other siblings' perceived reasons for being. This influence is often sustained over time to affect not only the lost child's parents and siblings, but also future generations. Health care and mental health care workers frequently encounter such stories, but little is known about the actual phenomenon, which may be a form of disenfranchised grief. This conceptual article explores the construct of transgenerational grief as it pertains to adults' lifelong grief responses to a sibling whom they did not know, but whose “ghost” has been important in the family. The authors consider this construct within its historical family context, proposing that miscarriages and infant losses that a family experienced even a century ago may have resembled unresolved grief, due in part to brief, unresolved mourning. Bereavement theory, Bowenian family theory, and constructionist theory of grief are woven together to create speculative theoretical underpinnings to support transgenerational grief and its impact as uncovered in the authors' study of personal stories of sibling loss.",

      "abstract": "I argue that the inappropriate anger criterion for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is likely to contribute to gender bias in the diagnostic process. In its current form, the inappropriate anger criterion is vaguely formulated, providing close to no guidance on to how to distinguish inappropriate from appropriate anger. Further, recent work in moral psychology highlights that the inappropriate anger criterion can be understood and applied in wide range of ways, none of which are required nor excluded by criterion. Moreover, research on public administration and management gives us reason to suspect that the criterion’s ambiguity coupled with the working conditions characteristic of healthcare settings is likely to increase the risk that clinicians will rely on stereotypes in their assessments of the appropriateness of anger. Specifically, various empirical studies point to the existence and widespread influence of gender stereotypes whereby anger is associated with men. Women who display anger are seen as underconforming to prescribed gender roles and, therefore, abnormal. Thus, we have good reason to think that women’s anger will more often be thought inappropriate than men’s, in general and in psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "From a dynamic perspective, it is essential to search for links that may exist between the two disorders that affect this child. The attachment theory allows us to develop a hypothesis, based on the history of this boy and the clinical observations of the authors.\r\n\r\nThe affective deprivation of the first 16 months of life is indicated by the great difficulty with which the boy entered into a relationship with his adoptive parents. He obviously took a long time to accept his highly attentive adopted mother. This included an oppositional phase (so often observed in deprived children).that seemed to be intended to provoke maternal rejection. But why, during this slow relationship-forming process, did he flee from the male figure? Had he been abused by one or more males in his early childhood? If so, this could be the primary reason why he is inclined to adopt a female identity.\r\n\r\nIt may be, however, that the observed behaviour of the adoptive mother is influencing him to assume a female identity. One notes that his mother—in keeping with a process often observed in children thought to be traumatised and profoundly deprived—shows a tendency to put his needs before her own. She gave him an affectionate nickname that is typically given to females, and he demonstrates—even at the age of 6–7—a constant search for the approval of his adopted mother.\r\n\r\nIf the child has suffered trauma at the hands of a male figure, this overprotective behaviour by the adoptive mother might encourage the boy to imagine that, if he were a girl, he would receive all the affection he desired and missed during his first 16 months—a crucial period in self-development.",

Both liking and loving can be defined as attitudes, emotions, and motivations. Increasingly and very importantly, scholars also have studied people’s ongoing interactions with close partners and have identified intra- and interpersonal processes that occur within these interactions and which, in turn, influence people’s ongoing attraction to each other (and, sometimes, in the case of romantic partners, their attraction or lack thereof to alternative partners outside the relationship). Determinants of attraction may differ at different stages of relationships.",

      "abstract": "A verbal contract isn't worth the paper it's written on.* Whether one is a movie mogul or a practicing lawyer, the problem with oral contracts has long been recognized. Such problems have been prevalent in the estate and estate planning area. The best laid estate plans may come to naught when a despised relative shows up after death claiming to have had a contract with the deceased to receive all of the deceased's estate.' I. INTRODUCTION If a man can't forge his own will, whose will can heforge?** Contracts to make a will occur in a variety of factual situations. Very often they involve the elderly. As people grow older, their reliance on others normally increases because of their inability to care for themselves. This is especially true of those who have lost spouses and who, as a result, come to rely on relatives for normal needs such as housing and food. The furnishing of these services by a friend or relative may be motivated by a variety of reasons, including friendship, good samaritanism or, unfortunately, greed. In many instances, no mention is ever made of compensation to the providers. In such a situation, after the death of the one receiving the services, the providers may claim there was an oral contract to make a will, under the terms of which they were to be left certain property in exchange for their providing care for the deceased. 2",

      "title": "Negotiating Relational Breakups",
      "abstract": "Romantic relationships often develop with excitement and positive anticipation. Yet many dissolve. Research has examined several facets to unpack the dissolution process, from what leads to termination to redefining relationships with former partners. For example, relationship dynamics (e.g., commitment, love) typically play the largest roles in dissolution, but individual and demographic factors also contribute to whether relationships stay intact or terminate. Research has also delineated specific strategies people use to disengage, which vary in directness and whether they are one-sided or mutual. Models of dissolution also describe typical paths or precipitating communication patterns that reflect dissolution. Following a breakup, most people experience post-dissolution distress, which can entail emotional, cognitive, and physiological effects. People vary in the intensity of distress experienced; those who fare badly tend to have more relational anxiety or use coping strategies to distract themselves from or deny the effects of the breakup. The fact that many ex-partners maintain contact or relationships following dissolution complicates the recovery process. Former partners maintain contact because they have the same social network, because they want to renew the relationship or consider the ex-partner as a back-up plan, or because they have children or shared resources. Hence, many former partners redefine their relationship rather than completely terminating all contact. Some are able to successfully transform their relationship into a friendship, and some eventually also reconcile the romantic nature of their relationship. The dissolution of a romantic relationship can be one of the most significant stressors that individuals experience. Most people, even those who initiate the breakup, endure distress and negative effects. Yet dissolution can provide relief from a detrimental relationship for some. And many people experience positive effects or post-dissolution growth, such as gaining a new appreciation for other relationships, rediscovering the self, or pursuing new opportunities. The extant research provides an understanding of the various factors and steps in the dissolution process. Future research can synthesize these areas of research into more comprehensive frameworks to derive more tailored recommendations on navigating breakups, thereby minimizing the distress and maximizing the benefits.",

In the phase of latency and adolescence, there is a return to a kind of sexual undifferentiation. In borderline pathology, uppermost is the fear of fragmentation, dissolution into the other. The way out of indiscrimination, of confusion, is traced via the creation of a primal scene fantasy, a primal scene that constitutes the origin from which identification and oedipal complex are elaborated. In reality, the rejection of sexual difference, as S. Freud noted, also emerges as a defence of the feminine in both sexes. The lack of symmetry between the sexes implies different forms of desire, suffering, and loving in human development. It opposes the mythical idea of self, of the narcissistic wishes of lovers. Sexuality leads to an object similar to self.",

      "title": "[Psychiatric complications of abortion].",
      "abstract": "The psychiatric consequences of induced abortion continue to be the object of controversy. The reactions of women when they became aware of conception are very variable. Pregnancy, whether initially intended or unintended, may provoke stress; and miscarriage may bring about feelings of loss and grief reaction. Therefore, induced abortion, with its emotional implications (of relief, shame and guilt) not surprisingly is a stressful adverse life event. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS: There is agreement among researchers on the need to compare the mental health outcomes (or the psychiatric complications) with appropriate groups, including women with unintended pregnancies ending in live births and women with miscarriages. There is also agreement on the need to control for the potential confounding effects of multiple variables: demographic, contextual, personal development, previous or current traumatic experiences, and mental health prior to the obstetric event. Any psychiatric outcome is multi-factorial in origin and the impact of life events depend on how they are perceived, the psychological defence mechanisms (unconscious to a great extent) and the coping style. The fact of voluntarily aborting has an undeniable ethical dimension in which facts and values are interwoven.No research study has found that induced abortion is associated with a better mental health outcome, although the results of some studies are interpreted as <<neutral>> or <<mixed.>> Some general population studies point out significant associations with alcohol or illegal drug dependence, mood disorders (including depression) and some anxiety disorders. Some of these associations have been confirmed, and nuanced, by longitudinal prospective studies which support causal relationships.With the available data, it is advisable to devote efforts to the mental health care of women who have had an induced abortion. Reasons of the woman's mental health by no means can be invoked, on empirical bases, for inducing an abortion.",

While child sexual abuse involves the child in a physical deed, its harmful developments are predominantly shown in the child's psyche. Its considerable risk factors for developing psychopathology lie not just in childhood and adolescence, but also into adulthood. Child sexual abuse is highly under-reported in India, which has attained epidemic proportions. It is still seen as a taboo, creating a sense of discomfort where most communities try to hide, ignore, or mistrust the accusations. In healthcare, it thus becomes paramount to understand the warning signs, the likelihood of revelation while interviewing, and the dynamics of the family about culture and implications that can come along with the abuse. With a keen understanding of the types of abuse and an awareness of the proceedings after the disclosure, safety can be targeted.",

      "title": "SUBJECTS OF ENVY AMONG YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN: CONTEXTS OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOR",
      "abstract": "This article explores the propensity for deviant behavior and the objects of envy among young men and women. Specifically, it examines the following aspects: Appearance: Young individuals often experience jealousy regarding each other's physical appearance, clothing, hairstyle, and more. Envy of attractive attributes may drive both genders to engage in deviant behaviors, such as resorting to drug use or alcohol abuse to achieve these attributes. Social Status: Envy can also revolve around social status, encompassing factors like popularity, academic or athletic success, and group affiliations. Envious feelings related to these aspects may lead to deviant behaviors, including the use of violence or manipulation to attain desired status. Material Goods: Material possessions can be a focal point of envy, motivating young people to engage in theft, deceit, or illicit activities to acquire them. Power and Control: Envy of power and control may serve as another motivator for deviant behavior. For instance, the desire to wield power can lead to attempts to control others or resort to violence to achieve personal objectives. Deviant behaviors often stem from envy, as individuals may seek to obtain desired objects or statuses through wrongful means. For instance, a young man envious of a successful classmate may resort to grade forgery or cheating to attain similar success. Jealousy can also trigger conflicts and violence among individuals. For example, two girls envious of each other's attractiveness or popularity may engage in efforts to undermine each other's lives or even resort to physical aggression. The primary objective of this article is to identify the principal psychological and legal characteristics of envy among male and female students within the context of deviant behavior. The article's objectives include assessing the level of envy among male and female cadets and exploring gender-specific relationships between deviant behavior and envy across various subject areas. It is essential to note that envy alone is not the sole cause of deviant behavior; rather, it is one of several factors influencing young individuals and motivating them to engage in unlawful acts. Additional factors, such as inadequate social support, low self-esteem, or negative environmental influences, also significantly contribute to the development of deviant behavior. In conclusion, this study underscores that envy is not a moral sentiment and highlights the centrality of feelings of inferiority in the experience of envy. Moreover, gender differences in envy, prevalent among youth, tend to diminish as individuals mature.",

      "abstract": "The highly variable selves that ethnographers have documented cross-culturally all build upon the universal human self described by neurobiologists. The link between cultural selfhood and this neurally-based self is emotional arousal. Arousal heightens the effect of synaptic plasticity, insuring that clusters of strong associations, or cognitive schemas, result from many fewer repetitions of the arousing experience. There are identifiable types of such predictably arousing experiences cross-culturally, many occurring early in life. While susceptible to individual variation, these are typically based in kinds of experience widespread in groups. Culturally elaborated, these shared experiences result in distinctive cultural selves. The argument is illustrated at length with one of these types, disciplinary childrearing practices. Early attachment, cultural psychodynamic defenses, and several other shared, culturally variable experiences that are predictably emotionally arousing are also considered: unintended consequences of childrearing; separation from primary caretaker(s); trauma of all kinds; rituals such as initiation rites or religious conversion; and cultural idealizations of occasions, institutions, or roles.",

      "title": "Maintaining friendships in early stage dementia: Factors to consider",
      "abstract": "Friendships and the importance of social connectiveness play a critical role in aging well, regardless of gender, race, social class, or impairment. Yet, dementia takes its toll on social relationships, and many friends withdraw and ‘disappear’, because they can no longer bear to see the changes that are taking place in their diagnosed friend. The dementia care literature documents this abandonment; however, this study examines the opposite occurrence. In order to understand more clearly the role of long-term friendships and how such friendships remain and continue, despite the diagnosis of dementia, this qualitative study examines in depth eight people in the early stages of dementia who have been able to maintain strong friendships despite the diagnosis. Factors that seem to play important roles are: (1) the importance of the friendships, (2) factors affecting the quality of the relationships, (3) mutually beneficial relationships, (4) core values, (5) acceptance and disclosure, and (6) recognition of strengths and understanding of limitations.",

      "title": "Depression and Psychological Distress",
      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a common and often-recurrent disorder that impairs functioning and reduces quality of life; it is currently ranked as the largest contributor to disease-related disability worldwide. It is of particular importance for women’s health because, from early adolescence onwards, women are roughly twice as likely as men to experience depression. Depression is a multifactorial disorder, with evidence of influences from genetic and other predisposing individual characteristics, exposure to adverse perinatal and childhood experiences, and more immediately precipitating stressors. As a result, a number of different developmental pathways may be involved, mediated via impacts on aspects of neurobiological, psychological, and social development. This chapter provides an overview of recent evidence on these themes. It begins by sketching epidemiological findings on changing rates and gender ratios in depressive disorders from childhood to older age. It then examines the main domains of risk for depressive conditions, exploring recent evidence on the extent to which men and women differ in exposure or susceptibility to risks that affect both sexes, and whether some gender-specific risks may be involved. Throughout, it highlights the differing pathways through which individual vulnerabilities, childhood adversities, and later stressors have been argued to combine to contribute to the genesis of depression.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Attachment describes the human infant's tendency to seek comfort, support, nurturance, and protection from a relatively small number of preferred caregivers or attachment figures. The capacity to form an attachment is not present at birth, but develops over time. Although infants in the first 6 months are able to distinguish among different interactive partners, they do not express an obvious preference for one caregiver over another. All of this changes at around 7 to 9 months of age. At that point, infants begin to exhibit stranger wariness and separation protest, two behaviors that herald the onset of focused attachment. Stranger wariness varies from mild reticence to outright distress, but it contrasts with the infant's comfort with an attachment figure, from whom the infant seeks comfort, support, nurturance, and protection. Separation protest describes the infant's reaction to actual or anticipated separation from an attachment figure. After these two behaviors appear, infants are attached to one or more caregivers. Once infants have developed the cognitive capacity to exhibit separation protest and stranger wariness, they may form new attachments with any caregivers with whom they have significant interactive experiences.",

These cultural sources of prejudice and discrimination are based on racial, ethnic, religious, and other social differences in an attempt to explain entire groups of people based solely on selected information. Stereotypes have been studied as automatic and unconscious thoughts, but are learned over time in social contexts and perpetuated by the socialization process in various ways. Stereotypes can result in historical patterns of prejudice and discrimination in society, but have also been demonstrated to have individual impacts such as creating a self‐fulfilling prophecy and stereotype threat. Stereotype threat is a situational impact of stereotyping in which individuals are aware of the negative stereotypes that surround their particular social group and they feel anxiety that their actions might confirm the stereotype as true.",

Child maltreatment in childhood and adolescence is recognised as an important psychopathological risk factor and is associated with poor psy‐ chological function in childhood and adolescence and adulthood. In this respect, we empha‐ sise that it is wrong to believe that current knowledge has enabled the identification of clearly differentiated consequences for each type of child maltreatment. There is a high de‐ gree of co-morbidity among the different types, in such a way that many children experi‐ ence more than one form of maltreatment and display common consequences. Moreover, it still needs to be clarified whether child abuse and neglect produces a general vulnerability towards psychopathology, in such a way that other factors would be responsible for the form finally adopted by psychopathology.",

      "title": "“No more a child, not yet an adult”: studying social cognition in adolescence",
      "abstract": "There are several reasons why adolescence is interesting. It is in this phase that an individual finds herself fully facing the external world: basically equipped with the kind of social cognition that s/he has acquired at home, at school and through the media during childhood, s/he has now to meet a host of other, diverse views of what \"reasonable\", \"appropriate\" or \"expected\" courses of thought and emotions are, in the wild with friends and peers, romantic or sexual partners, teachers and employers, and the society at large. Furthermore, she is also expected, both at home and in the external world, to have a wholly new degree of control over such courses. While the idea that the development of social cognition still progresses after infancy (and possibly throughout the life span) is clearly gaining consensus in the field, the literature building on it is still scarce. One of the reasons for this probably is that most tests used to study it focus on its basic component, namely ToM, and have been mostly devised for us with children; therefore, they are not suitable to deal with the hugely increasing complexity of social and mental life during adolescence and adulthood. Starting from a review of the literatuer available, we will argue that the development of social cognition should be viewed as a largely yet-to-be-understood mix of biological and cultural factors. While it is widely agreed upon that the very initial manifestations of social life in the newborn are largely driven by an innate engine with which all humans are equally endowed, it is also evident that each culture, and each individual within it, develops specific adult versions of social cognition.",

Later he expressed a different view, emphasizing childhood fantasies of sexual intimacies with a parent that never actually took place. Freud never totally repudiated his original seduction theory, however, maintaining to the end of his life that at least some cases of actual incest occurred and that these instances underlay certain types of psychopathology. In our era we have become aware that incest is frequently a forerunner of subsequent borderline disorders, especially in women hospitalized with borderline personality disorder (B.P.D.). All the clinical manifestations of B.P.D. can be related to the prior incest experiences.",

Domestic violence is narrowly defined as an act or threat of violence against someone with whom the perpetrator has a deep relationship. Domestic violence is also closely related to violence against children. While children may not be physically harmed, seeing or hearing their parents being abused can be psychologically devastating. Maturity in Latin verbs is called the term adult or adolescene which means to grow into maturity Adult in Dutch is volwassen which means full and wassen means to grow, so volwassen means that it has fully grown or has finished growing Therefore, adults are individuals who have completed their growth and ready to accept a position in society along with other adults. However, a person's maturity can be disturbed if the child lives in a less harmonious family environment or a broken home, because domestic violence (domestic violence) not only affects the parents but also their children.

      "abstract": "The article presents the study results of the rejection in interpersonal relationships in the social exclusion ideas context. The empirical study involved 51 people. The results, carried out using qualitative and quantitative methods of data analysis, demonstrate the characteristic perception of rejection as a process. The rejection trigger is the discovery of otherness and / or inadequacy with the interaction partner. This is expressed in the mismatch of values, attitudes, person’s expectations; in the awareness of the reciprocity absence; in inattention to the partner, in ignoring its interests. The rejection experience is accompanied by feelings of resentment, loneliness, other negative emotions, as well as a search for the meaning of what is happening. Adaptation to a situation of rejection presupposes acceptance or reciprocal rejection, which leads to the final break in communication with the partner of interpersonal relations, to the loss of psychological resources, to the significant social needs’ deprivation. It is shown that lonely adults are much less likely to describe the rejection process as a way to accept the diversity of the world and interpersonal relationships’ variability. Understanding rejection as a social exclusion form gives a possibility for building psychotherapeutic work with people who reject interpersonal relationships.",

      "abstract": "Narcotics addiction is both a psychophysiological state and a social category. It is a product of behavior learned within a social context and cannot be adequately understood apart from that context. The prevalence and consequences of drug addiction in any society depend as much upon the social and legal definitions placed upon the nonmedical use of narcotics as upon the nature and effects of narcotics or the nature of persons who become addicted. These definitions generally evolve in harmony with the general orientations of the society toward various types of experience, though in some instances, they may be imposed by groups having special interests in and concerns about the problem of narcotics use and addiction. In contemporary North America, narcotics addiction tends to be regarded with horror. The dope fiend and the drug peddler are subject in the popular mind to the same loathing and abhorrence that attaches to the sex maniac. The addict's apparent lack of will power and rejection of goals other than the support of his drug habit are utterly antithetical to the Protestant ethic, with its injunction to moral responsibility and striving. Intensifying the strong social disapprobation of the addict has been the change in legal definition attaching to drug use and drug possession since passage of the Harrison Act in 1914.1 The maintenance of addiction now requires that one be a criminal, whereas addicted persons could previously obtain their drugs at very low cost through legitimate drug channels. This action was, of course, designed to protect the population against the dangers of addiction through innocent medicinal use or self-experimentation with narcotic drugs. Coupled with the new legal definition of drug use, however, came the designation of the addict as enemy by enforcement personnel and the solidifying of underworld ties and identifications on the part of many addicts. Thus, stereotypes of the addict were reshaped and widely circulated and, to a degree, they were confirmed by the subsequent responses of addicts forced to work out new modes of survival.

Only relatively recently, for example, has the conviction that only negative consequences will be experienced by families with a child with a disability been challenged. Research questions and instruments or approaches must allow for positive experiences and outcomes. In addition, often family research has failed to recognize the importance of cultural differences. One example of this can be found in assumptions of the applicability of instruments used in family research across different cultural groups. The capacity of instruments to reflect the constructs being measured must be established before they can be used confidently across cultures. In addition, the relationships between constructs must be tested rather than assumed. Finally, before intervention programs or approaches that have been developed by one culture are adopted or applied to another, their fit with the attitudes, beliefs, and resources of the latter culture should be established.",

Dyadic term has been also used for these deaths as these incidents often involve a pair of persons. Homicidesuicides usually involve a male perpetrator, who commits one or more homicides and then commits suicide. They generally occur within a family and may involve children. There is a love or spousal relationship between the victim and perpetrator in most cases. Three types of homicide-suicides have been classifi ed; familial, spousal/consortial, and extrafamilial types. They have different sub-classifi cations defi ned by age of individuals and relationship. Homicide-suicides in older couples were interpreted as dyadic deaths, dual suicide pacts, or homicide-suicides with altruistic motives which are attributed to the perpetrator. We present a homicide-suicide of an older couple involving a complex suicide. A 77-year-old retired man, who lived with his 72-year-old wife, was described as hot tempered by his relatives. On the incident day, his wife reported to her neighbors that he was acting strangely, and she was worried. Later that evening, he killed his wife by hitting her on the head with an iron bar. He then killed himself by cutting his abdominal region and by hanging himself. A detailed death scene investigation and autopsies of the couple were performed. The case presented is unique because it involves both homicide-suicide and complex suicide which is defi ned as using more than one method to induce death. In addition, a homicide-suicide case involving complex suicide has not been reported in the literature before.",

Infantile sexual theories, the family romance, and phantasies of primitive scenes (with the inevitable risks of idealization and negativity) reveal traits of maternal or paternal identification, and prove to be essential references in establishing correspondences between historic events and subjective individual experiences.

This is known as the 'fraternal birth order' effect. In the past, efforts have been made to explain this phenomenon in terms of several alternative biological hypotheses and a psychosocial hypothesis. This note examines how well these hypotheses accommodate the fraternal birth order effect. It is concluded that: (1) the evidence for the hypothesis of maternal immunoreactivity to the male fetus is weak; (2) the evidence for the intrauterine hormone exposure hypothesis is also weak; (3) the evidence for the hypothesis of postnatal learning is stronger. Lastly, there seem likely to be causes common to male homosexuality and paedophilia. They may include sexual (or quasi-sexual) experience in childhood or adolescence.",

Evidence suggests that a relationship may be placed at risk during the grief process, with different forms and rates of grieving between the couple creating barriers to effective communication and increasing feelings of vulnerability. Fifty-one adults who had experienced the loss of a baby as a result of miscarriage or stillbirth took part in this preliminary study to identify gender differences in coping strategies used by males and females in dealing with their loss. Results suggested not only gender differences in chosen coping strategies, but also differences between women depending on the type of loss experienced (ie miscarriage or stillbirth). While men tended to worry, use social support and ignore the situation, women were more likely to seek spiritual support, use tension reduction, wishful thinking and seek support from others who had experienced the same loss. A tendency to use self-blame was also evident in the responses of the female subjects, in particular women who had suffered a miscarriage.©1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

With such new means of communication as the Internet, transmitting rumor is possible beyond the traditional oral and written forms. Rumor is spread in both the higher and lower levels of an organization. Typically, disproving a rumor is more difficult than proving a rumor. The financial impact of a rumor must be considered also. If people believe, for example, that a radiology department does not have its act together or offers poor customer service, the department may lose revenue because people have lost confidence in it. Originally, the word gossip had positive implications. It referred to a family friend or the woman who delivered a child and announced the event to the community. Because well-intentioned gossip often turns into a damaging story, various approaches for stopping rumors have been identified. They include analyzing the grapevine, identifying the habitual spreaders of rumor and keeping employees informed. In most cases, a person of authority who provides facts can stop or at least slow down rumors spreading at the employee level.",

      "title": "Affirmative Psychotherapy with Bisexual Men",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY This article describes the range of issues that are of concern to bisexual men seeking psychotherapy. In addressing these issues with bisexual clients, the therapist is well advised to recognize the diversity that exists within this population regarding the pathways that individuals take in the course of acknowledging and coming to terms with their sexual orientation. It is important for the therapist to recognize that for most bisexual clients, the presenting issues are those that are common to most psychotherapy clients, such as anxiety, depression, stress, and relationship issues. For others, however, there are questions about sexual identity, coming out bisexual, and the implications of their sexual attractions to both women and men. An individual may have concerns regarding whether or not to disclose his sexual orientation at the start of a new relationship, or regarding realizing for the first time that he has bisexual feelings within an already established same-sex or other-sex relationship or marriage. There may also be questions and concerns regarding HIV/AIDS. In these situations, the personal impact of living in a social context in which sexuality is thought of in dichotomous either/or terms will be a realistic concern. Current trends in the research and clinical literature regarding bisexual men will also be discussed. The variety of manifestations of bisexuality across racial, ethnic, and cultural groups will be examined, including the challenges that this may pose for clients and therapists who identify with dominant definitions of sexuality within their respective social communities. Finally, the practical value and shortcomings of the main therapeutic schools will be examined in terms of providing bisexual men with effective and affirmative psychotherapy.",

      "title": "On the psychological attachment of infants to their mothers",
      "abstract": "The attachment of the infant to the mother can be seen in open parkland when an infant is set free for exercise and play. In an area of safe space, a mother has little cause to restrain her child, nor, owing to other attractions around, to entertain or otherwise divert him. In order to deduce which of the women and infants make up kinship pairs, the observer postulates criteria for recognizing a pair; attachment is then conceived of as factors which identify a mother and her infant in field conditions. The infant detaches himself from his mother but he maintains proximity to her, particularly around the age of 2 years, when his proximity- and contact-seeking are at their height. Yet, at this age, the infant shows most alertness to remote events. From 2 years old onwards, the presence of age-mates competes for the infant's proximity. Hence, the statistical data presented below is from observations which were made when the likelihood of interruption by neighbouring people was minimal. Proximity to the mother can be defined as the child's being at rest beside her, or as his playing in her vicinity, or as a pattern of exploratory locomotion with the mother the centre of the territory he covers. In each of these aspects, the behaviour of 1-, 2- and 3-year-olds is distinguished by typical distances from the mother. The infant's responsiveness to unexpected sights or sounds is inferred from the orientation responses he makes to them. In his postures and the distances he takes up from the mother, his feeling-states of alertness, fear, anger, uncertainty, fatigue and conflict are expressed; when thus activated, he tends to relate himself to his mother.",

Sexting is commonly understood as the sending and receiving of sexually suggestive or sexually explicit photos, video, or text via cell phone or other technologies. The characteristics that fuel whether one engages in sexting are not well understood. In this study, 459 unmarried, heterosexual undergraduate students (female = 328; male = 131), aged 18 to 25 years, from three universities completed an online questionnaire about their behaviors with technology and romantic relationships. In general, low attachment avoidance and high fear of negative evaluation from the dating partner predicted sending a sexually suggestive photo or video, sending a photo or video in one's underwear or lingerie, and sending a sexually suggestive text. High fear of negative evaluation predicted sending a nude photo or video as well as sending a text message propositioning sex. Low attachment avoidance, greater fear of negative evaluation, and greater social distress when dating were associated with sexting behaviors.",

Puberty is one of the multiple transitions of adolescence, and is often considered the signal for its onset, though there is some evidence to support the position that adolescence commences with 'adrenarche', which precedes puberty, rather than with 'gonadarche'. It is clear that as the adolescent life stage is approached there are risk factors inherent in biological development, personal history and in the social context in which the individual finds him or herself. The litany of changes occurring during the extensive adolescent period, albeit that the changes may represent developmental milestones, has a significant impact on the adolescent's ability to deal with stress associated with the risk factors. As a response to shifts in life situation the immediate aftermath of a parental divorce or remarriage is anger, resentment, demandingness, confusion, non-compliance, anxiety and depression.",

      "abstract": "When used clinically, psychedelics may appear unusual or even unique when compared to more familiar or long-standing medical interventions, prompting some to suggest that the ethical issues raised may likewise be exceptional. If that is correct, then perhaps psychedelics should be treated differently from other medical substances: for example, by being subjected to different ethical or evidentiary standards. Alternatively, it may be that psychedelics have more in common with various existing medical interventions than first meets the eye. We argue in favor of the latter position, drawing on parallels from earlier debates around genetic exceptionalism in bioethics. We suggest there are risks to adopting a stance of \"psychedelic ethical exceptionalism,\" and propose that consistent ethical rules and evidentiary standards should be applied across all relevant areas of clinical medicine. Importantly, this does not preclude the possibility that changes to existing standards should be made; but if so, this should not be justified by appealing to the alleged uniqueness of psychedelics.",

Such inaccuracy may result from the fact that true justifications are socially undesirable or less persuasive than competing justifications or are unavailable in conscious awareness. Because of the delicate nature of these issues, people may be particularly likely to misstate the reasons for preferences on gay marriage, abortion, abstinence-only education, and premarital sex. Advocates on both sides typically justify their preferences in terms of preserving social order, maintaining moral values, or protecting civil liberties, not in terms of their own sexual preferences. Though these are the stated reasons, in empirical tests we find that psychophysiological response to sexual images also may be a significant driver of policy attitudes.",

We live in a world in which feelings of inferiority are widespread. This betokens a widespread amount of emotional crippling. Emotional cripples, reacting against their feelings of inferiority with exaggerated egotism, power-seeking and hostility, should be recognized as such, for they play an important part in creating the problems of the world, between nations, within nations, and even in small groups.",

Shame dissipations were longer but less specific in content, and respondents were more likely to use the \"projective\"second person when describing shame than guilt. The observed content differences were generally consistent with current theory. Guilt was typically induced by specific moral transgressions, often involving harm to others. Shame was induced by specific moral transgressions as well as by nonmetal situations and issues (e.g., failure in performance situations, social{y inappropriate behavior or dress). The analysis of interpersonal concerns indicated that both shame and guilt can arise from a concern with one's effect on another person. Concern with others' evaluations, however, were almost exclusively the domain of shame. Although there appear to be some classic shame-inducing situations and some classic guilt-inducing situations, the majority of situations appear capable of engendering either emotion.",

Such credulity is consistent with a long-standing philosophical and scientific conception of young children as prone to indiscriminate trust. Against this conception, we argue that children trust some informants more than others. In particular, they use two major heuristics. First, they keep track of the history of potential informants. Faced with conflicting claims, they endorse claims made by someone who has provided reliable care or reliable information in the past. Second, they monitor the cultural standing of potential informants. Faced with conflicting claims, children endorse claims made by someone who belongs to a consensus and whose behaviour abides by, rather than deviating from, the norms of their group. The first heuristic is likely to promote receptivity to information offered by familiar caregivers, whereas the second heuristic is likely to promote a broader receptivity to informants from the same culture.",

Following each of the specialists’ assessment the findings, plan for investigations, the psychosocial situation and gender assignment and treatment should be reviewed among the group members prior to meeting the family. Following the group discussion the information should be presented to the parents using easy to understand language with visual aids and their questions should be answered so that they can make an informed decision regarding gender assignment, surgical options, where medically indicated, and hormone treatment. Potential for sexual relationships and fertility preservation should be discussed. The birth of a baby with abnormalities may be associated with mother/parental guilt feeling and the point that there is nothing that they did or did not do that caused the newborn’s condition. Disorder of sex development (DSD) can be divided into isolated and non-isolated according to the finding on physical examination and should be further classified into abnormalities of chromosomal abnormalities, gonadal defect, internal and external genital abnormalities.

Se admite hoy en día que más de un tercio de las mujeres ha padecido violencia (psicológica, física o sexual) en algún momento de sus vidas. La violencia sexual es la versión más extrema de violencia contra la mujer y concurre usualmente con los otros dos tipos de violencia. Se puede presentar en todas las etapas de la vida y ni siquiera el embarazo constituye un factor protector. Las personas más cercanas a las víctimas (pareja actual o anterior, sus familiares o personas conocidas), generalmente con poder sobre ellas, son los perpetradores más comunes. Se puede identificar algunos factores asociados, como el alcoholismo, la ignorancia, la permisividad social, la mala relación entre las parejas, el uso de drogas y otros. Las consecuencias pueden ser inmediatas o de corto, mediano y largo plazos y se dan sobre la salud física (suicidio, homicidio, muertes derivadas de sida o por complicaciones del embarazo; lesiones leves y graves, infecciones pélvicas y de transmisión sexual, embarazos ectópicos, embarazos no deseados, abortos espontáneos o inducidos, peso bajo al nacer) y mental (depresión, ansiedad, síndrome postraumático, síndrome posviolación, trastornos del sueño, obesidad, consumo de alcohol, drogas y tabaco y conductas sexuales de riesgo, entre otras) y tiene también impacto social (costos derivados de la atención de la salud y de la atención legal, implicancias sobre la productividad y el empleo).

      "abstract": "Coital activity is often initiated during adolescence, and adolescents, like many adults, do not behave in purely rational ways and frequently fail to protect themselves against undesired pregnancy. Public attention is focused on adolescent pregnancies because of their increasing number and because the consequences are usually catastrophic. Unplanned pregnancies can have physical, psychosocial, and prenatal effects. It is important from both the individual and societal perspective that high priority be given to the task of preventing adolescent pregnancy. The health care provider, to gain the trust of the adolescent, must be open, honest, and willing to consider the young person's feelings and motivations. In addition to historical data and physical examination, the choice of a contraceptive method is based on individual preferences involving personal, familial, religious, and societal beliefs as well as sexual practice. A decision involving birth control for the adolescent can be complicated by parental influence and involvement. The teenage years are frequently a time of embarrassment about the physical maturation and biological functioning of the body. Birth control methods which require a person to touch himself/herself or to be used at the time of sexual intercourse may be unacceptable to the teenager. Fertility awareness techniques, such as basal body temperature, rhythm, and cervical mucus methods are inexpensive but call for a high degree of personal motivation. The use of a diaphragm requires an office visit and a pelvic examination for fitting and prescription. Contraceptive foam, suppositories, and condoms can be easily obtained over-the-counter for a minimal cost, and a moderate degree of personal motivation is needed for their effective use. Though effective, abortions should not be recommended indiscriminately. Permanent contraceptive methods are not recommended for the adolescent. The IUD and oral contraceptives (OCs) are recommended for adolescents who are unwilling to touch themselves or who desire a birth control method which can be used apart from the act of sexual intercourse. Both are highly effective, but there are important factors to consider in their prescription. Both methods require an initial office visit and pelvic examination and an additional procedure for the insertion of the IUD. Follow-up visits are essential and a prescription is necessary for the OCs. Cost can be prohibitive for the adolescent. Both have possible side effects contributing to mild to major discomfort.",

The attitude toward name also reflects the ego attitude positively or negatively, at times neurotic. Therefore all parents is very careful to make naming at their baby births. There is an old proverb that the tiger dies and leaves the leather, and the person dies and leaves name behind. This means that our names represent the human dignity, and emphasizes the importance of naming. But there were many persons tried to change their given names. They used the various pen names, stage names, nick names, pseudonyms, anonyms, alias, total or partial renaming. Their renaming behavior is likely to hide many various personal motivations. Their main motivations reveal the personal conflicts and identity problems. Those are the denial of familial origins, or the concealment of native lands, family romances, wishful rebirth fantasies, secondary gainings, dissatisfied self-images, or personal insecurities, self-protectiveness, lowered self-esteems, chronic inferiorities, preserved privacies. Renaming needs to be considerably decisive as well as the religious conversion. But I would like to conclude that the most powerful motivating forces of renaming are the identity crisis and intrafamilial conflicts.",

      "title": "Sexual Incompatibilities",
      "abstract": "A framework is given for thinking about the clinical approaches to sexual incompatibilities. It is simplified by breaking down into the three major stages of marriage. Early marriage presents the facets of drive level differences, of sexual ignorance, fatigue states, and paired‐relation images. The sexual complaint is rarely presented as such. Middle marriage is laden with a host of troubles which will present some sexual face. Personal incompatibilities are well developed, progressive alienation is occuring, preoccupation with career or child raising is prominent, and frank psychiatric states come into full bloom. Sexual complaints are readily voiced at this stage. Advanced marriage is marked by the aggravated incompatibilities, the increasing occurence of disease states and both the conditioned libido loss and that induced by medications. The specific problems, and their possible solutions are more readily identified and dealt with within this kind of framework.",

An individual or group identity is only partly a matter of self-identification. Identities are also assigned by others. They imply and rely on the recognition of differences. ‘Racist identities: ambivalence, contradiction, and commitment’ questions the ambivalence of racialized language, the factors that create an identity, and the contradictions involved in anti-racists claims that prejudice is a product of ignorance and irrationality. Having a possibly unfavourable view of ‘outsiders’ does not constitute racism, which involves specific beliefs about the existence of race and the possibility of a hierarchical order.",

An increasing number of abnormalities can be uncovered in the human body, and more and more people are defined as being at risk for various diseases or at risk as child bearers. The aim of this paper is to examine the notion of risk, and to understand it in different ways as it is applied to childbirth. General and professional perspectives on risk are different; views vary as to what constitutes acceptable risk, and the association between normalcy and complications is socially and culturally determined. Figures for risk and reliability are not objective values. The safe and the risky are anchored in certain symbol systems. Alternative and dialogic notions have been introduced in conversations and thinking about risk, and medicalism and paternalism have been questioned. This questioning has thus far had little influence on clinical practice. The two opposite perspectives of risk and security in the area of pregnancy and birth should be taken into consideration. The childbearing woman has preferences of her own. Dialog with the health professional and information about professional facts and professional uncertainty should be offered.",

      "title": "Motivation for social contact across the life span: a theory of socioemotional selectivity.",
      "abstract": "Older people engage in social interaction less frequently than their younger counterparts. As I mentioned at the start, the change has been interpreted in largely negative terms. Yet when asked about their social relationships, older people describe them as satisfying, supportive, and fulfilling. Marriages are less negative and more positive. Close relationships with siblings are renewed, and relationships with children are better than ever before. Even though older people interact with others less frequently than younger people do, old age is not a time of misery, rigidity, or melancholy. Rather than present a paradox, I argue here that decreasing rates of contact reflect a reorganization of the goal hierarchies that underlie motivation for social contact and lead to greater selectivity in social partners. This reorganization does not occur haphazardly. Self-definition, information seeking, and emotion regulation are ranked differently depending not only on past experiences, but on place in the life cycle and concomitant expectations about the future. I contend that the emphasis on emotion in old age results from a recognition of the finality of life. In most people's lives this does not appear suddenly in old age but occurs gradually across adulthood. At times, however, life events conspire to bring about endings more quickly. Whether as benign as a geographical relocation or as sinister as a fatal disease, endings heighten the salience of surrounding emotions. When each interaction with a grandchild or good-bye kiss to a spouse may be the last, a sense of poignancy may permeate even the most casual everyday experiences. When the regulation of emotion assumes greatest priority among social motives, social partners are carefully chosen. The most likely choices will be long-term friends and loved ones, because they are most likely to provide positive emotional experiences and affirm the self. Information seeking will motivate some social behavior, but for reasons discussed previously, this will also require judicious choices of social partners. Narrowing the range of social partners allows people to conserve physical and cognitive resources, freeing time and energy for selected social relationships. As such, SST is highly consistent with the selective optimization with compensation model of successful aging formulated by P. Baltes and M. Baltes (1990) described above. SST is meant to describe and explain the underlying mechanisms for age-related changes in social behavior. It is not intended to be prescriptive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "A universal phenomenon equally ancient as the history of mankind, suicide is defined as the willful and intentional ending of one's own life. Risk factors for suicidal behavior are traumatic childhood and adulthood experiences, negative interfamily interactions, social isolation, decreased social solidarity, financial troubles, losses, despair, impulsivity, and migration. Recognized as a critical public health problem, preliminary causes of suicide are financial, religious, political, social, cultural, and medical in addition to mental disorders like depression and alcohol addiction. It has been proven in a number of researches till today that there is a correlation between major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, alcohol-drug use, and suicidal behavior. Nonetheless, the relation between anxiety disorders and suicidal behavior has not been clearly defined to date. The evidences gathered so far reveal that panic disorder is only an independent risk factor for suicide attempt. The limited number of studies on this domain provided nonhomogenous results. It is however a point to keep in mind that if anxiety disorders are codiagnosed with mental disorders, they pose risk for suicidal behavior. In different studies with a wider sampling in this domain, analyzing the effect of specific anxiety disorders on suicidal behavior might be useful for suicide prevention programs.",

      "abstract": "When people's knowledge and awareness are the subject of public health research, the meanings applied to the words knowledge and awareness are often unclear. Although frequently used interchangeably without that being problematic, these words sometimes appear to have different intended meanings but those meanings are not made explicit or, despite the meanings having been made explicit, they are not adhered to. It is necessary to overcome obscurities when knowledge and awareness are intended to represent different domains. This occurs when they are compared with each other; it also occurs when knowledge and awareness are assessed separately in relation to such variables as health behavior; physical, psychological, or socioeconomic statuses; gender; age; and ethnic backgrounds. For those particular research ventures, recommendations are made that knowledge be used to refer to information that is, to a greater or lesser extent, detailed and factual, and that awareness be associated with information that is personally relevant. Some suggestions are made, and issues are raised, about how the psychometric foundations for each of those two domains might be established prior to use in empirical research. Adopting the recommendations and suggestions made in this article provides opportunities for greater conceptual and empirical clarity and success.",

Homosexuality virtually cannot be corrected and is carefully concealed. In single-sex groups (soldiers, students of military schools, convicts) the prevalence of homosexuality may be as high as 30 to 50%. The proposed complex method for the diagnosis of homosexuality in men has been developed on the basis of methods of sexology, anthropometry, verbal and nonverbal psychodiagnosis, multidimensional mathematical statistics. The method consists of several independent blocks representing different aspects of sexuality. It is conductive to a flexible and rapid solution of numerous practical problems from singling out a risk group in screening examinations to full expert evaluation of the sexual sphere with a resulting differential diagnosis.",

The celebrities who commit suicide may have various reasons like, family problems, failed relationships, pressure of career, disturbed married life etc. As they are unable to cope up or face the pressure of their personal lives being telecasted openly they try to hide and suppress their relationship out of public glare. It has been noticed that, the celebrities who had failed in their love relations are more likely to commit suicide and the most common method of suicide has been by hanging. It is also seen that in all the celebrities suicide cases their male partners were accused of abetting them for committing suicide, but when investigated they were found innocent and released.

Either a substitution without proxy or a swindle of one spouse by the other occurs in vital areas of their relation. The spouse's communication shows a continuous reciprocal attempt not to define their own relation, by the use of a wide wordiness, that includes different subjects and meanings in a confusive and spiral-shaped sequence. Such a kind of relation is assumed as originated by a massy influence of at least one spouse's family, that stops the couple at early stages of their relation.",

Early traumatic sexual experiences (e.g. sexual abuse), religious orthodoxy, low self-esteem and body image, negative attitudes about sexuality, lack of knowledge about sex and fear responses are some of the traditional etiological correlates of vaginismus. Vaginismus is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. An interview is crucial in differentiating the causes of this disease and it should involve the following key questions: -whether the contraction of the vaginal muscles was recorded from the first sexual contact and still remains a need for sexual satisfaction is achieved without relations vaginal or -symptom occurs for some time and what circumstances it bound or -contraction of the muscles is independent of the will, reflex and is at the very idea of sexual intercourse, and -that the contraction of the vaginal muscles occurs when you try to enter the member into the vagina which is very painful. The physical, gynecological and sexuological examinations exclude local causes of the disease. The mainstay of treatment in the majority of cases is psychosexual support. The cause of organic vaginismus is congenital malformation of the genital tract. It results from abnormal development of genital paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts and the urogenital sinus, which are structures involved in the process of oviduct, uterus, and vagina organogenesis. This has strong implications in the practices of gynecology and sexuology in general, not only in adolescent gynecology and sexuology. Vaginismus with congenital malformation is an important problem in these fields.",

These stereotypes may in turn yield positive or negative consequences; however, their influence may be limited by other variables.

On the other hand, the debate for or against abortion is meaningless to the extent that most women seeking abortions are to some degree \"against\" abortion. Finally, beyond a certain point the use of contraception and the demand for abortion are not related, as shown by the stability of abortion rates in France over the past 20 years during which rates of contraceptive usage changed greatly and by the high level of contraceptive information among women seeking repeat abortions. In the psychic realm, being pregnant is positive if only as a indication of the power to become pregnant. It is known that women suffering a recent loss are more likely to become pregnant. PRegnancy under circumstances of loss or mourning signifies that something other than death or loss is possible. The idea of pregnancy as a compensation for loss can refer to a range of situations such as death of a close relative, end of a union, divorce, unemployment, or educational or professional failure, to name a few. The unconscious utilization of pregnancy as a proof of power can be repeated each time doubt arises as to the reality of this power. Not pregnancy, but bringing a child into the world is what is impossible in voluntary pregnancy termination. Abortion is chosen because it allows the mother or the couple to avoid an investment for which they are unprepared. Becoming a mother means to stop being a child and also forces an encounter with the images of one's own parents internalized during childhood. Such images are not always good, which caused problems in the psychic work of identification with the parent that accompanies childbirth. Choosing to have a child and joining the chain of generations is impossible for some persons, because the filiation is too difficult or the parental images are too negative. Abortions, like the occurrence of the pregnancies that lead to them, are always meaningful, although their significance may not be consciously grasped by the woman. On the societal level, abortion may signal resistance to the medicalization and perhaps politicization of sexuality. The perceived high economic cost of children and desire to provide them with abundance may be other factors in the demand for abortion. To some degree children are now valued by society primarily as a potential market. Study of the origins of abortion is not specific, but fundamental to an understanding of human reproduction in general.",

Different people might define traumatic differently. And more importantly, a person's current personality may be related to the tendency to classify things this way. The point is that it is difficult to interpret a simple association between the experience of life events and specific personality traits; without prospective, longitudinal data, it is impossible to determine which came first. When examining the links between trauma and personality change, it is not always the case that negative effects are to be expected. Indeed, a relatively large literature focuses on the possibility that trauma can lead to growth.",

      "abstract": "There is a robust tendency for people to expect others to be more immoral than them, for instance, more selfish. Where do these pessimistic beliefs come from? We explore a socio-metacognitive account whereby those beliefs originate in one's own impulses to act selfishly. In two studies, we used the social mindfulness paradigm, a task that provides the initial chooser the opportunity to be socially mindful about other people or not. Results show 1) that people expect others to be more selfish than them, and 2) that this belief in the selfishness of others is related to one's own impulses to act selfishly. Thus, even when people are kind in their choices, they tend to be less generous in their beliefs about the kindness of others, and this is particularly the case when those selfless choices did not come easily to them, but rather required suppressing an impulse to act selfishly.",

In applying genetic techniques to patient populations and their families, they have to avoid the hazards, in choosing their index cases, of making too few diagnostic distinctions, too many, or the wrong ones. They have been accused of working with nonhomogeneous collections, on the one hand, or with ad hoc divisions, on the other, and of lacking sophistication regarding the individuality of human lives. Actually, however, the discipline of psychiatric genetics has as one of its chief goals the development of techniques for eventually making clinically useful distinctions and discovering clinically useful interrelationships that also have an etiological basis. As with any other approach directed to refinement of nosology, a genetic study may start with a wide catch of subjects defined on symptomatic, social, or other pragmatic bases, but lead in an enlightening fashion, by a process of subdivision and elimination, to one or more clearly defined groups.",

There seems to be a built-in tension between the two: this is evident, for example, in negative emotions such as envy and hate, where one person has a significant negative attitude toward another. This tension is also obvious in positive emotions, such as schadenfreude, where an individual is pleased about the other’s misfortune. Such tension may even be greater in romantic love, where the lover should give special attention and status to the beloved. The tension gains further momentum when we assume that self-fulfillment is an essential feature of romantic relationships. Indeed, it seems that in many low-quality romantic relations, the tension between self-fulfillment and the needs of the beloved is real and toxic. However, in enduring profound love, which involves the personal growth of each partner, self-fulfillment is not egoistic, and the tension drives mutual thriving.",

In addition to having sex, other pedophiles are satisfied by watching child pornography which is spread on prohibited sites and joining sexual deviation groups to make video calls for sex. If they do not have direct sexual intercourse, the pedophile can satisfy his lust by interacting online with the victim in the form of erotic chat, sending pictures and videos, and audio that triggers sexual arousal. The object of pedophilia itself is minors and does not look at gender. The type of research used in this article is normative by utilizing laws, pedophilia books, and mass media in the form of articles. Research data shows that there is confusion in convicting a pedophile. This is because pedophilia can be classified as a mental disorder, psychological condition, or more towards sexual orientation. This deviant behavior will certainly damage the growth and development of a child as a future generation. This deviant behavior must be stopped. When the perpetrator begins to realize there is a sexual disorder, the perpetrator must consult his condition to a psychologist. If this deviant act damages and harms other people, the perpetrator must undergo severe sanctions. Because the perpetrator takes the opportunity to deceive and damage someone's morale.",

      "abstract": "Death is a general human experience and a certain and inevitable end of a human life. Understanding of and individual attitude towards and dying has changed throughout history from the fact that it is a natural phenomenon to the point that it is a disturbing and unacceptable event. Concepts of and dying are two different events that are clearly defined and conceptually different so they should not be mixed up. Dying is a dynamic process of gradual and irreversible loss of vital functions during a certain period of time, whereas is a moment when life ends, or status of life’s completion. Nowadays, has become a taboo subject and it has been thrown away from everyday life and became ignored and rejected as a result of fear of in most people. The most common problems associated with dying and are: telling the truth about diagnosis and prognosis, informed consent for treatment, usually unsuccessful and sometimes futile treatments, fear of pain, the absence or lack of psychological support and personal care. In the second half of the 20th century, there was a change of social consciousness about and dying which encouraged experts from different scientific areas to study them as a specific discipline. Somewhat later, a new philosophy, about taking care of people who cannot be cured, had appeared which was based on respect for human rights. Coincidentally appeared a new worldwide hospice project, with goal to influence on symbols of and dying and to improve the quality of life of a dying person and his family. As a result of this approach to problems of and dying, a new concept of good death was developed, which was realized through following aspects: naturalness, managing symptoms, pain and emotions, social support, humanity and dignity, quality of living and care for the family. Even though Republic Serbia has the Strategy for palliative care according to which palliative care should become an essential part of heath care system and an important element in citizens right for health care, this problem will not be completely solved without special educations for present and future doctors and health co-workers.",

      "abstract": "Stereotypes, prejudices, and discriminatory behaviors directed toward people based on their sexual orientation vary broadly. Existing perspectives on sexual prejudice argue for different underlying causes, sometimes provide disparate or conflicting evidence for its roots, and typically fail to account for variances observed across studies. We propose an affordance management approach to understanding sexual prejudice, which weds the fundamental motives theory with the sociofunctional threat-based approach to prejudice to provide a broader explanation for the causes and outcomes of sexual prejudice and to explain inter- and intragroup prejudices more broadly. Prejudices arise as specific emotions designed to engage functional behavioral responses to perceived threats and opportunities (i.e., affordances) posed by different sexual orientation groups, and interact with the perceiver's chronic or temporarily activated fundamental motives (e.g., parenting, mating), which determine the relevance of certain target affordances. Our perspective predicts what stereotype content is likely to direct specific affective and behavioral reactions (i.e., the stereotypes that relay threat- and opportunity-relevant information) and when the affordance-emotion-behavior link is likely to engage (i.e., when those threats and opportunities are directly relevant to the perceiver's current fundamental goal). This article synthesizes the extant sexual prejudice literature from an affordance management approach to demonstrate how fundamental goals interact with preexisting perceptions to drive perceptual, affective, and behavioral responses toward sexual orientation groups, and provides a degree of explanatory power heretofore missing from the prejudice literature.

This study reports findings from a 13-year, 4-phase longitudinal study in which trait anxiety, measured when spouses were newlyweds, consistently predicted marital negativity which, in turn, was associated with partner's marital dissatisfaction. Some support was also found for effects of trait anxiety on partner's marital satisfaction, independent of marital negativity, as well as for the idea that trait anxiety is directly related to spouses' own marital satisfaction. Trait anxiety did not distinguish couples who divorced from those who remained married, and it generally did not predict declines in marital satisfaction.

We have seen in Chapter 6 that one particular aspect of expressing difficulty with and defending against the pains of separateness and intimacy is to engage in behaviours and take up positions that appear more adult or at least show intolerance of the pains of dependency. On the other hand, it is possible to identify adolescents that appear to locate the problematic arena in the outside world of peers and adulthood. These adolescents appear to be stuck on the inside, within the child in the family role. This has the meaning that the impact of internal, familial and social factors, often in inextricable combinations, slows down or brings to a halt the adolescent development towards separateness and relative independence of parental figures. Thus, either physically or emotionally or both the adolescent is unable to become a 'temporary outsider'. There is a range of adolescent difficulties that can be associated with being stuck on the inside. In order to explore the psychosocial aspects of these difficulties in adolescence, this chapter will discuss adolescents with phobias, body image disturbance and eating disorders and disabilities. This is followed by a discussion of depression and self-harm.",

Nonreligious young adults are typically socially liberal with individualistic, nonauthoritarian values.

On one hand, those with low religiousness and infrequent church attendance tend to have more mental health problems and often report familial conflicts if they were raised religiously.

They can resort to a prenatal diagnosis, a preimplantation diagnosis, have a child naturally with the risk of transmitting the disease to it, or opt for the radical and painful decision not to have a child at all. Through interviews with couples, the article analyses the outcome of the desire to have a child in such a context. The unforeseen diagnosis of genetic disease can creep into the effects of retrospect and deploy along the lines of two configurations: the first where discontinuity, passivation and distress reign and the second where unpredictability can accompany a movement of trophic transformation for the couple. The man’s and the woman’s subjective positions can then be insufficiently brought into conflict when one of the partners wishes to have a child and the other refuses, fearing not just handing down the disease to the child but also the illness’s consequences on their partner.",

      "abstract": "Coined as “phubbing”, excessive use of smartphones in the romantic context has been shown to represent a barrier to meaningful communication, causing conflict, lowering relationship satisfaction, and undermining individual well-being. While these findings project a dire picture of the future of romance, the mechanisms behind the detrimental influence of partner phubbing on relationship-relevant markers are still little understood. Considering prior evidence that partner phubbing leads to the loss of exclusive attention towards the other party, we argue that these are rather the feelings of jealousy partner phubbing is triggering that are responsible for the negative relational outcomes. Based on the analysis of qualitative and quantitative responses from “generation Y” users, we find that partner phubbing is associated with heightened feelings of jealousy, which is inversely related to couple’s relational cohesion. Moreover, jealousy plays a mediating role in the relationship between partner’s smartphone use and relational cohesion, acting as a mechanism behind this undesirable link. Challenging the frequently promoted euphoria with regard to permanent “connectedness”, our study contributes to a growing body of IS research that addresses dark sides of information technology use and provides corresponding implications for IS practitioners.",

      "abstract": "In couple relationships, intense or protracted conflict can activate the attachment system, raising concerns about the partner‘s availability and the future of the relationship. Hence, individuals with different attachment orientations are expected to respond differently to conflict. This article summarises a series of studies into adult attachment and conflict processes, examining four issues: conflicts regarding closeness and distance in dating couples, patterns of marital conflict, reactions to anger-evoking and hurtful events, and the role of attachment and conflict patterns in the intergenerational transmission of relationship difficulties. The studies point to complex links between attachment and conflict variables. Insecurity - particularly attachment anxiety – is associated with high levels of conflict, and with maladaptive responses such as coercion and conflict avoidance. These conflict behaviors are likely to fuel disagreement, hence maintaining or exacerbating insecurity. There is also evidence that insecurity and maladaptive conflict behaviors create relational dissatisfaction, and that conflict behaviors partially mediate the link between insecurity and dissatisfaction. Research further suggests that parents‘ insecurity and destructive conflict behaviors have negative consequences for adolescent offspring, in terms of attachment difficulties and appraisals of loneliness. These findings highlight the importance of interventions designed to ameliorate insecurities and communication difficulties.",

      "title": "Paradoxes of Maternal Mourning",
      "abstract": "It has been customary to conceptualize mourning as a phasic or stage phenomenon (Lindemann 1944; Parkes 1972; Bowlby 1980; Knapp 1986). Such a conceptualization has proved to be of tremendous didactic value, especially in terms of succinctly organizing and communicating the major affects, behaviors, and reactions of mourning. It is, however, my belief, based upon clinical experience with many forms of bereavement, that the phenomenon of mourning is not comprised of clearly delineated stages and phases. I have come to conceptualize the phenomenon of mourning the death of a loved person as involving the bereaved's struggle with a series of more or less unresolvable paradoxes rather than as a progression through stages that possess relatively distinct and predictable beginning and ending points. The specific paradoxes encountered by a bereaved person differ, of course, in accordance with the relationship that was lost (mother, father, spouse, child, or sibling), the developmental stage of the bereaved (childhood, adolescence, adulthood, or maturity), the type of death (sudden or prolonged), and the cause of death (illness, murder, suicide, or accident). In this paper, I will address those paradoxes that seem specific to maternal mourning - that is, to mothers who are mourning the death of a child.",

Both forms, and especially a combination of the two, change the behaviors as well as the decision making of the person who has been abused, whether a child or an adult. And while an adult may choose not to have the abuser in her life, a child rarely has that choice. The child usually loves her parents unconditionally and cannot comprehend why she is being mistreated. As a teenager and then an adult, she often times looks for the same type of abuser in a partner in an effort to satisfy her need to repair her emotional scars. The child needs psychological help as early as possible before she grows up and sabotages her life by making life-altering mistakes.",

In both male and female primates, cues from or interactions with conspecifics can inhibit reproductive development in juveniles, as well as reproductive physiology and sexual behavior in adults. In males, reproductive maturation may be delayed, and adult testosterone levels and sexual behavior are often reduced, in low‐ranking individuals compared to dominants. Female reproductive maturation can be delayed by the presence of a dominant female and/or the absence of an unrelated adult male, while numerous aspects of adult female reproductive function can be inhibited by cues from same‐sex rivals or adult males. Social suppression of reproduction appears to be a mechanism whereby individuals avoid investing in reproductive attempts that are likely to fail due to inauspicious social conditions, thereby increasing the likelihood of breeding successfully in the future.",

      "abstract": "We replicated and extended (N = 495) what is known about the relationships between the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy) and a wider range (than previously reported) of sociosexuality including risky sexual behaviors (e.g., lack of condom use) and sexuality in relation to dating applications like Tinder, in general, in men and women, and above agreeableness. Machiavellianism and psychopathy were linked to most sociosexual behaviors and attitudes. In men, Machiavellianism was linked to various sociosexual outcomes, in women those outcomes were associated with psychopathy instead. Agreeableness was hardly correlated with sociosexual outcomes. The Dark Triad traits were more strongly correlated with the studied outcomes even after controlling for agreeableness or for the dark core. Unexpectedly, men who were Machiavellian and agreeable reported the most sex partners in different contexts, but not psychopaths. In contrast, women who were psychopathic not only had more sex partners in general, but they also engaged in more unprotected sex, and one-night stands than men did. These findings build on prior research on the Dark Triad traits and their associations with sociosexuality and help to draw a more nuanced and modern picture of those relationships.",

      "abstract": "If sociomedical research is to move beyond the stage of repeatedly reporting correlations between social variables and disease, a viable conceptualization of the connection between social and physiological variables must be developed. We suggest that subjective interpretations of information perceived in a situation as congruous or incongruous with learned expectations is the key point of articulation. Each individual has an information repertoire derived from social interaction and direct contact with the non-social environment. If the individual's perceptions of the situation are not congruous with his information repertoire, he is likely to experience activation of the autonomic nervous system and related neuroendocrine and somatic processes. If these physiological processes are intense and/or prolonged enough, they may alter the body's resistance to infectious organisms, temporarily or irreversibly damage the body or reduce behavioral efficiency, increasing the likelihood of accidents. At the same time, encountering of information incongruities may lead to rejection by the individual of the source of the invalidated information. If this source is a social network, the member may become alienated from the network. If this alienation is shared by others, it may lead to social change. Social communication networks protect their members from incongruities by teaching them correct information, by isolating them from incongruous information, by explaining incongruities encountered so they are no longer perceived as incongruous, and by providing means of relieving tensions produced by encounters with incongruities.",

Audiences vary in their reactions; what’s wrongful in one audience may be acceptable in another—hence, deviance is relative to audience, society, subgroup, context, and historical time. Typically, reactions express negative attitudes toward the violations of a strongly-held norm. Such reactions are varied, and include condemnation, withdrawing from the presence of the offender, and the unwillingness to join in interaction with the offending party or parties. Most members of the society can perform a mental experiment to picture what these reactions are likely to be for a range of audiences. The researcher conducted a survey among 60 park-goers to determine what is considered wrongful in the park. In the park, multiple parties put on performances of extremely eccentric or deviant behaviour. Felonious crime is very rare in the park; milder forms of deviance are common, however, including offensive staring and selling marijuana. Public gay sex, which used to be common, has all but disappeared there.",

At the other ends of the developmental spectrum infant temperament and late adolescent personality disorder are well described.

However, it is not known if or to what extent there are links between infant temperamental types and various childhood personality traits for normal children, although developmental trajectories for children 'en route' to antisocial personality disorder have been described. Earlier identification of a range of positive and negative personality traits in childhood would allow adaptive, positive traits to be encouraged and negative, antisocial or interpersonal traits to be curtailed through specially adapted parenting interventions.

      "title": "P–487 Couples undergoing first level assisted reproductive techniques: An Actor-Partner interdependence model of dyadic adjustment, psychological symptoms, alexithymia and romantic attachment on body-image avoidance",
      "abstract": "Abstract Study question The study aims to assess the commonalities and interdependence of couples undergoing first-level Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) as regards body-image avoidance referred to body-image dissatisfaction. Summary answer Partners’ functioning seem specular yet not interdependent, as not showing a couple-as-a-unit modality of functioning. Body-image avoidance is only influenced by intra-personal variables. What is known already: Stressful bodily emotions and body perception related to infertility and ART are critical aspects for people desiring having children. Infertility undermines women’s self-esteem and body-image, damaging their self-identity as women, while in males infertility associates with body dissatisfaction referring to perceived reduced physical fitness and personal failure, thus undermining their body virility. For infertile women, body-image dissatisfaction associates with reduced marital adjustment, and vice-versa; yet no study has considered how males body-image dissatisfaction associates with marital satisfaction. Nonetheless, couples should be considered as a unit, considering that infertile couples’ adjustment is influenced by their own, and their partners’, perceived stress. Study design, size, duration The study follows a cross-sectional design and is part of an ongoing transversal and longitudinal project, started in 2012, investigating the well-being of couples undergoing ART. For the present study only a minority of the existing data were considered, thus only including couples at the first level of ART with the intent of investigating couples’ commonalities and interdependence before treatments pervasiveness increases. Participants/materials, setting, methods Minimum N = 79 couples needed to be considered according to Power analysis results. N = 118 couples aged 24 to 46 years (women Mage=34.92, SD = 3.98; men Mage=37.45, SD = 5.25) were included, and declaring trying to get pregnant from 1 to 8 years (M = 3.18; SD = 1.99) and to never had children, although 22.9% of women had at least an abortion. Participants completed the Body-Image Avoidance Questionnaire, Toronto Alexithymia Scale–20, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, Symptom Checklist–90-Revised and Experiences in Close Relationships Scale-Revised. Main results and the role of chance The sample presents non-clinical levels of functioning referring to their psychological symptoms, alexithymia and body-image avoidance. Multivariate rank tests show that females report significantly higher levels of body-image avoidance (stat=–5.73; adj.p=.001), psychological symptoms (stat=–4.58; adj.p=.001) and romantic anxious attachment (stat=–3.33; adj.p=.005). These differences were confirmed also after applying multiplicity control. Moreover, bi-variate Pearson’s r correlations show an association among partners’ dyadic adjustment (r=.293; p&amp;lt;.001), albeit their overall level of dyadic adjustment is low. Significant correlations among partners also emerged as regards psychological symptoms (r=.258; p&amp;lt;.001) and alexithymia (r=.16; p=.05). The couple-effect, thus considering the couple as the unit of analysis, was modeled through an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. For both partners, dyadic adjustment’s actor-effect associates with body-image avoidance (women: β = 0.133, p=.026; man: β = 0.133, p=.026). Furthermore, for both men and women, psychological symptoms’ actor-effect associate to body-image avoidance (women: β = 0.467, p&amp;lt;.00; men: β = 0.499, p=.001). Comparing the level of influence of actor and partner effects among partners, the psychological symptoms’ actor effect results significantly more influential than the partner-effect (women: Δ = 0.378, p=.015; men: Δ = 0.587, p=.001). Only for males, alexithymia’s actor effect is significant (β = 0.499; p=.001). Limitations, reasons for caution Results should be considered in light of some limitations. Specifically, the cross-sectional study design, lack of a control group with no infertility issues, the use of self-report measures, homogeneity among couples and the sample small sample size (although sample size was appropriate to retain a power of at least .8). Wider implications of the findings: Results support the differentiation of gender-specific psychosocial interventions along the ART path, preventing and mitigating the negative impact of infertility and ART on body-image dissatisfaction and avoidance and on the couples’ well-being.

      "title": "Teenage pregnancy: the nonuse of contraception.",
      "abstract": "Despite their increasing knowledge and the availability of contraceptives and sex education programs teen-agers often do not use contraceptives. Factors affecting their nonuse of contraception include the following: 1) conscious or unconscious desires of young women to become pregnant without necessarily wanting a child; 2) the confirmation of masculinity for a young man by impregnating a woman; 3) the desire for security achieved by gaining peer support and feeling like 1 of them; 4) the feeling particularly of young women that planning for sex acknowledging its possibility and arranging for birth control makes them calculating loose and possibly immoral; 5) the impulsiveness and intensity of feelings of adolescents; 6) the widespread pressure to have sexual intercourse; 7) the myths and misconceptions about contraceptives; and 8) the difficulties in making information counseling and contraceptives easily available. If the use of a contraceptive is opposed by prevailing adolescent norms or represents a conflictual declaration of sexuality by the teen-ager the problem of contraceptive use increases. If contraceptives are offered without any examination or counseling problems also arise for the methods may be used incorrectly or may constitute an ecouragement of sexuality which the teen-ager may not be ready to handle. What the teen-ager often wants is help in sorting out feelings about a relationship or sex. Sometimes she/he may be asking for help in saying no because of ambivalence anxiety or a sense of not being ready. In relationships between young men and women it is often unclear as to who is to take responsibility for contraception. A psychiatrist can help the teen-ager develop the capacity to deal with her/his feelings and to predict behavior maximizing the possibility of planning. It is also important that the psychiatrist focus on family influences and issues without suggesting punitive or critical implications.",

      "title": "Sexual Orientation and the Addictions",
      "abstract": "Change and growth are essential parts of human development. Sometimes help is needed for change necessitating psychotherapeutic interventions. The desire for some specific changes, however, may be based on misunderstanding, fear, or prejudice. The therapist must take a clear and objective view, understand what motivates the change, and not promise the impossible. Gay men and lesbians, or people who are begining to become aware fo a homosexual orientation, may wish to try and change that orientation based on a combination of internalized and external homophobia. This combination lead to the higher exxpression of the illness of substance abuse among gays and lesbians. The gay and lesbian substance abuser who has not been able to accept and integrate his or her sexual orientation may well seek the help of psychotherapy to change orientation, hoping to somehow get life back on track. Denial of sexual orientation, however, usually extends to denial around issues of substance use and abuse. Before any real movement can occur in therapy, the therapist much help the substance abuser recognize the illness of substance abuse, and the need to have treatment for it. As part of the early recovery process of getting clean and sober, sexual orientation must be discussed and ways to accept and live with being gay or lesbian explored. After six months of being clean and sober, a patient may be in a position to effectively utilize psychotherapy to explore and resolve internalized homophobia. Usually, the desire to change sexual orientation subsequently disappears, and the patient learns how to fully accept and integrate a gay and lesbian identity into their new found sobriety.",

      "title": "The Animal Cruelty‐Delinquency Relationship",
      "abstract": "Several hypotheses have been advanced in an effort to explain the association that several decades of research suggests may exist between animal cruelty and delinquency. First, there is the violence graduation hypothesis, which holds that animal cruelty serves as a springboard to later interpersonal violence. Then, there is the deviance generalization hypothesis, which postulates that animal cruelty is part of a larger deviance syndrome. Finally, there is the antecedent lifestyle hypothesis, which maintains that animal cruelty and behaviors like bullying have their basis in a fearless temperament, callous/unemotional traits, and a proactive antisocial attitude. The antecedent lifestyle hypothesis further contends that in some cases delinquent behavior stems either directly or indirectly from one or more of the developmental antecedents identified by the hypothesis (i.e., animal cruelty, bullying, parental defiance, fire-setting, drug use, sexual promiscuity). In the first part of this chapter, the concurrent and predictive relationships that appear to connect animal cruelty to delinquency are explored, verified, and documented. In the second part of this chapter, the violence graduation, deviance generalization, and antecedent lifestyle hypotheses are evaluated against existing data in an effort to determine which hypothesis or set of hypotheses best explains the animal cruelty–delinquency relationship.",

      "title": "[Suicide and adolescence. II. Psychosocial factors and clinical aspects].",
      "abstract": "In this study, that follows another one, where the normal characteristics of adolescence that may influence suicidal behavior were focalised, a critical review of the psycho-social elements involved in the matter is done; attention is also given to the clinical picture. The family influences are very important and frequently we find antecedents of suicidal behavior in parents or in near relatives. The homes are usually unhappy with a father absent or \"feeble\". It is not rare the presence of a dominant-rejecting mother. The home is poor in love expressions, and the intra and extra family reactions tend to lead to the youth social isolation. With the changes that normally happens in adolescence, the repressed aggressive impulses increase and tend for discharge at this phase, but usually the youth turns them against himself. The emergent genital sexuality is also perceived as threatening by the parents. Though lacking more detailed studies, it seems that families of suicidal adolescents are very similar to the families of depressive ones. In females, cultural influences such as greater tolerance to suicidal attempts behavior, perhaps explain the higher incidence of this behavior. Men usually use violent methods for consumating the suicide, and often their mental status is more severe than in females. The precipitant factors vary a lot but they usually give evidence of a conflictive situation. It is suspected that often the patient unconsciously puts himself in the difficult situation. The influence of mental illness in the suicidal behavior of adolescents is complicated by several classificatory systems and the possibility of considering abnormal aspects that normally occur during adolescence. In the clinical picture is important to consider the patient report about his suicidal thoughts. The evaluation of the defences, the intensity of the conflict and the suicidal ideas involved, will determine our conduct. An important feature is that, in adolescents, depressive symptoms usually occur as \"equivalents\". The prognostic is worse when it is impossible to modify family relationships and when social life continues unpoverished. In 40% of the cases a new suicide attempt is done, and the risk is greater during the year that follows the first attempt. Prevention may be done by trying to understand and discuss adolescents problems with them in their peer groups. Public campaigns and courses with moral appeals should be avoided because they increase feelings of guilt. Special attention has to be given in each case to social and family situations. An early diagnosis by pediatricians, clinicians, teachers and law authorities is very important. To do this work they need to have instruction about the adolescence developments.",

Social phobia is known to be disabling at any age but is likely to be particularly important in late-life because of the recognised associations between social support deficits and many adverse outcomes, including depression (1), dementia (2, 3) and physical disorders such as coronary heart disease (4, 5) and some vascular risk factors (6, 7), as well as enhancing the association between depression and mortality (8). Clearly a person's level of social contact is a mixture of their own preference and environmental imposition. As a source of stress, it is most likely that adverse consequences are highest for people whose social networks are limited against their wishes (for example, through bereavement or limitations imposed by health conditions) rather than those who have always preferred a more solitary existence. Social phobia can be considered as representing an extreme form of the former scenario and, as such, should be taken just as seriously in older compared to younger people, if not more so. The study by Karlsson et al. (9) in this issue is therefore welcome because it provides novel and important information on the temporal stability of the condition in older people both in terms of 'new' cases arising and of 'recovery' in previous cases. As with most affective disorders, the observed prevalence of social phobia at a given time point depends substantially on the instrument and criteria used to define it. Estimates for the prevalence of anxiety disorders in older people have ranged from 1.2% using the GMS-AGECAT diagnostic interview (10) to 14% using DSM-IV criteria (11), while prevalence estimates for any phobic disorder in similar age groups have ranged from 1.4% using the GMS-AGECAT (10) to 25.6% using the Phobic Disorders Screen (12). Previously reported cross-sectional data from the Swedish cohort for which prospective data are described here indicated a one month period prevalence of 1.6% for social phobia if strict DSM-IV criteria were applied (13). While this figure cannot be generalised to other older populations because of the nature of the sample (consisting of 70 year old men and women, and 78 year old women), what was important was that the observed prevalence increased almost two-fold (to 3.5%) if the specific DSM-IV requirement was dropped for 'experiencing the fear as unreasonable or excessive'– i.e. all participants defined in this broader manner still described a fear of a social situation, an avoidance of the feared social situation (or an endurance of it with intense anxiety and distress), and adverse social consequences arising as a result (14). Over-rigorous application of diagnostic criteria may therefore be misleading and, indeed, could be construed as 'ageist' if they are allowed to support potentially false inferences concerning differences in prevalence between age groups which may simply have arisen because older people report a given syndrome in a different manner. If an older person reports a disabling social fear resulting in avoidance of the feared situation, is it reasonable to say that they do not have a phobic disorder (and therefore under-estimate prevalence) if they fail to report the fear as being unreasonable or excessive, perhaps because of a higher level of stoicism (or reluctance to report something as problematic)? On the other hand, research criteria for mental disorders traditionally include some prerequisite effect on function, and it is important to bear in mind that the threshold at which a given level of symptomatology affects daily activities may be determined by other contextual factors. An older person might therefore be more likely to report functional impairment relating to phobic symptoms (i.e. resulting in an over-estimated prevalence) if that function has already been compromised because of physical health worries (e.g. fear of incontinence) or other mental disorders (e.g. mild cognitive impairment). Clearly, the problem here relates to the underlying semantics and applicability of standard diagnostic criteria. Researchers should constantly bear in mind that traditional 'diagnoses' are simply constructs applied to help a clinician communicate with a consulting patient, and that 'research diagnostic criteria' exist to standardise the way in which these constructs are elicited (i.e. their reliability), but that achieving good reliability does not mean that the constructs necessarily have validity (i.e. may not reflect the underlying reality of mental ill-health). A commendable feature of the paper by Karlsson et al.(9) is that it takes a flexible approach to the issue of 'diagnosis' applied in social phobia; in particular, that the analyses apply both the strict DSM-IV criteria and the more loose but probably more clinically realistic definition (labelled here 'clinical social phobia') as well as other sub-clinical and symptomatic categories. The most striking finding from this naturalistic study is that only around a quarter of participants with clinical social phobia at baseline were defined as having this condition 5 years later, and close to one half did not describe any social anxiety at all at follow-up. These proportions were not changed substantially if the baseline 'diagnosis' was restricted to full DSM-IV criteria. Social phobia defined in a community population therefore appears to be a much less stable construct than the chronic condition which has been inferred from prospective clinical research (15). While no data are displayed on treatment received, it is unlikely that the high 'recovery' rate is accounted for by medical or psychological interventions, as common mental disorders are generally poorly recognised or treated in community samples and the report does state that receipt or not of antidepressants at baseline or follow-up was not associated with prognosis in the sample. Spontaneous recovery therefore appears to be the norm for social phobia, and clinicians working with older people, as well as people affected, can surely take heart from this, although as the authors warn, we need to bear in mind that social phobia seen in secondary or tertiary care settings may contain more severe or intractable syndromes than screened cases in community samples. The authors go on to describe the five-year 'incidence' of social phobia (i.e. the proportion fulfilling criteria at follow-up who did not do so at baseline), and describe proportions ranging from 2.0% for DSM-IV social phobia through 4.2% for clinical social phobia, to 16.6% for any social fear. This illustrates the point where traditional constructs applied in epidemiological research begin to fail in the face of conditions for which they are not suited. 'Incidence' of course is typically, and most usefully, applied to an event whose occurrence can be accurately ascertained and located in time (for example, a myocardial infarction or stroke) or to a change of state from health to ill-health where the change is relatively abrupt and where spontaneous recovery from the state of ill-health is unlikely (for example, cancer or diabetes). Mental disorders do not readily fit either of these patterns, either because they develop insidiously (for example, dementia and many cases of psychotic disorder in early adult life) or because they fluctuate in intensity between case/non-case levels. Affective disorders typically follow the latter pattern and present a substantial challenge for researchers who wish to communicate something about their course. Is 5-year incidence a helpful construct for a disorder such as social phobia where only a quarter will continue to experience the disorder after a further 5 years? This problem is accentuated in late adult life because of the greater length of preceding time over which such a fluctuation may have occurred. Most community studies of common mental disorders in older people have relied on 2-wave panel survey designs, similar to the analysis reported here. Disorder 'incidence' or 'onset' tends to refer to its absence at time 1 and presence at time 2. The 'incident' cases include both those who are experiencing their first ever episode at time 2 and those who have had chronic ill-health over a much longer period, perhaps even over most of their life, but whose symptomatology happened to be below case-level at time 1. The non-incident cases include those who remained free of symptoms throughout the follow-up period, those who remained at sub-case levels during that period and those who experienced a case-level episode which had fallen below case-level criteria before the time 2 examination. Clearly all of these groups represent very different levels of mental ill-health; however, they are poorly characterised by the 'incidence' paradigm. The 'recovery' paradigm can be criticised in a similar manner, there being a variety of patterns of change from an initial case-level state, although 2-phase studies do more readily convey clinically useful information, for example, in the case of the study by Karlsson et al. (9)., being able to tell someone with social phobia that, regardless of treatment, they have a nearly 50% chance of not having any social anxiety within 5 years time (although clearly information on shorter-term prognosis would also be helpful). What are the potential solutions? The use of multiple diagnostic 'levels' is a helpful start, as mentioned earlier. However, it is clear that mental health research may have to move beyond 'traditional epidemiology' and forge ahead with new ways of classifying patterns of transitions between health and ill-health over time, just as it has led the way in the field of psychometrics by necessity because of the lack of biological measurements and the reliance on accessing individuals' subjective experiences for standard diagnostic constructs. Psychometrics as a field has made substantial advances in characterising states of health at a single point in time, and perhaps a new discipline of 'prospective psychometrics' is required to quantify the complex ways in which mental health states can fluctuate over weeks, months or years. Reasonable progress has been made in describing the clinical course of conditions which have reached sufficient severity to present to secondary care services (16), as well as some naturalistic research in screened community samples (17), although even these involve relatively crude categorisation of different course patterns which do not move very far beyond the 'rule of thirds' beloved of medical students for describing outcomes for most chronic conditions. Characterisation of longer-term course is more challenging and will involve a move beyond simple two-phase designs with shorter intervals between multiple examinations to plot symptom changes more accurately, as well as transitions between states with differing symptom predominance (e.g. between generalised anxiety and depressive syndromes). A certain amount of retrospective recall is likely to be necessary if fluctuations between examinations are to be quantified. However, attempts to define 'lifetime' disorders in older people are likely to prove more problematic given evidence that even major depressive episodes are very poorly recalled 25 years later (18). Finally, just as the field of 'cross-sectional psychometrics' has provided the mathematical models for quantifying symptom clustering and underlying dimensions, so 'prospective psychometrics' needs the further development of mathematical models which take the field beyond simple 'incidence' and 'maintenance' categorisation.",

      "abstract": "You should consider the possibility of sexual abuse when evaluating a child with a traumatic or infectious genital lesion. As will be discussed, certain lesions are highly specific for sexual abuse while others may be nonspecific or more consistent with a medical disorder or accidental injury. It is important to remember that the vast majority of children disclosing sexual abuse do not have physical evidence of injury or infection on examination. Sexual abuse describes involvement of children and adolescents in developmentally inappropriate sexual activities to which they are unable to consent and which they cannot comprehend. Violent assault causing severe injuries is the exception in child sexual abuse, as sexual abusers often exploit the power differential between victim and perpetrator to manipulate children into complying with sexual activity.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the implications related to emotional and psychological abuse lasted for a long time have been discussed with respect to the particular patriarchal society of Pakistan. The data has been collected through interviews, observations, and surveys from the randomly selected participants. The results indicate that the abuse not only damages the person’s (being abused) self worth, self esteem, self respect, identity, self image and self understanding rather destroys the construction of the whole family where kids are especially at risk for later emotional and psychological disorders. Abusers in most of the cases are not aware of their behavior’s worst implications; as no one dares to remind them of their abusive attitude. Thus, families trapped in such traumas often go unnoticed while promoting abusive emotions/perceptual information to the coming generations, through their biased beliefs, gender based baseless sayings, and fake spiritual knowledge in the name of religion, culture and norms.

      "abstract": "Abstract People experience fair and unfair treatment daily, and at times may react by breaking ethical rules and lying. Here, we assess the extent to which individuals engage in dishonest behavior aimed at helping or harming others after they experience (un)fair treatment. Across three financially incentivized experiments, recipients in a dictator game received a fair or unfair amount and then could, by means of dishonesty, inflate or deflate their counterparts’ pay. Results show that dishonest helping is a common and robust behavior. Individuals lie to help others after fair, unfair, and no prior treatment. Dishonest harming, however, is less prevalent. Only after unfair treatment, some, but not all, individuals engage in dishonest harming. Dishonest harming was associated with high levels of anger and disappointment, and low levels of gratitude. Interestingly, the source of (un)fairness, whether it is intentional or not, did not attenuate peoples’ behavior, suggesting that dishonest reactions to (un)fairness were driven by the mere (un)fair treatment, and not by a motivation to reciprocate an (un)fair counterpart.",

      "title": "Risking your health: causes, consequences, and interventions to prevent risky behaviors",
      "abstract": "Behaviors that pose risks for an individual’s health and that also represent important threats for public health, such as drug use, smoking, alcohol, unhealthy eating causing obesity, and unsafe sex, are highly prevalent in low income countries, even though they are traditionally associated with richer countries. Individual choices are an important part of the risky behaviors. Risking Your Health: Causes, Consequences, and Interventions to Prevent Risky Behaviors explore how those choices are formed and what are their consequences. Why do people engage in risky behaviors? Many different explanations have been proposed by psychology, sociology, economics or public health. One trait common to all these behaviors is that there is a disconnect – a function of both delay and uncertainty - between the pleasure or satisfaction provided by them and their consequences. Another characteristic of risky behaviors is that they rarely occur in isolation. Peer-pressure, parental influences, networks and social norms often play an important role in initiating, continuing, or quitting those behaviors. Even if they might often be the first to suffer, the consequences of risky behaviors are also rarely limited to the individuals engaging in them. In certain cases, such as second-hand smoking or HIV transmission, the link is direct. In other cases, the link is less direct but not necessarily less real: the long term health consequences of many of these behaviors are costly to treat and could stretch households’ finances and worsen poverty. Finally, these risky behaviors have consequences for society as a whole since they often trigger a non-trivial amount of public health expenditures and lead to declines in aggregate productivity through premature death and morbidity. Changing behaviors is tricky -- public health interventions via legislation with strong enforcement mechanisms can be more effective than simple communication campaigns informing consumers about the risks associated with certain behaviors, since translating knowledge into concrete changes in behavior seems to be hard to achieve. Economic mechanisms such as taxes (especially on alcohol and tobacco products), subsidies (such as free condoms), and conditional/unconditional cash transfers are also used to reduce risky behaviors (for example in HIV prevention). Of great interest to policy makers, academics and practitioners, this book assesses the efficiency of those interventions designed to reduce the prevalence of behaviors that endanger health.",

      "abstract": "Dr. Baker said that he would like to turn the attention of the Association to certain lines of investigation that seem to promise much if properly carried out. He did not recall instances in which, if he could carry the investigation far enough, he could not find that antecedent to conception there was a deterministic condition of the parental mind, in the form of a stress brought about by deprivation. Take, for instance, cases of sexual obsession. So many times he had found that one of the parents, or both of them, had lived a life of absolute sexual stress, of the order of deprivation. He would not go into the details, but simply spoke of the general fact to indicate a line of investigation. Take, again, parents who, during their child-bearing period, are eager for property and yet, who, to a certain extent, are deprived of the benefits of property. Such a stress of mind, or emotion, or body, if you please, seems to be the ground-field in which the child gets the predisposition to an imperative conception or obsession, which will be developed later on. He did not say it is so universally; but he did say that when he had an opportunity of carrying the investigation far enough, he could not recall an instance where he had not struck the dire influence of stress upon determining the predisposition of the child. With reference to the influence of hypnosis in the treatment of these conditions, he confessed that he was not enough of a hypnotist to bring about the result claimed. He would rather take ten times the pains to engage such people in a straightforward development of the mind, by putting them at Emerson's essays, or geometry, or some new science; by giving them a hold upon something new to work with, than to use all the hypnosis that he was capable of bringing about.",

Despite this endorsement of natural, causal regularities and constraints, many children accept that miracles are possible and that God has miraculous powers. This combination of naturalistic and supernatural thinking is well exemplified by children’s conceptualization of death. Although they increasingly see it as a natural event that terminates all mental and biological processes, they are also likely to affirm the possibility of an afterlife. Moreover, there is little indication that children see any conflict between their biological beliefs and their afterlife beliefs.

This paper reviews psychological and social elements and contemporary visibility of the more common paraphilias. Extensive references provide sources for researchers to further explore the subject. There does not appear to be an obvious physical basis for paraphilic behaviour, and origins appear to be psychological. Specific causes for fetishes and paraphilias are unclear; however, paraphilias may be related to events that occur during childhood. Many paraphilias involve dominance and submission (D and S) practices. Paraphilic behaviour has been claimed to occur predominantly in heterosexual males and less frequently in homosexual males or heterosexual females, but there does not appear to be sufficient data available to support or deny this claim. Some individuals derive enjoyment from their behaviour; however, many others feel guilt, which results in many paraphilias being practised in secret. Published statistics on the incidence of various paraphilias are virtually nonexistent, because most paraphilias are considered to be taboo subjects. Estimates are that the prevalence of participation in some form of paraphilic or fetishistic behaviour is somewhere between 5 and 30 per cent of the population. The extensive availability of mainstream paraphilic books, photographs and paraphernalia indicates that the prevalence may be higher among the general public than might be suspected.

This problem has been studied and discussed intensively by many investigators, but the evidence to date is insufficient for the conclusions to be clearcut or definitive. In general it has been our experience that criminal offenses against society are committed by individuals with poorly integrated personalities, emotional instability, conflicts with the environment and frustration; these are also found in many alcoholic addicts whose drinking is symptomatic of their inability to adjust themselves realistically to the environment and its demands on them. One factor is clear, however; alcohol, pharmacologically, acts as a depressant on the nervous system resulting in relaxation (to varying degrees and extents) of judgment and control so that underlying forces—the personality dynamics—find a more direct mode of expression. While such underlying forces may be of a passive, laissez-faire nature as well",

      "title": "Shame: The Root of Violence",
      "abstract": "Violence takes many forms, from emotional to physical, from individual to group to societal, from swift to chronic. The greater the violence the more likely it is that question asked is Why? \nThe roots of violence, in organizations and in society as a whole, are in emotion -- more specifically, shame.\n\nShame is a misunderstood emotion that has come into focus only in recent years. Some will argue that it is the lack of shame that leads to violence and that the solution lies in shaming of offenders (Braithwaite, 1989). In that sense shame, or perhaps the avoidance of shame, is seen as a deterrent. It is a means of shaping behavior in keeping with contemporary societal norms. Getting the offender to accept the shame reduces the probability of future offences.\n\nIn the view of others (see for example Scheff, 1994, Nathanson, 1992,) shame is a negative affect arising from social experience, physiological origins, or both. In this sense shame is a disruptive experience for the self and thus may trigger negative consequences for the self, others, or both. Gilligan (1996) has argued that shame is a necessary but not sufficient precondition to violence.\n\nIn an exploratory effort to look at the link between shame and violence, the words of two mass killers will be analyzed. Thomas Hamilton killed 17 at the Dunblane (Scotland) Elementary School in March of 1996, and Kipland Kip Kinkel who killed his parents then drove to Thurston High School (Springfield, Oregon) the next morning and killed two more people and wounded many others, both wrote of their situations before they killed. These documents (or fragments thereof) are examined for indications of shame. In the analysis the works of Gilligan (1996), Nathanson (1992) and Retzinger (1991) are used as a basis for examination.\n\nThe paper concludes with a discussion of the need for greater understanding of the link between shame and violence and for methods of reducing the negative effects that shame plays throughout the course of life.",

      "title": "Gender Dysphoria in Psychiatric Practice: Understanding the Clinical Ambiguity and Management",
      "abstract": "There have been several myths and misconceptions about the dichotomous understanding of sex and gender. While sex is biologically determined, gender and gender identity depend on childhood experiences, upbringing, social expectations, beliefs, family environment, and peer interactions and is socially constructed. Gender dysphoria (GD) is the extreme distress experienced by an individual because of a mismatch between their gender identity and the sex assigned at birth. GD has been an ambiguous category in psychiatry, initially termed as “gender identity disorder” till Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM-5) considered removal of the term “disorder” to reduce the stigma associated. The critical element in GD is “clinically significant distress” that differentiates it from gender nonconformity. Individuals with GD identify themselves as transgender and frequently are victims of coercive social norms, discrimination, and stigma. This leads to delay in expression of distress, psychiatric mismanagement, and high comorbidity of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, self-harm, and suicidality. Though management involves a holistic multidisciplinary approach including psychotherapy, social support, and gender-reassignment treatments (medical/surgical), there has been considerable debate and ambiguity related to the same. With this background, the article critics the understanding of GD, focuses on the WPATH SOC-7 treatment guidelines, and highlights the role of mental health professionals for better care.",

      "title": "Jealousy and Violence",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The evidence linking jealousy to violence is reviewed. The violence of jealousy is predominantly vented on the partner rather than the actual or supposed rival. Men are responsible for the majority of the killings and serious injuries resulting from jealousy, though this may reflect less a quality of male jealousy and more the qualities of male aggression. A number of the judgements constitutive of jealousy are associated with feelings and predispositions to behave which impel the jealous individual towards aggression. In morbid jealousies the risks of violence occurring appears to be increased. There is a tradition in Common Law courts of regarding jealousy either as a potentially mitigating factor or as laying a basis for both mental health defences and a defence of provocation. It should be remembered, however, that in those who resort to violence when jealous it is often not the quality of the jealousy which is critical but the individual's other characteristics such as impulsiveness, insensitivity and substance abuse. Keywords: jealousy, violence, aggression, morbid jealousy, legal defences INTRODUCTION Sexual Jealousy is part of the experience of most adults at some time in their lives, and for many it creates significant disturbance and distress. Jealousy is all too often associated with threats and violence directed at the suspected partner. This paper will address the problems created by the violence of jealousy. The contribution of jealousy to domestic violence and spousal homicide will be discussed but it is important to remember that violence usually emerges from a complex concatenation of influences in which jealousy may be prominent, but is rarely of itself sufficient. Jealousy is common and infidelity is common, but violence, though far too common, occurs in only a minority of such cases with killing as an extreme rarity. Jealousy may well be the prime motivation for an act of violence but this still leaves open why this individual, on this particular occasion, resorted to force. In considering the forensic implications of an offender's jealousy, it is not just a matter of establishing whether that jealousy is part of a mental disorder or considered morbid in it's own right, it is also a question of the relevance of such jealousy to the pleas being advanced. JEALOUSY & DOMESTIC VIOLENCE In a recent community study of jealousy 15% of both men and women reported that they had, at some time, been subjected to physical violence at the hands of a jealous partner (Mullen & Martin 1994). The role played by jealousy in both initiating domestic violence and in attempts by perpetrators to justify their violence cannot be overstated. In a study carried out in Scotland nearly half of the 109 battered women interviewed identified their partner's excessive possessiveness and sexual jealousy as the typical precipitant of violence (Dobash & Dobash 1980). Two thirds of the women at a refuge for battered women in the London area reported that their partner's excessive jealousy was the primary cause of the violence and that in many cases the partner's suspicions were entirely Without foundation (Gayford 1975, 1979). Studies from North America produced similar results with for example Hilberman and Manson (1977) reporting that extreme jealousy contributed to the violence in most of their group of 60 battered women; and Rounsaville (1978) noted similar findings with 52% of the battered women listing jealousy as the main problem and no less than 94% naming it as a frequent cause. Interesting in one of the few studies to ask men why they battered their partners, they most often nominated anger at supposed infidelity (Brisson 1983). Whitehurst (1971) reporting on 100 cases of spousal violence noted in newly every case, the husband appeared to be responding out of frustration at his inability to control the partner, and that the overt accusation was that the partner was sexually unfaithful. …",

      "abstract": "S. Freud's theory of the life and death instincts put forward the view that aggression was primary, innate, and fundamentally destructive. The couples may have other versions of internal organisation too—loving ones perhaps—but the ones that bring them to couple psychotherapy are the warring states of mind, a model of couple relationships that puts aggression in the forefront. Aggression was instantiated as a result of inevitable disappointments in the availability of the people on whom the child relied, and with whom the child needed a relationship of love and concern. D. W. Winnicott's view on aggression helps to resolve the controversy between whether humans are born with an excess of aggression, or whether it develops solely in reaction to disappointment and mistreatment. The degree to which early experiences might lead to later aggression varies. But in general, poor regulation of early aggression leads to incapacity of the growing child to regulate aggression.",

Child abuse may include non-accidental injury (NAI) but also emotional abuse, sexual abuse and neglect. It has been increasingly recognized that the dental surgeon may be the first professional to suspect physical abuse, especially in relation to injuries involving the orofacial structures.3 A child is considered to have been abused if he or she is treated in a way that is unacceptable in a given culture at a given time.4 For the purposes of this review, only physical abuse in the form of NAI and neglect will be considered. Neglect occurs when an adult knowingly allows a child to endure pain or suffering or fails to provide the basic requisites for proper maturation.",

Play helps young children clarify and articulate similarities and differences in concepts and categories. Parental expectations from birth onward provide powerful incentives, both as direct reinforcers and models, for sharply divergent gender-role behaviors. The meaning of sex differences in play becomes profound for promoting divergence in developing interpersonal skills in contrast to skillful manipulation of objects in the physical world. Some theorists suggest that cognitive growth during the early years is deeply implicated in the marked separation by sex in play groups. Girls, compared with boys, also engage in different kinds of pretend or sociodramatic role-play. Sexual play that involves dominating or assaulting another child must be firmly forbidden, discussed, and handled by adults who establish clear boundaries and keep children safe from hurt.",

      "title": "Profiling of online pedophiles",
      "abstract": "Paraphilias represent a group of disorders characterized by a pathological sexual tendency or anomaly, with the impulses including intense sexual fantasies and urges that keep returning in regard to the unusual objects, activities, circumstances, and/or certain category such as the children. Pedophilia belongs to this group of disorders and it is alternatively labeled as a pedophile disorder, which includes specific incriminated actions, which in addition to prison sentences, generally result in a social stigmatization of not only perpetrators but victims too. It is a sexual affinity disorder mostly found in adults who have expressed sexual fantasies and a tendency to enter the sexual relations with children of the same or the opposite sex. Nowadays, a \"digital space\" has become a unique environment where these specific crimes take place, and the border between the virtual and real world is practically indistinguishable. In this digital environment, pedophiles and other sexual predators have got a new space in which they establish spontaneous contacts with potential victims (often with children). In a manipulative way, they recruit vulnerable individuals with the aim of various forms of abuse and sexual exploitation. Considering the fact that it is a delicate and variable disorder, which calls for an interdisciplinary approach, profiling these persons is crucial in relation to any countermeasure. Profiling is also necessary to systematically investigate the symptoms, nature, and factors of psychopathological conditions and deviations in the existences of the affected persons. After all, it is one of the ways of reaction to make pedophilia more visible as a part of preventive programs before the late manifestation. In this paper, there are applied the methods of a quantitative and qualitative content analysis, comparative analysis (reaction to pedophilia) as well as a descriptive and analytical statistics. The purposeful goal is to recognize pedophilia as a sociopathological phenomenon that requires an adequate response from the social community.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Families transmit risk for essential hypertension (EH) via parents' genes and through learned patterns of behavior. Evidence linking anger with EH risk and the success of family-based approaches to early risk reduction create a need to understand how families might transmit heightened vulnerability to chronic anger arousal. Behavioral genetic research suggests that trait hostility, like high blood pressure, is heritable, and that social environments influence genetic expression. Yet pathways by which family environments foster chronic anger may not be the parenting behaviors emphasized in prominent theories of child development. Instead, research reviewed in this article suggests that susceptibility to frequent, prolonged anger is affected more by unshared family experiences arising out of marital discord, intra-familial alliances, and asymmetrical sibling interaction patterns. These processes influence the development of social competence, defined in terms of self-directive goals, self-evaluative standards, and social influence skills. Competence deficits foster persisting vulnerability to a syndrome of strong negative interpersonal emotions associated with heightened cardiovascular reactivity and disease risk. Early family intervention may prevent or modify these deficits.",

      "title": "Informed consent, vulnerability and the risks of group-specific attribution",
      "abstract": "People in extraordinary situations are vulnerable. As research participants, they are additionally threatened by abuse or exploitation and the possibility of harm through research. To protect people against these threats, informed consent as an instrument of self-determination has been introduced. Self-determination requires autonomous persons, who voluntarily make decisions based on their values and morals. However, in nursing research, this requirement cannot always be met. Advanced age, chronic illness, co-morbidity and frailty are reasons for dependencies. These in turn lead to limited abilities or opportunities for decision-making and self-determination. Exclusion of vulnerable people from research projects would disadvantage them by not covering their needs, which would violate the ethical principles of justice and beneficence. Commonly, vulnerability is attributed to social groups. The consequence for individuals, attributed as belonging to such a vulnerable group, is that the principles of respect for autonomy, justice and beneficence are subordinated to the principle of non-maleficence, understood as avoiding the risk to cause more harm than good. In addition, group-specific attribution could lead to stigmatizing because labelling a person as deviation from a norm violates integrity. For clinical nursing research, the question arises how the protection of vulnerable people could be granted without compromising ethical principles. The concept of relational ethics provides a possible approach. It defines vulnerability as the relation between a person’s health status and the extent to which this person is dependent on the researcher and the research context. Vulnerability is not attributed solely to a person but to a situation, meaning the person is viewed in context. By combining vulnerability as a context-related and situational concept with existing approaches of informed consent, the different ethical principles can be balanced and preserved at every step of the research process.",

      "title": "Idioms denoting derogatory attitudes toward a person in the English mass media",
      "abstract": "Idiomatic expressions do not only embody popular wisdom and timeless truths but also play a significant role in the realm of mass media. These expressions, often learned during childhood, equip speakers with the ability to effortlessly convey their thoughts in a concise and accessible manner. The use of idiomatic expressions in mass media not only contributes to linguistic economy by replacing lengthy explanations with a single phrase but also enhances the vividness and imagery of language communication. In the English mass media, idioms are frequently employed to express attitudes toward individuals in various ways. Some idioms express a derogatory attitude towards a group of people. For example, certain idioms target specific groups, portraying them in a negative light. These idioms can convey a sense of disdain, superiority, or dismissiveness towards the targeted individuals. Another way idioms denote derogatory attitudes is through the use of negative connotations associated with certain professions, beliefs, or social groups. Such idioms may suggest hidden agendas, secretive behavior, or manipulation by individuals belonging to these groups. These idioms are used to convey scepticism, criticism, or mistrust towards the targeted individuals. Idioms can also carry negative evaluations based on factors such as gender, age, race, or social status. Some idioms use derogatory language or comparisons to belittle or mock individuals based on these attributes. Invoking such idioms, speakers or writers express negative opinions or prejudices towards the targeted individuals. It is worth noting that idioms denoting negative attitudes towards males are relatively scarce compared to those targeting females. However, when negative idioms targeting males are used, they often reinforce traditional gender stereotypes and associate femininity with weakness or inferiority. These idioms perpetuate gender-based discrimination and may be considered offensive. Thus, idioms in the mass media serve as an instrument for expressing negative attitudes towards individuals or groups. They allow for concise and impactful communication, conveying disdain, scepticism, criticism, or prejudice. However, it is important to be mindful of the implications and potential harm caused by the use of such idioms, particularly those perpetuating stereotypes or discriminating against certain genders or social groups.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Sexuality is one of the basic needs in human life and its positive effects for the wellbeing are undeniable. People with dementia, despite cognition and functioning impairments, still pursue intimacy as part of their expression of basic human instincts. Objectives We aim to address the subject of sexuality among patients with dementia, emphasizing the physiological, environmental and legal barriers. Methods We conduct a non-systematic review of recent evidence on dementia and sexuality, using PubMed/Medline database. Results People with dementia face several difficulties expressing their sexuality. First, they struggle with physiological barriers to enjoyment of sexuality, such as ageism, apathy and limited free mobility. Secondly, either at home or in long-term care facilities, privacy is usually abolished. For care facilities, the Sexuality Assessment Tool supports the normalization of sexuality and self-audit policies that promote resident rights for privacy and assistance. Moreover, expression of sexuality in elderly can be misinterpreted as disinhibition, leading to unnecessary use of psychotropics to cease these behaviors. Additionally, legal barriers regarding consent arise when a partner loses the ability to consent sexual activity, questioning agreement and mutual desire. The Lichtenberg and Strzepek Decision Tree for Capacity to Participate in Intimate Relationships can be helpful to address this issue. Conclusions Sexuality in older people remains neglected in clinical intervention. Besides the urgent need to deconstruct stereotypes, families and staff must be sensitized to understand the changes in expression and perception of sexuality among people with dementia, rather than being indifferent or medicate what can be perceived as disinhibited/distorted expressions of normal needs.

      "title": "S10: Ageism in intersection: Ensuring the human rights of older persons in the face of oppressions",
      "abstract": "Summary: Ageism is defined as prejudice, discrimination, and stereotypes towards people because of their age. Ageism can be directed towards individuals of all ages and be either positive or negative. Ageism can operate at the institutional level directed via legal and social policies, at the meso level as evident in interpersonal relations and at the micro level directed by people towards their own age and aging. Ageism can be experienced either consciously with full awareness or unconsciously, without the agent of ageism and/or the target of ageism being fully aware of it. The following presentations will address ageism in relation to older persons because of its well- known detrimental effects. An important aspect of ageism concerns the fact that it does not occur in silo. Instead, it is often age in intersection with other forms of discrimination, which results in the marginalization of older persons. Perel-Levin will analyse how ageism and age-based discrimination intersect with other forms of biases, discrimination, and inequalities based, such as disability, gender, gender identity and sexual orientation, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status. The presentation by Daichman will focus on age in intersection with gender by stressing the vulnerable place of older women and relate this to elder abuse. Ayalon will highlight self- directed ageism and intergenerational conflict as they manifest in older persons’ political activism. Finally, Rabheru will discuss findings concerning ageism in Canada based on data obtained from a diverse array of stakeholders, including researchers, healthcare professionals, social service providers, older persons, and advocates. Kalache will moderate the session and conclude with applied tools to ensure the human rights of older persons in the face of institutional, interactional, and intrapersonalageism.",

Although much of the following discussion refers to hiring practices or promotions, it is still assumed that nepotism is any form of (preferential) treatment provided to one or more family members but not granted \nto others within the same organization. It is understood that this type of \n(preferential) treatment may occur within an organization among nonfamily members as well. However, the emphasis and basis for this model \nrelies heavily on kinship, a factor unique to nepotism that di¦erentiates it \nfrom other organizational practices. Kinship is expected to substantially \nin¬uence the predictors and outcomes of nepotism in a way that may not \nexist in other circumstances.",

      "title": "Supporting Transgender and Sex Reassignment Issues",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY For the care provider unfamiliar with supporting transsexual and transgender persons, as well as their partners, it becomes an imperative to be able to identify this population's unique needs, transition concerns and relationship dynamics. New challenges arise as transgender clients become more prevalent within the GLBT community and contact community clinical resources. These include distinguishing between sexual orientation and the complexities of gender identity; differentiating actual transgender issues and ordinary relationship concerns; and recognizing characteristics of strong relationships versus those doomed to fail when one or both partner's needs can no longer get met. This article reviews an abundance of stereotypes adversely affecting transgender individuals, relationships and which can taint the treatment environment. At a core level, there exists the need for care providers to recognize when having a transgender identity stops being a disorder, such as when the client is no longer gender dysphoric, and where the care provider needs to advocate the individual's right of self-determination. This includes recognizing when situational depression or anxiety and social discrimination are the actual root of ongoing individual and relationship concerns. With basic transgender knowledge, effectively supporting transgender persons and their relationships is possible for cross-specialty providers, and is recommended.",

Implica una falta de consentimiento de este, por la falta de comprension y por la etapa de desarrollo psicosocial de la victima (Kempe, 1992). El abuso sexual puede ser de distintas formas de contacto: digito-genital, oral-genital, genito-genital y las mismas variantes de contacto anal. Tambien incluye abusos sin contactos, como: exhibicionismo, “voyerismo” y la participacion cada vez mas difundida de ninos(as) en actividades pornograficas y en la prostitucion. Este fenomeno actualmente se considera como un problema de salud publica que afecta a la poblacion infantil y adolescente sin respetar edad, sexo, clase socioeconomica o distribucion geografica. La prevalencia se desconoce; probablemente es elevada, pero no se notifica. Se estima que en la poblacion general varia entre 1 y 38% de ninos(as) y adolescentes menores de 18 anos (Muram, 1989, I).",

      "abstract": "A thorough investigation on Freudian lines of the marital or sexual life of women suffering from anxiety hysteria will, however, lead to the conviction that states of anxiety, oppression, and restlessness are almost invariably to be traced back to lack of, or to incomplete, sexual satisfaction. The most frequent cause of this is premature ejaculation in the male. Only the selfishness of the male, and of physicians who are generally males, has made it possible to overlook the fact that such a state of affairs, if it becomes stabilized, must lead at least to functional disturbances. The female sex, which has subjected itself to the male viewpoint in morals as in other matters, has so completely adopted this ideal of femininity that it holds the opposite attitude to be impossible for itself, even in thought. The female sex provides a great contrast to this. All sexual excitement is methodically kept away from girls but also in fantasy.",

      "abstract": "Self-enhancement and self-protection are constrained by reality. But to what extent? Broader constraints, often considered powerful, such as East-Asian culture, religion, mind-body practices, and prison environments are not particularly effective deterrents. Narrower constraints, also considered powerful, such as self-reflection and mnemic neglect, are not very helpful either. Deliberate and systematic laboratory efforts, both at the intrapersonal level (e.g., explanatory introspection, salience of one's faults) and the interpersonal level (e.g., accountability, relationship closeness), can boast success in constraining self-enhancement and self-protection strivings, but the success is mixed, difficult to implement, and probably short-lived. The doggedness (potency and prevalence) of self-enhancement and self-protection are due to the functions or social benefits with which they are associated or confer: psychological health, goal pursuit and attainment, leadership election, and sexual selection. These functions are traceable to our species' evolutionary past.",

      "title": "SEXTING, NON-CONSENSUAL IMAGE SHARING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH",
      "abstract": "Background and Aims: Sexting refers to the exchange (sending and/or receiving) of self-taken sexual photographs, usually depicting the sender nude or semi-nude, via mobile phone. Academic and media narratives tend to portray sexting as a deviant behaviour due to the perceived risks of non-consensual image distribution (where individuals’ sexual images are shared without permission): Qualitative research suggests the psychological harms of revenge pornography (one type of non-consensual image distribution) are comparable to the effects of sexual assault and are gendered in nature; considered part of a continuum of sexual violence against women. There is a lack of quantitative research regarding adult sexting and non-consensual image sharing. Studies to date have conflated consensual and non-consensual sexting behaviours and have poor methodological design in terms of the operational definitions used. Researchers investigating sexters’ psychological health have thus far neglected to consider individual factors (e.g. coping, resilience and sexting attitudes), interpersonal aspects (e.g. relationship context and privacy expectations) and image characteristics. Existing research is biased by the measures used (i.e. primary focus on psychological distress) and there has been limited opportunity to demonstrate positive sexting associations (e.g. relational wellbeing). We therefore sought to develop a more nuanced understanding of sexters’ psychological health and wellbeing by addressing the following questions:\r\nHow common are non-consensual image sharing experiences amongst a UK community (non-clinical) sample of adult sexters?\r\nAre there any differences in the psychological health and wellbeing of non-sexters and sexters (including those who have experienced non-consensual image sharing)?\r\nAre any sexting specific factors, such as privacy expectations, image characteristics and relationship with recipients, associated with psychological health?\r\nAre there any differences in psychological health and wellbeing between consensual sexters’, those who have experienced non-consensual sexting, and non-sexters’ when coping, resilience and sexting specific factors are accounted for?\r\nMethod: We utilised a quantitative, cross-sectional online survey design. Participants from a non-clinical adult population (N = 270) were recruited via social media. The\r\nsurvey consisted of a sexting questionnaire identifying type of sexting behaviours, relationship context, privacy beliefs and sexting attitudes; as well as non-consensual image sharing behaviours and experiences. Psychological measures used included: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress scales (DASS-21), the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing scale (WEMWBS), the Impact of Event Scale (IES-6), the Brief COPE and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS).\r\nResults: 87% of the sample had engaged in sexting as an adult, primarily within committed relationships in order to maintain sexual intimacy. 14% of sexters had experienced the non-consensual distribution of their images and 16% had distributed others’ images without permission. Males and females did not differ significantly in who experienced non-consensual image distribution. Images were most often shared by someone the person was dating, typically with friends and family, although images were shared online in 43% of cases. Privacy expectations and sexting attitudes were not related to psychological health or wellbeing. When coping and resilience were accounted for, experiencing non-consensual image distribution was not related to psychological distress but individuals who were uncertain if their images had been shared had lower wellbeing, and consensual sexters who sent sexts to multiple partners had higher anxiety.\r\nConclusion: Our research suggests that the problematic coping strategies individuals employ, and their level of resilience have a stronger relationship with psychological health than do their sexting behaviours; although further quantitative research with clear consistent definitions of sexting and non-consensual image sharing is needed to identify if these findings are replicable. Clinical interventions for those who are distressed by non-consensual image distribution should focus on identifying and reducing the use of problematic coping strategies such as avoidance, denial and self-blame. Sexting may be considered a normative part of intimate relationships: Educational strategies should fully explore issues of consent and perceived gender stereotypes; as opposed to encouraging individuals to abstain from sexting as a deviant or risky behaviour (which could contribute to self-blame and victim blaming). Future research should focus on understanding specific motivations for and types of non-consensual image distribution (e.g. revenge pornography) and whether it is associated with more harmful aspects of relationships such as interpersonal violence.",

      "abstract": "The concept of sexual harassment, in its modern understanding, is a relatively new one, dating from the 1970s onwards; although other related concepts have existed prior to this in many cultures. “Sexual Harassment” means behavior, including physical contact, advances, and comments in person, through an intermediary, and/or via phone, text message, email, social media, or other electronic medium, that is unwelcome; based on sex or gender stereotypes; and is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with a person's academic performance, employment or equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from college or University programs or activities or by creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working or educational environment. Students at academic institutions often sexually harass others by calling them “fag, ” “homo, ” “Hey, babe, ” “Hot stuff, ” or “Big stud” or other degrading terms that refer to sexual orientation. Additional types of sexual harassment include students starting or spreading sexual rumors, writing sexual graffiti on bathroom walls, sending crude e-mails or letters, and displaying sexual drawings or pornography. A person in a position of power may request sexual favors in return for a starting position on a college team, a higher grade, or access to a popular club or peer group. Individuals who experience sexual harassment feel fearful, intimidated, manipulated, and overpowered.",

Significantly less research has focused on what transpires in the relationship in the longer-term after the infidelity, and after the faithful partner fully realizes what has occurred. The research that does exist tends to pertain to sex differences in reactions, with men being far less optimistic about the future of their existing relationships. Others have examined the effect of the type of infidelity on relationship termination. This chapter focuses on how couples decide, and the methods they use, to continue relationships and rekindle love after infidelity has occurred.",

They stay in the position of an almost asexual child, in families close to the primitive horde, where violence, hatred, and passion reign. The places of each are not identified and alignment with the symbolic order cannot succeed. The author approaches this question in reference to two clinical cases, and with a main “father-son” dialectic, postulating that filial transmission can take place only if a father has been able to take his own son’s place beforehand. Without this, he cannot transmit to his children their place of sons, or daughters, and parenting issues are unbearable to him. Clinical situations highlight the difficulties of filling such places when the paternal function is not held by the parents and when the limits are surpassed. The issues faced translate into a confusion of generations in which physical and sexual violence co-exist, or an outright rejection of an imperfect son by his father. It all boils down to a choice between an expectation of an ideal and an imperfect life that is disavowed because it would signify a lack.",

      "abstract": "Definitions Fears and phobias represent a major segment of the psychological distress experienced by children while growing up. It is important to distinguish between the two. Fears are a normal part of life and usually are most vivid and ubiquitous during childhood. Fear is the emotional and physiologic response to an external danger. At their best, fears help keep one safe. The fear of being burned, being accosted by strangers, disappointing parents by doing poorly on an examination, or ending up in jail all can lead to a more healthy and productive life. One could speculate that heights and snakes are among the most common fears among adults because those ancestors who avoided snakes and high places were most likely to live long enough to ensconce these tendencies in the gene pool. The differential diagnosis of fears and phobias is easier during adulthood than it is during childhood. This is because the child's physical and cognitive immaturity can confound reality testing on developmental and psychopathologic bases. The toddler who is so small, helpless, and unable to understand the forces of physical and human nature accurately often has many normal fears. These typically may include strangers, their parents' leaving, monsters, the dark, or going to sleep.",

There is nothing to match the early psychology experiments where subjects were often swayed by the behaviour of others to an extraordinary degree, but there is plenty of evidence of conformism. This seems built-in to our sociality either because we have preferences for conversation or status which are activated by the knowledge of what others do, or because other people face relevantly similar decisions to our own and so that their behaviour signals something useful to us about the uncertain world. These social influences can cause mischief. The more worrying cases, however, are those where individual preferences themselves change through interaction with others: the strongest experimental evidence for this is with respect to individual social preferences.",

Claimants are supposedly not motivated by a credible or even sincere belief that unfair or unequal treatment has occurred, but simply seek to illicitly gain public sympathy or private reward. Characterizing discrimination claims as systematically made in bad faith enables them to be screened and dismissed prior to engaging with them on their merits. This retort preserves the dominant group's self-image as unprejudiced and innocent without having to risk critical analysis of the claim's substance.",

      "title": "Suicide as social logic.",
      "abstract": "Although suicide is not viewed as a mental disorder per se, it is viewed by many if not most clinicians, researchers, and lay people as a real or natural symptom of depression. It is at least most typically seen as the unfortunate, severe, yet logical end result of a chain of negative self-appraisals, negative events, and hopelessness. Extending an approach articulated by the early French sociologist Gabriel Tarde, in this paper I argue that suicide is merely an idea, albeit a very bad one, having more in common with societal beliefs and norms regarding such things as divorce, abortion, sex, politics, consumer behavior, and fashion. I make a sharp contrast between perturbation and lethality, concepts central to Edwin S. Shneidman's theory of suicide. Evidence supportive of suicide as an idea is discussed based on what we are learning from the study of history and culture, and about contagion/cluster phenomena, media/communication, and choice of method. It is suggested that certain individuals are more vulnerable to incorporate the idea and act of suicide into their concepts of self, based on the same principles by which ideas are spread throughout society. Just as suicide impacts on society, so does society impact on suicide.",

This chapter undertakes an anthropological analysis of affective life or sensibilité to better understand the experiences of infertile women in Niger. In this way, the chapter psychologizes anthropology and anthropologizes psychology. Through interviews conducted in Niamey, it is found that when a couple is unable to produce a child, the wife is alienated by her husband and husband’s family, which brings about overwhelming feelings of loneliness. Some interviewees report having to hear insults on a regular basis from their relatives within their own home, making them question their own self-worth. Women stigmatized for being childless feel a deep sense of shame and guilt for not being able to fulfill their social duty. At the same time, they can feel hopeful for a miracle. The extensive marginalization of women without children and the constant gaze of and judgment by others are internalized, incurring psychological distress that deserves greater attention.",

Evil actions are defined as repeated or persistent, commensurate with provocation and causing extreme harm, at times due to repetition. Evil develops or evolves. Evil usually has a more enduring quality. Evil usually begins when profoundly important needs of human beings are not fulfilled, either in the course of growing up or later in life, and especially when early frustration of basic needs is combined with later frustration. The devaluation of certain groups and their members often becomes part of a culture. Devaluation can vary in form and intensity. A society may become evil, in the sense that its characteristics make intensely harmful actions probable. Often, groups develop cultures and social institutions that are not themselves evil, but they create the preconditions or enhance the potential for the generation and speedy evolution of evil.",

This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm's way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control--the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-specific changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.",

      "abstract": "Despite numbers of publications and effort to try to establish the definition, the classification, the epidemiology, the clinical aspects and the psychopathology of serial killers, a universal consensus seems to say the least. Crime, though reduced in some countries, appears to impact more and more consistent worldwide, generating controversial ideas and a multitude of possible explanations. The serial killer usually presents as a caucasian man, aged between 20 and 40 years, often embedded socially and in his family, but with serious psychiatric, personal and especially family history. Usually acting alone, the serial killer plans a crime well in advance, but sometimes within the scope of impulsivity for a minority, the victim not being previously selected. In the latter case, an actual mental illness like psychosis is found. It is clear from numerous psychopathological studies conducted so far that most serial killers are defined as psychopathic sexual sadists, whose childhood was difficult, if not flouted, punctuated by physical and psychological violence situations. In addition, pervasive fantasies combined with thoughts of death, sex and violence are as much in common with the original acts of which they are the instigators. Beyond a relentless media that is constantly watering the public with stories and pictures depicting them as such, serial killers remain an enigma. We can therefore attempt to answer the various questions raised by this phenomenon, the way these people operate and how we can curb the rise, thanks to the neurobiological and neurophysiological approaches that science offers us.",

      "abstract": "Since elderly people have their own attachment to vehicle operation, being involved naturally in their way of life, it is not easy for us to take a businesslike attitude like As your are old..., or It is the commonsense thing to.... Rather, some other data suggest that not few of them are convinced that themselves are the exceptions of rare isolated case. A conclusive factor of giving up driving may be out of their own judgement in an overwhelming majority; and yet it seems that the consciousness of declined eyesight could be a finishing blow whether they admit it or not. Although the advice of a doctor or a family member, or the result of a driving aptitude test may be considered a good means of becoming aware of one's limit of ability, it is more recommendable to resort to a counseling method such as let him experience the awakening of his present self approach, before attempting to persuade them straightforwardly or enumerating fragments of plausible explanation. Furthermore, some consider leaving everything until one will encounter an accident or become frightened/startled would be an effective approach. However, the thought itself is dangerous because a slight misstep will have a serious effect, this is matter of life and death. From now on, it is necessary to promote spread of driving aptitude tests. At the same time, a reasonable amount of consideration and thoughtfulness will be required on the part of examiners with regard to the manner and attitudes when conducting tests, as well as the method itself.

      "abstract": "Background: Men’s experience of depression has not been as well understood as women’s experience of depression. Men are more likely to suffer in silence. It appears that what men “feel” is likely to be kept in for longer while women act upon their symptoms more readily as the symptoms arise. Purpose: To present the current research findings on depression and gender, with a focus on the factors that account for gender differences in rates of depression among women and men, and emphasis on the relationship between the male gender role and men’s experience of depression and coping with the symptoms. Method and Material: A critical review of this body of literature was carried out. Evidence was collected through Medline database. Results: Although depression is often traditionally thought of as a woman’s illness, there is growing evidence to suggest that men may not be adequately counted in studies examining rates of depression, that men are equally vulnerable to depression, and that depression in men is a serious and, if untreated, potentially fatal condition. This phenomenon is better supported by several explanations, namely, the gender bias explanation, and the gender role socialisation explanation. Conclusions: Depression predicted as the second leading cause of global disability burden by 2020 may well be underestimated if the direct and indirect effects of depression in men are not taken into account. Understanding depression in both men and women and help-seeking behaviours across genders is important because there are implications of the findings in the context of primary care in order to detect and cope with depressive symptoms in men.",

I start out by defending the necessity for privacy because many physicians ignore this rule. Although some patients do not require strict privacy, you do not know in advance when privacy may make a crucial difference (Petronio, 2002). First of all, the clinical history, by its very design, discloses the most personal and intimate details of the patient’s life. Compile all of the medical questions that you would not want to answer with your spouse, parent, or child present: “Are you sexually active and have you ever had a venereal disease?” or “How much alcohol do you drink?” or “Do you use street drugs?” Suppose the husband did not father the child brought in by a couple for examination but does not know this fact.

      "abstract": "Learning penetrates religion in many ways. Primary religious socialisation – sometimes referred to as religious nurture – is the process by which children are explicitly and purposefully taught to do things religiously or they learn implicitly by following what their families and other people around them do, speak and feel. In secondary religious socialisation one sets about learning something additional to or different from what was learned and internalised in one’s religious or non-religious childhood home and surroundings. Secondary socialisation may also entail processes of unlearning something previously learned in order to grasp and master the skills, ways of thinking and feeling, and discursive habits of the new worldview and context of life. Learning in both primary and secondary socialisation can in some cases turn into a thoroughly religiously informed way of life. Alternatively, religious learning may not always be sufficiently lengthy and committed to result in full socialisation. Many people engage in religion merely in special situations or turning points in life, and after that particular need is over, religion loses its acute significance. Furthermore, religious learning may also have intended or unintended effects and consequences beyond the more strictly bounded religious sphere and may come to be reflected in personal and relational life much more widely.

      "title": "Hypocritical blame is associated with reduced prosocial motivation",
      "abstract": "Abstract People often act hypocritically. One form of hypocrisy occurs when people blame others for transgressing moral principles they themselves have violated in the past. However, the psychological processes linked to this hypocritical blame are largely unknown. One possibility is that hypocritical blame is associated with the costs of being prosocial, such that a person could intend to help but is unwilling to put in the effort. Here, we test whether a measure of hypocritical blame that quantifies the discrepancy between willingness to profit from another’s harm, and blaming somebody else for similarly profiting, is related to the motivation to choose and then exert physical effort to benefit themselves or a stranger. Results revealed that hypocritical blame is associated with reduced prosocial motivation specifically, and not with how willing people are to exert effort for their own benefit. This effect was found in both a reduced willingness to choose to be prosocial and for energising prosocial acts. This suggests that the discrepancy between moral standards and actions is related to the willingness to overcome the costs of being prosocial, with some people being simply unwilling to exert the effort required to live up to their moral principles.",

      "title": "Discrimination and the Role of the Clinician",
      "abstract": "Recognizing and confronting discrimination is essential to eliminating health disparities. Healthy People 2030 highlights discrimination when addressing social determinants of health.1 In this issue of Pediatrics, Lei et al2 contribute to the growing literature that discrimination adversely impacts mental health in young adults. The authors investigated the effect of discrimination (racism, sexism, ageism, physical appearance, other) over time on mental health, substance use, and well-being. Data analysis using the Transition to Adulthood Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics revealed that increased discrimination frequency was associated with higher levels of mental illness diagnosis, psychological distress, substance use, and languishing for up to 6 years after initial exposure.2 Clinicians should know 3 aspects vital to combating discrimination in health care: the impact of interpersonal discrimination, the role of implicit bias in perpetuating disparities, and decolonizing medical education and training.First, interpersonal discrimination (sometimes called individual discrimination) refers to conscious or unconscious acts of prejudice committed by a member of a dominant or privileged group toward a member(s) of a marginalized group. Acts of interpersonal discrimination (ie, microaggressions) can manifest as lack of respect toward a person as well as marginalizing, undervaluing, and scapegoating a person. Experiences with acts of interpersonal discrimination have been found to contribute to poor mental health and physical health outcomes in children, adolescents, young adults, and adults. Within the health care setting, this can include making disparaging comments to a patient or colleague about their weight, accented speech, name, or religious affiliation.3–6 Acts of interpersonal discrimination in health care also include failing to provide translation services for patients who are fluent in languages other than spoken English; making assumptions about a patient's intelligence on the basis of their economic status, educational level, or geographic origin; or refusing to see patients who are members of sexual or gender minority groups.7–9Secondly, acknowledging, mitigating, and eliminating the impact of implicit biases within the health care system is critical. Evidence suggests that clinicians endorse negative implicit biases toward race, sex, weight, age, and mental illness that are similar to those in the general population.10 Studies have found that clinicians' negative implicit biases influence how they communicate with their patients, influence the treatments they recommend, and influence patient satisfaction ratings.11 The Joint Commission report on implicit bias in health care suggested useful strategies for addressing implicit bias, including perspective-taking (the cognitive aspect of compassion that can reduce bias and deter unconscious stereotypes and prejudices), emotional self-regulation (experiencing positive emotions during patient encounters to build rapport, trust, and connection), and partnership building (working collaboratively with patients toward a common goal).12Lastly, we must address bias and discrimination in trainee curricula and continuing medical education. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) included in the Common Program Requirements that a trainee must demonstrate competence in \"respect and responsiveness to diverse patient populations, including but not limited to diversity in gender, age, culture, race, religion, disabilities, national origin, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.\"13 ACGME has 6 core educational competencies, but none specifically address bias, discrimination, and inequity. To fill this training gap, a new ACGME competency has been proposed: Structural Competency, Health Equity, and Social Responsibility.14 This includes 3 subthemes that address knowledge, skills, and attitudes: structural competency (eg, understand implicit and/or explicit race and/or gender bias and its effects on health outcomes, health inequities, and patient care), structural action (eg, incorporate direct interventions on patients' social and structural determinants of health into all physician functions), and structural responsibility (eg, examine the ethics of patient care decisions, with a focus on structural vulnerability and reducing the inequities faced by historically marginalized and oppressed populations).14 The American Board of Pediatrics has an updated entrustable professional activity for general pediatrics, number 14, entitled \"Use Population Health Strategies and Quality Improvement Methods to Promote Health and Address Racism, Discrimination, and Other Contributors to Inequities Among Pediatric Populations\" to address racism, other social determinants of health, clinician bias, and health inequities.15 This entrustable professional activity is focused on the following: clinician personal responsibility to their community and society, identifying populations at risk for poor health outcomes, cooperating with diverse stakeholders on creating and implementing initiatives to improve health outcomes, analyzing data from various resources for quality improvement and/or population health initiatives, and undoing the systems and processes that are rooted in discrimination that have led to health care inequities.15 To mitigate the influence of implicit biases on clinical decision-making, researchers from the Royal College of Physicians have suggested a checklist for determining if clinicians' biases influence clinical decision-making.16 This checklist includes items that analyze how one reached a diagnosis and whether stereotypes were used.16Interpersonal discrimination contributes to poor physical and mental health outcomes for children, adolescents, and adults. Clinician biases and discriminatory actions in practice and/or in training against patients based on their demographic characteristics can lead to serious health consequences. Clinicians play a central role in recognizing and addressing interpersonal discrimination in health care settings and during patient encounters. Institutions have a responsibility of addressing interpersonal discrimination within the work environment and with patient care activities. Committing to reducing and eliminating interpersonal discrimination in health care will promote a healthier society.",

The gender drive has long been ignored by translators, who have unduly assimilated the sexual drive, whereas the gender drive precedes the latter in the construction of the body of the child and in his/her quest for identity. The power drive that the child then engages in can lead him/her to seek out jouissance—albeit in the form of assuming power over the other—before being able to define and accept him/herself as a being separated from the mother, an autonomous being in the elaboration of his/her own body.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Is it possible for a person's face to appear differently to observers depending on the perceived personality of that person? Subjects read about a sexual assault in which a male or female witness either smiled and watched the rape, or called for help and scared off the attacker. Those who read about the harmful witness rated him or her as consistently more hostile, socially deviant, dominant, sadistic, and more likely to take risks than the helpful witness, and as having less empathy and nurturance. The subjects then received a composite photograph of the witness and were asked to make several global and specific facial feature ratings. Those who previously perceived the male or female witness as having negative personality traits, also rated him or her as having a more thin, narrow, and pale face, a more narrow and square chin, with a long nose and thin lips, compared to the witness who was judged in more positive terms. We discuss these results in terms of the validity of eyewitness testimony.",

It has potential for damaging the mental health of the victim and intergenerational cycles of this behaviour pattern may develop. The paediatrician is in a position to detect children at risk and may be able to intervene. Three types of sexual abuse are described (i) single sexual attacks which may be accompanied by physical violence: (ii) sexual exploitation of children for financial gain, and (iii) longstanding sexual relationships, generally between girls and father figures; these are far the most common. Although it is hard to separate the effects of premature sexual experience from other adverse environmental influences. the child victim of longstanding sexual abuse emerges immature, with considerable confusion as to her role in the family, and with constricted personality development. Her primary motivation is attention seeking, and she adopts sexual activity with an adult as a means of survival in often deplorable conditions. The sensitivity of management following the assault being made public is an important factor in determining eventual adjustment.",

Like a large number of social beliefs, attitudes towards equality take their direction from beliefs about the self, the status of the self, and one's self-esteem or lack thereof. Equality must be treated within classes, not between them, to be meaningful—and in this way the problem of placing oneself becomes tolerable, or sometimes rather gratifying. The psychic defenses against subordination available in stressing moral equality or superiority were used—but only rarely. Equality would pose problems of social adjustments, of manners, of how to behave. Consider the possibility of social equality including genuine fraternization, without economic equality. The fears, while plausible and all too human on the face of it, emerged unexpectedly from the interview material designed to capture ideas and emotions on other aspects of class status.",

      "abstract": "The child abuse in its various forms, physical, sexual and psychological violence, is a complex phenomenon, potentially able to alter not only the natural development of the subject abused, but also his ability to relate to others. This paper aims to point out the way that the child has to take from the moment he decided to take over being a victim of abuse at the time when it is called to testify about the abuse right away, with all the difficulties that this witness implies, not only for the child himself, but also for those who are called upon to decide and rule on the quality of that testimony. The art. 196 of the current Code of Criminal Procedure recognizes everyone the ability to testify, then, including minors. Nothing therefore prevents the operators from taking information from a child in criminal trials. Moreover, investigators have wide discretion not only \"if\" hearing the minor, but also on the methods to do it. This entails serious risks on the authenticity of the evidential result: mnestic lability, suggestibility, tendency to pander to the interlocutor's expectations, all of which are typical factors of the minor that can compromise the correct reconstruction of the facts.",

      "title": "\"Ich bin stolz auf dich.\" Über die Bedeutung und die bedingenden Faktoren von Stellvertreterstolz",
      "abstract": "AbstractResearch generally agrees that pride is the result of a positive self-evaluation concerning a specific behavior or achievement. The behavior or achievement needs to be internally attributed, relevant for the own self-concept and congruent with goals in order to lead to pride. Being proud of someone else hardly seems to fulfill these prerequisites, yet it is common linguistic use to express pride of one’s child, spouse, friend or even a famous person. This emotion is commonly referred to as vicarious pride which implies that it might be a shared emotion instead of one’s own pride.So what is vicarious pride exactly? Is it indeed a vicarious experience of pride or do other mechanisms play their parts? This study aims to explore in which situations people experience vicarious pride and which factors contribute to this emotion.Using a 2x2 between-subjects design, main effects for both relationship to the other person and involvement in their achievement were found. Furthermore sympathetic emotions appear to play a key role in experiencing vicarious pride. This study provides interesting first insights into vicarious pride and indicates a direction for further research.ZusammenfassungBisherige Forschung ist sich einig, dass Stolz das Ergebnis einer positiven Evaluation einer eigenen Leistung oder eines eigenen Erfolges ist. Diese Leistung oder Erfolg muss dafür internal attribuiert werden, relevant für das Selbstkonzept und kongruent mit eigenen Zielen sein, um Stolz hervorzurufen. Es ist nicht erkennbar, wie dies erfüllt sein kann, wenn man auf eine andere Person stolz ist. Dennoch ist es im deutschen Sprachgebrauch üblich zu sagen, dass man auf sein Kind, seinen Partner oder Partnerin, oder sogar auf eine berühmte Person stolz ist. Diese Empfindung wird als Stellvertreterstolz bezeichnet, was impliziert, dass es sich um eine geteilte Emotion handelt.Doch was genau ist Stellvertreterstolz? Ist es tatsächlich eine stellvertretene Empfindung von Stolz oder spielen hier andere Mechanismen mit hinein? Diese Studie hat zum Ziel, zu untersuchen, in welchen Situationen Stellvertreterstolz erlebt wird und welche Faktorenzu dieser Empfindung beitragen.Mithilfe eines 2x2 between-subjects Designs wurden Haupteffekte sowohl für die Nähe zur anderen Person als auch für einen eigenen Beitrag zu ihrem Erfolg gefunden. Zusätzlich scheint Anteilnahme eine Schlüsselrolle im Empfinden von Stellvertreterstolz zu spielen.Diese Studie verschafft einen interessanten ersten Einblick in Stellvertreterstolz und bietet Anhaltspunkte für zukünftige Forschung.",

      "abstract": "Attention seeking acts as a barrier from experiencing inner happiness. Happiness is about more than simply the experience of a positive mood. Happiness is a subjective experience and there is no common factor which gives happiness to all. The search for happiness is unique for each and every individual and it is explained by each individual in their own frame of reference. People who are high in attention seeking find happiness only by capturing the attention of others. Most of the human beings strive for attention and recognition of others in one or another occasion. Enjoying the attention of others is socially acceptable in some situations. But the problem arises when the attention seeking tendency crosses the threshold. The extremity of attention seeking leads to complications in life. If the behaviours elicited by the attention seekers fail to grab the attention of others, it makes them feel frustrated. And it also makes them to engage in behaviours which can be both positive and negative, whether it is liked by them or not which in turn again fails to make them feeling happy if it again fails to meet the criteria of attention seekers. So for high attention seekers, they have to depend on others for their happiness which lacks in turn is dubious for experiencing happy. So high attention seekers are restricted to happiness what the average individuals enjoy in their life. This paper is an attempt to study how the trait of attention seekers limited themselves to the particular factor for experiencing happiness. Key words: Attention seeking, Behaviour, Happiness, Contentment, Frustration.",

      "title": "Professionals’ Understanding of Risk Factors for Substance Misuse by Young People and Approaches to Intervention",
      "abstract": "Issues and trends in relation to substance misuse normally develop in the transitional phase of adolescence, as young people begin looking towards their peers for direction and are less subject to parental authority. Risk factors are predictors of the likelihood that an individual or group will be involved in activity leading to adverse consequences. Research indicates that some young people are beginning to initiate alcohol and drug use earlier than many adults suspect. In relation to substance misuse it is observed that risk and protection factors exist in equal measure within different context including within the individual, family, peer group, school and community settings. The enhancement of decision making by young people could delay or inhibit their engagement in harmful activity including substance misuse. If young people experiences substance use as enjoyable and without any negative consequences then it is likely they will not perceive risks relating to such use. Parental disapproval of substance misuse is a strong predictor of delayed initiation, whereas family instability and parental or sibling substance misuse, are identified as significant risk factors placing young people at greater danger of developing lifetime trajectories involving substance misuse. Assessment is central to the identification of needs and forms the basis for the establishment of integrated care plans framed within the context of multi-disciplinary and inter-agency collaboration. Governments and other organisations are required to play an active role in supporting the well-being of individuals, families and communities. As such, the practice of including children within adult categories when referring to “normal” alcohol consumption levels needs to be re-evaluated. Parents‟ and other adults require information about the risks and harmful effects of early onset substance misuse in order to make informed choices and to be empowered in taking a stance in relation to teenage substance misuse",

      "abstract": "In this case report, we represent a male anorexia nervosa case and discuss its psychodynamics in the frame of psychoanalytic theories. Males account for %5-15 of all eating disorders. History of a criticism or a teasing for fatness by relatives or friends is very common in males before the onset of the illness. Males who are in occupations or athletic pursuits that emphasize body weight, or who work in potential high-risk jobs, and who are homosexual are at increased risk for eating disorders. Potential high risk jobs include appearance-based jobs, jobs traditionally held by women and food related jobs. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, mainly depression and anxiety disorders, and especially for bulimic males, substance-related disorders and cluster B personality traits with marked impulsivity are common. When family dynamics are considered, a father who is psychologically distant from his son, and an \"over-protective, over-involved and over-dependent\" mother have been described. Separation difficulties and lack of boundaries within covertly conflictual relationships have been noted in a number of clinical reports. The only difference in clinical presentation between males and females is; males rarely use medicine in order to lose weight and weight changes throughout the illness are more common in males. In this case report, a male anorexia nervosa case's psychodynamics are discussed under the influence of his psychiatric illness and his childhood history.",

The major factor motivating the sexual behaviour of these women was the overwhelming importance to them of maintaining the dependent relationship upon a male with a total and blind acquiescence to his wishes. Of lesser importance were acting out against parents, a strong sexual drive, the need to prove oneself a woman and a desire, conscious or unconscious, to have a baby. Much guilt was aroused by the use of or insistence on birth control measures; these implied responsibility for sexual activity, the use of such measures was precluded. Contrary to other reports, nausea, vomiting and obstetrical complications occurred with the same frequency as in married women. The course of the pregnancy did not appear to be affected in any way. It was concluded that a weak ego structure was more basic to their behaviour than the unconscious drive to have a baby, or the acting out of unconscious fantasies which often have been assumed in the previous literature. The results suggest that the mild nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is of physiological rather than psychological origin, and that the course of pregnancy is not as readily affected by unhealthy motivation for having the baby as has often been assumed.",

      "title": "Editorial: Controlling ourselves: insights into the development of psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Controlling yourself is far more easily said than done. It takes years of experience and biological maturation to even acquire the basic skills to get it right, and there is no simple formula for getting from infancy to adulthood with good self-regulation skills in place. It is a very complex business, involving opportunities and pitfalls along the way. Yet the establishment of self-regulation is arguably one of the most dramatic markers of healthy development. From early in life, the brain develops in tandem with changing social influences, resulting in typical and healthy cognitive, sensory-motor and social-emotional functioning. Yet the presence of a host of biological and environmental risks sometimes disrupts this developmental course. These disruptions are in part responsible for the emergence of a wide range of symptoms arising from mental and behavioral disorders. Although adolescents and especially children (when compared to adults) are still developing their self-regulation skills, they are much like adults in the extent of individual differences in their underlying self-regulatory capacities. Similarly, different disorders show distinct patterns of self-regulatory deficits or adaptations. This variation is expressed at many levels, from neural activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems, to modulation of visual attention, to control of cognitive or emotional events, to broad and easily observed behaviors. Understanding these variations - within and between the different levels of brain, cognitive, emotional and behavioral activity - will yield important insights into the nature and consequences of psychopathology, and provide better roadmaps to new interventions and improvements in existing treatments (Posner & Rothbart, 2007). In their annotation, Banaschewski and Brandeis provide many examples of research that is providing new methods for studying the development of childhood disorders. Their review emphasizes the strengths and limitations of using measures of electrophysiology to test for individual and disorder-group differences in brain activation patterns that reflect the real-time processing of information and the control and regulation of those processes. This methodology and field of research is maturing rapidly, and promises to yield powerful information regarding etiology of disorders and effects of intervention, especially when coupled with traditional behavioral assessments of symptoms. Investigation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) reactivity – our body's first response to danger or stress - opens another window into the developing self-regulatory capacity of children and adolescents and its role in psychopathology. Using skin conductance reactivity as a measure of SNS functionality, Cummings and colleagues found that the effects of paternal and maternal depressive symptoms on children's developing behavioral and emotional problems were dependent on the degree of children's SNS reactivity, with highly reactive children showing the strongest effects. Accordingly, practitioners should be aware of risks to healthy self-regulation arising from fathers’ as well as mothers’ depressive symptoms. Moreover, some children may be more vulnerable than others, depending on their stable physiological responses – and poor regulation of those responses – to stressors and particular family contexts (e.g. paternal depression). These findings point to the importance of considering children's reactivity to stress as well as the broader family environment in determining directions for assessment, diagnosis and treatment. Moving from the analysis of SNS functioning to behavioral measures of cognitive control, Hardin and colleagues examined the role of incentives (money in this case) in influencing adolescents’ and adults’ performance in a visual attention task. They compared the youth and adults, as well as sub-groups of youth with anxiety or depression, and found evidence of developmental and diagnostic group differences in the degree of cognitive control and sensitivity to reward, as they related to improvements in performance. Anxious and depressed adolescents showed impaired regulation of eye movements during the task, as well as a dampened response to incentives, compared to the healthy adolescents and adults. If replicated, these results have important implications for the way in which clinicians utilize and evaluate the use of incentives for improving treatment outcomes with mood and anxiety disordered youth - particularly in light of the predominance of cognitive-based therapies for these disorders. Another example of dysfunctional self-regulation can be seen in the comorbidity of ADHD and reading disability. The paper by Bental and Tirosh highlights the need to measure attention and executive functions in youth who show evidence of reading disorder, as well as the assessment of working memory and information processing speed (i.e. rapid naming of objects or numbers) when considering ADHD symptomatology. Their study of Hebrew-speaking children and young adolescents revealed that the co-diagnosis of reading disorder and ADHD is predicted by the combination of slow processing speed and poor working memory, and also points to the importance of attention regulation to reading performance and efficiency. A similar lesson can be learned by reading Reiersen and colleagues’ paper on the connections between ADHD diagnosis and autistic symptoms in childhood and adolescence. The presentation of autistic symptoms in some children with ADHD previously has been noted by clinicians, but as these researchers emphasize in their paper most diagnostic taxonomies (including DSM-IV) do not permit co-diagnosis of ADHD and pervasive developmental disorder. Reiersen and colleagues have confirmed the presence of severe autistic behaviors in many children with ADHD in a twin sample derived from population-wide birth records. Clinically significant levels of autistic traits were most common among youth with a combined type ADHD diagnosis. These findings reinforce the importance of assessing and treating severe disruptions in social responsiveness and related social impairments in children with ADHD. So what do clinicians and other practitioners gain by adding to their ‘‘toolbox’’ a bio-behavioral framework, when considering the role of dysfunctional self-regulation in the development of disorders? As is evident in these papers, there is some potential in the underlying theories and methodologies used in this work for determining brain-behavior mechanisms - and doing so with much greater precision than has been allowed in the past. For example, clinicians want to know whether the treatments they are utilizing result in meaningful and lasting improvements in functioning. But within any group of youth (for any disorder in question), there is almost always a wide range in response to treatment and long-term progress following intervention. With more proximal and precise measures of the underlying brain mechanisms involved in self-regulation of cognitions, emotions and behavior – as well as a more thorough understanding of how these bio-mechanisms transact with the social environment – change in these bio-social processes can be studied. My prediction is that in the not too distant future, we will be able to use these tools to measure change in regulation and symptoms at multiple levels of analysis (e.g. brain activation, working memory, observed behavior), and also will be equipped with a precision of measurement and specificity of theory that will allow us to designate sub-groups of individuals who are most or least likely to respond well to readily available treatment options. Readers of JCPP are exposed to a broad range of topics presented within excellent theoretical and empirical studies, and the current issue is no exception. The studies described above are complemented by other outstanding papers addressing contexts, etiology, diagnosis and treatment of a variety of disorders and symptom profiles, ranging from autism to conduct problems to somatic problems.",

      "title": "Polarized Couples in Therapy: Recognizing Indifference as the Opposite of Love",
      "abstract": "How can a couple \"fall in love\" and then subsequently \"stumble out of love\"? For centuries, this question has perplexed partners, researchers, and therapists alike. Unlike falling out of love, which may be a long-term gradual decline in love, falling in love may occur without much deliberation like the famous \"love at first sight.\" During a developing love relationship, couples are more susceptible to ignoring a myriad of factors that will eventually influence their relationship. These ignored personal and general factors become increasingly conspicuous after the relationship is established. When facing relationship difficulties, the presence or absence of mutual love and intimacy steers the couple's relationship toward continuity or termination. Emotional indifference (which is the opposite of love) diminishes love and care; the terms marital disaffection and romantic disengagement are used synonymously to represent emotional indifference in couples. Marital disaffection is one of the central concerns of couples entering therapy. Nevertheless, spouses may enter therapy with divergent goals that may be polar opposites. Therefore, treatment of polarized or different agenda couples is challenging because disaffected spouses may be seeking counseling to break the bond at a safe venue, while their partners may still be obliviously hoping for the rebirth of their lost love. This article reviews marital disaffection/romantic disengagement and discusses counseling options for polarized couples.",

      "title": "Academic and Behavioral Problems of Boys in Elementary School",
      "abstract": "The development of a boy's sex role begins shortly after birth when he is assigned certain colors due to his gender. By the time the boy is eighteen months old, adults are expecting clear sex differences in his behavior. Subtle and not so subtle pressure is put on the child to produce sex differences. The pressure is from a wide variety of sources such as type of toys purchased, clothing provided, decoration of his room, and his interactions with family members and other significant adults. Consequently the boy's preference for guns, wheeled toys, running, and aggressive play appears at or before age three. By the time the boy enters elementary school at age six, he has a strong notion of the masculine behaviors expected of him. Modification of sex roles to accommodate the expectations of the school is one of the more difficult tasks facing elementary school aged boys. As they enter school, boys are required to assume a second role, that of a student. However, the behaviors implicit in many boys' sex roles are oppositional to the behaviors required in the student role. The conflict results in the boy not successfully assuming the student role, and may result in the boy being identified as having an academic and/or behavioral problem. Considerable research indicates that a large percentage of boys are experiencing difficulties in the schools. The present article will explore the reasons boys are involved in such frequent problems in school, and will make recommendations for persons working with elementary school aged boys.",

      "abstract": "Commonly debated in the public sector as well as in academic circles and scientific research, the basic concepts of the phenomenon of sexual orientation are being confused or simply recognized inadequately. This especially affects the conceptual understanding of sexual behaviour, sexual orientation, but also sexual identification and sexual identity. Homosexual behaviour does not have to correspond to or be the cause of homosexual orientation. Homosexual behaviour may not necessarily be an indication of homosexual orientation. Homosexual orientation has deeper biological roots than homosexual behaviour, which, in humans, is strongly influenced by culture. The phenomenon of sexual orientation does not have to be perceived as a positively dichotomous occurrence anymore. Quite the opposite, it seems it is a continuum of various sexual orientations that can have their own specific biological and socio-cultural roots. The psychological concept of the sexual identi­fication process suggests there can be a discrepancy between the psychological and the biological aspect of a single phenomenon, a discrepancy between sexual orientation [with no regard to behaviour] and sexual identification. The second part of the article seeks to outline the complex issue of gender conformity and nonconformity, which is closely related to the topic of homosexual orientation and, furthermore, is significantly overshadowed hy numerous 'popular myths', common among laymen. ln gender nonconformity we distinguish between Childhood Gender Nonconformity [CGN] appearing before puberty and Continuous Gender Identity [CGI]. Childhood gender nonconformity is one of the most common [although not completely accurate] predictors of future homosexual orientation. As far as the 'popular myths' connected withthis issue are concerned, the most widespread yet overly simplified idea is that every homosexually oriented male is positioned nearer to the feminine end of the masculinity-femininity scale. The article aims to illustrate that the problem is in reality more complex: actually, it is possible to distinguish more types of male homosexual orientation.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Gender dysphoria (GD) is defined as a marked incongruence between their experienced or expressed gender and the one they were assigned at birth. Case summary: A 17-year-old male from low socioeconomic status presented with repeated inclinations to be dressed up and move like a female for the past 11 years and for past 3 months with sleep disturbance, low mood and loss of interest in surroundings, and occasional passive death wishes. There was no physical ambiguity regarding his male sex at birth. During early age, he preferred to play with girls and enjoyed the role, wearing their traditional clothes without getting any sexual pleasure in doing so. Due to this behavior, he was criticized continuously by his father and faced strong opposition from all his relatives when he expressed his wish to become a transgender. He was diagnosed with Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults with mild depressive episode and treatment was initiated. Discussion: GD occurs when an individual strongly believes that he or she was born with the body of the wrong sex. People suffering from GD were prone to serious illnesses ranging from emotional distress, depression, isolation, and in worst cases, suicide. Hence, there is an urgent need to create awareness to perceive gender expression as a continuum reducing the burden of mental health problems associated with GD. Conclusion: GDD is a difficult condition to deal and treat, especially in individuals with orthodox and low socioeconomic backgrounds.",

      "abstract": "This development of the child is all the more remarkable when we consider the magnitude of the task. The impatient, self-centered, pleasure-seeking infant, concerned only with himself and with his own survival, is somehow induced within the child-parent relationship to defer his pleasures, consider others, become educated, develop self-control and eventually to assume some degree of responsibility in his society. This important process cannot be taken for granted as something that occurs inevitably and automatically; we have too many failures in socialization in our society for that, as the great number of delinquents, neurotics, and the maladjusted about us reveal. Mother-wisdom, valuable as it is, is inextricably related to personal adjustment and cultural patterns; instinct alone does not provide a guide. Great thinkers of the past have developed rich but incredibly varied views on the nature of the child. The infant has been regarded as a being full of original sin, as an imperfect small adult, as one who comes from Heaven trailing clouds of glory, or as one who is born free and then enslaved by society. These half-truths have not been enough to serve as a basis for the development of a sound philosophy and psychology of the parent-child relationship. So far the relatively new science of psychology, from which we have expected so much, has offered us disappointingly inconsistent views of the child in its various schools of thought. In the behavioristic school, the child is regarded more or less as a bundle of conditioned reflexes which can be established or eliminated in a scientific fashion. Developing as it did, during America's adjustment to the machine age, this view of the child lent itself to treatment of the infant in a hygienic, impersonal manner. Even today many mothers",

But even altruistic sacrifice depends on two elements that border on the measurable—\"solidarity\" and \"hope.\" If one gives up a good without reward—whether present or future, in this world or any other—one does so because the beneficiary of the sacrifice in some sense remains oneself. Such solidarity with family members, friends, or benefactors seems so common that sociobiologists have sought Darwinian explanation for it. The quality of one's life depends not merely on the quantity of goods and services one uses, but also on what others have and do.

Statistics do not adequately convey the intricacies of male sexual desire; it is a complex construct, encompassing interest, arousal and motivation for initiating or responding to sexual cues for dyadic or solitary sexual behaviors. A range of etiological factors are implicated in this dysfunction, and relational conflict and stress are high among them. Anger and resentment for one’s partner can result in absent desire for the partner, with sexual desire still intact for other sexual outlets (other partners, masturbation, pornography). Sexual secrets are therefore important to consider as well as shame about the true nature of one’s sexual desires. Systemic sex therapy, with its emphasis on identifying and addressing a wide range of etiological factors while also focusing on behavioral interventions to improve desire, is an effective treatment option for men suffering low desire in the context of an ongoing relationship.",

      "title": "A Study of forgiveness and Empathy: a Gender Difference",
      "abstract": "The interpersonal relationships an individual establishes and maintains in his or her life offer quality and meaning in one's life. The relationships parents, spouses, children, extended family and friends provide for a valuable social network. This is particularly true as these relationships work at a basic level in people's lives. These interpersonal relationships begin mutual attraction, develop respect and trust and are sustained by the belief that each person will act in the other's best interest (Flanigan, 1992).Despite the best intentions of those involved in a given relationship, mistakes may be made, considerations of the other person(s) may be abandoned and the other's best interest may be put aside. Interpersonal conflicts are a normal feature of human life, which must be dealt across the entire lifespan. Conflicts may range from simple divergence in preferences to deep hurts and severe transgressions. Such transgressions are accompanied by inner turmoil involving emotions like anger, anxiety and sadness. Negative emotions are accompanied by motivations like wanting revenge or seeking to avoid the rejecting person (McCullough et al., 1997; McCullough et al., 1998).What is forgiveness?Traditionally, definitions of forgiveness have fallen into two camps: foigiving involving (a) reduction of negative experiences (e.g., emotions, motivations, behavior, cognition; i.e., Ashton, Paunonen, Helmes & Jackson, 1998) or (b) both a reduction of negative experience and a resulting positive experience toward the offender (Fincham, Beach, & Davila, 2004). Worthington (2005) observed that when strangers or people in poor or nonvalued relationships offend, the focus is on reducing the negative. In valued, continuing relationships, the focus is on both reducing the negative and then (if possible) increasing the positive.Forgiveness is a constructive communicative act that allows individuals to cope transgressions as well as transgressors rather than negatively respond to hurtful experiences (Metts & Cupach, 2007; Worthington, Van Oyen Witvliet, Pietrini, & Miller, 2007). Fincham, Stanley and Beach (2007) indicated that forgiveness serves as a dyadic self-repair strategy with the potential to influence exchanges over time by changing the degree to which each partner's behavior serves to determine the other's response. Forgiveness does not always lead to relational repair; however, it does allow forgivers to view transgressors in a positive regard and to move forward into future relationships (Metts & Cupach, 2007).Forgiveness is not the pardoning or excusing of a hurt or transgression (Enright, Gassin, & Wu, 1992; Enright & Fitzgibbons, 2000; Smedes, 1984). Forgiveness does not require that the consequences of an offense be nullified or set aside. By forgiving, an individual is not required to refrain from pursuing justice or relinquishing his or her access to justice.Excusing or condoning a transgression can still leave the offended party bittemess where forgiveness strives to extinguish these negative feelings (Enright & Fitzgibbons, 2000). Overall, researchers suggest that forgiveness is a positive method for coping a negative relational experience in that it benefits the forgiver through a reorientation of emotions, thoughts, or acts toward the transgressor (Wade & Worthington, 2005). Essentially, forgiving others' transgressions is a pro-social act that can benefit and maintain relationships.Decisional forgiveness and emotional forgivenessThere are two different types of forgiving (Exline et al., 2003). Decisional forgiveness is making an intent statement (to oneself) that one intends to put aside vengeance and avoidance (unless it is dangerous to continue interaction) and to treat the other person as someone of value. Emotional forgiveness involves replacing negative emotions associated unforgiveness positive other-oriented emotions (such as empathy, sympathy, compassion or love for the offender). …",

      "abstract": "Love wakens pleasant memories, feelings and emotions that are associated with romantic stories, which hardily mention the conflicts that are spread through love relationships. Love is daily lived and told not only from the beautiful but especially from the conflicts that produce disharmony. Love experienced in conjugality is ruled by monogamy, which is fostered by the desired ideal of fidelity as an option. However, many people establish sexual and affective relationships out of the conjugal bond, awakened by sexual and affective dissatisfaction, lack of tenderness, love and care, or perhaps desire, pleasure, passion, vengeance or competition, considered to be socially undesirable behaviors. This work tried to unveil how relationships of infidelity are daily lived by eight women and five men in Belem, Para, which have agreed to share their stories and secrets about the subject with the researcher. As there was a circularity of ideas in the narratives, the informants allowed finding many visions of and innumerous justifications to the practice of affective or sexual infidelity, as well as different nuances that inform the feminine and masculine representations about infidelity. This gave the opportunity to read the limits that structure conjugal relationships, because infidelity – thought as a disarrangement element – is in general juggled and serves as a strategy for the love game, assuring sometimes, when it is undiscovered, the maintenance of the couples bonds.",

One of the effects to which child sexuality is subjected is the paedophilic relationship, which offers the child an opportunity to fill the intolerable emptiness felt as a consequence of not having been 'listened to' and not having had his or her pregenital sexual and emotional needs 'contained'. According to Devereux paedophilia can be attributed to fathers' lack of interest in their children, who attempt to compensate for the 'absence' of their father with other adult men. The child's complicity following the allurement, which is noted sometimes in paedophilic relationships, must not be mistaken for reciprocity, but must be associated with phenomena of premature adult-like behaviour. The characteristic of narrow-mindedness in mental cruelty goes hand in hand with the boring monotony of paedophilic behavior.",

      "title": "The “no” of the Adopted Adolescent: A Combination of Factors that Encourage the Development of Oppositional Behaviours",
      "abstract": "Opposition is a common form of behaviour in adolescence, a sign of the process of self-affirmation and the quest for independence. The narcissistic foundations formed during early childhood are particularly tested at this age. They constitute a narcissistic filter protecting against invasion by the object or its deficiencies. When they are weak or deficient, opposition may take a pathological and restrictive turn, penalizing family and social inscription. This frequently occurs with adopted adolescents. The authors emphasize the reasons why the situation of adoption is liable to undermine both primary and secondary narcissistic foundations. Opposition has the effect of making imperious demands on the object while at the same time keeping it at a distance, and has more to do with taking pleasure in mastering or controlling the object than in sharing with the object. The analysis of two clinical case histories of adopted adolescents will help to highlight certain aspects of this problem. One case concerns a narcissistic confrontation owing to the mother’s alcoholism and depression in the absence of paternal regulation; the other concerns a refusal to attend school and the development of a negative identity in response to a traumatic family situation undermining the status of the adolescent’s identity. In both these situations, the “work of the negative” in Green’s sense is highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Commitment uncertainty represents an ongoing state of conflicted feelings or thoughts about the future of a relationship. It is currently an underexplored dynamic within romantic relationships and may be a key component of young adult relationships that may influence the likelihood of relationship termination. When commitment is uncertain, individuals may engage in serious monitoring of relationship alternatives. The authors examined the associations between commitment uncertainty, serious alternative monitoring, attachment style, and relationship termination. Results supported the hypothesis that higher levels of commitment uncertainty are related to greater likelihood of termination. Interestingly, serious monitoring of alternatives was not related to relationship termination. Implications are offered for the management of these important relational processes.",

      "title": "Friendship and aggressiveness as determinants of conflict outcomes in middle childhood.",
      "abstract": "The attributions and responses of aggressive and nonaggressive boys to ambiguously intended actions of friends and nonfriends were examined. Thirty-seven aggressive and 37 nonaggressive third- and fifth-grade boys were presented with descriptions of encounters between peers in which child experienced a negative outcome as the result of the ambiguously intended actions of another. Neither aggressive nor nonaggressive subjects were influenced by the presence or absence of friendship between themselves and the child whose behavior they were asked to interpret or respond to. Aggressive subjects attributed more hostile intent than nonaggressive subjects when the objectionable action was directed at themselves but not when directed at others. Both groups of subjects predicted less hostile responses by themselves than by others. Although a significant degree of consistency was found between subjects' attributions and responses, it was also true that most hostile responses were predicted following nonhostile attributions. This finding is inconsistent with an attributionally based explanation of hostile reactive behavior. Conflict between peers is a fact of life throughout childhood. It occurs among children of both sexes, between friends and nonfriends alike, whenever one person does something to which a second person objects (Hay, 1984, p. 2). Denned in this way, conflict entails a dyadic exchange in which the actions of child are met with opposition by another. The first child need not have intended to offend the second for conflict to arise. However, if offense is intended, but none is taken, no conflict can be said to exist. Thus, an oppositional or antagonistic response by the offended party is a denning feature of conflict (Shantz, 1987). When a potential conflict situation occurs, a child's interpretation of that situation, particularly the intention that he or she attributes to the other child involved, has been shown to be important in determining the child's response (Darley, Klosson, & Zanna, 1978; Dodge, Pettit, McClaskey, & Brown, 1986; Mallick & McCandless, 1966; Rule, Nesdale, & McAra, 1974). If the child has a negative experience and believes that the other individual acted with hostile intent, then he or she is likely to respond with hostility. In contrast, if the child views the responsible peer as having acted benignly, a nonhostile response is more likely to result.",

      "title": "Understanding the Delinquent Behavior: A Step towards Reformation",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONDelinquency can be well described in a few words as a misdemeanor or an aberration from the social acceptable norms by a group of individuals who are in the middle or late adolescence. The majority vehemently reacts to these traits and sets out to punish them by incarcerating them and placing them in correctional institution to be corrected for their deviance. This treatment applies to all the children of this age group be it developed or any undeveloped nation in the world.There may be a number of factors responsible for juvenile delinquency in India. The first factor which might spur delinquent behaviour is an unfavorable family environment, including weakening of family ties, disruption of previous relationship, or the breakdown of consensus and loyalty. Besides, in present time juveniles are having access to modern gadgets and technologies. Their anticipations and aspirations from society are also very high. Unsatisfied needs and failure to reach goals lead them to deviate and get entrapped in various unwanted, antisocial activities. Lack of positive role models, and peer pressure further stand as strong reasons for their turning away from the standard norm.Another emerging issue is that of the migrants which becomes pronounced with the growth of industries and the spread of urbanization this floating sample is alienated with its existing environment. Children of these migrant families rootless and with identity crisis have their own set of ideas. Desires and life styles.. Peer pressure strengthens the feeling in the boy that he is not alone enabling him to do that which he never thought of doing it otherwise. The difference between the right and wrong gets diffused. In many instances when they realize their mistakes they are filled with remorse and look towards a new guidance.Juveniles in conflict with the law are therefore the unfortunate lot who due to one reason or more failed to adjust with the social mainstream and adopted a life style which made them deviants, and they ended up as offenders. Had they received proper attention at the appropriate time from their families and the social environment they could have joined their more fortunate peers in the mainstream for a purposeful, constructive and fulfilling life.This particular study is based on the boys residing in the Observation home known as Sewa Kuthir, at Kinsway Camp, New Delhi, remains the subject of concern for all including the members of the JJBoard, social welfare department and the family who eagerly wait for their return back to their hearth. They can be left to themselves till their release without repenting for their misdemeanor only to come back again with further hostility and aggression towards ones own self and towards others. To avoid such a situation efforts are made to transform their personality and create in them the sense of guilt and remorse. Life Skill program was specifically tailor made for these boys living in Kinsway Camp and Majnu ka Tila, followed by other intervention activities.To assess that the juveniles were instilling new ideas and skills and were sensitized appropriately a pre and post tests were administered. Boys were observed by the experts to assess the impact of the Life Skill on them. Two standardized scales were used one is Criminal Propensity Scale and the other was Morality Scale.AIM OF THE STUDYThe aim of this short study is to assess whether the boys who have been exposed to life skill classes have really undergone a change and felt the impact of the modules.HYPOTHESIS* Those boys found statistically high on criminal propensity and low on morality were not safe to be released and need to undertake the life skill program* Those boys found low on Criminal propensity and high on morality were safe when they were in the society and were not likely to repeat any offence.* Boys in the moderate level with medium criminal tendencies and moderate moral values were receptive to changeMETHODOLOGYSampleInitially a list of 40 boys was prepared for the study but it was regularly modified because of the release of some of the boys. …",

      "abstract": "Altruistic behavior is understood to largely stem from adaptations for kin altruism, contingent on degree of relatedness, and/or reciprocal altruism, contingent on degree of benefits conferred in exchange for help. Because kin qualify for both kin and reciprocal altruism, they should receive greater support than friends, as has been demonstrated in prior research. Here, we tested this prediction with regard to willingness to punish on another's behalf, comparing inclinations to aggress against transgressors when the victim was framed as an acquaintance, close friend, cousin, sibling, or oneself. Participants endorsed comparably greater direct aggression on behalf of the self, kin, or friends relative to acquaintances, despite reporting substantially greater emotional closeness to friends, consistent with what has been termed a kinship premium. Kin engendered greater aid than is explicable by affiliative emotion. Participants also reported less anger-yet trends toward greater disgust-when victims were acquaintances relative to all other conditions, replicating prior work distinguishing the social functions of anger and disgust. These results are discussed as they inform both the kinship premium hypothesis and sociofunctional accounts of moral emotion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "title": "Understanding Social Factors and Inequalities in Health: 20th Century Progress and 21st Century Prospects",
      "abstract": "The development of social epidemiology and medical sociology over the last half of the 20th century, in which Leo Reeder played a central role, transformed scientific and popular understanding of the nature and causes of physical health and illness. Viewed in the early 1950s as shaped almost entirely by biological processes and medical care, physical health and illness are now understood to be as much or more a function of social, psychological, and behavioral factors. Utilizing a stress and adaptation conceptual framework, social epidemiology has identified a broad range of psychosocial risk factors for health, most notably: (1) social relationships and support; (2) acute or event-based stress; (3) chronic stress in work and life; and (4) psychological dispositions such as anger/hostility, lack of self-efficacy/control, and negative affect/hopelessness/pessimism, with new risk factors continuing to be identified. However, proliferation of risk factors must be balanced by conceptual integration and causal understanding of the relationships among them, their causes, and consequences. One source of such integration and understanding has been the rediscovery of large and persistent socioeconomic and racial-ethnic disparities in health. Socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity shape individuals' exposure to and experience of virtually all known psychosocial, and well as many environmental and biomedical, risk factors, and these risk factors help to explain the size and persistence of social disparities in health. Improving the socioeconomic position of a broad range of disadvantaged socioeconomic and racial-ethnic strata constitutes a major avenue for reducing exposure to and experience of deleterious risk factors for health, and hence for improving the health of these groups and the overall population. This in turn requires better understanding of the macrosocial forces that influence the socioeconomic position of individuals.",

      "abstract": "An association between childhood cruelty to animals and dangerous aggression against people at a later age could have important implications regarding early detection and treatment, preventive psychiatry, and a social ethic that encourages positive attitudes toward living creatures in general. Research reports in the literature are inconsistent and inconclusive regarding a possible relationship between animal cruelty and aggression against people. Although a single act is not predictive of another act, a pattern of substantial animal abuse may conceivably be associated with a pattern of recurrent violence directed against people. In the present study, extensive interview schedules were administered to aggressive criminals, nonaggressive criminals, and noncriminals. The nature of abuse was described for each subject who gave a history of substantial abuse. A clear relationship was found between early substantial abuse and recurrent violence against people. Possible explanations for conflicting results in the literature are discussed.",

      "title": "The impact of ejaculatory dysfunction upon the sufferer and his partner",
      "abstract": "Ejaculatory function cannot be evaluated outside the dyadic process and without taking into account the men's and women's cognition of the condition and how their subjective perception impacts on the evaluation of the relationship and sexual quality. Although the distress of the sufferer and his partner has been a motivating factor in leading men with ejaculatory dysfunction to seek medical help, few objective or prospective evaluations of the effects on the couple have been reported. Specialized literature has been dealing with ejaculatory disorders in a heterogeneous manner. Comparatively, there are far more studies on premature ejaculation (PE) than on delayed ejaculation (DE) and even fewer studies on other male orgasm disorders. Therefore, the review focuses on the literature of the two most studied ejaculatory disorders. The matter presented in this article can also be considered for other ejaculatory disorders, since all of them relate to a failure of control, changing the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), with consequences for men and their partners. There are multiple psychological explanations as to why a man develops PE or DE. Unfortunately, none of the theories evolve from evidence-based studies. The common final pathway of these factors is the irrational fear of ejaculating intravaginally. These sexual disorders may also cause personal distress for the sexual partner and decreased sexual satisfaction for the couple. An association between pre-existing anxiety disorders and sexual performance anxiety has been found in men and couples with ejaculatory dysfunction. This could reflect a process in which pre-existing anxiety triggers sexual dysfunction, causing performance anxiety and leading to a vicious cycle: anxiety, sexual dysfunction, more anxiety. Men with DE are similar to men with other sexual dysfunctions. They show the same elevated level of sexual dissatisfaction and they also show lower levels of coital frequency. To a lower extent, they use more masturbatory activity relative to controls. The burden of PE for the patient is revealed in three different levels: the emotional burden, the health burden, and the burden on the relationship. In terms of the emotional burden, there is often a sense of embarrassment and shame at not being able to satisfy their partner, and patients often have low self-esteem, feelings of inferiority, anxiety, anger, and disappointment. Men feel frustrated about their PE and how it affects their intimacy with their partners and the sexual relationship. In conclusion, ejaculatory dysfunction has a negative impact on both the man and his female partner and, consequently, it has implications for the couple as a whole. Additionally, ejaculatory dysfunction extending beyond a year elevates the risk of depression in these patients. Although partner perceptions of PE generally indicated less dysfunction than those of subjects, partner outcomes measures play a part in the assessment of PE. Ejaculatory dysfunction involves the integration of physiological, psychobehavioral, cultural, and relationship dimensions. All these elements need to be considered in the treatment.",

Additionally, these relationship qualities do not occur in isolation since sibling relationships are known as the quintessential love–hate relationship. The ambivalence (i.e., coexistence of positive and negative feelings) siblings experience toward one another during childhood and adolescence and the prevalence of this feeling make the sibling relationship unique. Ambivalence in the sibling relationship during adolescence is developmentally appropriate and may benefit individuals throughout life. In this article, we argue that adolescence is the tipping point in the sibling relationship that sets the stage for how healthy and engaged, or distant and uninvolved, relationships with siblings become in adulthood.",

      "abstract": "According to the latest results of Croatian Institute of Public Health, there are more and more children and young adults who are diagnosed with behavioral or mental disorders. Today, personality disorders in adolescence are in the focus, they are important health problem because those problems reflect on families and society in general. Last decades, some important scientific researches on personality disorders in adolescence are present. Adolescence is the period of maturing where the child prepares himself/herself for adulthood; it is the period of turbulence, emotional ambivalences and intensive changes in physical, psychic, emotional, cognitive and sexual development. Numerous risks, to which young people are exposed to, can interfere with normal transition through that period and stimulate occurrence of certain disorder in the mental health of adolescence. Personality disorder is the condition where behavior and experience stand out from habitually and normal behavior; it is not adapted; it interferes with normal functioning of a young adult and it is not justified with the situation where the young person find himself/herself. The cause of disorder is interpreted as the combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risky environmental factors in the childhood take big part in its origin and development of personality disorders. There is a big vigilance in diagnosis of personality disorder in adolescence, because the fact that psychophysical development of a young adult is not finished yet, symptoms of a certain personality disorders must be present for at least one year. We distinguish several types of personality disorders that can be recognized by certain characteristics. Personality disorders are conditions; they are not mental illnesses, but if the symptoms are not recognized on time and the young person does not protect himself/herself from the risky situations and enviornment, peronality disorders can develop in that direction. The key point in the treatment of personality disorders is the early identification of the problem, setting the correct diagnosis and individual approach in choosing of methods of treatment. Psychotherapy is the most common type of treatment, in which cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, psychoanalysis and group psychotherapy are most used. Which one will be used, depends on the assessment that best suits the person with personality disorder. In the program of the mental health protection of the youth, that are introduced on the national level, series of measuers and acitivites are pursued and directed towards the promotion and advancement of mental health, early recognition of difficulties and disorders in mental functioning, and work with high-risk children and youth. The approach is interdisciplinary, teachers and professional associates play the key role in those activities in educational institutions. Their education, consultation and permanent specialization are very important.",

      "abstract": "Primates and dolphins exhibit comparable examples of all categories of non-conceptive sexual behaviors, including sexual interactions involving immature individuals, those involving individuals of the same sex, and copulation during the non-conceptive period. Although mammals of other taxa also perform non-conceptive sexual behaviors, the fact that there are so many reports of non-conceptive sexual interactions among higher primates and dolphins suggest a link between the nonreproductive use of sexual behaviors and high intelligence. This link might be because the greater role of learning in sexual behavior expands the possibility for sex to be incorporated into a variety of non-conceptive functions. Non-conceptive sexual behaviors seem to reflect or be influenced by important social factors, including affiliative relations and alliance between individuals of the same or different sex, high social status of females, within-group or between-group tension resolution, mate selection, and infanticide prevention. Animals may employ non-conceptive sexual behaviors to control various important aspects of their relationships with others which they cannot control with other social behaviors, which suggests that instances of non-conceptive sexual behaviors may serve as keys to understanding important aspects of the social relationships or social structure of the species.",

      "title": "Mitos do amor romántico",
      "abstract": "Non se pode negar que o amor ocupa un lugar fundamental na vida das persoas, podendo ser fonte de satisfacción e felicidade ou de insatisfacción e desdita. Resulta difícil ofrecer un significado do amor válido para todos/as, posto que é ao mesmo tempo un sentimento universal e unha construción social, na que interveñen múltiples dimensións: histórica, biolóxica, socio-cultural e individual. Na sociedade occidental prevalece o concepto de Amor Romántico, vinculado a unha serie de Mitos, disfuncións e paradoxos que xeran un modelo normativo de ser parella inalcanzable e imposible. A investigación céntrase nos Mitos, concretamente nos seguintes: do emparellamento, da perdurabilidade ou paixón eterna, da exclusividade, da fidelidade, da equivalencia, da omnipotencia, da media laranxa, do matrimonio e dos celos. A crenza nestes Mitos pode dar lugar ao establecemento de relacións negativas e tóxicas e xerar problemas na saúde psicosocial das persoas, sendo fonte de insatisfacción e infelicidade por teren que enfrontarse continuamente a imposicións contraditorias, entre elas e coa propia natureza do ser humano, imposibles de acadar. As consecuencias poden ir dende o desasosego persoal, o desenvolvemento de sentimentos de frustración e decepción ata a discusións e problemas na parella, máis ou menos intensas. Agora ben, tamén pode chegar a extremos máis dramáticos, dando lugar a dependencia emocional, desigualdade dentro da parella, violencia, etc. Dadas as evidencias da importancia do amor na vida das persoas, xustifícase o interese científico-profesional do estudo. Partindo de que o colectivo de profesionais do Traballo Social debe ser especialmente sensible ás estruturas sociais subxacentes, realizouse unha investigación cuxo propósito foi indagar sobre o Nivel de Aceptación dos Mitos do Amor Romántico por parte do alumnado do Grao en Traballo Social da Universidade de Vigo e a súa relación con diferentes variables (Sociodemográficas, coa existencia de Relación de Parella e coa Autoestima), para o cal utilizouse un Cuestionario estruturado que foi aplicado a 103 suxeitos, e cuxas respostas foron analizadas co SPSS/19. Os resultados indican unha importante aceptación dos Mitos do Emparellamento e a Fidelidade, que acadan porcentaxes en torno ao 70 e 60%, respectivamente; e un rexeitamento elevado do Mito dos Celos, da Perdurabilidade e da Exclusividade, co 75, 67 e o 53%, respectivamente. Atopáronse diferenzas significativas (p&lt;.05) en relación a algúns Mitos e ás variables Sexo e Curso. Ponse de manifesto a necesidade de realizar unha intervención cuxo obxectivo sexa evitar as consecuencias que se derivan da Aceptación dos Mitos do Amor Romántico, para o cal se propón a realización dunha deconstrución dos mesmos que permita camiñar cara novas formas de entender a parella na que os roles muller-home non estean preestablecidos pola sociedade, na que non existan diferenzas de poder dentro da relación.",

      "abstract": "The happy consequence of a sexual intercourse between adults is, at times, the birth of a child. The tragic consequence of a sexual intercourse between an adult and a child is always the death of a child. This simple brutal truth is the heavy weight that hits the analyst when he becomes close to an abused child, or to someone who had been abused as a child. Adults too struggle to visualise an abusive situation, especially if the perpetrator is someone close, someone 'above suspicion', so it happens frequently that when the child finds the strength and words to ask for help, he meets up with a barrier of disbelief and accusation that leaves him in the most desperate solitude. An abuse finds infinite representations to express itself. The betrayal of a partner becomes an obscure evil that nests in the body and invades the mind. An examination turns into the fear of an invasion leaving behind a nameless anguish.",

      "abstract": "Today, every other human experiences some kind of discrimination or prejudice which is based on their physical appearance, skin color, gender, nationality, level of education or some other deficit. Even though we live in a modern world in which we can often meet various types of people we still can't fully accept all the differences they have. Consciously or unconsciously, we create opinion in advance about people we don't even know, just on the basis of what we see for the first time or what we hear about them. We put labels on people and classify them in various groups while we do not take in mind what kind of person they really are, their attitude, beliefs and opinion. There are few explanations why we still have a tendency to approve people similar to us and disapprove someone who is different. Social evolution theory assumes that the cause of hostility we are witnessing today towards people who are different is caused by our ancestors behaviour towards these kind of people which then usually ended with physical confrontation because of fear for their lives. Second theory is that from beginning of our existence we didn't have implanted true moral values so we didn't really appreciate right thing about people. Minority groups very often confront great obstacles because of that discriminative opinions and they often don't fit in the society. And society works in the principle to glorify equality but not differences. Education sistem works in the same way as society. It's good for an average child who can understand every class and learn about it how much it is needed but on the other hand it is bad for children with special needs like autism, ADHD and gifted children. System which is trying to integrate various children in upbringing and education is totally unadjusted to their differences. Today's system demands impossible from these children and it needs a major change if we want to have a successful education system. But if we can't change this system, we can only change ourselves and our way of thinking so that we can accept differences and draw the best fro each one of us. The process which encourages such development of attitudes and values with people like global interdependence, peace, tolerance, social justice and environmental consciousness is called upbringing for development and one of its concepts is knowing other people and respecting their differences.",

As in the case of many disasters, child abuse occurs unexpectedly despite an obvious build-up, as nobody sees anything happening. The perpetrators trigger a cycle of violence which they soon lose control of because no child can resist them. It seems that violence demands still more violence in what is often an endless cycle. The relationship of adults to their child can be perceived in their own speech. Abuse can begin in different ways. The automatic, loveless removal of a child from one family to another bodes no good for the child when the family is just a patchwork of people, organized for utilitarian reasons rather than by affection and love.",

      "abstract": "Physiological stains in sexual assault cases have the potential to provide useful information. A comparison of genetic marker types in evidence semen stains and/or saliva stains to the corresponding genetic markers in the blood of a suspect may exclude the man as the perpetrator of the crime. If the genetic markers match, identification is inconclusive but may tend to support other circumstantial or eyewitness evidence of guilt. Potential for error is particularly high with physiological stain evidence because of its susceptibility to physical and chemical degradation. Furthermore, secretions (vaginal fluids, saliva, perspiration) from the victim are commonly mixed with the evidence specimens (semen, saliva) of the assailant. Certain genetic markers from the victim may mask those of the assailant. In many US crime laboratories there are no professional qualifications or requirements for the analysts assigned to this type of work. There is little administrative enforcement of quality control.

      "abstract": "The goal of this research is to examine the specificity of social representations of infidelity among married and unmarried men and women. The hypothesis was advanced that married and unmarried men and women differ in their perception of infidelity. The differences depend on the gender and marital status, and pertain to definition of this concept and the underlying causes. The article employs the methods of questionnaire, content analysis, and the developed by the authors projective technique &amp;ldquo;draw infidelity&amp;rdquo;. It was established that the respondents view infidelity from two perspectives: those who commit adultery (more typical to men), and those against whom adultery was committed (more typical to women). Married individuals more often describe their own infidelity, while unmarried persons describe the infidelity of another partner. The main cause infidelity for men are new sensations (new sexual experience, etc.), while women it is love for another person (strong emotional experiences). Married respondents describe infidelity as a rare, tough, and long-term phenomenon. Unmarried respondents consider infidelity a rather frequent phenomenon that gives new experience in relationships. Women view infidelity as an emotional, passionate, and unique phenomenon. Men tend to assess infidelity as an indifferent, typical, and rational event. The acquired data can be used in family counseling on the problems of infidelity, as well as in psychological counseling overall. The results can also be used in psychoprophylactic work with youth on the question of family and marriage.",

      "title": "Gender Based Violence in India: Causes, Patterns and Prevention",
      "abstract": "Violence against people or groups of individuals based on their gender is referred to as gender-based violence to differentiate it from another forms of assault committed by both people and groups. Acts that cause or are likely to cause bodily, sexual, or psychological injury are included. Moreover, Violence against women includes coercion, random absence of liberty, and the risk of like acts. Such violence against women may be committed by state agents, within the household, or inside groups during “peace times” and conflict. Family members, friends, strangers, or intimate partners-including spouses-may commit it. Among the many common and socially acceptable kinds of assault in the world is probably gender-based violence. This problem is pervasive and enduring in India, and it is closely related to patriarchy and its fundamental presumption that males possess the right and ability to harm women. It is rooted in belief that females are less valuable than male and is associated with both the patriarchal system and masculinity, according to which a “real man” is someone who abuses women. The Indian Constitution’s guarantees of women’s fundamental rights and human rights are severely hampered by gender-based violence. Gender-based violence is a grave human rights violation and a severe health and safety concern. People who escape their homes are frequently more vulnerable to physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, including forced prostitution, rape, and sexual assault. Even though anyone can become a victim of violence due to their gender or sex, women and girls are particularly vulnerable. According to estimates, one in three women will be the victim of physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives. Public or private sexual, physical, psychological, and financial abuse are all examples of gender-based violence. Threats of violence, coercion, and manipulation are also included. Intimate relationship violence, sexual assault, marriage of children, modification of women genitalia, and so- called “honour crimes” are just a few examples of the various ways this can manifest. The nature and causes of assault against women in India are examined in this essay. India has a widespread and severe problem with gender-based violence, where female experience many types of harassment, discrimination, and assault in public and household settings. Prevalence of violence against women is still a major problem in the nation despite the implementation of numerous laws and programs. The prevalence of assault against female is among the highest in India. The information from NCRB annual report, India has seen a startling increase in crimes against women. A startling rise from 2021 and 2020 is revealed by the data, with 4,45,256 incidents reported in 2022 alone- nearly 51 FIRs each hour. According to data from the NCRB’s annual crime report, “Crime in India 2022,” the number of crimes committed against female per lakh people was 66.4, while the list of charges in these cases was 75.8. India must give gender-based violence top priority and endeavour to provide a secure atmosphere for women. India cannot successfully address the problem of violence against women and protect women’s rights and dignity unless it takes coordinated action and persistent efforts. The Indian Constitution grants women equality and empowers the State to enact anti-discrimination laws that will assist women in overcoming their historical disadvantages in politics, education, and the economy. The government is creating new institutional structures including all-female police stations and national and state commissions for women, as well as reinforcing the current laws through evaluation and revisions when necessary. The literature review of theoretical viewpoints on gender- based violence, the nature and causes of gender-based violence in India, patterns of gender-based violence in India, and preventative strategy is the foundation of this work.",

      "title": "Unconscious bias",
      "abstract": "FigureHave you ever walked into a patient room with a preconceived picture based on socioeconomic status or ethnicity? Have you feared taking care of someone because he or she is homeless or has opioid use disorder? Although we're caregivers and have devoted our lives to helping people, we sometimes display unintentional biases toward others. Everyone has a cultural lens through which we view the world, which can sometimes create biases. Often, the decisions we make are directly influenced by those biases, even when we espouse other beliefs. The influence occurs without our knowledge because unconscious bias is just that—unconscious—and research has revealed that we all harbor unconscious biases. What's unconscious bias? Unconscious, or implicit, bias is defined as stereotypes or cultural concepts that influence decisions and behaviors. These biases started forming when you were very young and were shaped as you matured into who you are today. Investigations of unconscious bias show that people of all backgrounds, despite claims against partialities, have unconscious preferences based on gender, race, sexual orientation, or other aspects of identity. We also classify people according to educational level, disability, sexuality, accent, social status, and job title, automatically assigning presumed traits to anyone we subconsciously put in those groups. Further research supports that our unconscious biases, and the decisions they cause us to make, may contribute to healthcare disparities (see What does healthcare disparity mean?). Despite our strong ethical and moral commitment to others, our biases have a significant impact on nursing practice and the nation's health. Even if you're aware of unconscious bias, your reaction to your patient sets the tone for his or her care. Your body language, focused attention, or level of care can be directly impacted by your feelings toward the patient. Understanding what may trigger your reactions to people and what makes you act differently can improve the way you provide care. Identifying our biases No one wants to feel like they make decisions based on unconscious bias. In fact, most of us get very defensive if someone accuses us of stereotyping or making a biased comment. However, we must accept that we all have a different lens to view the world, and that lens impacts how we see each other and, ultimately, how we care for others. Making decisions based on prejudices can have devastating impacts on nursing care. The first step in addressing the impact of unconscious bias is identifying your own biases. The process begins with recognizing that words and feelings can cause uncomfortable feelings toward others. You need to be honest with yourself about the stereotypes that affect you. For example, you may consciously think that men and women are equally effective leaders but, as a woman, you believe that men perhaps don't have the same level of empathy as women. As we've seen, people may unwittingly tend to favor physicians or nurses from their own backgrounds. Likewise, you may favor caring for someone from your own familiar background. Neurologic tests and exercises, such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which was introduced in 1998 and has now been used by more than 15 million participants, can help you identify your unconscious biases and reduce their influence. The test measures the time it takes to match representatives of social groups to particular attributes. There are more than a dozen IATs that you can take online to gauge your perceptions of ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, disability, skin tone, weight, religion, and more. Once you've identified your biases, you're prepared to move to the next step: acknowledging unconscious bias. Acknowledging unconscious bias Do you know how your unconscious biases affect your nursing care? Acknowledging your biases can be done individually or in a group. You can choose the most comfortable way to approach this step. However, make sure you're in a safe place if you're doing this with someone else. To begin, we must eliminate the stigma around talking about biases. Doing so may seem like common sense, but it can be difficult if you don't have the tools or desire to acknowledge that we all have biases. Part of making a concerted effort to eliminate prevailing bias is working together. Leaders and coworkers must feel empowered to call out or interrupt bias language. For example, when a nurse says, \"I don't want to take care of that nagging, old lady,\" fellow coworkers should interrupt the conversation and state, \"You mean Mrs. Smith.\" Many times, we don't realize the bias in our language. Nursing is considered one of the most trusted professions, and the last thing you want to do is allow biases to impact your patient. Remember that every action you take and decision you make also creates a stigma about yourself in the patient's eyes. Strategies to disengage biases The next question you should ask yourself is: Do I want to honestly address my biases? As nurses, we hope the answer is \"yes!\" It's important to remember that you aren't trying to change your unconscious bias, but rather disengage it while caring for patients. Biased decisions often occur under stressful situations, which is most of our bedside nursing careers. Disengaging your unconscious bias takes honesty, practice, and intentional thought. First, write down your commitment to the action you'll take to disengage a specific bias you've identified. For example, \"I won't address the new graduate nurses as 'baby' nurses.\" Next, you must unpack your level of consciousness. The honest conversation with ourselves must include a shift from feeling like we're very tolerant to a focus on being the nurse we mean to be. You can start by challenging yourself to stop using a few common biased words, such as frequent flyer, bossy, baby nurses, old nurses, or any other words that don't tastefully describe your coworkers or patients. Another way to identify your bias is to ask yourself this question: \"Would I address my patient by this name or description to their face?\" If the answer is \"no,\" you're probably using biased language. As healthcare professionals, we must be able to empathize with our patients and their circumstances to fully disengage our biases. You can develop empathy by making a conscious effort to understand the patient's situation. Try to imagine walking in the patient's footsteps. Some biases are more difficult to disengage than others, and this takes intentional practice. However, remember that your biases can raise a barrier to empathy. For example, caring for patients who participate in risk-taking behaviors can make it more difficult for you to be empathetic. To overcome these barriers, you must consciously make an effort to recognize and acknowledge that the barriers exist and deliberately implement a practice that aligns with unbiased patient care. Another strategy to overcome our unconscious bias is mindfulness—the ability to empty the mind of distracting thoughts so that we can focus on the present moment. When we're being mindful, we free ourselves of the distraction of assumptions. Your patients should be able to sense that you intend to do what's best for them to provide safe outcomes. Educating yourself, aside from this article, is essential to changing your bias. Many educational opportunities exist, such as implicit bias webinars, diversity training in your facility, or formal courses on diversity in healthcare. Be the change Although many healthcare professionals don't see themselves as being biased, our patients may be negatively impacted because of our unconscious bias. Education can be introduced in the formal curriculum for healthcare providers and nurses. However, change starts with us—the front line of care for our patients. What does healthcare disparity mean? Healthcare disparity is defined as a particular type of health difference that's closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage and adversely effects different groups. People who experience the greatest disparities include those who've incurred obstacles at the system level based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; socioeconomic status; gender; age; mental health; cognitive, sensory, or physical disability; sexual orientation or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion. Examples of healthcare disparities include: Rates of premature death from stroke and coronary heart disease are higher among nonHispanic Black individuals when compared with White individuals. The infant mortality rate for nonHispanic Black women is more than double the rate for nonHispanic White women. on the webFigureNational Institutes of Health:https://diversity.nih.gov/sociocultural-factors/implicit-bias Project Implicit:https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html re:Work:https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/unbiasing Very Well Mind:www.verywellmind.com/negative-bias-4589618",

      "abstract": "M ental health is defined as a state of wellbeing in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community. Mental health problems may increase in specific environments where social isolation and poor quality of life are prominent. In urban settings in developing countries, the risk of mental health problems or mental disorders may be higher than in rural areas. Health inequalities between rural and urban areas are considered by many investigators because urban areas have better health statistics and consume the majority of the health budget. It is important to understand the characteristics of urban environment and provide mental health services to obtain mental well-being of the people and prevent mental problems. The causes of mental problems may include genetic abnormalities, physical disorders, problems in childhood and growing up and stressful events of life. Mental illness occurs from the interaction of multiple genes and other environmental factors such as poor family conditions, abuse, psychiatric disorders in family members, traumatic events, unsafe neighborhood, and pollution, uncomfortable living conditions (crime areas or war-torn regions). Social stressors such as poverty, financial pressures, racial and sexual discrimination or harassment, unemployment, isolation, and a lack of social support can also cause stress and lead to poor quality of life and mental problems or disorders. The urban setting is a specific area where risk factors of mental problems exist. The competitive life which is not usual in rural area pushes the people across their life span. Significant problematic behaviors are frequent in urban setting as the result of mental health problems for example: divorce, abuse, selfdestruction, suicide, drug abuse, crime, sexual problems and abortion,",

We further propose that certain life experiences, such as parental divorce, augment the strength of the beliefs constituting this naive theory. A method was devised to measure children's attributions of unhappiness to someone who perceives a second party being given affection by a third. Children were asked to respond to pictures of three-person situations in which the first person was the donor of affection, the second was the recipient, and the third was the nonrecipient. Children of divorced parents attributed significantly more unhappiness to nonrecipients than did children from intact families. Detailed results indicate that different levels of unhappiness are expected depending on the family role (child, father, mother) of the nonrecipient.",

      "title": "Learning to ‘talk the talk’: the relationship of psychopathic traits to deficits in empathy across childhood",
      "abstract": "Psychopathy is characterised by profound deficits in the human tendency to feel and care about what other people feel, often known as 'affective empathy'. On the other hand, the psychopath often has intact 'cognitive' empathy skills, that is, he is able to describe what and why other people feel, even if he does not share or care about those feelings. Despite a rapidly advancing neuroscience of empathy, little is known about the developmental underpinnings of this psychopathic disconnect between affective and cognitive empathy.The parents of N = 2760, 3-13-year-olds reported on the levels of empathy, callous-unemotional traits (CU), and antisocial behaviour (AB). Consistent with current theory and measurement practice, an index of 'psychopathic traits' was derived from the CU and AB measures.There are important gender and developmental differences in empathy deficits related to psychopathic traits. As expected, psychopathy is associated with severe deficits in affective empathy across all ages for males; however, no such deficits were found for females. Contrary to adult findings, psychopathic traits are associated with deficits in cognitive empathy in childhood for both sexes; however, males with high psychopathic traits appear to overcome these deficits in cognitive empathy as they move through the pubertal years.In contrast to cognitive empathy, low affective empathy does not appear to be associated with psychopathic traits in females. The characteristic disconnect between cognitive and affective empathy seen in adult male psychopathy crystallises in the pubertal years when they appear to learn to 'talk the talk' about other people's emotions, despite suffering severe deficits in their emotional connection (affective empathy) to others.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Adolescence is characterized by a series of developmental tasks that need to be mastered. In the realm of sexual development, such tasks include learning to manage feelings of sexual arousal, developing new forms of intimacy and autonomy, experiencing interpersonal relationships with the opposite sex, and developing skills to control the consequences of sexual behavior. The conceptual framework in which we study sexuality, or what we term sexual well-being, employs the constructs of vulnerability and resilience from developmental psychopathology. Vulnerability implies that a particular child or group of children who are at risk in a probabilistic sense for manifesting a certain behavior or set of behaviors are also susceptible to decrements in well-being. Risk factors are those biological, psychosocial, and environmental conditions, broadly defined, known to be associated with negative outcomes or decrements in well-being. The opposite of vulnerability and risk factors are resilience and protective factors. Protective factors and their links to resiliency have not been studied as extensively as risk factors and their links to vulnerability, yet they are critical to the promotion of well-being (Furstenberg, Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Morgan, 1987; Garmezy &amp; Rutter, 1988; Werner &amp; Smith, 1982).",

      "title": "“Friendship Jealousy”: An (Overlooked) Emotion for Friendship Maintenance?",
      "abstract": "Friendships make us happy, keep us healthy, and can\neven facilitate our reproductive fitness. But most friendships are\nnot forever—even when we want them to be. How do people maintain\nvalued friendships? I propose that “friendship jealousy” arises\nwhen people perceive others as posing threats to valued\nfriendships, and that this response can function to prevent\nfriendship loss and friend defection. In preliminary experiments, I\ntested predictions derived from this functional view. As predicted,\nI found, first, that friendship jealousy is calibrated to friend\nvalue. Second, friendship jealousy predicts intentions to “friend\nguard” (i.e., engage in behavior to protect the friendship). Third,\nfriendship jealousy has sex-differentiated features, which are\nconsistent with sex differences in friendship structures and\nancestral friendship functions. The present work pits against one\nanother intuitive and functional predictions as to what drives\nfriendship jealousy. Although intuition might lead one to expect\ngreater jealousy when a friend spends more time with a new person,\na functional view suggests greater jealousy when that new person\nthreatens to fulfill the same function for one’s friend that one is\ncurrently fulfilling (i.e., to “replace” him/her). Preliminary\nstudies revealed that greater friendship jealousy is evoked when\nfriends form new same-sex friendships (which presumably pose\ngreater replacement threat, but lesser time threat) versus new\nromantic relationships (which presumably pose lesser replacement\nthreat, but greater time threat). The focal experiment explicitly\nand experimentally manipulates a version of “replacement threat”\n(whether the best friend “chooses” the new friend over you) and\n“time threat” (how much time the best friend spends with the new\nfriend). In line with functional predictions, the amount of time\nthe best friend spends with a new friend drives friendship\njealousy—but only when direct information about replacement threat\nis unavailable. Regardless of the time threat posed, participants\nreport high friendship jealousy when replacement threat is high,\nand low friendship jealousy when replacement threat is low. Results\nimply that friendship jealousy is calibrated to replacement threat\n(over time threat). Overall, findings suggest that friendship\njealousy might be a functional response aimed at facilitating\nfriendship maintenance.",

CBDs are often hidden experiences, aside from the lack of treatment in literature, academic or not. This article re-frames CBDs through a philosophical, yet subjective, treatment that seeks to describe it as a cluster of experiences that often step outside of the bounds of the medical definition. Why have CBDs been so elusive? Partly because of their multi-layered, temporally structured, socially organized ontology, which makes them hard to define, locate, and reduce to one clear-cut perspective. Are they in the genes, in actual bleedings, in secondary disabilities, in the social adjustments involved, in iatrogenic complications; or are they to be located in the joints, the liver, or other organs that may be affected as a consequence of treatments? Do they affect individuals, families, genetic carriers, sexual partners, or even future generations? Drawing partly upon personal history, conversations, semi-structured interviews, published biographical narrations, and the shared experience of patients’ groups, the article amends some misinterpretations and captures salient aspects of this illness experience.",

      "abstract": "Being social creatures, humans need a safe and secure social environment to exist. For one's physical and emotional well-being, it is imperative to have satisfying social connections. Loneliness may result from a lack of social connections. Intimacy and a sense of belonging are fundamental human desires. Interpersonal connections have several advantages. Loneliness has been perceived as a universal human experience since the dawn. Social connection is essential for everyone's survival. People are innately social beings that rely on one another for assistance. Even though mental health issues and social isolation often coexist in young children, early isolation does not indicate worse mental health issues in the future. However, children with such issues and behaviors could find it difficult to handle the social difficulties they face as they advance through the early years of school. Humans are social animals, and when they don't feel connected, they tend to get sadder, sicker, and more susceptible to developing depression and other mental health problems. Isolation is a frequent occurrence that become more prevalent during the COVID-19 global pandemic, having an adverse effect on people's physical and mental health everywhere. Furthermore, according to the most recent data, there may be an increase in the prevalence of mental health problems among at-risk groups and persons who are vulnerable to them after the pandemic's height. 6 Children and adolescents, the elderly, people who are unemployed or homeless, COVID-19 survivors, people with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, community workers, pregnant women, people who are physically or mentally disabled, migrants, refugees, and members of the LGBT community, as well as people who belong to racial or ethnic minorities, are among the vulnerable populations. Loneliness in the elderly beings and social isolation pose a substantial threat to public health because they increase the risk of dementia and other serious disorders in a huge number of people.",

      "abstract": "Although a couple's sexual relationship evolves over time and is sometimes replaced by other forms of intimacy, it is not true that long-term relationships lack sex altogether. However, it may take more energy and creativity for long-time partners to stimulate themselves and each other and to keep their sexual relationship satisfactory. This article suggests that, although it seems contradictory, development of a more individual, autonomous stance in each partner often fosters the relationship, including sex. Falling in love or extramarital sex can be the catalyst that makes it clear that some fundamental elements are lacking in a long-term relationship. Sometimes couples therapy-or reconsidering the reasons to stay in a marriage in another way-helps to bring a couple together again. In other cases, this is not effective, and divorce can be a necessary next developmental step for one or both partners. For children, divorce is never easy, especially when they are adolescents and in their second separation-individuation stage of development. For adolescents, seeing one or both of their parents fall in love again and start a sexual relationship with someone new can be a confusing and upsetting experience. A case example is offered to illustrate these dynamics.",

The data from these studies seem further to indicate that this association is not a linear cause-effect relationship in either direction, but a circular or interactional relationship. Unemployment may affect mental health by acting as a precipitating factor. But, on the other hand, it is evident that the risk for the mentally disturbed to become unemployed is clearly greater than for other people. Many other factors besides unemployment and mental disorder act in this complex interaction network too. All unemployed are not similar, but such factors as age, education, domicile, family, other social ties, and personality have a great effect on the whole. Work is an important resource for mental health. Unemployment can be regarded as a risk factor because it means that the individual loses the positive and supporting elements which work has. The negative factors are (i) the lack of emotional and economic security, (ii) the perplexity of the time perspective, (iii) isolation, (iv) identity diffusion, and (v) a general sense of frustration.",

They appear as a common circumstance a typical condition for most. For a rare few the degree of trouble is so slight that it is overlooked or soon forgotten. Rare individuals experience near-perfect relationships or so they report. On the other hand I believe I can show that many experience truly hurtful occasions of blocked communication. Also my informants sustain what some other observers have said: A too-large minority suffer personality damages and severe social disorders of long duration. The impact of a damaged personality or of his shattered family relationships cannot limit itself to the one individual. The impact will necessarily extend into his social contacts wherever they may occur. My study of the subject convinces me that there are interesting variations when different topics are talked about. Boys have somewhat different problems with a given list of topics than girls do. There is variation in the list of difficult topics when discussion takes place with mothers or with fathers. The reasons differ too for each of the four sex-paired combinations: son-father daughter-father son- mother daughter-mother. Inasmuch as I have studied teen-agers at college freshman and high school freshman levels I am able to supply some interesting comparative speculations about changes which growing up seems to bring about.

Consequently “loss,” as it is implied within the classical perspective, does not seem to be a significant factor associated with most forensic suicides.

      "title": "On Phenocopies, Their Developmental Physiology and Genetic Meaning",
      "abstract": "To sum up: Recognizing that certain facts remain which at present defy interpretation and which call for further analysis, I believe that the evidence which has thus far been brought forward from various sources justifies the following interpretation of the genesis of phenocopies. As mutant genes produce a dislocation in the integrated functions of the normal genotype, so do certain external agents, whether physical or chemical, intervene in gene-determined developmental events by preventing them at one point or another from accomplishing their appointed ends, leading thereby to a mutant-like phenotype. The point of interference varies according to the existing genotype, the developmental stage at intervention, kind and quantity of the external agent, and still other factors. But I believe that in all instances the resulting phenocopies are the result of external pressure which has a suppressing, retarding or disorienting effect on one or more gene-controlled components of the normal or mutant genotype in question. It is probable that with sufficient or the proper kind of pressure many gene-controlled events can be made to appear as being the result of sub-threshold alleles, but I do not believe that the existence of such isoalleles as determiners of phenocopies has been proven or that it is likely. I believe that the phenotypic homologies between mutants and phenocopies, whether they be only superficial or intrinsic, represent two different ways in which weaknesses of ontogenetic integration are revealed. The fact that, in our experience, those mutant phenotypes which exist as several independent gene substitutions are also the ones which can most readily be produced as phenocopies, and that the affected events depend on complex developmental interactions presumably enhances the likelihood of \"derailments\" to occur. The deficiencies in developmental integration and stability which we have in mind must, of course, be viewed as a failure of evolution to provide me chanisms which could cope with the genic or environmental sources of dislocation. There is abundant evidence, however, for the widespread occurrence of specific modifiers, as constituents of the residual genotype, which in a similar manner alleviate mutant and phenocopic development. This is important in view of the many facts which suggest that these modifiers are in reality an integral, if varying, part of the normal genic endowment of organisms. Taking all evidence into account it seems to me that the most exciting aspect of the study of phenocopies is the opportunity it may provide of shedding light, if only indirectly, on the developmental functions of that awesome skeleton in the closets of genetical science-the normal genotype.",

Successful coordination, as well as individual wellbeing, benefit when we also perceive others as trustworthy, reasonable or well-intentioned.

Here, we present the development and testing of a scale to directly measure this attitude. Using a representative sample of 1869 UK adults, we test dimensionality and consistency of the scale items. We show that the refined, six-item, scale is associated with, but not entirely determined by, generalised trust in other people. Our \"Faith in Reason\" scale shows large individual differences, but the average tendency is slightly on the side of endorsing, rather than rejecting, sentiments such as \"The typical person is often irrational\".",

The understanding of prejudice has in recent years become one of the major concerns of social science. Numerous studies undertaken during the past decade have considerably increased comprehension of the phenomenon. The earlier notion that the cause of prejudice was to be sought in the nature of its object has all but disappeared. It is sometimes still encountered, but chiefly as a conciliatory gesture to stimulus-response theory (if a response exists, some stimulus must have called it forth) or, almost apologetically stated, as a variant of Merton's (33) self-fulfilling prophecy (minority groups develop certain characteristics as defenses against prejudice or because of limitations imposed upon them). Early studies of prejudice were mostly statistical or descriptive-how many people in a given group showed prejudices, in what areas, against which groups. More recent research has dealt largely with personality correlates of prejudice, its development in children, and to a lesser extent with social, cultural, and situational factors which lead to its growth or favor its expression. As one consequence of these investigations, prejudice has come to be recognized as a symptom in a total personality configuration or syndrome, appearing under given social and historical conditions, as the review by Van Til and Denemark (50) indicated.",

      "abstract": "Children are rarely perceived as torture victims, although they may be easier targets. International inertia is compounded as not only torture, but also ‘other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’ is prohibited. Some of these occur in the private sphere, which traditionalists erroneously assume outside of international human rights law. Children may also be unprotected because they suffer from trauma in different ways from adults. Jurisprudence of human rights fora based principally on adult victims, despite some dicta to the contrary, risks international standards being inappropriately applied to child victims. This promotes an analysis which fails to address the particular vulnerabilities of children and their role as social actors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Family violence research and practice is generally fragmented according to the type of violence and the identity of the victim and perpetrator but the few small studies that have been undertaken suggest that a number of forms of violence may occur simultaneously in the same family. An exploratory study of twenty child abusive families found that each family was involved in at least one other violent activity, as well as (with only one exception) more than one type of child abuse. The violence was directed by adults and children towards self, adults, children, and/or the community. It is suggested that failure to take all violence into account may have hindered theory development. It is also proposed that there may be serious implications for intervention in child abuse in that the child protection worker may underestimate the danger to, and other effects on, the child.",

      "abstract": "The following three devices were used with a sample of 226 children: (1) The 'Ideal Person' Test, where the child names the person he would most wish to be like and gives reasons for his choice; (2) The 'Moral Wickedness' Test, where the subject describes what he considers to be the most 'wicked' deeds; (3) The 'Moral Incidents' Test, where ten hypothetical situations, involving honesty, loyalty, responsibility and punishment, are presented together with alternative methods of meeting them. The results were analysed in relation to sex and intelligence as assessed by the Stanford‐Binet Scale. The majority of children chose as their ideal characters personally unknown to them. Both sexes tended to choose male figures but boys mentioned a relatively greater proportion of characters associated with war, adventure, politics and sport, whereas girls chose a higher proportion of people distinguished because of moral or religious qualities. Less able children more often named as their ideal someone from their immediate circle of relatives or friends and gave fewer reasons for their choice than the more intelligent group. The most frequently mentioned 'wicked deeds' were murder, physical cruelty, stealing and cruelty to animals. Though the sexes showed considerable unanimity in their list of wicked actions, a higher proportion of girls than boys considered stealing, cruelty to animals, lying and swearing to be wicked. The most intelligent group produced a greater number and variety of morally wicked actions. The findings from the 'Moral Incidents' Test suggest that straightforward moral issues are readily understood by children but that the duller child's moral judgment is prone to become confused or blurred in the face of complexity or subtlety.",

The emphasis is then no longer placed only on the formal traits of the test, but also specific aspects of the content are included. Particularly the human content is seen as reflecting qualities of the patient's object relationships. The incomplete differentiation between self and object may manifest itself in the test both as wishes for and as fear of fusion with the object.

      "abstract": "In cases where it is alleged that an offence is perpetrated by a gang, but where there is no definitive, eye-witness evidence of involvement, the prosecution’s case often rests upon the presumption that a person, by dint of their prior association with ‘known gang members’, and hence their understanding of and commitment to the aims, purposes and modus operandi of the gang, is engaged in a ‘joint enterprise’ to perpetrate that offence. The charge of joint enterprise is often supported by a submission of evidence of the defendant’s ‘previous bad character’. However, because of the lack of any generally agreed definition of gang involvement, the complex patterns of association in gang-affected neighbourhoods, the sometimes questionable relevance of the evidence deployed to support a submission of previous ‘bad character’ and the fact that the alleged perpetrators are not infrequently subject to some degree of implicit or explicit coercion or duress, establishing the defendant’s actual culpability is fraught with difficulty and there is, therefore an ever-present danger of injustice. In this article I explore the patterns of association between young people in gang affected neighbourhoods and the ways in which the law and policing practice understands, and sometimes misunderstands these relationships. I then suggest a set of definitions which could help to clarify the actual nature and degree of an individual’s association with a youth gang.",

      "abstract": "Sending young children to boarding school may be considered a particularly British form of child abuse and social control. The trauma of the rupture with home may be followed by other ordeals such as emotional deprivation and, in extreme cases, physical and sexual abuse. The taboo on expressing emotion, which is common in such institutions, may lead to an encapsulation of the self. Consequently, the needs of the distressed child/self remain active, but unconscious, within the adult. This maybe disguised by an armoured, and very often socially successful, persona. The psychological interplay, between these two facets of the personality, may be detrimental to intimate relationships. In clinical practice the emotional conflict between a desire for intimacy and anticipated exile comes to the fore. Three examples demonstrate how within the transference this may lead to a dependent and erotic atmosphere, which abruptly changes to sever all connection. Changes in the frame, breaks in analysis, and confessions of emotional need are all points at which vigilance is required if such disturbance in analysis is not to end in its abrupt termination.",

      "abstract": "This is a brief review of the normal changes in adolescent behaviour and the interplay between biology and social factors that occur at and around puberty, in an attempt to explain when this transition may become problematic The onset of puberty is a biological marker for an individual's transition from a non-reproductive to a reproductive state. Adolescence is a normal developmental transition associated with clearly visible physical changes, reorganization and pruning of neuronal circuits in the brain and the occurrence of new behaviours and interests. It is a time when new life tasks (orientation towards peers of the other sex, romantic and sexual involvement and mastering an educational career) need to be mastered. Parent-child conflict increases and becomes more intense as the adolescent struggles for more independence while still requiring support. These normal changes can become problematic if biological and social expectations diverge e.g. entering puberty very early or very late. While early pubertal onset in boys is likely to have beneficial effects, in girls precocious pubertal timing may have a negative impact on body-image, affect (or emotional well-being) and sex-role expectations. Other individual biological predispositions and genetic endowment may interact with social factors (e.g. peers, parenting style, neighbourhood) making adolescence either an adaptive or a challenging transition. There is a lack of sufficiently large longitudinal studies that have been able to study this interaction between genetics, biology and social environment on adolescent development. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of pubertal timing on social behaviour. Planned assessments and concepts are outlined.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Homosexuality has a central place in the history and development of psychoanalysis. Freud correctly identified‘difference’ as a starting place for an investigation into the dynamics of sexuality. Unwittingly he also instigated thinking that raised, among some analysts, a desire for curative action. The absence of insights from the countertransference debate influenced psychoanalytic thinking for a period, obscured the benefits that might accrue from the analyst's recognition of his intrinsic bisexuality and, more recently, fuelled a popular reaction which argues that homosexuality is not a matter for psychoanalytic investigation but a healthy extension of the personality. The profession similarly has been divided. This paper contends that homosexuality should remain an area for psychoanalytic consideration. There are transference and countertransference issues to examine that include shame, disgust, anger and revenge. While such emotions and reactions are not unique to the area of homosexuality they may lead to particularly destructive effects if left unobserved in our work and in ourselves.",

Disability growth areas include diagnostic categories such as depression, anxiety disorders, anorexia, cancers, traumatic brain injuries, attention deficit disorder, autoimmune disease, spinal cord injuries, autistic spectrum disabilities and dementia. Yet disability, like any challenge or limitation, is fundamental to being human, a part of every life. Becoming disabled demands learning how to live effectively as a person with disabilities, not just living as a disabled person trying to become nondisabled. It also demands the awareness and cooperation of others who don't experience these challenges. Becoming disabled means moving from isolation to community, from ignorance to knowledge about who they are, from exclusion to access, and from shame to pride.",

In other words, the alcoholic family not only has lower cohesive power of the family, lower life satisfaction and family functioning than a normal family, showing a dysfunctional type of communication prominently, but also having strict rules and rolls. As drinking is getting more chrome, the higher family raise the rate of getting in such codependency symptoms as derual, low self respect, feel of guilty, depression, uneasiness, and chaos etc. A dependent of the codependency makes features of a dishonesty, an anger, a hostile feeling, an adjuslment, a perfectionism, and a dependency.

In addition, he Jays emphasis on meeting requirement of the alcoholic prior to the acknowledgement and fulfillment of self aspiration. So he feels an uneasiness at the threat of breaking a symbiotic interdependency relation. as well as having a fear of wrong self loss made in symbiotic relationship. For this reason, the codependent among members of the family have a deep feeling of rejection, uneasiness, or fear. The children of the alcoholic with a symptom of excessive responsibility tend to be good at their study, while those making slow and showing a symptom of fitnessism have features of bad at the study, frequent late for school, and late submitting the homework Some of them also have features showing a symptom of creating a good atmosphere and solving all the problems properly.

I argue that as well as, and partly because of, their emotional deficiencies, psychopaths suffer a severe deficit of empathy, either from birth or brought on by abuse or neglect in childhood. Based on evidence from developmental psychology, I argue that empathy plays a central role in the way we come to ascribe value to entities other than ourselves. Lacking this crucial developmental stage, psychopaths reach adulthood without the capacity to see others as valuable. Because they lack this capacity due to factors which they cannot be expected to change, they are not morally responsible for lacking it. They are therefore not morally responsible for the failure to respond to certain reasons which stems from this lack. Finally, I consider other disorders of low empathy, specifically autism spectrum disorder and borderline personality disorder, and give an account of why these conditions do not apparently lead to the same outcomes in respect of the ability to value others.",

In the former point of view one may direct his attention solely to the violence being identified with crimes. One may attempt to list up violence cases and a variety of punishments imposed upon them. The punishments will disclose the specific values underlying the indigenous ways of thinking and behaving as well as certain specific conditions in the society. One may, however, be likely to devote oneself to a mere classification and a description of the crimes and punishments and will not go further to analize their causes. Another may have a slightly flexible point of view and study violence in connection with social maladaptation. Those who deviated from the social norms or failed to be successful or prosperous in their work tend to be frustrated and are inclined to burst into irrational conducts. In this view one interrelates social deviation and mental depression with the causes of violence cases. One may pose a positive assessment of violence. Any sporadic and individual exercise of physical force may be identified with an offence. The organized use of it, however, comes to be a socially recognized act. Few can deny the usefulness of such physical forces as police and army in the maintenance of social conformity and solidarity. Their existence and activities are never de-",

Many adolescent girls are insufficiently informed about the mechanisms of reproduction or the techniques of birth control and first come to medical attention or consult a family planning center when already pregnant. However, among those teenagers who do become pregnant or even experience motherhood at an age when society would rather see them on school benches, some are neither ignorant about sexuality nor the victims of an unpredictable failure. For those, contraception and the desire for pregnancy or motherhood are in conflict with one another and is only further aggravated by various sociocultural and psychosocial factors. All too often, such a conflict results in a voluntarily ignored or unconsciously rejected contraception option, with an unplanned pregnancy as the outcome.",

As hypothesized, all master status Ss were particularly likely to be mindful in social interactions; they recalled detailed information about the situation and often took their partner's perspective during the interaction. The positive or negative connotations of the master status conditions were irrelevant in predicting Ss cognitions (mindfulness) but were critical in determining Ss behaviors (interaction strategies).",

      "abstract": "Seeking food is a profound inherent drive found in all living organisms to ensure proper functioning of their biological systems. Adequate coexistence of hunger and satiety brings health and wellbeing and inadequacy in food intake can threaten the health and survival. Eating behavior is a complex phenomenon compounded by interplay of central nervous system, endocrine and gastrointestinal systems linked with numerous neural pathways [1]. To put anything in mouth is a discernible human behavior and governed by hunger, hormones, emotions, and desires. Numerous life events may claw the normal eating behavior leading to aberrant eating pattern, if prolonged can result in Eating Disorders (ED). Anorexia nervosa, bulimia or binge eating are common eating disorders which affects millions of people of all ages, men, women particularly teenage girls. Major causes of ED were associated with physical and emotional destructions due to psychological and socio-cultural factors. New researches are indicating its link with genetic and neurochemical pursuits. In most cases of anorexia, the victims have high self-image and want to protect oneself from body shaming. ED victims are often entrapped in fancy images of their bodies in social and media circles and are either unaware or refuse to accept their problem and its adverse consequences. ED is a manifestation of anxiety and trauma of self-image stirring to the extent of hospitalization and fatal stage.",

      "title": "It Isn’t Just Them",
      "abstract": "It Isn’t Just Them Kathryn Lofton51 For some time I thought about the problem of sex abuse by clergy as a historian of religion and as a person who grew intellectually through reading queer and feminist theory. But over the last several years I have increasingly considered such abuses in the context of ongoing revelations about misconduct in higher education. When I was thinking intensely about sex abuse in the lead-up to a conference, “Sex Abuse and the Study of Religion,” that I hosted with Robert Orsi and Terence McKiernan at Yale in September 2011, I came across this description of the web of emotions that occurs in sexually abusive relationships from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: The child of five or older who knows and cares for the abuser becomes trapped between affection or loyalty for the person, and the sense that the sexual activities are terribly wrong. If the child tries to break away from the sexual relationship, the abuser may threaten the child with violence or loss of love. When sexual abuse occurs within the family, the child may fear the anger, jealousy or shame of other family members, or be afraid the family will break up if the secret is told.52 Within the documentary materials available, this standardized profile of abuse is rendered relentlessly specific to Catholicism. Sexual abuse is a practice within an existent relational dynamic, one that simultaneously transforms and calcifies the hierarchies and codes that determined the original affiliation. For me it would be absurd to talk about Roman Catholic sex abuse in today’s context without also thinking about what learning about it can help us understand about the hierarchical spaces in which scholars spend so much of our time. If abuse is a ritual practice of hierarchy, then it might be inevitable that institutions—academic and Roman [End Page 26] Catholic—include significant abuse. Consider the above description from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Note how it described that the child becomes trapped between affection for their abuser and recognition of the wrong they make; how they know what they are doing is wrong, but they can’t break from that wrong abuse because they might then experience other repercussions, including, most chillingly, loss of love. How many situations of abuse in the academy occur on the exact same terms? That the abused person needs the relationship, needs that bad love, they think, more than the freedom from it. Why? Because if they say what is happening is wrong, they don’t just destroy this particular relationship. As is written: “When sexual abuse occurs within the family, the child may fear the anger, jealousy or shame of other family members, or be afraid the family will break up if the secret is told.” Nobody wants to break up with love—the love of a caretaker, the love of knowledge. Even more: nobody wants to break up with the container in which the love is transferred: the family, the church, or the university. What if the secret of the academy is told? To tell the truth of one abuse of power is to show the abuse of power that suffuses the whole system. Because while every story is particular, every individual faculty member or student singular, the refrain once told is not: “I was afraid to tell the truth. I worried that I wouldn’t get a good letter of recommendation. I worried I wouldn’t get a job.” We are silent because the system keeps us in it by our desire to stay in it, to keep it, to keep open the possibility that we could become a part of it. I need the family, I need this job; I need these more than I need my security from the harm they do me. This is a very, very hard problem to solve. Our love of learning, and of the institutions that facilitate our learning, is a tender thing. We want to stay in it: to be in that place. We want to be in it—we will lie to keep ourselves in it. We will cover up the pain it...",

      "abstract": "Comparing surveys from successive periods demonstrates that elderly people now enjoy a better and more varied sexual life than previous generations. The proportion of older people who remain sexually active has significantly increased, and the practices of masturbation or oral sex have spread considerably. The generation effect has an incidence upon sexual behaviour: older people's repertoire of sexual practices differs from that of younger people, in the sense that it focuses less on sexual intercourse and oral sex. Women and men, beyond the common trends towards sexuality characterised by a more open repertoire of sexual practices, differ in terms of sexual interest and subjective sexual wellbeing. The cessation of sexual activity by individuals who had previously been sexually active is often the result of a cascade of reactions, such as the occurrence of a sexual dysfunction in one or both partners, anticipation of failure, increased anxiety, lack of adaptation of sexuality and/or avoidance behaviour.",

Others, leading to divorce. The purpose of this study is to analyze the management of the communication process between married couples in early marriage, when there are contradictions in the different forms of communication that occur in everyday household life with the aim of maintaining and maintaining the commitments that have been built. This research is a descriptive study using relational dialectical theory, commitment theory, and naturalistic paradigm. The data collection technique used by the researcher is indepth interviews. The results of the study prove that early marriage couples who marry with various backgrounds experience relational dialectical contradictions due to different forms of communication. The three pairs experience three main contradictions in relational dialectics, namely integration and separation, stability and change, and expression and non-expression. In managing different forms of communication, the three early married couples feel that age affects them to overcome prestige, influences to listen to their partner's opinions and requires the intervention of others. However, this can be done by taking a special time that is fun so that the couple can express their feelings to each other and understand each other in a relaxed atmosphere.",

      "abstract": "A large number of couples who end up their reproductive career with only one child presents a serious problem for demographic trends of a region in which they reside. A question rarely posed is what kind of consequences that phenomenon has for a family climate and family dynamics of those families. An even more important question is what kind of consequences the same phenomenon has for personality development of a child who grows up as a single child. What kind of characteristics and what personality traits are more likely to develop in a child that grows without his/her siblings? The results of our research show that single children get better results on the tasks that require recognition of one?s own emotional states and motives of one?s own behavior than first born and second born children. However, single children score less favorably than first or second born on the tasks that require forecasting other people?s behavior. The explanation for this may be that single children are self-centered due to the lack of interaction with siblings. Other possible explanation may be a specific parenting style that a single child receives from his/her parents. This parenting style is uniquely different from parenting style that a second or third born child receives due to the unique situation created by the fact that he/she is a single child.",

      "abstract": "The present research featured the speech tactics of compliment and response to compliments in young interlocutors. The speech tactics of compliment usually depend on the following factors: communicative goal, communicative situation, speaker’s attitude, gender roles, cultural impact, etc. Depending on the communicative situation, the most frequent speech tactics were: to raise the mood of the recipient, to support them, to show one’s approval, or just because it was appropriate. Young female respondents were able to mention much more situations when they usually make compliments than male respondents. Depending on the communicative objective, young women much more often made compliments about one’s appearance, something they liked, or one’s character. The impact of Russian culture seems to be in the following opinion voiced by the respondents: compliments must be genuine, so they usually give compliments only to family and friends. There are different speech tactics of compliment responses: acceptance, acceptance with a comment / joke / reciprocal compliment, self-glorification, ignoring, etc. In an official situation where the interlocutors had equal status, the young men chose to answer with a joke / comment, to ignore the compliment, or used the tactic of self-glorification. The female respondents used such speech tactics as acceptance, acceptance with a comment, a reciprocal compliment, or a joke. While talking to male strangers in an official situation, the young men used the tactic of acceptance with a comment or ignored the compliment, while the young women tended to accept the compliment, answer with a joke, or use self-glorification tactic. When the young men were talking to a woman-stranger, they ignored the compliment, whereas the young women accepted it, answered with a joke, used selfglorification, or returned the compliment. In an informal situation, the young men ignored the compliment, demonstrated self-glorification, accepted the comment, or answered with a joke; the young women preferred acceptance with or without a comment or a joke, self-glorification, or a reciprocal compliment.",

      "abstract": "All over the world young people are stigmatised and discriminated against in relation to their sexual and reproductive health. Stigma discrimination and the violation of human rights are intimately connected reinforcing and legitimising each other. Their manifestations are varied occurring in families and communities in health services at places of work and in schools. Across a range of settings young people may be stigmatised and discriminated against for being sexually active before marriage or for engaging in forms of sexuality which are considered by their communities and wider society to be non-normative such as homosexual or transgendered practices. In addition in settings where premarital sexual activity among young people is stigmatised the signs of unprotected sexual activity such as unplanned pregnancy having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or being HIV-positive may themselves be highly stigmatised. This may seriously limit access to good quality sexual and reproductive health services. This stigmatisation of young people’s sexuality and sexual behaviour has serious consequences. In particular it can lead to young people feeling that they have to conceal their sexual activity from significant adults in their lives including parents teachers and health workers. The secrecy and shame that stigma often brings can deny young people access to the resources they need in order to make and implement informed decisions about their sexuality and sexual health. Where resources are available - or inappropriately framed - they may be inadequate to address young people’s needs. (excerpt)",

Parent loss and other traumatic overstimulating, abusive experiences in childhood, whether sexual or physical, are risk factors leading to vertical splitting in the ego that in turn gives rise to clinically observable splits in identity. In the psychoanalytic literature, the term identity was first used by Tausk in referring to the newborn's primary or innate narcissism associated with finding pleasure in its own body. Kernberg investigated the role of the superego in identity formation and its deterioration under group pressures as they are applied to young adult psychoanalytic candidates and graduates alike. Sexual and gender identity are not internally determined alone, since there are powerful stimuli in the infant's and child's environment that strongly influence the outcome of gender identity. People to whom the term identity diffusions applies have not settled on either vocational or ideological goals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The development of autocratic leaders in history reveals that many share severe character disorders that are consistently similar across borders and cultures. Diplomats and humanitarians negotiating for access to populations in-need and security of their programs, especially in health, must understand the limitations placed on the traditional negotiation process. These shared character traits stem from a cognitive and emotional developmental arrest in both childhood and adolescence resulting in fixed, life-long, concrete thinking patterns. They fail to attain the last stage of mental and emotional development, that of abstract thinking, which is necessary for critical reasoning that allows one to consider the broader significance of ideas and information rather than depend on concrete details and impulses alone. These autocratic leaders have limited capacity for empathy, love, guilt, or anxiety that become developmentally permanent and guide everyday decision making. Character or personality traits that perpetuate the lives of autocratic leaders are further distinguished by sociopathic and narcissistic behaviors that self-serve to cover their constant fear of insecurity and the insatiable need for power. Human rights, humanitarian care, and population-based health security are examples of what has consistently been sacrificed under autocratic rule. Today, with the worst global loss of democratic leadership ever seen since WWII, leaders with these character traits now rule in major countries of the world. While history teaches us of battles and conflicts that result from such flawed leadership, it lacks explanations of why autocratic behaviors consistently emerge and dominate many societies. Building multidisciplinary capacity and capability in societies among democracies to limit or cease such authoritarian dominance first begins with a developmental understanding of why autocrats exist and persist in externalizing their pathological behaviors on unsuspecting and vulnerable populations, and the limitations they place on negotiations. “…once in power, a leader with an Antisocial Personality Disorder thrives on continuing conflict and never seeks peace.” Daedalus Trust, London, 2016 Burkle FM Jr. Character disorders among autocratic world leaders and the impact on health security, human rights, and humanitarian care .

The case of si-nais (housewives) in Hong Kong shows that we can never assume that married women (or any social category) are privileged by virtue of their status on the sexual hierarchy. The blessings of social respectability apparently enjoyed by these women may work to enable or hinder women's expression of their erotic desires and sexual fulfilment, depending on their special social circumstances. These women's imagination and experience of good sex is composed of a multitude of components. Women may feel good because they can achieve other psychological and social aims that are important in their lives (which could be related to the maintenance of marriage or the peace of the family). Women may feel good because of the erotic satisfaction that they derive from different pursuits including interests, leisure or other intimate relationships, rather than sexual fulfilment in terms of orgasm or physical pleasure. Women may reformulate their pleasures variously at different stages of their lives. Social respectability, orgasm, emotional intimacy, or any other specific elements, may all enter or leave the formula for good sex.",

      "title": "\"Elderly” as vulnerable: Rethinking the nature of individual and societal responsibility",
      "abstract": "The vulnerability of our embodied beings and the messy dependency that often comes in the wake of physical or psychological needs cannot be ignored throughout any individual life and must be central to theories about what constitutes a just and responsive state. The concept of vulnerability reflects the fact that we all are born, live, and die within a fragile materiality that renders all of us constantly susceptible to destructive external forces and internal disintegration. Vulnerability should not be equated with harm any more than age inevitably means loss of capacity. Properly understood, vulnerability is generative and presents opportunities for innovation and growth, as well as creativity and fulfillment. Human beings are vulnerable because as embodied and vulnerable beings, we experience feelings such as love, respect, curiosity, amusement, and desire that make us reach out to others, form relationships, and build institutions. Both the negative and the positive possibilities inherent in vulnerability recognize the inescapable interrelationship and interdependence that mark human existence.",

      "abstract": "Grief is a universal reaction to loss. Losses are often associated to the death of a loved one, however, they may also originate from the end of an intimate partner relationship. Whereas studies have focused on grief after a divorce or on symptomology students endure after a death, this article attends to the understudied college student experience of grief following a breakup. Within emerging adulthood, the loss of a close romantic relationship may be challenging to navigate alongside the daily stressors of college. Stigmatization by means of social cues convey sentiments, such as the need to get over an ex-partner, which in turn can lead to disenfranchised grief where individuals do not feel heard, accepted, or valid in their experience of grief. It was hypothesized that as endorsed closeness of the past relationship increases so does grief intensity, and that as feelings of stigmatization increase also increases grief intensity. Multiple regression models supported the main effects, although the interaction effect between levels of closeness and perceived stigmatization was not supported. Implications and future directions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper puts forward the following claims: (i) The size of inequality in welfare should be distinguished from its badness. (ii) The size of a pairwise inequality between two individuals can be measured by the absolute or the relative welfare distance between their welfare levels, but it does not depend on the welfare levels of other individuals. (iii) The size of inequality in a social state may be understood either as the degree of pairwise inequality or as its amount. (iv) The badness of a pairwise inequality may differ from its size in several ways; for example, the badness measure might go by the distance between priority‐transformed welfare levels and/or it might assign heavier weight to larger distances. (v) The badness of a pairwise inequality may be either personal or impersonal, with the personal interpretation being internally consistent and, pace Temkin, independently tenable even if we reject the so‐called Slogan (i.e., the Person‐Affecting Claim). (vi) The aggregation procedure by which we arrive from the badness of pairwise inequalities to the badness of the inequality in a social state takes different forms depending on whether the badness of a pairwise inequality is interpreted in a personal or in an impersonal way. (vii) Since Temkin's complaint‐based measures of the badness of inequality follow the format appropriate for the personal interpretation, they seem out of place if one, like him, treats the badness of inequality as an impersonal value.",

      "abstract": "My thesis seeks to reduce what may be a natural human antipathy to ageing and/or the elderly by working with one distinctive and consistently approved feature of some older people. This feature is a bold and cheerful struggle within a self‐chosen project. The argument opens by distinguishing short‐term gratification from lasting, fulfilling happiness, and showing the link between gratification and dependence. Three kinds of struggle (non‐voluntary, part‐voluntary and positive) are then outlined and exemplified. Gerontological and anthropological research suggest that attitudes to struggle are fixed early in life, and while in the past they mitigated for or against successful survival, they now influence happiness and coping in later life. I argue that the negative effects of the first two kinds of struggle ‐ which are often misguided, grudging or ‘no‐win’ struggles ‐ are responsible for the rigidity, narcissism and resentment disliked in some older people. Self‐respect, contrasted with self‐righteousness, is shown to accrue only from the positive (voluntary and congenial) struggle that seems at any age to deflect or compensate for depression, disappointment, loneliness and illness.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Dimensions of Family Violence",
      "abstract": "The common dictionary definition of violence states that this term encompasses the exertion of physical force so as to injure or abuse someone else. The inclusion of “abuse” in the definition is important, because it opens up the issues of force being used to induce negative psychological states and to violate basic human dignity and rights. One type of violence that has received increased attention in recent years is family violence, a deviant or delinquent behavior for which statistics are difficult to compile because it is so heavily underreported. The issue of family violence is an important area of public, political, and academic concern that goes to the heart of the institution of the family and marriage. At the individual level, it involves personal negative attitudes and aggressive behaviors as well as physical and emotional prejudices. There are a number of well-documented predictive factors of family violence, most of them psychological. Several forms of the family violencebased victimization have been described. Direct (as victim) or indirect (as eyewitness) exposure to family violence can have a significant psychological impact on children and adults during their development. For example, infants, school-age children and adolescents who witness violence in their homes are more vulnerable to excessive irritability, immature behaviors, sleep disturbances, emotional distress, fears of being alone, and developmental regression. This paper briefly analyses the causes, types and consequences of family violence.",

Such advances, however, raise a complex cluster of ethical questions that should increasingly concern us in the future as these technologies become more prevalent, powerful, and wide ranging in their effects. Most ethical dilemmas and debates about enhanced cog- nition seem to focus on our relation to others. These ethical controversies typically concern two kinds of issues. The fi rst is whether our enhanced knowledge about others may be unethically used to limit their freedom, which would not be so limited if our cognition was not thus enhanced. An example of this issue would be whether enhanced biological knowl- edge of an individual's physiological or psychological predisposition to violence should be used to limit that person's access to fi rearms or to cer- tain professions, even if that person has not yet displayed any excessive or disturbing violence in actual behavior. The second kind of ethical prob- lem case, which seems more a matter of fairness than freedom, relates to whether the enhanced cognition that an individual (or group) achieves provides an unfair advantage over others in the competitive situations",

      "title": "Facial expression of pain, empathy, evolution, and social learning",
      "abstract": "The experience of pain appears to be associated, from early infancy and across pain stimuli, with a consistent facial expression in humans. A social function is proposed for this: the communication of pain and the need for help to observers, to whom information about danger is of value, and who may provide help within a kin or cooperative relationship. Some commentators have asserted that the evidence is insufficient to account for the consistency of the face, as judged by technical means or in the perceptions of observers, or that facial expression is epiphenomenal to a gross behavioural defensive response to pain. The major criticism is that it is unnecessary to invoke evolutionary mechanisms beyond the emergence of an unconditioned facial response to pain in neonates, subsequently shaped and maintained by instrumental and social reinforcement throughout life. These criticisms are addressed, acknowledging the need for further data to address some, and elaborating the areas in which evolutionary and operant mechanisms would predict different behavioural interactions, rather than acting synergistically. Several supportive commentaries propose extending evolutionarily-based hypotheses to sex differences, the complexities of others' responses within the social relationship, and the role of empathy. A number of commentators provided valuable suggestions for experimental paradigms or methodological issues. Overall, addressing these issues indicates the need for further conceptual development and for collection of data specifically in relation to these hypotheses.",

Also virtually all theories of depression assert that faulty parent-child relationships play a major role in the aetiology of this disorder. According these theoretical formulations familial risk factors have been the focus of most research on depression in adolescence. Several studies have shown that insecure attachment and parenting characterized by coldness, rejection, harsh discipline and unsupportive behaviour is positively related to adolescent depressive symptoms. Some research indicates that authoritative parenting, conceptualized as a composite of warmth, accept-involvement, firm control, and democratic discipline, is associated with the least depressive symptoms among adolescents. Pathogenetic factors within the family environment, such as parental depression, changes of family structure, violence or neglect, can also contribute to depression in adolescence. A causal relationship between anomalous parenting and depression is probably the interplay among genetic, cognitive, emotional, interpersonal and family environmental factors.",

      "abstract": "Christian scriptures point to human beings’ ordinary romantic and familial relationships and experiences as likely irreplaceable pathways for glimpsing foundational beliefs about the identity of God, his love for humanity, and how human beings are to love him and one another. In other words, sex, marriage and parenting are an inextricable part of the language of Christian belief, and the very “architecture” of the faith.Given this conviction about the role played by familial and romantic relations in the understanding and transmission of faith, Christian parents are alarmed to witness widespread repudiation of their familial norms. Sometimes this occurs in the confines of courses regularly denominated “sex-education or “health” or “family life” education, but sometimes it occurs elsewhere in the program of education.This paper will not address the material offered within sex-ed courses, given that these are regularly subject to parental opt-ins or opt-outs. It will also not evaluate age-appropriate communications touching upon sex, marriage or parenting that have as their object the presentation of historic or scientific or other factual material, or which are designed to promote kindness toward, and prevent bullying of, students who identify as sexual minorities or come from families identifying similarly. These not only pose no threat to religious liberty in a Christian vein, but overlap its aims. Instead it will consider state-sponsored proselytizing about familial topics that also possess religious content, which happens outside the confines of classes subject to parental options.The Supreme Court has not weighed in on the precise question of parents’ rights to object to particular educational content in public schools, save school prayer, but has spoken to parents’ First Amendment Free Exercise and Fourteenth Amendment custodial rights respecting their children’s education. But lower federal courts have considered particular material concerning sex, marriage and parenting that is presented outside of sex-education courses; employing a variety of rationales, they have nearly universally held that parents who send children to public schools are subject to state decisionmaking about educational content. Current cases employ numerous rationales to reach their nearly univocal conclusion.Given what is at stake, it is important to closely scrutinize these rationales. Close scrutiny reveals numerous weaknesses. I conclude that lower court opinions are getting very wrong the balance of authority between parents and schools, using arguments bordering on the duplicitous concerning matters such as the degree of state coercion, the practicability of avoiding it, and how to advance tolerance and health among students. They also poorly analyze how much promise the Supreme Court’s existing parental rights’ decisions hold for vindicating parents’ constitutional free exercise and custodial rights, and the presence of less restrictive means for the state to advance its important interests in boosting tolerance and health among students. Finally, they ignore the promise that a religious anthropology holds for promoting these goods.",

Overall levels of religious devotion or belief in God did not directly predict cheating.

Four groups of psychological difficulties were identified that impede the successful adaptation of women, as well as the clinical manifestations associated with these difficulties: women&amp;rsquo;s expectations regarding interaction with society do not coincide with society&amp;rsquo;s expectations which contributes to the emergence of frustration and deprivation; the predominance of external motivation when moving to another country (following a husband) results in loss of work and familiar environment which often leads to depression and/or somatization; the predominance of compelled contacts in the structure of communication causes an increased irritability; self-image as a migrant before the move does not coincide with real self-image in a new country generates intrapersonal conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;",

However it occurs often in dynamically developing firms that ethical norms are not kept and this process is observed by lack of equal chances to get a job  people without connections remain without work. Due to different research the very serious problem is a phenomena of mobbing. Psychological terror or mobbing in working life involves hostile and unethical communication which is directed in a systematic manner by one or more individuals, mainly toward one individual, who, due to mobbing, is pushed into a helpless and defenseless position and held there by means of continuing mobbing activities. These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months´ duration). Because of the high frequency and long duration of hostile behavior, this maltreatment results in considerable mental, psychosomatic and social misery.",

      "abstract": "Gender variance is an umbrella term describing behaviours, interests, appearance, expression, or an identity of persons who do not conform to culturally defined norms expected of their natal gender [1].There are additional experiences of discomfort with their biological sex, primary and secondary sex characteristics and social gender roles.Resultantly, they experience various levels of distress, from depressive moods, anxiety, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, intra-psychical conflicts to suicidal ideation and psychotic breakdowns.The last decade has witnessed a significant rise in gender variant persons looking for care at gender clinics across the world.The LGBTQ+ population is also referred to as gender variant persons.Increasing psycho-social awareness, sociopolitical initiatives in support, social media empowerment, globalisation through the information world, greater receptivity by the family members and peers with regard to one's gender identity crisis and media appearances of LGBTQ+ individuals have encouraged a lot of individuals to come out about their sexuality.In accordance, some individuals may choose to undergo 'transition' in order to comply with the gender they (psycho-socially) identify with.Transitioning is a process of changing one's gender presentation in order to align it with their internal sense of gender identity.Transitioning may happen socially, which may involve using a different name, pronouns, transformation of physical appearance, use of suitable bathrooms, and taking social roles of the affirmed gender.However, transitioning may also be medical where the individual may choose to undergo hormonal and medical surgeries.More transitions happen from male to female (MTF) than from female to male (FTM)-transgenders are MTF transsexuals [2].The challenge of accessing mental health care for the LGBTQ+ community has remained as a doubled edged sword given their non-conforming gender identities and stigma towards mental health.The incidence of mental health problems among the LGBTQ+ is noted to be 2-3 folds higher than their heterosexual counterparts.Within the gender variance, there are some subpopulations that face greater challenges than the other.Lesbians and transgender communities are said to face 2-fold greater risk for mental health problems within the community [3].Some of the common mental health problems seen among the LGBTQ+ persons are: depression, anxiety, suicidality, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, eating disorder.Additional socio-cultural barriers present as low self-esteem, low confidence, body image issues, social ostracization, homelessness, forced prostitution, poverty and interpersonal relationship violence [4].Formulation of public health policies directed to the group, implications of gender issues, the structuring of health services, and performance of professionals, directly interfere with access of and guarantee the right to health of the LGBTQ+ population [5].Though the governments have taken some active steps for the wellbeing for the community, the similar fails to reflect in implementation and the discriminatory divide persists.There are various challenges that",

While a number of significant correlations were noted between these measures for all Ss, marked sex differences were found. Social constriction and assertion were related negatively for females, but unrelated for males. Similarly, social constriction was related to suspicion in females, but not males. With respect to factors of openness to experience, assertion was related positively to receptiveness to unconventional views of reality, openness to hypothetical or theoretical ideas, aesthetic sensitivity, and general openness for females only. For males, negativism and irritability were related positively to loosely defined ego boundaries and related negatively to deliberate systematic thought, while suspicion and guilt were related positively to systematic thought. For females, resentment, indirect hostility, and total hostility correlated with access to unconscious processes. Physical assault was associated with assertion, access to unconscious processes, openness to unconventional views of reality, and general openness for females, but not for males.",

Although ED can exist for only psychogenic reasons, organic ED is almost always associated with some degree of psychogenic dysfunction; thus, nonpsychogenic ED is actually mixed. In the past, when the principal treatment for ED was penile prosthesis implantation, the distinction between psychogenic and organic or mixed ED was of considerable importance. Since many of today's treatment options are nonsurgical, this distinction is less critical. For men who are contemplating surgical treatment, such as penile prosthesis implantation, however, it is still desirable to exclude temporary or potentially reversible forms of erectile impairment, such as psychogenic ED. Erectile dysfunction must also be distinguished from other sexual disorders, such as decreased libido, premature or retarded ejaculation, painful erections or orgasm, and erectile deformity. Of course, any of these disorders may coexist.",

      "abstract": "The central premise of this paper is that a significant amount of sex offending stems from unusual or inappropriate sexual preferences that appear in early adolescence, are relatively stable, and immutable. In other words, they are like the more ordinary sexual preferences with which we are familiar. As such, they generate sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals will be strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them will be unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct in not trusting the individuals with such preferences and thus in attempting to monitor or control them. However, most efforts to do so appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome. The possibility of voluntary castration for such offenders, in lieu of preventive detention or other more restrictive measures, is explored.",

      "abstract": "Once considered a mental illness, homosexuality is now viewed as a normal but less frequent variation of human sexual and affectional expression. In looking at homosexuality from a nonpathological point of view, sexual orientation itself is now better understood; new concepts and ideas are still evolving. The biological and genetic contributions to sexual orientation, as well as the societal and psychological forces associated with the development of a particular sexual orientation, are being studied more systematically. Psychological and emotional problems for gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may arise from the recognition, acceptance, and adjustment to a sexual orientation that is different from the majority. Internalized homophobia may result from the antigay bias and heterosexism common in our society. By understanding the developmental pathways for gay and bisexual people, varied and enlightened clinical approaches to working with gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals follow. Gender identity is distinct from sexual orientation. Gender identity disorder is seen in children and adults, but the diagnosis for adults is controversial. Transgender people perceive their biological sex to be the opposite of what they feel themselves to be. Psychological issues such a person may experience in the transformation from one sex to the other are described.",

This chapter focuses on three historical periods, the Classical Age, the Middle Ages, and the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to see how, although the attitude towards children and their world varies, sexual abuse has never gained the full, convinced and unequivocal approval of society, even when it has been subject to norms or informally accepted. Some have thought of defining paedophilia not as a form of perversion but as 'social corruption', as it is considered a perversion only in certain societies or historical periods, whereas in others it is an absolutely natural behaviour.",

In addition, all people suffer from control measures, even if only a few show wrongdoings. As various studies show, higher interpersonal trust ensures, among other things, for more cooperation, more prosperity, more life satisfaction, and better health. Determinants of interpersonal trust are only to a small extent personality traits. Education and cultural influences are more important. Recommendations for action to strengthen interpersonal trust are therefore aimed at the classic areas of (early childhood) education and labor market policy, which also increase trust in fellow human beings. Inclusion also counteracts distrust and cynicism. This applies dealing with diversity as well as designing inclusive growth. A general recommendation - which is empirically proven here - probably comes from the 6th century BC and from Laotse: If you don't trust, you won't be trusted. The report encourages - fact-based - to trust more.",

While several studies suggest that prosociality is an instinctive and impulsive behavior, others argue that patience and self-control are necessary to develop prosocial behaviors. Yet, prosociality and patience in children have rarely been studied jointly. Here, we measured patience (i.e. delay-of-gratification) and prosociality (i.e. giving in a dictator game to a known or unknown partner) in 250 4- to 6-year-old French schoolchildren. We found that sharing with an unknown partner was negatively linked to patience in children but observed no relationship between patience and sharing with a familiar partner. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that children are intuitively prosocial independent of strategic concerns and that patience is therefore not necessary to act prosocially during early childhood. Future studies investigating whether and why prosociality show a non-linear developmental trajectory across the lifespan are warranted.",

      "abstract": "This study examined gender differences in the level and psychological significance of discrepancy with own ideal standards versus ideal standards held by parents and close others. Women showed higher levels of discrepancy with their own ideal standards than with the inferred ideal standards of parents and close others, suggesting that women may seek congruency with others' hopes and wishes at the price of failing to attain their own aspirations. Men showed equal levels of discrepancy with their own and significant-other ideal standards. Discrepancy with own ideal standards was associated with increased dysphoria in both men and women, but discrepancy with others' ideal standards was associated with significantly elevated levels of dysphoria only in women. Beliefs that failing to meet others' standards would result in abandonment and rejection (self-other contingency beliefs) contributed independently from discrepancy in predicting dysphoria. These findings suggest that the tendency to modulate affect, self-esteem and behaviour from a relational perspective (relational self-regulation) may increase risk for psychological distress. Women may be more likely to adopt this regulatory style as a function of their socialization experiences.",

      "abstract": "There is now considerable evidence that infants are surprised when shown impossible events that violate their beliefs about objects, as indexed by reliably greater looking times at these events than at possible events that are consistent with their beliefs. Do infants also attempt, as older children and adults do, to generate explanations for these impossible events? Data from our laboratory provide intriguing hints that infants, like older children and adults, strive to reconcile what they observe with what they believe. This evidence comes from experiments in which infants were presented with an impossible and a possible event and were found not to show the typical preference for the impossible event. Five examples are presented, involving infants aged 3 to 10 months, and ranging over several facets of infants' physical reasoning. It is argued in each case that infants' failure to look preferentially at the impossible event stems from their having arrived at some explanation for the event. In some instances, infants' explanations appear to be entirely self‐produced, as when infants spontaneously posit hidden objects to make sense of otherwise impossible events. In other examples, infants' explanations appear to depend on additional clues provided, either deliberately or inadvertently, by the experimental situation. Despite these superficial differences, however, the examples are all related in suggesting that infants, like older children and adults, actively seek explanations for inconsistencies in their world.",

      "title": "Psychiatry, Morality, and Ethical Behavior",
      "abstract": "November, 2004. If there is a fundamental substrate linking the area of psychopathology with the broader world of social interaction, it might be identified as human behavior itself. In clinical psychiatry we classify human behavior as normal or abnormal, yet we know there is no sharp line differentiating the two and that the definitional conventions we use to distinguish the two are approximations at best, and at times are arbitrary. Not only is there a continuous, dimensional gradient connecting many psychiatric disorders with non-pathological behavior, but what is called normal behavior in one culture is not necessarily the same in another. Special circumstances (e.g., sleep deprivation, fear of pain, imprisonment) can also precipitate atypical behavior in certain individuals that may not be labeled abnormal given the circumstances. Other ways in which we classify human behavior include legal or illegal, mature or immature, moral or immoral, and ethical or unethical, and these concepts cross the normal/abnormal boundary with respect to ourselves and our patients alike. One urgent mandate that accompanies medical progress is to anticipate and address the consequences of our success, which can include unintended complications. Among the giant steps of medical progress in the twentieth century was the successful completion of the mapping of the human genome, for the first time making real the potential to understand the complex, polygenic nature of major mental illness. In this issue of the Journal, Appelbaum draws our attention to critical ethical issues that accompany this unfolding rush of new knowledge. Genetic screening and prenatal testing are already in place for some medical conditions, but the appropriate use of this information to guide the choices and decisions of those affected is daunting. There are strong tailwinds moving psychiatry rapidly down this genetic information highway, and Appelbaum wisely recommends that we proceed with caution. Also in this issue, Kroll and Egan call our attention to the role of the “moral emotions, “ such as guilt, shame, remorse, and regret, in motivating behavior, sometimes by first kindling emotions such as anxiety, disappointment, or frank depression. While we readily recognize absence of guilt or remorse as symptomatic of severe antisocial or narcissistic behavior, we may less often be attentive to what Kroll and Egan call “moral worry” or even the “guilt narratives” that underlie symptoms of anxiety or depression. Another important aspect of human behavior is one not often addressed on the pages of psychiatric journals. Hall et al. review the profound importance of the animal/human bond in society, not only with respect to pets (“companion animals”), but also in the caretaking responsibilities of farming, ranching, and livestock enterprises. When disaster strikes, as it did recently in the United Kingdom when the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic required the slaughter of thousands of valued animals, the scope of the stress was vast. Not only is the process itself devastating and nearly unbearable for those affected, resulting in large numbers of (mostly unappreciated) new cases of depression, acute stress syndrome, and other conditions, the sequelae in terms of loss of livelihood can be overwhelming. Disaster response planning is a challenge very much on the “front burner” these days, and this dimension of those efforts should claim a meaningful place in such plans.",

The attribution may of course be totally unfair and unjustified. Alternatively, it may be, as it were, enforced or imposed, by a kind of circular selfconfirming procedure. An easily identifiable sub-population credited with strong criminal proclivities may find it difficult to secure ordinary employment and may in fact be forced into criminal activities.

Social science at its best seeks to show a relationship among two or more variables that attributed to chance or to intervening variables. Social science may be better at showing the effects of various forces on relatively small and specially selected populations—for example, the effects of prison or childhood experiences on delinquents, or the effects of various stimuli on phobic persons.

Many of the problems posed by earlier analyses of femininity can be clarified by recognizing that before the girl \"turns\"; to the oedipal father as love object, she looks to the rapprochement father for identification. Identification is not merely an internal structure, it is a relationship in which the subject recognizes herself or himself in the other. In rapprochement, love of the father, who symbolically represents the outside world, takes the place of the practicing toddler's \"love affair with the world.\"; This identificatory love of the father, initially noticed in boys by Freud and later authors, is often frustrated by the father's absence or inability to recognize the daughter. This frustrated longing takes the penis as its symbol of likeness. The pre‐oedipal over‐inclusive phase of identification with the other sex parent is not superceded by the oedipal constellation, but is integrated with it. Thus identification becomes an important basis of the love of the other: it is not so much the opposite of object love as an important precursor and ongoing constituent of it. Case material illustrates the multiple possibilities of identificatory love and use of phallic symbolism to represent them.",

      "title": "Social Comparison by Young Children.",
      "abstract": "Social comparisons are important determinants of behavior in any culture, even cultures which are not so achievement-oriented as ours. Comparison with others is often the sole source of judgments about the adequacy or the acceptability of behavior. Frequently, standards by which to judge one's own behavior do not exist other than those provided by the actions of others. For the growing child, the problem of standardizing one's behavior is particularly difficult because standards of appropriateness change with age. At age three, the child may receive comfort and solace when he cries after arguing or fighting with a friend but, by age five, his parents may point to his older brother and exhort the child to be a little man like his brother and not cry over small disagreements; still later, the child may incur his parents' disapproval when he reports a fight with a peer and, at this point, his attention may be directed quite specifically to a brother, a sister or a peer whose social life is less besmirched by altercations. Psychologists and other students of behavior often invoke social comparison opportunities in research. For example, in studies of the effects of success and failure upon children's behavior (e.g., Mischel, Coates & Raskoff, 1968) , children's actual performance may be held constant and only the norms concerning the performance of others varied. The subjects may receive a preset series of scores but are told that good scores, scores received by most children of the subject's age, are either: a) much lower than (success) , or b) much higher than (failure) the scores the subjects actually receive. Such procedures are quite effective. The fact that success and failure are defined purely in terms of social comparison judgments, which the subjects presumably make, is seldom mentioned.",

It is not at all clear, however, that we recognize the fundamental changes in social relations that are occurring as a result. Some changes are quite positive, e.g., low cost maintenance of geographically distant but emotionally close relationships. Others can be quite negative, e.g., the lost ability to gauge emotional reactions through face-to-face contact, often resulting in unnecessarily hurtful behaviors. Preliminary data indicate that people selectively use different forms of communication under positive circumstances, e.g. to transmit good news; or negative circumstances, e.g. resolve a dispute/express anger and dependent on the nature or closeness of the relationship e.g., parent, spouse, child. We need to be mindful of the good, the bad, and the ugly of technology; and, its specific effect on the relationships of and with older people.",

      "title": "Fraternal incest or sibling sexual abuse",
      "abstract": "It is not rare, among professionals working with adolescents, to hear certain remarks directed against young people who have imposed their sexuality on others. Signifiers such as “predator,” “pedophile,” and “pervert” may be used, even though it is clinically necessary to take the time to determine what factors compelled the teenager to act, before “labeling” him/her. Based on two clinical cases, this article reflects on the “sexual act” in two of its forms, fraternal incest and sibling sexual abuse. Incest takes place in a fusional, symbiotic relationship between two people, both of whom, at least for a while, find satisfaction in it. Passion is central to it, as is the enjoyment of an exclusive relationship. In sibling abuse, on the other hand, the notions of influence over the other and omnipotence are uppermost in the mind of the perpetrator. One can hardly differentiate the two at the level of material facts and the behavior of those involved; it is only on the plane of the psychic defenses that the nuances are noticeable. We therefore propose to examine the aspects of splitting present in both cases.",

      "title": "REGRESSIVE EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR IN COLLEGE STUDENTS",
      "abstract": "To conclude, regression is a necessary step in maturation. It is commonly seen in college students and perhaps to a greater extent in them than in young people who go directly to work from high school. Ideally, it should be purposeful and contributory to the progress of the race. Necessarily it will result in unevenness of behavior, in excesses and sometimes in pathological by-products. The alienation of generations from each other which exists even within peer groups, increased living pressures and competition in the college environment are considered factors that increase frequency and duration of regression. Shifting parental roles undoubtedly complicate the identity formation of college students. The pendulum swing away from authoritarianism to permissiveness leaves the college student with a feeling of emptiness and confusion. Without religion, without parental guidance to fill the void, with a faculty too remote to help, the college student often seeks refuge in regression. We have described regression as healthy in some instances and pathological in others. When it results from fear, repression or guilt it may cause fixation at a more primitive level of adjustment and consequent lifelong neurosis or psychosis. When it represents a forward thrust, alternating with periods of consolidation or temporary regression, it serves the advance of civilization. If one sees the college student in the psychiatric office, one sees and hears an aspect of student life that is not visible to anyone else, or at least not in the same way. Yet the view of the educator, historian and anthropologist—of everyone, including the student himself—reflects an image that contributes to a composite whole. For me, regressive aspects of behavior in late adolescence appear to be a useful modus operandi of understanding the college student who so lately has come by the outward manifestations of maturity and so quickly and easily scurries back to the security of an earlier phase. Whether it is our society, our nuclear age or our pseudo-sophistication that causes this and to what extent this is a universal phenomenon of adolescence in all ages—these are questions that we should all ask but for which we should not seek simplified answers.",

SSH is very rare and many criminal justice professionals may only encounter a few, if any, stranger sexual killers (SSKs) during their careers. Some men intentionally search for and target female strangers to sexually assault and kill, others impulsively attack them during other routine activities. In relation to age, ethnicity, and employment, SSH appears typical, compared to other similar crimes. Most SSKs have previous convictions. SSH mostly occurs late at night or the early hours of the weekend, and in various locations relatively close to the murderer's home.

      "title": "Introduction",
      "abstract": "Extract Hate crime often takes place in the context of sporting events, particularly football matches. Hate crimes are crimes motivated by hostility, prejudice and hate towards the victims' identities. Definitions of 'hate crime' vary from one country to the next and even within countries. In England and Wales, the central point of reference is the operational definition offered by the College of Policing (2014), which earmarks hate crime as offences that are motivated by hostility or prejudice on particular grounds, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender status and disability. From this perspective, hate crime can be understood as any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated wholly or partly by hostility or prejudice based on a person's protected characteristics. McDevitt et al (2001) observe that 'hate' is absent from the vast majority of hate crime. Rather, hate crime may be driven by bias, prejudice or 'negative feelings held by the offender towards a social group that, in their eyes, have an \"outsider status\"' (Garland and Chakraborti, 2012: 40). An 'in-group' is any group a person belongs to or identifies with; in contrast, an 'out-group' is any group a person does not belong to or identify with. A key element of hate crime is that offenders target potential victims because of their membership of despised out-groups. According to Gerstenfeld (2013), it is the fact that the victim is targeted because of their actual or perceived membership of a social grouping – rather than the presence of any bias or hatred – that is the most significant factor when defining hate crime; that is, it is the attack on the person's identity that sets hate crime apart from other crimes.",

      "abstract": "Background: Humans are social creatures who cannot live alone. Humans will always depend on someone else and also need help from others. Every human being also has the feeling of wanted to be loved and loving from their opposite sex. From these feelings, humans will make a relationship with someone they loved and make the it turns to the wedding stage. In every love affair as well as marriage relationship, individuals surely have a sense of jealousy. It is mostly caused by individuals are afraid of losing someone they really love. This fear can arise since individuals have emotional dependence with their partners. Individuals assume that only their partners who can make themselves happy. & Nbsp; Married couples would tend to be more protective of their partners. It is due to individuals’ sense of belonging who make them feel that their partner is a place to share complaints, bliss and sorrows, and also as a life-long friend. Those sense of dependence lead the individual to feel jealous. Objective: to find out the relationship between emotional dependence and romantic jealous. Method: a research using technical product moment correlation analysis with Likert’s scale model. The scale used is a modified jealous romantic scale from Damayanti (2010) and also a scale of emotional dependence modified from Socha (1995). The research subjects were married couples who lived in Manyar Sabrangan RT 02 RW 02 Street, Surabaya. It tooks 25% of the total 186 married couples into 50 married couples. Result: there is a relationship between emotional dependence and jealous romantic on married couples with the value of correlation analysis shows the value of 0.000 0.05 and jealous romantic scale of 0130>0.05. Whereas for the linearity test of both variables is 0.852>0.05.Conclusion: there is a relationship between emotional dependence and jealous romantic on married couples. It means that the higher the emotional dependence, the higher the romantic jealous for married couples, and vice versa.",

      "abstract": "In this article, the concept introduced by Lyman Wynne, that the individual develops epigenetically within the family system, is discussed and validated with data from a study of the characteristics and relationships of 27 women with borderline personality disorder and their parents. Each stage of the epigenetic process is impaired in one way or another, adversely affecting subsequent stages. Early impairment of attachment‐care‐giving processes is at least partly attributable to a lack of empathic parenting; effective communication is marred by family members' inability to experience or express feelings (alexithymia); this, in turn, makes it difficult to engage in joint family problem solving. Mutuality between family members does not occur in such a context, and there is an absence of intimacy between family members. These are often abusive family systems, with multiple abuse and intrafamilial sexual abuse more specifically directed at the daughter with BPD. The symptoms of the daughter can be understood systemically, as representing both predispositional characteristics and reactions to the family system. It is suggested that the epigenetic paradigm could be used to characterize the specific failure of developmental processes in many different disorders.",

This category-specific pattern has been interpreted in terms of simulation constraints, whereby it may be harder to imagine the absence of some states than others. Afterlife beliefs have also shown context-sensitivity, suggesting that environmental exposure to different types of information might influence adults' reasoning about post-death states. We sought to clarify category and context effects in adults' afterlife reasoning. Participants read a story describing the death of a human protagonist after exposure to a biological prime, an emotional prime, or no prime. Emotions, desires, and epistemic states were more frequently attributed to the dead character than biological, psychobiological, and perceptual states, partially replicating previous findings. The biological prime decreased the attribution of certain post-death states relative to the control condition, whereas the emotional prime had no effect. Simulation theory does not provide a satisfactory explanation of the present findings, which may be better accounted for by conflict between different cognitive systems that are engaged in thinking about the dead.",

      "title": "Modelli Matematici di Storie D'Amore",
      "abstract": "In questo articolo sono descritti i principali risultati finora ottenuti nel contesto della modellistica delle relazioni d’amore. I modelli sono di tipo descrittivo e stu- diano l’evoluzione dei sentimenti di due individui a partire da uno stato iniziale di indifferenza fino al raggiungimento di un regime sentimentale stazionario, periodi- co, o addirittura aperiodico. I modelli pi`u semplici sono costituiti da due equazioni differenziali (una per lei e una per lui) contenenti le informazioni essenziali sul mo- do con cui ogni individuo reagisce all’amore e al fascino dell’altro. Analizzando i modelli si possono ricavare, senza bisogno di alcun dato, le propriet`a fondamentali delle storie d’amore tra individui di varie categorie: sicuri o insicuri, non polarizzati o polarizzati (tra cui, platonici o sinergici), ... Cos`i facendo si capisce, ad esempio, perch´e in coppie di individui sicuri ci sia una marcata tendenza ad aumentare il proprio fascino nella fase del corteggiamento, o perch´e piccole scoperte riguardanti il partner possano avere conseguenze (positive o negative) sorprendentemente grandi (catastrofi). Coppie di individui insicuri hanno invece una decisa propensione ad interrompere la relazione dopo un certo tempo. Infine, si scopre che regimi sentimentali altalenanti sono possibili a causa della copresenza di insicurezza e sinergismo e che le crisi ricorrenti possono lentamente sparire o attenuandosi o rarefacendosi nel tempo. In conclusione, per mezzo di questi modelli, propriet`a come quelle appena descritte, note agli psicanalisti che le hanno scoperte esercitando la loro professione, sono finalmente capite e spiegate: un risultato di indubbio valore. Tutti i fenomeni sopra citati riguardano coppie estremamente semplici, in cui l’evoluzione della storia d’amore `e dominata dalle interazioni tra i partner. Ma nella realt`a le relazioni interpersonali sono molto pi`u complesse perch´e risentono anche dell’ambiente sociale in cui la coppia vive. Successi e insuccessi nella pro- fessione, problemi di salute, lunghi e ripetuti periodi di assenza forzata, esistenza di importanti passioni, come quelle tipiche degli artisti, sono tutti fattori che in- terferiscono, anche notevolmente, con l’evoluzione dei sentimenti. Per modellizzare coppie cos`i complesse, `e necessario far uso di modelli con tre o pi`u equazioni diffe- renziali, che possono essere analizzati solo per via numerica. Tali modelli possono spiegare anche regimi sentimentali caotici e, quindi, imprevedibili. Finora ci`o `e stato fatto solo per un numero limitato di casi, in particolare per relazioni tenden- zialmente instabili come quelle triangolari. Tuttavia, i risultati ottenuti sono cos`i incoraggianti da far pensare che l’intero settore scientifico debba, in tempi brevi, espandersi significativamente. Il lettore che desideri approfondire quanto esposto in questo articolo potr`a fare riferimento al libro ”Modeling Love Dynamics”, pubblicato nel 2016 daWorld Scien- tific (autori: Sergio Rinaldi, Fabio Della Rossa, Fabio Dercole, Alessandra Gragnani e Pietro Landi).

      "abstract": "Humans possess explicit, rule-based, and culturally determined systems for identifying kin, but kinship inferences are also influenced implicitly by cue-based mechanisms found commonly across the animal kingdom. These mechanisms are fallible. An evolutionarily informed signal-detection analysis suggests that (a) cue-based kin recognition may sometimes be biased in favor of false-positive errors, resulting in implicit kinship inferences even in the presence of nonkin, and (b) the tendency toward this inferential error may vary predictably in response to specific developmental and contextual circumstances. This analysis has important implications for a wide variety of psychological phenomena (especially in the realms of person perception, interpersonal attraction, and prosocial behavior) and leads to the deduction of many novel hypotheses.",

      "abstract": "Mainstream theorizing of paedophilia from the mid-1920s through to mid-1960, and even into the 1980s, was importantly psychodynamically oriented. The early history of the concept of paedophilia in early psychodynamic thought is problematic, however. Extant historical references are not without problems of their own, and have suffered from a lack of insight in the wider history of sexuality at this point of ‘erotic age preferences’. Review of primary sources highlights several contemporaneous interfaces of early psychodynamic theory: with the established forensic psychology of perpetrators of child sexual abuse; Krafft-Ebing's specific aetiological concept of age fetishism; early study and typologies of homosexual age preferences; emergent and divergent ideas about psychosexual infantilism; and strikingly late empirical attention to the psychiatry of the perpetrator of intergenerational incest.",

      "title": "Adolescent and adult health outcomes following child abuse and neglect: a birth cohort study",
      "abstract": "The maltreatment of children, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect, is a major worldwide public health problem. There is an extensive literature base suggesting that child maltreatment is associated with a range of adverse outcomes in adolescence and into adulthood, including mental health problems, drug and alcohol abuse, obesity and risk-taking behaviour and criminality in adulthood.However, there are weaknesses in much of the literature base on this topic.  First, there has been a heavy reliance on cross-sectional studies using retrospective self-reporting of childhood abuse by adult subjects.  There are concerns about the reliability of associations documented in this way, due to the possibility of systematic recall bias. Second, much of the earlier research has failed to adequately account for the social milieu in which child maltreatment occurs, leaving open the possibility of confounding by variables such as income, education status, and parental substance use. Third, the propensity for two or more types of maltreatment to co-occur leaves studies of single maltreatment types (e.g. sexual abuse) open to confounding by other maltreatment types. Finally, where subjects have been able to be followed longitudinally, many of the cohorts have been selected either from clinical populations, or agency-documented cases followed longitudinally but without the context of a population sample for comparison.This PhD thesis represents the first broad-ranging study of the outcomes of child maltreatment that overcomes many of the limitations of previous studies by investigating a large, population-based birth cohort – the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy, MUSP – linked with independent government agency data on exposure to specific types of child maltreatment.The thesis is presented with a series of peer-reviewed publications. While each paper has unique aims, the overall aims can be summarised as follows:(1) To examine the consequences of child abuse and neglect with a robust longitudinal methodology – including prospective, independent documentation of exposure to abuse and neglect.(2) To determine whether child neglect and emotional abuse are as, or more, important than physical and sexual abuse as antecedents of adverse outcomes on a young person’s mental health, cognitive capacity, and propensity to substance misuse; and(3) To determine whether there is a significant association between self-reporting of child maltreatment and related parenting practice – specifically adult recall of child sexual abuse, and adolescent self-report of suboptimal parenting – and independently documented government agency notification of child maltreatment.The studies showed that after adjustment for a range of potentially confounding sociodemographic variables, an agency-documented history of notification and/or substantiation of child maltreatment is associated with adverse outcomes in both adolescence (age 14) and young adulthood (age 21) on psychological, cognitive, educational, and substance-related functioning. In particular, a recurring theme among the studies is that child neglect and emotional abuse are as or more strongly associated with adverse outcomes than the more extensively studied physical and sexual abuse.",

The most frequent sexual disorder reported by spouses of patients with dementia is sexual indifference related to apathy and blunted affect. Increase of sexual demands is rare and many behaviors considered as inappropriate or expressing hypersexuality actually express affective needs or result from cognitive disturbances. Permanence of sexual activity is most often a factor of adjustment for married dementia sufferers and their caregivers. However, some sexual behaviors are stressing for the spouses, mainly women spouses. In nursing homes or long term care facilities, expressing sexuality by demented subjects and dealing with inappropriate sexual expression are source of concerns for the nursing staff, other residents, and families. Information about sex and dementia and a psychobehavioral approach can decrease the strain of families and caregivers.",

All couples were examined in the course of domestic proceedings at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy in Childhood and Adolescence (University of Tübingen). Differences between self-image and the partners perception as well as self-image and rating of the partner were worked out. The degree of symmetry and correspondence regarding gender positions and the degree of confirmation/negation of the position were pointed out. No sex differences could be found in regard to role attribution. Sings of sex-specific role perception could not be shown amongst the couples being part of the domestic proceedings. Sex-specific differences in regard to the image as perceived by the other parent do not exist any more. The exact complementary role of ones own role-perception is being attributed to the former partner. The role-characteristics attributed to the former partner can be described as dominant, under-controlled, hypomanic, and inaccessible. Family- and psychodynamic aspects of these results are discussed.",

Although junior blue-foots suffer violent subordination, partial starvation, slow growth, and high levels of stress hormone due to abuse by elder siblings, important developmental impacts never materialize. During adulthood, juniors show no deficits in defense of territory, annual survival, cellular immunity, age and date of first breeding, or the number of fledglings produced through age 16 years. Similarly, although one-third of junior human siblings suffer physical, psychological, or relational aggression from siblings on a weekly basis, affecting self-esteem, loneliness, anxiety, interpersonal stress, and depression, rigorous studies found no effects on the major personality traits in adulthood: emotional stability, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and imagination. Both species may have evolved developmental resilience to the stresses of sibling conflict, a predictable challenge of infancy, and similar resilience has been observed in other wild birds.",

A distinction can be made between emotional loneliness that occurs when an individual lacks an intimate relationship with one special person such as a spouse or parent, and social loneliness that occurs when an individual lacks friends or has no sense of belonging to a community. Solitude is not invariably accompanied by loneliness. In the past decade, research on loneliness has expanded rapidly, spurred in part by the development of reliable paper-and-pencil instruments to assess loneliness. Like other forms of psychological distress, loneliness is more common among lower socioeconomic groups. Loneliness is most common among adolescents and young adults, and is less often reported by people in older age groups. The immediate cause of loneliness is typically some event that produces a significant deficit in a person's social relations.",

Joy, confidence, unity and solidarity with other people are able to give strength, help withstand difficult times and inspire exploits. Whereas grief, fear, loneliness, anxiety and apathy, when they also last a long time, can destroy not only a person's mental and physical health, but also radically change their beliefs and values. The pandemic has caused damage not only to the physical health of people in all countries, with a significant deadly harvest and continuing its sinister course to this day: it has also caused deep emotional wounds that are still difficult to count and identify.  Self-isolation and strict control by the state, far from always compensated by the care expected of its fellow citizens, have increased feelings of loneliness, fear and anxiety. In addition, the justifiability of such harsh measures, which violate basic constitutional human rights and have caused much harm, is in many cases less obvious. Also, one of the most important reasons for grievous emotions and feelings is that everyone has seen the state of crisis that our medicine is in. Optimisation of it led to the fact that the most valuable achievements of Soviet medicine, whose authors were talented world-class specialists, were forgotten [4]. At the same time, the reasons for the lack of positive emotions are not only the deadly disease itself, which is undoubtedly dangerous and has not yet been investigated, but also the side effects of the pandemic in the form of long-term stress and so-called info-demia, emotional infection and poisoning with negative information that has swept the world through TV and computer screens.",

      "abstract": "V rARIOUS ATTEMPTS to solve marriage problems, e.g., the failure of the husband to provide, triangle problems, incompatibility, etc., in s spite of sincere attempts, have not produced very satisfactory results. Marriage counsels, lawyers, and psychologists have attained some adjustments in some cases but we must admit that the permanent, stable, scientific approach has not been found. Frequently we meet individuals who, as individuals, appear to be well adjusted, who perform perfectly well on every level-except in their marriage. If we do not want to force the issue and place the responsibility for such problems on one or the other of the individuals involved, we necessarily must conclude that their interpersonal situation, not the individuals, is at fault. Those who have dealt with such problems know that even a divorce very often offers no satisfactory solution but may even produce a psychic trauma in the life of the individual which often might be responsible for future failures in following marriages. We therefore suggest that, even in cases which may require divorce as a solution, an expert scientific attempt should be made to help such marriage partners to understand and accept a divorce as the only satisfactory solution of their problem. That means we advocate a scientific planning of divorce, or what we might call a divorce catharsis, as Moreno suggests. In the following discussion, our understanding and interpretation of the interpersonal situation between marriage partners are similar to our treatment of neurotics and psychotics by the psychodrama as developed by Moreno.' Theory. The psychodrama offers a method for the study of the social atom in marriage problems. By social atom is meant the smallest constellation of psychological relations which can be said to make up the individual cells in the social universe. It consists of the psychological relations of one individual to those of the individuals by whom he is attracted or repelled and their relation to him. It is the particular pattern of interpersonal relationships which develops from the time of human birth.",

Health consequences of sexual violence vary from mild to severe medical, gynecological, obstetric, surgical, psychological, and psychiatric trauma. The most common sequelae of sexual violence are mental health consequences, and the effects of violence manifest in different ways throughout the life span. Adults commonly experience depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic disorders. Mental health sequelae of violence manifest somewhat differently in children, though they are also susceptible to mood, anxiety, and posttraumatic disorders.

      "abstract": "THE greatest psychological blessing that can be conferred upon a child at birth is to be wanted by his parents. Conversely, an enviable asset for new parents is to be in a position to welcome wholeheartedly the new addition to the family. This is not to say that all unplanned pregnancies are unwanted or that they turn out badly, but that there is an optimum readiness for parenthood and this readiness is too often neglected in our society at present. This neglect is in part an indictment of medical and public health practice. There is a striking contradiction-rarely noted-in the way our society regards readiness for the responsibilities of parenthood. There is virtually no interference or even cautionary suggestion against parenthood for married couples who are biologically able to reproduce. Even for the unmarried, social sanctions aginst pregnancy act chiefly as punishments or threats, without supporting prevention: the prospect of punishment often fails as a deterrent. Even couples who decide that they are unable to rear a child properly have been-and are still being-denied full information and necessary implements to practice birth control. There still exists a medical-social bias that favors pregnancy as the inevitable outcome of sexual intercourse, especially for the deprived segments of our population. In this circumstance of effective, albeit unconscious bias, no attention is paid to the quality of parenthood in store for the child-to-be, or of the wishes of the parents-to-be in regard to their own future, except perhaps to deny the right of conjugal love unless they wish to procreate. By way of contrast we note the plight of an infertile couple (especially one of mature years, mixed religion or race, or low income) who wish to be parents. For an approved adoption procedure they must be thoroughly evaluated as to their qualifications as parents, and many adoptive couples will testify to the emotional stress involved in presenting oneself for this",

      "abstract": "Introduction Jealousy is a complex emotional state and some degree is considered normal in mature love, but when does it become destructive in a relationship? There's a thin line between what is normal and what is pathologic. Pathological jealousy differs from normal by its intensity and irrationality. Obsessive and delusional jealousies are different types of pathological jealousy, difficult to distinguish, which is important, since they have different treatment. Despite the differences, both result in significant distress and carry the risk of homicide/suicide, so it's a matter deserving the psychiatrists’ attention. Objective Explore the psychopathological differences between obsessive and delusional jealousy and list the characteristics and difficulties in the approach to pathological jealousy. Methods The results were obtained searching literature included on the PubMed and Google Scholar platforms. Results Delusional jealousy is characterized by strong and false beliefs that the partner is unfaithful. Individuals with obsessive jealousy suffer from unpleasant and irrational jealous ruminations that the partner could be unfaithful, accompanied by compulsive checking of partners’ behavior. This jealousy resembles obsessive-compulsive phenomenology and should be treated with SSRIs and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Delusional jealousy is a psychotic disorder and should be treated with antipsychotics. Conclusion The common issue in pathological jealousy is the problem of adherence to treatment and bad prognosis. In order to achieve better treatment outcomes, we should follow-up the patient regularly. One key factor is to explore the psychopathology and motivate the sufferer for the proper pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions, trying to reduce the suffering caused by ideas of unfaithfulness.

Ancient and medieval sources are consulted; discovered references are interpreted in the light of the over-all culture of the times and locale; eventually, an evolutionary pattern emerges which links the gradual steps from primitive origins to the facts and theories available when the quest is undertaken. Similar efforts concerned with emotional disorders of children lead to the amazing disclosure of the total absence of an allusion, however casual, before the eighteenth century. Folklore, which seizes upon every conceivable aspect of human life, is peculiarly silent. Theologic, medical, and fictional writings have nothing to say. This does not warrant the assumption that infantile emotions always ran a smooth course in the past and that the occurrence of their disturbances is a relatively recent phenomenon. The truth is that, aside from occasional pious pleas for nondescript philanthropy, our ancestral lawgivers, physicians, and philosophers seem to have been indifferent toward the afflicted among many categories of the young and, for that matter, of the grown-ups as well.

In the last decades different scientific approaches to gain empirical evidence about the type and extent of negative effects of hormonal contraceptives on mood and sex did not result in clear evidence-based statements due to the complexity of the interaction between contraceptive methods and mental and sexual health (inconsistent measurement of patient reported outcomes, multiplicity of intervening variables etc). Based on an understanding of the biological, psychological and sociocultural factors contributing to the mental and sexual health of the individual user, and the individual impact of hormonal contraception, which can have negative, positive or neutral effects on mood and sexuality, an individualized approach is proposed to integrate mental and sexual health into the practice of contraceptive counselling and care.",

      "abstract": "Violence as an individual phenomenon is traced to its beginnings in the developmental process as one potential expression of the innate aggressive energy which in turn has a combination of structural, genetic and psychological determinants. The early life experience of the individual is found to be the major force in making the decision about whether and how the aggressive drives are expressed in violent forms. There are some constitutional patterns which particularly lend themselves to the more openly aggressive forms of interactive and impulsive individuals. There are environmental shaping forces which can be major influences such as being reared in a setting where violence between people is commonplace. Group pressures and influences can be later determinants. There are specific developmental stages, particularly between two and four years of age when there is active interest in and experimentation with sadistic and other violent forms of interaction and expression. It is during these stages that major decisions are made about whether the aggressive energy is expressed in socially acceptable, useful patterns and interests, or whether they will be anti‐social in nature. Definition (Webster's Unabridged Dictionary): Violence An exertion of any physical force as to injure or abuse. It implies intense, turbulent or furious action, often destructive.",

      "abstract": "Given that the prevailing literature largely neglects the unwanted sexual activity experiences of men, this study examined both prevalence and predictors of men's compliance with unwanted, but consensual, sexual activity. Specifically, we examined whether traditional gender-role endorsement, belief in male sexuality stereotypes, and age predict sexual compliance among heterosexual men. Participants (N = 426 men) completed a brief demographic questionnaire, measures of gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes, as well as a modified measure investigating motives for consenting to unwanted kissing, sexual touching, oral sex, and/or penetrative sex. The reported incidence rate of mild sexual compliance (i.e. consenting to unwanted kissing at least once) in heterosexual men was 61.3% over the past 12 months. Results suggest that sexual compliance in heterosexual men may be predicted by their endorsement of traditional gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes. Moreover, men may be motivated to be sexually compliant due to motives of altruism, intoxication, sexual inexperience, peer pressure, popularity, and sex-role concerns.",

It is argued that the deaths of these individuals are qualitatively different from those related to other substances such as alcohol or nicotine, for example. The reasons for this include the often unexpected nature of the deaths and the young age at which they tend to occur. These deaths result from an activity that is illegal and is regarded as deviant or carries social censure. The deaths under consideration occur in a context that might be poorly understood by those close to the user. The death itself might reveal a relative or friend as drug user for the first time. Drug users also have a 'spoiled identity' that can be attached to the bereaved. There are, moreover, few guides to the practitioner as to the difficulties that the bereaved may experience.",

      "abstract": "Synopsis While depressive reactions appear to be universal, until recently they have seldom been described outside Europe, probably because of their lack of exotic salience, but also because they are seldom identified locally as distinct entities. Where it occurs, such an identification reflects a local preference for the articulation of individual psychological notions, rather than universal moral imperatives. While the symptoms of reactive depression are recognized in rural Trinidad as a common experience, but not especially remarked, they are also identified by Afro-Caribbeans as a specific state, Tabanka , following the loss of a sexual partner to another. Tabanka is characterized by lassitude, anorexia, insomnia, feelings of worthlessness, anger, a loss of interest in work and other activities and, especially, by a preoccupation with the faithless one. It is said to be most common among married men and among the upwardly socially mobile, and to lead to heavy drinking and occasionally madness or suicide. The precipitation of Tabanka provokes hilarity rather than moral indignation, and its humour articulates an egalitarian and individualistic working-class attitude to marriage and social mobility. In contrast, Trinidadians of Asian or Venezuelan origin emphasize moral notions of honour and shame.",

      "title": "Sexual desire, not hypersexuality, is related to neurophysiological responses elicited by sexual images",
      "abstract": "BackgroundModulation of sexual desires is, in some cases, necessary to avoid inappropriate or illegal sexual behavior (downregulation of sexual desire) or to engage with a romantic partner (upregulation of sexual desire). Some have suggested that those who have difficulty downregulating their sexual desires be diagnosed as having a sexual 'addiction'. This diagnosis is thought to be associated with sexual urges that feel out of control, high-frequency sexual behavior, consequences due to those behaviors, and poor ability to reduce those behaviors. However, such symptoms also may be better understood as a non-pathological variation of high sexual desire. Hypersexuals are thought to be relatively sexual reward sensitized, but also to have high exposure to visual sexual stimuli. Thus, the direction of neural responsivity to sexual stimuli expected was unclear. If these individuals exhibit habituation, their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be diminished; if they merely have high sexual desire, their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be increased. Neural responsivity to sexual stimuli in a sample of hypersexuals could differentiate these two competing explanations of symptoms.MethodsFifty-two (13 female) individuals who self-identified as having problems regulating their viewing of visual sexual stimuli viewed emotional (pleasant sexual, pleasant-non-sexual, neutral, and unpleasant) photographs while electroencephalography was collected.ResultsLarger P300 amplitude differences to pleasant sexual stimuli, relative to neutral stimuli, was negatively related to measures of sexual desire, but not related to measures of hypersexuality.ConclusionImplications for understanding hypersexuality as high desire, rather than disordered, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Despite increased attention within psychiatry and psychoanalysis to childhood sexual abuse, the problem of cases in which sexual abuse is suspected but cannot be verified has received relatively little consideration. Just as underattention to the possibility of molestation as a cause of sexual trauma can fail to address the child's environmental and therapeutic needs, so a premature conclusion that molestation did occur may skew the course of treatment and have adverse medicolegal ramifications. Although the occurrence of molestation may be verifiable, its absence generally cannot be proven. However, some cases of suspected or equivocal child sexual abuse may involve trauma other than frank molestation. In unclear or equivocal situations, extended diagnostic formulation or treatment with attention to reconstruction may lead to an explication of the symptoms that is at least plausible. In this report, cases thought to involve possible sexual molestation are presented to illustrate alternative formulations or constructions of the trauma. A psychoanalytic perspective can be useful in the approach to such cases.",

The protagonist's troublesome and painful separation from his wife taking place during a trip through the United States is interpreted as an attachment-conflict towards the mother that has not been dissolved during late adolescence. The essential characteristic of late adolescence is taking one's final leave from the infantile and adolescent parental imagines and the reapproachment to the real parents. In case of a failure late adolescence may easily lead to a syndrome of rejection or of overadjustment or of drop-out-identity. Especially in the rejection or in the drop-out-identity one can find object-relationships resembling those found in narcicistic or borderline-disorders. In many cases these adolescents lack the transitional scope they would have needed to find their way to autonomy or to the ability of containing (BION).",

      "title": "Arguing against inhumane and degrading punishment",
      "abstract": "Increasingly, it seems, there are crimes so appalling that they challenge our resolve not to sink to the level of their perpetrators as we punish them. In cases where several victims have not only been murdered, but also raped, tortured, mutilated, dismembered, or eaten, it is understandable why some members of the public are prepared to have the state inflict a little of the same treatment on the perpetrators. This is especially true when the victims are children. Like most others who ponder the limits to legal punishment, I think that we should resist the impulse to inflict inhumane or degrading punishments on the worst offenders. Unlike many of them, however, I am not always persuaded by claims to the effect that the inherent dignity of offenders is the ground of an absolute moral prohibition on such forms of treatment.(1) At times I am attracted to such a firm prohibition. But at other times I understand the impulse to question it, to ask whether some crimes are so despicable that their perpetrators forfeit or otherwise lose any claim they have to minimally decent treatment by their fellow human beings. Alternatively, and I suspect more interestingly, I wonder whether the claim to be treated in minimally decent fashion, though very stringent, can be outweighed by more stringent moral claims. If we could gain something very important by brutal treatment of the worst criminal offenders, should we not at least consider seriously the arguments for doing so? We should see what follows if we are prepared to relax the rigid prohibition on inhumane or degrading punishments just a bit. If, as I shall attempt to show, doing so would gain us very little of moral significance, then it would be useful to be able to explain to ourselves and others how and why this is so. The suggestion that we should weigh a prohibition on inhumane and degrading punishment against the attainment of other moral goods or the avoidance of other moral evils will immediately raise the hackles of some moral theorists. Such theorists believe that any defensible theory of punishment must include certain inflexible moral constraints. If we are willing to weigh such constraints--in this case, one that strictly limits the kinds of legal sanctions we impose on offenders--against the achievement of other aims, then perhaps the best we will be able to do is make a contingent case for them. For many theorists this will be an unsatisfactory outcome, especially when it comes to prohibitions on punishment of the innocent or on disproportional punishment.(2) Lurking in the background, here, is a formidable and long-standing dispute in moral theory, one that I do not pretend to address adequately in the discussion that follows. Brief consideration is given to the question of whether the approach I develop can account for the prohibition on punishment of the innocent. Also, the question is raised whether the proportionality requirement, by itself, rules out inhumane and degrading punishments. I suggest that it does not and, thus, that other arguments must be employed against the use of inhumane and degrading punishments. Though these arguments have a contingent character, they are contingent in an unusual way. They treat some interests that individuals have as morally more important than others of their interests. Specifically, the interests individuals have in being treated neither inhumanely nor degradingly are taken to be crucial ones that cannot be outweighed by considerations of mere utility. Some of the arguments discussed will be familiar because, in slightly different forms, they are central to scholarly debate over the death penalty. But the moral prohibition on inhumane and degrading punishments is more general. Short of killing offenders, there is a range of deprivations or kinds of suffering that we might, and sometimes do, impose on those found guilty of serious crimes. These include denials of decent food and medical care, adequate space, sufficient heat, fresh air, exercise, religious or political expression, conjugal or parental visitations, and access to entertainment or culture. …",

      "abstract": "No one who is interested in the problem of value and attempts to read through the literature on the subject can fail to be struck by the extraordinary diversity of opinion. Some of this difference of view is traceable to ambiguities in language; there are various terms employed, each of which, of course, may or may not express any valid idea—terms like value, values, kinds of value, sorts of things that have value, value-objects, things that have value. The terms value and values are subject to and lead to much confusion, even on the part of those who are aware of the existence of such a danger. Much of the difference may probably be due to two other important factors: first, the education and training in earlier years whereby emotional reactions to words instead of intelligent understanding of their meaning and validity are induced, and, second, the continual reliance upon moral experience, which reliance may seem to be necessary, but which may be invalidated by the consideration, generally overlooked and unappraised, that moral, like social, experience might not be what it is if certain views were not entertained and did not prevail. The latter possibility would put moral and social studies on a plane quite different from that of physical investigations, for the moral and social inquirer would always have to bear in mind that the facts with which he is confronted, and to which he seeks to appeal, may exist to confront him and his fellowmen only in the sense that they arise from the acceptance and effectuation of a belief or theory, and would not be but for the effectuation of the belief or theory. The other factor, that of the influence of education and training upon emotional reactions, is also important in relation to a study of value, for it is necessary to be on guard against confusing reactions to words and reactions to objects, things, or situations.",

Injury is different from accident in that the latter cannot be expected and prevented, and also different from trauma that means the external forces on the body and the response against the force. Injury can be expected scientifically and prevented. The risk of injuries in children is closely related to the age, sex, socio-economical status, and environment. Injuries are always the most common cause of death in children throughout the world, and traffic accident is the most common cause of childhood injuries. Burn, near drowning, and fall down occupy most of the causes of injuries in infancy, and pedestrian injuries and traffic accidents are the major causes of injuries in pre-school ages. Suicide becomes an important cause of injuries in adolescents. Sexual abuse should be considered seriously in children with perineal injuries without definite causes. All of these childhood injuries are closely related to the status of growth and development of children.",

      "abstract": "Clinical experience at the Center for Family Information and Fertility Regulation in Geneva suggests that the ready availability of contraception has not reduced ambivalence about childbearing. Various symptoms seen in family planning centers are believed to indicate ambivalent desires for pregnancy: failure or forgetting of contraception, accidental pregnancy followed by abortion, sterility of psychogenic origin, marital conflicts, sexual symptoms, and others. Some of these conditions have always existed, but with fertility control today seemingly assured, the symptoms may have another explanation. Society, through contraceptive use, encourages programmed children who arrive at the optimal moment. The underlying myth supports consumption, discarding, and replacement of desired objects according to the tastes of the moment and the near future. The individual stresses self-realization in the here and now. Often lacking reflection on a past which is repressed and a future which may be too frightening to contemplate, with unemployment, nuclear peril, or other horrors, the individual can only validate the present moment with the fantasy of a marvelous infant, which is a reflection of himself. Family planning centers see more and more individuals shocked by personal and social contradictions. Observed symptoms seem frequently to arise from a common difficulty related to the limitation of desire to those of the present moment. The individual of today has difficulty integrating the present and the past. If this hypothesis is correct, family planning centers will be increasingly required to help clients reflect on contradictions within themselves, their relationships, and their societies regarding the desire for children. In 1980, the Center for Family Information and Fertility Regulation conducted 2781 consultations for 1502 cases. 38.4% were for contraception, 17.9% for induced abortion. 17.4% for marriage counseling, 7.9% for psychological problems, 6.7% for sexual problem, 5.7% for medical problems, 2% for legal problems, 1% for sterility and adoption, and 2.9% for others.",

      "title": "Reframing Mental Health Narratives: Rethinking the Popular",
      "abstract": "Mental health and fatalism have seen an exponential rise in recent times, with more and more people, especially youngsters, falling prey to this illness and especially to its dangerous downside -suicide. Both rupture in social relationships and the sense of alienation experienced by individuals amid the rising stress of expectations and isolation in a postmodern neoliberal society could be one of the main contributing reasons for young individuals to take the extreme step, in addition to other factors. Literature has always mirrored the larger socio-cultural dimensions of society, and so Suicide and issues related to mental health and the symptoms thereof have been depicted and written about in popular lore from times immemorial. However, the paradox is that famous depictions have not stemmed the prevalence of this malaise but, in many cases, have only clandestinely perpetuated the occurrence. One of the reasons may be the romanticization of death and the symptoms that have essentialized popular genres of fiction and Literature. Another contributing factor could be the misleading, ill-informed, or downplayed depiction of the whole idea. The paper attempts to analyze the depiction of the symptoms of mental health, especially Suicide, in popular Literature across time frames and also understand how Literature has slowly but surely turned the ideology of alienation, isolation, and anomie into a sensationalized and romantic genre, often exploiting the popularist sentiment-rather than use its presence and reach to create an aura of immediacy and discursive affirmation of the malaise.",

      "title": "Spontaneous pregnancy and unexplained infertility: A gift with many whys",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nInfertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. The dualism between the so-called “Psychogenic hypothesis” and the hypothesis of “Psychological consequences of infertility” has been solved with the proposal of an interactive and bidirectional relationship between infertility and psychosocial diseases.[1] Infertility itself can cause severe stress on both partners and start a vicious cycle resulting in the decreasing likelihood of pregnancy and even of treatment success. The infertility treatment could be responsible for a major impairment of the sex life because it frequently digs into the intimacy of the couple. Moreover the “emotional rollercoaster” related to the treatment is felt, especially by the women, to be extremely mentally stressful. Sexual intercourse can lose its spontaneity because it is aimed at “baby-making” and it is strictly restricted to “fertile” days. Sexuality can be therefore deprived of its recreative and erotic value and subordinated to the direct goal of pregnancy. Furthermore, sexual intercourse may be increasingly associated with a sense of failure, affecting even the patient's image of his/her own body. According to a recent meta-analysis, sexual disorders – depending on both infertility itself and infertility diagnosis and treatment – are common in infertile couples, with women more affected than men.[2]\r\n\r\nLittle is known about spontaneous pregnancy after infertility therapy either successful or failed. Couples dealing with long-term involuntary childlessness usually consider in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments as a final option but a relative high incidence of treatment-independent pregnancies especially in couples with unexplained infertility is frequently reported. Hennely et al., analyzed the spontaneous conception rate after a successful IVF cycle. In this retrospective study 106 of 513 (20.7%) couples obtained a spontaneous pregnancy two years after Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) birth success.[3] The likelihood of spontaneous conception was higher in younger women and was strongly connected to the duration of infertility. Indeed, women who have been infertile for a shorter period more likely achieved a spontaneous pregnancy. In a recent study,[4] 2134 couples were retrospectively analyzed in order to estimate the frequency of spontaneous pregnancies among couples previously treated by IVF. The spontaneous pregnancy rate was 17% among couples who previously achieved pregnancy through ART and 24% among couples who conceived spontaneously after unsuccessful medical treatment. Among both groups, almost 60% of the spontaneous pregnancies occurred two to three years after the last IVF transfer. The proportion of spontaneous pregnancies was higher in couples with unexplained infertility, suggesting a better fertility prognosis compared with couples whose infertility is of known origin. Spontaneous conception in couples with unexplained infertility could be related either to the stress relief after the decision to abandon the therapy or to the placebo effect after being placed in the waiting list before starting the treatment. Treatment-independent pregnancies occur sometimes after a successful ART procedure or after adoption, suggesting the important impact of psychological factors on fertility.\r\n\r\nNevertheless spontaneous pregnancy in couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility remains nowadays a mysterious event. Many questions are still unanswered. Is spontaneous conception connected to a previous ovarian stimulation, necessary in some IVF cycles? Could the previous pregnancy be responsible for endocrine changes that increase the reproductive potential? Or is it mainly related to the stress relief that undoubtedly occurs after achieving parenthood? A lot of work in that direction needs to be done. It remains however important to remind to every couple starting an infertility treatment that spontaneous conception before, during or after ART-procedures has to be taken into account!",

Dysfunction or disturbances of family functioning are such features of family life that complicate or hinder execution of family functions. A dysfunctional family in a broad sense means a system determining distortions of personal development and, therefore, maladaptive, deviant behaviour or neurotic disorders at one or more of the family members. The aim of the study is to identify the causes of disharmony in marital relations and the criteria for normal functioning of a family as a system. The empirical part of this study was devoted to determining the causes of such disharmonies in marital relationships that subsequently led to divorce. The study was conducted during the family counselling of married men, women and married couples who were in the process of divorce. The next criteria for normal family functioning have been determined: respect for differences; sincerity in expressing thoughts and feelings; dynamic relationships; role sharing; observance of personal boundaries; family openness; emotional and spiritual intimacy.",

      "title": "Processes of Believing, Mental Abnormalities, and Other Matters of the Mind",
      "abstract": "Two categories of mental events – ecstatic or indescribable religious revelations and bizarre beliefs or behavior with related mental abnormalities – have been compared and contrasted in order to understand whether they are manifestations of different basic neural and psychological processes, or fundamentally the same. In popular terms, such comparisons point to the issue of the relationship between being religious and being mentally ill. McCauley and Graham (2020) have argued for a benign “maturational naturalism” (MN) as an over-arching concept to subsume and understand the two approaches. MN rests on the assumption that for purposes of understanding the processes that mediate any “matters of the mind,” it makes no difference whether they are labeled religious or not. All must be functions of maturationally natural processes, or else they would not occur. Whether they are labeled “religious” or “mental illness,” or whether an extra-world agent or spirit was involved, is left for others to discuss. There is a gap in their analysis, however: They refer to beliefs (religious, delusional, evidence-based), but do not adequately clarify the processes from which they spring or what believing is even for. The present article completes the picture by explaining the fundamental processes of believing that underpin all they say, and more. The keyword for the processes of believing is the term credition, a neologistic variant of credible or believable. This article elaborates how believing processes make possible religious, esoteric, and logical and evidence-based beliefs; where they come from and how they are constructed: and what they are good for, i.e., why humans do what is called believing at all.",

Ein weiterer Entwicklungspfad fuhrt uber Substanzabhangigkeit in die Beschaffungsprostitution. Selbstschadigende Sexualkontakte und dependente Beziehungsmuster vor dem Hintergrund einer Borderline-Storung konnten einen zusatzlichen Risikofaktor fur den Einstieg in die Prostitution darstellen. Gleichzeitig konnen im Rahmen der Prostitution erlittene Traumatisierungen eine entsprechende posttraumatische, emotional instabile Symptomatik nach sich ziehen.",

      "abstract": "The fundamental theorem of primary socialization theory is that normative and deviant behaviors are learned social behaviors, products of the interaction of social, psychological, and cultural characteristics, and that norms for social behaviors, including drug use, are learned predominantly in the context of interactions with the primary socialization sources. During adolescence, learning of social behaviors is frequently dominated by interactions with peer clusters. There are a number of additional postulates: 1) The strength of the bonds between the youth and the primary socialization sources is a major factor in determining how effectively norms are transmitted. 2) Any socialization link can transmit deviant norms, but healthy family and school systems are more likely to transmit prosocial norms. 3) Peer clusters can transmit either prosocial or deviant norms, but the major source of deviant norms is usually peer clusters. 4) Weak family/child and/ or school/child bonds increase the chances that the youth will bond with a deviant peer cluster and will engage in deviant behaviors. 5) Weak peer bonds can also ultimately increase the changes of bonding with deviant peers. Primary socialization theory is consistent with current research, has strong implications for improving prevention and treatment, and suggests specific hypotheses for further research.",

      "abstract": "Apart from insecurity posed by Boko Haram and other terrorists, there are other different concepts of insecurities that exist side by side in social policy such as material, social, economic, financial, psychological, housing, and personal autonomy. Insecurity is closely related or allied to poverty, Wresinki postulated and defined - lack of basic security - “as the absence of one of more factors that enable individuals and families to assume basic responsibilities and to enjoy fundamental human rights… chronic poverty results, when the lack of basic security simultaneously affects several aspects of the people’s lives, when it is prolonged, and when it seriously compromises people’s chances of regaining their rights and resuming of their responsibilities in the foreseeable future. [1] ” The root of insecurity is lack of resources, which means that each part of a person’s social life is compromised by the limitations that this places on each person’s capacity. The lack of resources is indirect poverty. Poor people are likely to be insecure, and his potentials are limited. Secondly, rights and responsibility are central to a place in society, and a place in the society is necessary for security. All over the world, even in the freest societies there exist laws, rules and regulations and a system of enforcement backed by sanctions for the protection of human persons in the overall interest of every citizen and the society at large. As it concerns, lives and properties, the nation will be impacted negatively and national development will suffer a decline as nobody will want to remain in a country where life, properties and investment will not be secure. Therefore this paper will not only examine security of human persons in Nigeria vis a vis other developed nations, the impact of insecurity of human persons on the country’s investment portfolio but will also consider the legal regime put in place by the various tiers of government in their bid to ensure security for every person living or doing business in Nigeria against the backdrop of increasing terrorist activities in the country. Therefore security of Human persons in Nigeria will be examined through the eye of terrorist activities which have left hundreds or thousands homeless and displaced, and its impact on national development.

Discussions of relative deprivation often deal at one and the same time with a complex cluster of related concepts. Relative deprivation as a social condition refers exclusively to the fact that one social unit as compared with another has \"more\" of some variable, for example, income, prestige, safety, piety. Reactions of relative deprivation will have greatly different consequences depending on whether deprivation is conceived in fraternalistic or egoistic terms. Efforts to find strong effects from status incongruity as a factor in relative deprivations have been inconclusive. But one important set of processes does seem to involve both incongruity and relative deprivation as effective explanatory conditions.",

      "abstract": "Much of the research on on-again/off-again relationships shows they are different from non-cyclical relationships. This chapter organizes the differences found into three sections: relationship evaluations, communication dynamics, and structural factors. The first section details how on-off partners have lower levels of love, less satisfaction, and more relational uncertainty, particularly while dating (as compared to when they are in a post-dissolution phase). The second section outlines how on-off partners use less relationship maintenance, engage in more disclosure as well as topic avoidance, and also exhibit more conflict and aggression. The third section focuses on structural, external, or sociological factors. For example, on-off relationships are more likely to be long-distance and are somewhat less likely to garner support from their friends and family. In addition, partners in these cyclical relationships are more likely to have experienced economic and employment hardships; yet, children of cycling parents might gain certain benefits. Overall, the research consistently shows that on-off partners have lower relational quality and experience certain external factors that might either produce or perpetuate their cycling.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study uses questionnaire data from 301 terminated romantic relationships to investigate hypotheses concerning the conditions under which a quality that is initially appealing in a partner is later disliked (i.e., a “fatal attraction”). Individuals are expected to be prone to fatal attractions when they are attracted to a quality in a romantic partner that is “different” in any of three ways: (1) different from the individual's own qualities (i.e., dissimilar); (2) different from average (i.e., extreme, or unique); or (3) different from normative expectations (i.e., gender atypical). Such attractions are less likely, however, when individuals are drawn to similarity in another. Findings from a logistic regression analysis provide support for four of the five hypotheses. Fatal attractions are significantly more likely when an individual is drawn to partner characteristics seen either as “dissimilar” from her or his own, as “unique,” or as “extreme” in nature. When these characteristics are viewed as “similar,” disenchantment is less likely. Fatal attractions are neither more, nor less, probable, however, when partner qualities contradict gender stereotypes. A qualitative analysis of open‐ended questionnaire responses provides further support for these attraction patterns. The findings have implications for diverse theories, including those of mate selection and dialectics.",

The deviant world one wants to study may be divided into several somewhat separate segments, such that various methods will be necessary for each; any study of homosexuality must reckon with this. Deviants frequently look for unconventional sources of medical, legal, and psychiatric services, either because they cannot afford what is conventionally available or, as is often true with regard to medical services, because they do not like the embarrassment and harassment they experience from conventional practitioners.

      "title": "The development of multiple role-related selves during adolescence",
      "abstract": "The organization of the adolescent self-portrait is discussed within a framework that focuses on the construction of multiple self-representations across different relational contexts. Contradictions between self-attributes in different contexts create conflict, beginning in midadolescence when cognitive-developmental structures allow one to detect but not resolve opposing attributes. Conflict is greater across roles than within roles. Moreover, for certain roles (e.g., self with mother vs. self with father) conflict is higher. Females, particularly those with a feminine gender orientation, report greater conflict involving attributes in more public contexts. Opposing self-attributes also raise concerns for adolescents about which attributes reflect true versus false self-behaviors. Conflict is more frequent for opposing attributes that pit true against false self-characteristics. False self-behavior is associated with liabilities including devaluation of false self-attributes, low self-esteem, and depressive reactions. Perceived support across relational contexts is highly predictive of favorable evaluations of attributes, high self-esteem, and true self-behavior within corresponding contexts. Strategies for resolving potential contradictions in self-attributes would appear to emerge as one moves into late adolescence and adulthood, when multiple self-representations are perceived as both appropriate and desirable, and the individual can achieve some degree of integration through higher level abstractions and the narrative construction of his or her life story.",

      "abstract": "ECONOMISTS generally take tastes as given and work out consequences of changes in prices, incomes, and other variables under assumption that tastes do not change. When pressed, either they engage in ad hoc theorizing or they explicitly delegate discussion of tastes to sociologist, psychologist, or anthropologist. Unfortunately, these disciplines have not developed much in way of systematic usable knowledge about tastes. Although economists have been reluctant to discuss systematically changes in structure of tastes, they have long relied on assumptions about basic and enduring properties of tastes. Self-interest is assumed to dominate all other motives,' with a prominent place also assigned to benevolence toward children2 (and occasionally others), and with self-interest partly dependent on distinction and other aspects of one's position in society.3 The dominance of self-interest and persistence of some benevolence have usually been explained by nature, or an equivalent evasion of problem. The development of modern biology since mid-nineteenth century and of population genetics in twentieth century made clear that is only beginning, not end of answer. The enduring traits of human (and animal) nature presumably were genetically selected under very different physical environments and social arrangements as life on earth evolved during millions of years. It is not difficult to understand why self-interest has high survival value under very different circumstances,4 but why should altruistic behavior, sometimes observed among animals as well as human beings, also survive? This kind of question has been asked by some geneticists and other biologists especially during last two decades. Their work has recently been christened sociI For example, Adam Smith said, We are not ready to suspect any person of being defective in selfishness [9, 1969, p. 446], and it is not from benevolence of butcher, brewer, or baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest [10, 1937, p. 14]. 2According to Alfred Marshall, . . men labor and save chiefly for sake of their families and not for themselves [6, 1920, p. 228]. 3Nassau Senior said, the desire for distinction . . . may be pronounced to be most powerful of human passions [8, 1938, p. 12]. 4Ronald Coase argues convincingly that Adam Smith, especially in his Moral Sentiments, was groping toward an explanation of importance of selfinterest in terms of its contribution to viable social and economic arrangements (see Coase [5, 1976]).",

      "title": "The Link of Childhood Abuse and Personality Pathology",
      "abstract": "Along with the advanced development of current society, personality disorders have attracted more attention. They can drive people to more stressful and unhealthy states. To develop corresponding treatments, studying the etiology of personality disorders is crucial. One proposed contributor is childhood maltreatment, which is pervasive and often result in severe damages to the victims. The childhood maltreatment basically can be divided into five types: physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, and mental neglect. Different types of maltreatment, the co-existence, and the severity may contribute to various degrees of personality disorders. Childhood maltreatment may not cause disorders directly but may be a mediator in this relationship instead. Common mediators in this link can be gender difference, relevant personality traits, and deviated attitudes toward self, such as consistent self-criticism. The existence of diversified mediators suggests that the relationship between child abuse and personality pathology can be a complex one. One of the limitations in the previous studies is that the methodology of most experiments is self-report. Although self-report can effectively reflect one’s personal experience, the subjectivity of self-report can lead to possible biases in the findings. Another limitation is that the sample size is not large and abundant enough. Plus, there is also a lack of tracking victims’ life experiences after the abuse, to understand how abuse can impact their daily lives. To address this limitation, future research should adopt longitudinal experimental designs. This review can provide some insights and clinical emphasis to the family intervention studies and practices for those children that are at risk of child abuse.",

      "title": "Social Anxiety as a Predictor of Dating Aggression",
      "abstract": "By far, most research on the behavior of socially anxious individuals has focused on the \"flight\" rather than the \"fight\" response described in the traditional conceptualization of anxiety. More recently, however, there has been some speculation and emerging evidence suggesting that social anxiety and aggression may be related. The present study examined social anxiety as a predictor of dating aggression within a late adolescent sample. Two forms of dating aggression were assessed: physical aggression, such as slapping, use of a weapon, or forced sexual activity, and psychological aggression, such as slamming doors, insulting, or refusing to talk to one's partner. One aspect of social anxiety, Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), emerged as a significant predictor of male dating aggression, even after controlling for relationship quality. Notably, FNE was most predictive of increased aggression of both types when men also perceived their romantic relationship to be more antagonistic. Despite its demonstrated importance as a contextual variable, however, relationship quality did not mediate the association between FNE and psychological or physical aggression. Implications for prevailing conceptualizations of social anxiety and dating aggression are discussed.",

      "title": "Adolescent School Failure: Failure to Thrive in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Success in school is an excellent marker for general adolescent well-being; school failure in adolescence is a powerful indicator of other high-risk behaviors, such as delinquency, substance abuse, and pregnancy. It is estimated that about 17% of White non-Hispanic children in the United States are at high or very high risk for these behaviors compared with 51% of African-American children and 45% of Hispanic children.It is difficult to consider any one of these high-risk behaviors in isolation because all can be antecedents to or consequences of any of the others. Lower grades, for example, are associated with substance abuse and early childbearing, and truancy and disruptive behavior at school are related to substance abuse and delinquency. Although there are many complex mitigating factors and pressures, most adolescents initially try hard drugs, commit a first delinquent act, or engage in unprotected intercourse as a personal decision at a given time and place.In contrast, school failure is more insidious, resulting from an array of forces, many of which are outside the control of the adolescent. It occurs at the end of a long process rather than at its initiation. Because school progress frequently is measured through grades and group achievement testing, there are many opportunities for preventive interventions. The ultimate marker of school failure is dropping out. In a sense, school failure and dropout can be viewed as failure to thrive of adolescence. Many of the etiologies for adolescent school failure can be viewed in both public health and medical model frameworks.Successful programs and interventions for adolescent high-risk behaviors largely address the antecedents to these behaviors rather than the behaviors themselves. The antecedents of school failure and subsequent dropping out, which are virtually the same, have been described by Dryfoos (see Suggested Reading) and are summarized in Table 1. Children who are 1 year older than classmates (behind 1 modal grade) have a 20% to 30% greater chance of dropping out of school, even when achievement, social status, and gender are controlled for. This should make clinicians skeptical of endorsing any recommendation for retention. Race and ethnicity cease to become factors in school dropout when social status is controlled for.In addition to the factors listed in Table 1, low self-concept and an external locus of control (believing that the\"winds of fate\" control one's destiny rather than the individual being able to bring about change) are significant predictors of school failure. Children and adolescents who have low self-esteem about their academic ability should be provided with individualized successful academic experiences. Youths who have an external locus of control can be provided with mentored learning experiences that demonstrate the relationship between their positive behaviors (such as sticking to a structured study schedule)and academic outcomes (including getting more work turned in and better test scores).The epidemiologic research (Table 1) cites conduct problems and \"behavior\"—referred to in the biobehavioral literature as externalizing behavior problems—as major predictors of school failure. At the same time,\"psychological factors,\" including stress and depression, are characterized as predictors that only are \"cited in selected sources\" in the literature. This may be explained by reporting bias. Externalizing behavior problems (oppositional and defiant behavior and conduct problems) are easily recognizable in the classroom and affect the ability of teachers to teach and learners to learn as well as the\"social ecology\" of the entire classroom. Internalizing behaviors(anxiety and depression), on the other hand, are not easily identified by teachers and peers and do not often interfere with general classroom functioning. It is strongly incumbent on clinicians to ask about and identify any internalizing behavior problems in adolescents who are performing poorly in school because the health-care system may be the only professional interface outside of school used by adolescents and their families that is prepared to diagnose and treat these symptoms.The relationship between household composition and school failure is inconsistent. For example, it is unclear whether single-parent households are correlated with higher rates of school failure or dropping out.Children from disadvantaged homes have been found to succeed in excellent schools. On the other hand, some schools are so inadequate that success is the exception. In one recent survey, almost 70% of adolescents who had dropped out of school stated that they might have stayed if\"teachers paid more attention to students\" and if \"we were not treated like inmates.\"Effective programs that prevent school failure and dropout share three major attributes: Early intervention programs such as Head Start and Early Childhood Special Education have focused successfully on the prevention of learning and developmental problems and educating parents in child development. Successful school-age programs have maintained a focus on basic academic skills and recognized the primary importance of a healthy school climate.Several years ago Dr Michael Rutter studied students making the transition from primary schools to middle schools in London. He found that the best students often did poorly when moved into the worst schools, while the poorer students often did well when placed in the best schools. The \"best\" schools could be characterized as emphasizing academics; allowing teachers autonomy to meet the educational needs of individual students; and having programmatic flexibility,systems of incentives and rewards for students, and systems that allow students to take responsibility for their own behaviors. In the United States, Dr James Comer has established a model school-based management approach in inner-city New Haven, Connecticut, and other cities. These schools have advisory councils consisting of the principal,teachers, teacher aides, and parent groups. They also have school-based mental health teams, paid parent participation programs, and a flexible academic program.Programs such as these provide for individualized attention and instruction for students and attract committed teachers who have high expectations. Links between learning and working (such as working in a nursing home and keeping a daily journal of this experience) have been found to be extremely effective in many programs. Some high-risk students require intensive, sustained counseling before they can take full advantage of these programs.Adolescents who are successful despite extremely high-risk profiles have been found to have specific interests and been supported in pursuing them; often have had some mentoring relationship that has encouraged them to believe in themselves; and have been described as self-aware, self-directed, and committed to interpersonal relationships.State-mandated promotion policies that rely solely on testing results are ineffective. Raising school standards without raising the quality of the schools simply encourages failure and dropout. Grouping classes by\"ability\" has uncertain benefits for the lowest achieving students at a potentially enormous psychological cost. Being labeled as \"below average\" can have a tremendously negative effect on students' self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are \"scared straight\" or\"moralized to\" almost always fail. The question should be: \"How do schools fail adolescents?\" rather than \"How do adolescents fail school?\"Factors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can \"functional disorders\" such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on \"street value.\"Afternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and \"coaching\"surrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent's problems being viewed as \"characterologic disorders\" rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual's achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as \"slow learners.\" They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including \"high-functioning autism,\"Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one's temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one's own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more \"medical model\"diagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent's behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the \"patient\" where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD\"triad\") can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent's consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good \"learning hygiene\"; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

Being labeled as “below average” can have a tremendously negative effect on students’ self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are “scared straight” or“moralized to” almost always fail. The question should be: “How do schools fail adolescents?” rather than “How do adolescents fail school?”Factors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can “functional disorders” such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on “street value.”Afternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and “coaching”surrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent’s problems being viewed as “characterologic disorders” rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual’s achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as “slow learners.” They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including “high-functioning autism,”Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one’s temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one’s own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more “medical model”diagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent’s behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the “patient” where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD“triad”) can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent’s consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good “learning hygiene”; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

      "title": "Some applications of delinquency theory to childhood accidents.",
      "abstract": "The past two decades have witnessed an increasing recognition on the part of the physician and the behavioral scientist that the state of a person's health--indeed, even his likelihood of surviving infancy or of being institutionalized for mental illness-is closely related to his social status and to the social, political, economic, and cultural characteristics of his community, his state, and his nation. With the growth of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, such purely biological phenomena as infant mortality, mental illness, malnutrition, and venereal disease have come to concern the sociologist and the anthropologist as strongly as they have the physician and the epidemiologist. Accidental injury and death, however, have to a large extent remained outside the sphere of interdisciplinary scrutiny. One reason for this neglect stems from the fact that data on accidental injury are so much less reliable than other health data as to be virtually unusable. Perhaps another reason is that the concept of an accident as an act of God persists in the minds of otherwise sophisticated persons--and acts of God seem somehow unrelated to the social and cultural environment in which they occur. Regardless of the reasons, however, the fact remains that, although a good deal is known about the socioeconomic and cultural conditions that influence the infant mortality rate, mental illness, and cardiovascular accidents, very little is known about the relationship between social conditions and the incidence of accidental injury and death. The following paper does nothing to advance our knowledge of this relationship. But it points out the gaps in our present knowledge, warns against pitfalls that are more familiar to behavioral than to medical scientists, and pleads for the application of sound sociological theory to a problem which is as much social as it is medical.

At this time, a person more likely to adjust to many changes that happen in life such as declining physical ability, death of husband or wife, or friends age, retirement, and face the empty cage (empty nest), When the elderly unable to adjust to these circumstances, the elderly will feel lonely, a feeling of emptiness in social relations marked by a feeling alienated, rejected, abandoned, worthless, and felt alienated in a common life with others so that individuals feel their social relationships unsatisfactory that ultimately led to individuals experienced a\r\ndecrease both physical and psychological health. Loneliness experienced by the elderly if left unchecked will lead to a protracted prolonged stress, which in akhinya will fall into a condition called the tendency of depression, a condition that refers to the mood or feeling of profound melancholy and gloomy because of the conditions that affect aspects of one's life. This research is aimed to know the relationship between feeling lonely with the tendency of depression in the elderly. The samples studied were elderly people aged from 60-80 at the United superannuated Republic of Indonesia (PWRI), which numbered 30 people. Sampling was purposive sampling.

      "abstract": "People typically believe they are more likely to engage in selfless, kind, and generous behaviors than their peers, a result that is both logically and statistically suspect. However, this oft-documented tendency presents an important ambiguity. Do people feel \"holier than thou\" because they harbor overly cynical views of their peers (but accurate impressions of themselves) or overly charitable views of themselves (and accurate impressions of their peers)? Four studies suggested it was the latter. Participants consistently overestimated the likelihood that they would act in generous or selfless ways, whereas their predictions of others were considerably more accurate. Two final studies suggest this divergence in accuracy arises, in part, because people are unwilling to consult population base rates when predicting their own behavior but use this diagnostic information more readily when predicting others'.",

We argue that such defensive tendencies are driven, in large part, by a fundamental motivation to protect the perceived worth and integrity of the self. Studies of social–political debate, health–risk assessment, and responses to team victory or defeat have shown that people respond to information in a less defensive and more open–minded manner when their self–worth is buttressed by an affirmation of an alternative source of identity. Self–affirmed individuals are more likely to accept information that they would otherwise view as threatening, and subsequently to change their beliefs and even their behavior in a desirable fashion. Defensive biases have an adaptive function for maintaining self–worth, but maladaptive consequences for promoting change and reducing social conflict.",

Intimacy scores were higher for respondents who mentioned a partner as most confidant relationship than for respondents who mentioned either a friend or a close relative. People living without a partner, whose most confidant relationship has little or no intimacy, and who express the desire for new relationships can, as a consequence, be characterized as people with a high probability of loneliness.

So itâ€™s higher and greater.In my opinion what in popular called Love is attraction of two opposite personality and some part of its reasons is oppositeness affect and its why it results failing.",

      "abstract": "The subject of human behavior may seem vague and indefinite to the man of science who is accustomed to dealing with specific phenomena. This is in large part due to the fact that human behavior is an expression of the most complex organization in the world. There are so many implications in human behavior that individual aspects of it have been developed into separate and distinct sciences, such as psychology, sociology, economics, etc. Moreover, the medical man entering this field is confronted with the necessity of considering facts and points of view which are more or less foreign to medicine. This gives rise to the appearance of disharmony if not of direct opposition among those who work on the problem. Fortunately, there is no real clash between the various departments of science. There need be no attempt to supplant the older professions which have dealt with the behavior problem; on",

      "abstract": "A surprising number of men report a lack of sexual desire, with conservative estimates ranging between 15 and 25% of adult males. Statistics do not adequately convey the intricacies of male sexual desire; it is a complex construct, encompassing interest, arousal and motivation for initiating or responding to sexual cues for dyadic or solitary sexual behaviors. A range of etiological factors are implicated in this dysfunction, and relational conflict and stress are high among them. Anger and resentment for one's partner can result in absent desire for the partner, with sexual desire still intact for other sexual outlets (other partners, masturbation, pornography). Sexual secrets are therefore important to consider as well as shame about the true nature of one's sexual desires. Systemic sex therapy, with its emphasis on identifying and addressing a wide range of etiological factors while also focusing on behavioral interventions to improve desire, is an effective treatment option for men suffering low desire in the context of an ongoing relationship.",

Many self-identified bisexuals hold the view that their identity is not dependent on their current relationship status or their sexual practice in any particular period of their life. Monogamous non-bisexual partners often create anxieties, if a bisexual person insists on maintaining a public bisexual identity. Differences in income and social and cultural capital create divisions in lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer families as much as in heterosexual relationships. Many bisexual people commit themselves to monogamous partnerships. Bisexuals who wish to be non-monogamous and polyamorous frequently have to negotiate a range of issues in their relationships. Common anti-bi sentiments complicate bisexual identification, bisexual coming or being 'out' and the maintenance of bisexual intimacies.",

      "title": "Social Loneliness after Divorce: Time-Dependent Differential Benefits of Personality, Multiple Important Group Memberships, and Self-Continuity",
      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Critical events in the second half of life, such as divorce, pose a significant threat to well-being. Individuals undergoing divorce often experience feelings of social loneliness and may benefit differently from available resources depending on how much time has passed since the event. Personality traits have been found to be related to adaptation, with particularly strong effects immediately after the critical event. Other resources, such as identity-stabilizing mechanisms (i.e., valued social groups and self-continuity), may play a role only later in adaptation. However, little is known about the benefits of these resources and their potentially time-dependent effects on social loneliness when one is overcoming later-life divorce. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This study investigates the role of psychological (e.g., personality, self-continuity, multiple important group memberships) and social resources (e.g., new partner, having someone to help deal with divorce) for social loneliness in two post-divorce phases, using a married group as the reference, controlling for sociodemographic aspects and health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A representative sample of 850 divorced (aged 40–79 years) and 869 married individuals (aged 40–78 years) living in Switzerland were compared, using multiple regression analyses. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Differential predictive patterns for social loneliness between the two divorced groups and the married group were observed. For the short-term divorced (up to 2 years after divorce), higher extroversion and agreeableness and lower neuroticism were associated with lower levels of loneliness. For the long-term divorced (2–5 years after divorce) and for those who remained married, extroversion was similarly important for loneliness. Additionally, higher levels of self-continuity and multiple group memberships predicted lower loneliness, but the short-term divorced did not benefit from them. Having someone to help overcome the divorce benefited members of both divorced groups. A new partner was related to less loneliness, but only in the long-term divorced group. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Our findings demonstrate that the effects of psychological and social resources on social loneliness vary by adaptation phase. Although extroversion is beneficial for all divorced and married individuals, other personality traits play a more decisive role in the initial adaptation phase. Identity-promoting resources (i.e., multiple group memberships, perceived self-continuity) are beneficial only later in the adaptation process. To be successful, professional interventions must be tailored as needed.",

      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is not only an individual health issue but also a public health issue. While sexual abuse is a physical and psychological health issue for an individual, with multiple and varied repercussions, it also involves aspects of the earliest bonds, the bonds of attachment, since it usually takes place within the family circle. In light of three clinical case studies, the article discusses the concept of destructiveness both generally and specifically in situations of sexual abuse, in order to propose some key points concerning the child’s speech during treatment. It should be pointed out that the child, whether or not he or she confides in the clinician, is often psycho-traumatized. Destructiveness relates to the destructive nature of a living or non-living element and, more generally, to the ability to destroy. In connection with this notion, we can generally observe so-called gravity factors and other so-called protective factors, which are likely to coexist. If the former are more substantial, there is a high probability that the symptoms will be debilitating and long-lasting, and we note that they may worsen over time or appear in a delayed manner. If the protective factors are substantial, then the child is more likely to experience mild trauma and more or less rapid healing.",

      "abstract": "While domestic violence and child abuse are known to be highly correlated, several related areas of functioning of children are not well researched on and have implications for the provision of services. A complex pattern of results documented high levels of abuse and associated trauma disorders in children. Being exposed to violence in the home during war increases risk of developing problems in mental health and psychosocial wellbeing (MHPSW), a small but robust evidence base shows that. Studies reveal that living with domestic violence can cause physical and emotional harm to children and young people in the following ways: Ongoing anxiety and depression, emotional distress, eating and sleeping disturbances. Conversely, this evidence shows that supportive parenting can be a protective factor against the demonstrated negative effects of war on children´s mental health. Evidence from multiple sources increasingly shows that exposure to war alone cannot account for how children exposed to similar war events experience different mental and psychosocial states and trajectories. Other factors, including home life, provide complementary, at times even better, explanations In fact, in many cases, factors that traumatize children stem not only from war events, but also from everyday hardships. Home life can be a moderator, and potentially a mediator, of the effects of war.",

      "abstract": "The controversy regarding recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been characterized by two perspectives. According to one perspective, some people repress their memories of abuse because these experiences have been so emotionally traumatic, and they become capable of recalling the CSA only when it is psychologically safe to do so many years later. According to the other perspective, many reports of recovered memories of sexual abuse are false memories, often inadvertently fostered by therapists. In this article, we provide evidence for a third interpretation that applies to a subset of people reporting recollections of CSA; it does not require the concepts of repression, trauma, or false memory. These people did not experience their CSA as traumatic; they either failed to think about their abuse for years or forgot their previous recollections, and they recalled their CSA spontaneously after encountering reminders outside of psychotherapy. Their recovered memories are corroborated at the same rate as those of people who never forgot their abuse. Hence, recalling CSA after many years is not the same thing as having recalled a previously repressed memory of trauma.",

      "title": "It is not just ‘the opposite of jealousy’: a Buddhist perspective on the emotion of compersion in consensually non-monogamous relationships",
      "abstract": "Abstract Compersion is an affective state commonly discussed in the context of consensually non-monogamous relationships. It is typically described as a positive emotional reaction to one’s partner’s enjoying time and/or intimacy with another person, sort of ‘the opposite of jealousy’. Recent years have seen an increased interest in this seemingly startling emotion. Part of what makes understanding compersion so difficult is the mononormative expectations of our culture. We suggest that a non-Western, in particular Buddhist, perspective might be more helpful to understand that love and/or intimacy need not be an affair between two people only. We approach compersion through a Buddhist lens based on the ‘four immeasurables’, i.e. non-egocentric states that Buddhists take to promote well-being, and their ‘near enemies’, i.e. states which are easily conflated with them, but egocentric and harmful. Our goal is not to formulate a definition of compersion, nor to raise a normative bar for anyone who feels compersion, but to describe important facets of it that stand out more clearly against a Buddhist background than they might otherwise do. Such an approach not only enriches our understanding of compersion but contributes to people’s flourishing in all kinds of relationships and shows that non-monogamous relationships might be compatible with some forms of Buddhist practice.",

      "abstract": "Research on romantic jealousy is consistent with the idea that jealousy is, at least in part, the product of threats to attachment relationships. Attachment theory was used as a framework for examining individual differences in the ways in which people experience and express jealousy. Emotional, behavioral, and cognitive concomitants of romantic jealousy were related to differences in attachment style in ways consistent with attachment theory. For example, anxious participants were relatively more likely than others to resist expressing their anger, avoidant participants were especially likely to turn their anger and blame against the interloper, and securely attached participants were especially likely to express anger toward the partner and to maintain their relationship. Differences in attachment style, not just differences in level of security, are predictive of qualitative individual differences in jealousy experiences.",

      "title": "Stand tall against shortcomings",
      "abstract": "News headlines are frequently dominated by accounts of high profile, seemingly respected individuals accused of personal or professional shortcomings. Illegal or immoral activities appear to be commonplace for those who are well established and have excelled in their careers. What ignites poor decision making among people who appear to have everything? Do they understand that their actions may result in dramatic untoward effects on their careers and personal lives? Is bad behavior generated from a sense of entitlement?FigureWhether it's elected officials who've accepted bribes or the revelation of the tumultuous affairs of sports figures, a common thread appears to be that the individuals involved all developed a strong self-confidence and an overinflated ego—both rationalized by a sense of entitlement. Many individuals who have their trespasses exposed believe that because of their societal rank, they no longer have to follow a standard set of rules or behaviors reserved for those who are less successful than they are. Nurses aren't immune from making poor professional choices. Some nurses have a tendency to believe that because of their tenure within an organization or their years of experience, they should be pardoned from the basic expectations of their positions. Minor infractions might include taking longer than allowed breaks, tardiness, excessive absenteeism, or inappropriately verbalizing their frustrations. As nurse managers we need to be consistent on how we deal with these issues. Both senior and junior nurses within the department will be carefully examining the situation to see if you distinguish the manner in which the issue is handled. Your credibility will be severely damaged if your actions aren't consistent for all and appropriate for the situation. Nurses need to fully understand that they're in a profession that's governed by regulatory agencies. Failure to fully comply with established principles and guidelines may yield detrimental results. Breaches in practice such as failing to sign opioid wastage, writing orders from physicians without appropriate authorization, and making clinical decisions outside the scope of practice are all examples of behaviors that aren't only wrong, but may be illegal as well. Failure to follow established principles in behavior may not only result in losing a job, but also culminate in the forfeiture of a state nursing license or even imprisonment. As nurse leaders we need to appreciate that our role in the organization doesn't abdicate our responsibility to consistently act in a manner that's in accordance with the standards of the profession. It's imperative for us to role model conduct that's of the highest standards and not fall prey to believing that the leadership role we hold allows us to behave inappropriately. Most nurse managers are responsible for managing millions of dollars and leading many team members. The highest degree of integrity and honesty must be consistently practiced to maintain a safe and fair work setting. Tenured team members and leaders commonly receive privileges that more junior members need to earn. Seniority benefits commonly include higher salaries, better parking, more vacation time, and other earned rewards dependent on the social and economic status of the organization. These types of privileges should be preserved and enhanced but shouldn't jeopardize the organization's integrity. The benefits that senior staff and leaders receive should be based on the wisdom they impart to others. Experience should never be construed as an authorization to act in a manner that's inconsistent with established standards and principles of the profession.FigureRichard Hader [email protected]",

These traits are perceived in ways that create experiences and risks of stigmatisation, discrimination, violence and harmful medical practices intended to promote social and familial integration. Like all stigmatised populations, a range of different language is used to describe intersex bodies, but many individuals with these traits lack a vocabulary to understand themselves. Dominant frameworks treat people with intersex traits as disordered and in need of fixing and/or as an 'other' category of sex, in need of recognition. Neither approach respects the diversity of the population and differing personal values and preferences. Specific traits are sometimes associated with specific health issues, frequently including innate or iatrogenic infertility, while one trait can be fatal if not medicated. Attempts to promote the right to bodily integrity seek to distinguish medical interventions to promote physical health and wellbeing from harmful but still prevalent interventions grounded in gender stereotypes or ideas about social and familial integration. A small but growing number of jurisdictions are taking action to promote bodily integrity and the right to health.",

      "abstract": "For many people with disabilities or defects, the central probelm they confront is not the disability or defect itself, but a diminished sense of their own identity as persons. It is the social manifestation of disability or defect as handicap, and the effect which a particular social formation permits or encourages this to have on their acceptance, and consequently on their self-acceptance, which tends to dominate consciousness. Explanations for this vary. Goffman has argued that disabilities and defects, in so far as they are visible, 'stigmatize' the individual, 'cutting him off from society and from himself so that he stands a discredited person facing an unaccepting world'.3 Other writers4 emphasize less deliberate factors. More than others, people with disabilities and defects are confronted by incompatible role-expectations which, depending on the extent of the disability or defect, conduces to psychic conflict and maladjustment. On this view, greater problems attend those whose disabilities or defects are only moderate. Both accounts have some explanatory power, and it is probably inadvisable to expect a single statement to cover all the facts. Indeed, in view of the great range of disabilities and defects which express themselves as handicaps, some variation in the way they operate as threats to personal identity is only to be expected.",

      "abstract": "The nonrandom pattern of both marital violence and child maltreatment across cultures suggests that such behaviors may have been adaptive in certain past environments. Biological and psychosocial concepts and principles form the basis for a biosocial theory of family violence. In evolutionary theory, the twin concepts of parental investment and paternity certainty suggest the existence of endemic conflicts of interest within marital pairs and between parents and offspring. A biosocial perspective suggests that the probability of marital violence increases when ecological instability leads to the erosion of structural buffers (such as kin support or sex segregation), to changes-or perceived changes-in the marital balance of power, and to the development of coercive patterns of marital communication. Common social indicators of marital violence, underemployment, financial pressures, anxiety, and alcohol abuse can be conceptualized as markers of ecological instability or its consequences. Child maltreatment may have functioned in circumstances of ecological instability to optimize the reproductive fitness of parents. Even when maltreatment of children is nonadaptive or maladaptive, it occurs more frequently under conditions marked by ecological disturbances associated with rising levels of stress and reliance on coercion in family relationships. Mating and parenting behavior should be especially sensitive to circumstances indicative of ecological instability.",

      "title": "STRESS FACED BY RESIDENTS 1981",
      "abstract": "Surveys and controlled studies have indicated that personal identity conflicts, sleep deprivation, and financial difficulties are three prominent stresses that residents face. Failure to adapt results in decreased performance, increased marital discord, and substance abuse. A sense of identity comes primarily from inner feelings, but one's education and how one is viewed by society are perhaps equally important. When interns begin their year, they frequently identify themselves as “healers” who will significantly help their fellow man. In return, they expect to be treated with respect and to take home a healthy income. It is not long into their internship when the reality of long hours, the deprivations of meager income, and the nuisances of demanding patients and attending physicians imprint a mental image at odds with their expectations. Confusion followed by decreased performance appears to be the first effect of this awakening. Depression, marital difficulty, and substance abuse soon follow. Resolution of identity conflicts may not take place until late in the residency as the individual struggles with various and often conflicting roles (physician, student, employee, faculty, parent, spouse). Maturation might occur more readily if residency programs focused both on aiding the resident's coping mechanisms and on decreasing environmental stress. The availability of faculty advisors, counselors, and retreats addresses the former. Of more recent interest, and likely more effective, are efforts towards reducing work loads, providing quieter and more private call rooms, increasing salaries, and improving benefits.",

      "title": "Cheating in relationships – literature review",
      "abstract": "Defining the concept of infidelity in relationships has posed significant challenges for many researchers. By synthesizing their views, one can assume that infidelity encompasses any actions hidden from a partner, involving a third party, which violate the emotional, sexual, or romantic exclusivity of the relationship. Nowadays, it seems appropriate to categorize infidelity into sexual, emotional, mixed, and online types. Determining the frequency of infidelity is problematic due to discrepancies in various studies’ results, primarily stemming from cultural differences among the studied populations. Nonetheless, it is expected that this phenomenon affects 20-50% of relationships, occurring more frequently in non-marital relationships, although this difference appears to be gradually diminishing. The causes of infidelity are diverse, primarily arising from the unmet emotional or sexual needs of an individual by their partner. However, infidelity can also occur due to factors beyond the partner’s control, such as favorable circumstances. Factors that increase the likelihood of infidelity include being male and having higher education and income, as these factors lead to encountering more situations that facilitate infidelity. The impact of technological development on the occurrence of infidelity in relationships cannot be overlooked – practically every third internet user utilizes it for sexual purposes. Infidelity has consequences for relationships, often being the most common cause of their dissolution, as well as for the individuals involved. Those who are betrayed often experience anger and symptoms typical of a depressive episode and suicidal thoughts may also occur.",

      "title": "Asexuality: An Introduction for Questioning Clients",
      "abstract": "Asexuality—defined as the lifelong and nonpathological lack of sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender—is increasingly being recognized as a valid sexual orientation. For gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, this questioning phase is often triggered by feeling sexual attraction to someone of the same sex or gender; however, for asexual individuals, questioning may start with the realization that the person does not feel—and has never felt—sexual attraction to anyone, regardless of sex or gender. Thus, psychotherapists and other counselors have an ethical duty to respect their clients’ sexual orientation and not to discriminate against, deny service to, or demean clients on the basis of sexual orientation. Because asexuality is newly recognized as a sexual orientation, however, relatively few resources exist on cultural competency with asexual or potentially asexual clients. Finally, asexual individuals may have to navigate the implications of their asexuality in terms of cultural and social expectations for sex, relationships, and childbearing.",

      "title": "Who is hurting whom: Self-harm in adolescence",
      "abstract": "In adolescence, the system of values, the ways to find pleasure, the experience of being loved, being a male or a female, are put to the test due to the presence of sexually mature body. In many cases, what goes relatively smoothly in normal development can be stressful for some adolescents. Despite that, adolescents find ways to respond and to use their experiences constructively, in an effort and with a desire to enter the social and sexual world of adults. Still, there are adolescents whose experiences are completely different and whose adolescence is riddled with problems. They live haunted by their own fantasies and no matter how much they try to keep the cause of suffering or hatred outside themselves, they inevitably face the experience of their bodies being the source of abnormality and of not being able to do much else but giving in to illness. Crucial change that should take place in adolescence for an individual to reach psychic maturity is the weakening of relations with primary objects, which enables the creation of new object relations. In self-harming adolescents, however, there is inability to give up the bond with the mother - any internal attempt to break this bond brings the feeling of unbearable loss. Basically, the adolescent's relationship with their mother is highly ambivalent, and the feelings fluctuate from intense hatred to intense love. Careful monitoring brings up the conclusion that these are narcissistic personalities with primitive and punishing superego. In this article, we have used the psychoanalytic theoretical concepts as a basis for understanding the psychopathology and psychodynamics of adolescents whose act of intentional and conscious attacking of one's own body is one of the main reasons for seeking psychiatric help, which will be illustrated by presenting individual and milieu therapy of an adolescent girl treated at the Day Hospital for Adolescents of the Institute of Mental Health.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy is a very specific and complex period in a woman’s life. The accompanying changes are observed not only on the biological/physiological plane but also in her psychological and social functioning. Altered psychological functioning can occur from the very beginning to the end of pregnancy, including the postpartum period. During pregnancy, visible changes occur in the body's appearance, as well as in femininity, affections, and sexuality, whereas the woman's position and role are gaining new qualities. To a greater or lesser degree, every expectant mother experiences psychological am­bivalence, frequent mood changes from exhaustion to exaltation, emotional disturbances, and/or mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. In addition, pregnancy causes a number of specific apprehensions concerning the course and outcome, which makes the woman particularly vulnerable and requires adequate treatment, depending on the adaptive capacities of her personality. Furthermore, from a psychosocial aspect, pregnancy could be considered a specific highly emotional state, which may be a potent stressor. Perinatal maternal stress can lead to different complications that may have far-reaching consequences for both somatic and psychic functioning of the newborn. This review considers pregnancy as a complex psychological phenomenon and explores multiple changes in the woman's psychological functioning in both normal and psychologically complicated courses of pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper reviews some of the economic experimental evidence on conformism. There is nothing to match the early psychology experiments where subjects were often swayed by the behaviour of others to an extraordinary degree, but there is plenty of evidence of conformism. This seems built-in to our sociality either because we have preferences for conversation or status which are activated by the knowledge of what others do, or because other people face relevantly similar decisions to our own and so that their behaviour signals something useful to us about the uncertain world. These social influences can cause mischief. The more worrying cases, however, are those where individual preferences themselves change through interaction with others: the strongest experimental evidence for this is with respect to individual social preferences, particularly in a context where individuals belong to different groups.",

      "title": "Behavioral Intervention with Child Abuse and Neglect",
      "abstract": "The range of factors identified as related to child maltreatment has expanded over the years. The literature clearly calls for an ecological approach in which individual, family, community, and societal factors are considered. The behavioral literature to date reflects an unevenness in terms of acceptance of such an approach. Studies are also uneven concerning the faithfulness with which hallmarks of a behavioral approach have been applied. These include individually tailored assessment and intervention based on empirical data and planning for generalization and maintenance. Most intervention programs do attend to positive as well as negative parent behaviors. Little attention is devoted to environmental characteristics, such as poverty level incomes and impoverished social support systems that may contribute to maltreatment. Lack of comprehensive assessment and intervention programs is no doubt responsible for the modest changes described in many reports. Behavioral studies suffer from uncritical acceptance of the term \"abuse\" or \"at risk\" in a number of ways, one of which is a failure to clearly describe the nature of the alleged maltreatment and the immediate situational context. Another is in the assumption that one particular factor is responsible for the maltreatment, such as ineffective parenting skills. Too often a label identifies only one characteristic of a person, ignoring other attributes and related factors. Like all deviant labels, the poor and minority groups are more likely to receive negative labels (Newberger et al., 1976). Investigaters have not taken advantage of relevant literature in the area of child welfare. Familiarity with this material would be helpful in avoiding myths in the field to which many have fallen prey, such as the myth of classlessness of child maltreatment. Acceptance of this myth interferes with the development of programs that deal with difficult environmental problems. Reports suggest that a behavioral approach is promising. Attention to enhancement of child management skills is supported by research that shows that most abuse occurs as an extension of parental discipline attempts. A focus on describing the relationships between behaviors of concern and what happens before and afterward has yielded valuable information concerning interaction patterns in abusive, neglectful, and normal families. Advantages of viewing child abuse in the general context of family interaction are illustrated by the work of Patterson and his colleagues and by Gelles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Prenatal alcohol exposure produces a broad range of primary disabilities that lead to adverse life course outcomes in children raised in adverse environments. Inappropriate sexual behaviors are a commonly occurring secondary disability, with a large minority of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) displaying sexual aggression. Adults with FASD who commit repeated criminal sexual acts may be subject to legal proceedings for indefinite involuntary civil confinement as sexually violent predators/persons (SVP) in certain jurisdictions in the United States. Studies about the diagnostic practices among psychologists and psychiatrists retained by states to evaluate individuals as SVP do not recognize FASD as a mental disorder, despite the likelihood that hundreds of individuals petitioned for involuntary commitment suffer from FASD. Establishing an FASD diagnosis may provide exculpatory evidence to refute a government petition that an individual suffers from a mental condition that affects emotional or volitional capacity by predisposing the person to committing criminal sexual behavior. This article provides a framework for identifying, assessing, and deciding whether individuals with the FASD diagnosis suffer from the legally defined mental disorder that is necessary to indefinitely confine individuals as SVP.",

      "title": "The Impact of Individual Differences on Accuracy,Confidence, and Punitive Judgements forEyewitness Testimony of Domestic Violence",
      "abstract": "Previous research has predominantly focused on physical aspects of crimes that impact the\r\nreliability and accuracy of eyewitness testimony, such as the influence of proximity and visibility.\r\nThere is a lack of research examining whether combinations of individual differences impact on how\r\nwitnesses interpret and recall the events of a crime. This could have potential implications for the\r\nreliability of any subsequent eyewitness testimonies that are used during criminal investigations.\r\nPrevious research has identified differences in relation to variables such as gender, age, and ethnicity\r\non eyewitness accuracy and confidence, when examined individually. Additionally, some alternative\r\nresearch has identified that gender can impact on punitive judgements. The current thesis explores\r\ncombinations of individual differences (gender, age, personality) and their impact on eyewitness\r\naccuracy, confidence, and punitive judgements in one thesis, as these are all inherent in any\r\neyewitness. If eyewitnesses are perceived as being overly accurate or overly inaccurate and their\r\ntestimonies do not support this perception, this could have negative consequences for the Criminal\r\nJustice System as unreliable evidence may be used in court proceedings and be subject to a jury’s\r\ninterpretation. This thesis aimed to explore how individual differences (gender, age, personality)\r\nimpacted on eyewitness accuracy, confidence, and punitive judgements of domestic violence. To\r\nexplore this, 590 participants comprising of 232 male and 358 female participants aged between 18 –\r\n70 years (M = 33.10, SD = 13.27) were shown mock video footage depicting domestic violence\r\nscenarios comprising different condition combinations of clarity and perpetrator gender. Participants\r\nwere subsequently questioned about their recall, confidence, and perceptions of the footage. Substudies\r\nthen examined; a) overall accuracy and how this was impacted by the different conditions, b)\r\nrelationships between accuracy and eyewitness confidence across the different conditions, c) how\r\ncondition, accuracy and confidence influenced punitive judgements regarding the footage, and d) how\r\nindividual differences facilitated the relationships between the various measures. The findings\r\nrevealed that age and personality significantly impacted the accuracy of participants; however, this\r\nwas not the case for gender, clarity, and perpetrator gender. Additionally, the results demonstrated\r\nthat there was a significant positive correlation between accuracy and confidence, as well as\r\nsignificant correlations between accuracy and confidence and factors such as age and personality. It\r\nwas also indicated that participant gender, personality, clarity, and perpetrator gender impacted on\r\nparticipant responses to punitive judgements. The findings also showed that accuracy and confidence\r\nratings impacted on the responses and punitive judgements. To conclude, this research examined\r\nhow individual differences impacted upon accuracy, confidence, and punitive judgements, as well as\r\nlooking at these components in combination with each other. This was to gain a better understanding\r\nof how witnesses of domestic violence may perceive and interpret the incident. The findings showed\r\nparticipants had a positive bias towards female victims of domestic violence compared with male\r\nvictims in relation to punitive judgements. This research provided evidence to suggest that examining\r\nindividual differences in combination with crime scene factors can allow for a better understanding of\r\nhow witnesses interpret domestic violence and how individual factors and personal attributes may\r\ninfluence this. Therefore, from this research it is suggested that by examining the individual\r\ndifferences of witnesses and understanding the prejudices that may be linked to the incident\r\nwitnessed, greater insight may be provided into flaws in eyewitness testimony.",

      "title": "The Idea of a Right to Genetic Privacy",
      "abstract": "Genetic information is information about a person’s genes. That is to say, it is information about the biological material, not the biological material itself.[ Unfortunately, access to genetic information about a person on the part of other people or institutions may affect that person negatively. First, genetic information is relevant to a person’s health now and in the future, which means that a person with a genetic condition has reason to fear that he will meet with negative reactions from employers, insurance companies, the government, and others. Second, if, as seems to be the case, genetic information is also relevant to a person’s behavior, we have reason to fear that criminals with a genetic condition may be acquitted on the ground that they were thought not to be responsible for what they had done, and that individuals with a genetic make-up that would likely make them criminals will be rounded up and treated before they have committed any crime. Third, it is likely that the result of one person’s genetic test will be of interest to other people (his siblings, for example), and that therefore there will be disputes about who is entitled to know the results of the test. The question I want to consider in this article is whether the idea of a right to genetic privacy can be a useful analytical tool in the analysis of moral or legal problems that concern genetic information. For example, is an employer or an insurance company or a researcher who gains access to genetic information about a person from a DNA data bank guilty of violating his right to privacy? Is an employer who requires that his employees undergo genetic testing guilty of violating their right to privacy? Does a law that interferes with a person’s decision-making regarding personal, genetic issues violate his right to privacy? Etc. Some authors seem to think so, arguing as they do that our access to genetic information about other people ought to be circumscribed with the help of specific genetic privacy laws. I am inclined to agree, and I am going to argue that the idea of a right to genetic privacy, conceived of as a special case of the idea of a general right to privacy, can indeed be a useful analytical tool in the analysis of such problems, provided that we understand that right as a claim-right that covers so-called informational and physical privacy and nothing more.",

      "title": "Inter-Role Conflict and Mental Health in Early Adulthood Females",
      "abstract": "Inter-role conflict is one of the most common and challenging realities. It occurs when an individual faces dual demands from different roles, and the situation is likely to cause a lot of psychological strains. This kind of conflict was most prevalent among females in the early adulthood age of development, a period that involves a turning point to other important developmental tasks in life such as procurement of employment, further educational pursuits, and formation of settlement or marriage. Work and family responsibilities become intertwined during this phase, as the drive for career advancement merges with other obligations, potentially impacting one's health. The effects of inter-role conflict on mental health can be significant, impacting such outcomes as anxiety, depression, and stress. Anxiety might manifest itself through constant apprehension or a low probability of performing well in one or more positions. At the same time, depression can cause a lack of self-worth and a negative outlook on life. Such mental health issues can lead to maladjustment in behavior, which means that one can become less productive at work as well as seclusion in their relationships. Inter-role conflict, if persistent, causes chronic stress, which worsens these concerns and may lead to irreversible mental health problems. This review also explores the impact of inter-role conflict on mental health outcomes and explores potential strategies to mitigate these effects. Some realistic approaches to reducing the psychological load include time management, role prioritization, and seeking social support. This literature review emphasizes the importance of psychological strategies from existing literature to help young women manage their roles more effectively. Therefore, by integrating literature from the existing research, this study illuminates how inter-role conflict affects early adulthood females’ mental health with a focus on coping strategies.",

Relevant empirical data, however, have been limited, impressionistic, methodologically questionable, or limited to historically prominent figures. Survey data from the GSS and a study of affirmatively non-theistic and irreligious secular group affiliates in the U.S. do not provide evidence of disproportionately high rates of early parental loss among individuals who describe themselves as “atheist(ic)” or “anti-religious,” reject belief in God, or express strong anger about religion. Loss of a parent or other loved may play a role in turns toward, as well as away from, God and religion for some. There is also evidence of comparatively high rates of parental loss in the lives of historically prominent figures, both religious and non-religious. Present results, however, do not support the hypothesis that early loss is a disproportionately frequent experience in the lives of (“ordinary”) atheistic or irreligious people.",

      "title": "“He’s too much of a man to do that”: The role of masculine identities and self-conscious emotions in men’s help-seeking in preventative health",
      "abstract": "Despite lower life expectancy than women and higher likelihood of premature death from disease, men are reluctant to access preventative health services. Such services are transformative and aim to improve consumer well-being, usually through the co-creation of value between the service and the consumer in an interactive process, such as consumer attendance at a cancer screening clinic and participating in a screening procedure. However, the potential value of some services is not always realised, for example when men reject bowel cancer screening services. Gender literature theorises that men demonstrate their masculinity through their health beliefs and behaviours, which are usually unhealthy or risky. Health literature has found that male consumers cite threat to masculinity and emotions like embarrassment and guilt as barriers to help-seeking and accessing preventative health services. Emotions such as embarrassment, guilt and shame are examples of emotions known as self-conscious emotions and are usually triggered by self-representations or identity goals. Self-conscious emotions are important in social marketing for transformative services as they motivate people’s feelings, thoughts and behaviours. To date, there is sparse literature that examines the role of different masculine identities for men’s help-seeking and the role of self-conscious emotions and masculine identities in mature men’s help-seeking for preventative health. Through thematic analysis of five focus groups with mature men (N=39), this research identified seven key masculine identities for men’s help-seeking from 12 Jungian male archetypes, particularly the Thinker and Caregiver for positive help-seeking, and the Outlaw and Ruler for negative help-seeking. Three key themes of masculinity for the key masculine identities and their help-seeking behaviours were identified: role in family, normative influences and stoicism and self-reliance. The research also found three themes of masculinity that triggered self-conscious emotions for the key masculine identities: head of family role, agency and power, and toughness and stoicism. The themes of masculinity also lead to regulation of self-conscious emotions through either positive or negative help-seeking behaviours. The contribution of this research includes traditional masculine identities that: obstruct or promote healthy men’s help-seeking behaviour, regulate self-conscious emotions for men’s positive or negative help-seeking, and regulate self-conscious emotions through negative help-seeking behaviours because of masculine ideals of agency and power.",

      "title": "Antenatal Stress and Anxiety, Effects on Behavioural and Cognitive Outcomes for the Child, and the Role of the HPA Axis",
      "abstract": "There is now good evidence from several prospective studies that antenatal maternal stress, anxiety or depression can have long term consequences for the development of the fetus and the child. There can be a wide range of effects and both behavioural and cognitive outcomes can be altered. Such fetal programming is independent of the postnatal environment, although the nature of maternal care may have a modifying influence. The effects are clinically significant; about 15% of behavioural problems such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be attributable to prenatal stress. Not all children are affected, and those that are can be affected in different ways. Presumably there is an interaction with the genetic predisposition, but this has not yet been studied. There is little agreement about the gestational windows of vulnerability, which are probably different for different outcomes. Also we do not know the nature of the stress which is most harmful, although there is some evidence that stress due to a bad relationship with the partner is damaging, and anxiety has greater influence than depression. In animal models there is good evidence for the mediating effects of the HPA axis in both mother and fetus. In humans the evidence is less clear. Several studies have found little or no association between anxiety or depression and maternal cortisol in later pregnancy. However we have found an inverse association between amniotic fluid cortisol and child cognitive ability at 17 months, which is only apparent in insecurely attached children.",

      "abstract": "The gerontological literature provides a variety of examples of successful adaptive process among older widows. Janoff-Bulman (1992) proposed a particularly useful theoretical perspective on trauma and loss, one that lends itself well to an examination of infidelity. Stories abound of well-meaning persons who attempt to tell a friend about the infidelity of the friend's relationship partner, only to be met with incredulity, denial, and a tendency to blame the messenger. Relationship commitment does not automatically imply relationship exclusivity. An exclusive relationship provides a very unique and unifying context in which partners share intimate aspects of their lives with each other in ways that are not expressed or experienced with anyone else. The relationship between jealousy and attitudes toward exclusivity is a serious issue due to the potential consequences of jealousy, particularly male sexual jealousy.",

      "abstract": "Promiscuity, sometimes referred to as unrestricted sexual behaviour, can be defined as a set of attitudes towards uncommitted sex, past behavioural experiences with different partners and heightened sexual interest. The level of promiscuity has often been associated with feelings of loneliness that can be characterised by deficiency of (certain) high-quality social relations and subjective negative experiences. As such, the two constructs were frequently investigated among men who have sex with men (MSM), yet the ideas of attachment theory have not been considered yet, when trying to explain the underlying processes. MSM are still a labelled part of our society, especially when it comes to sexual risk behaviour, which may cause the transmission of HIV and other sexual diseases that are prevalent in this population, so it seems important to approach the issue with proper psychological tools and data. In this study it is hypothesized that insecure attachment models of MSM are associated with i. higher loneliness scores, as well as ii. higher promiscuity scores. Underlying motives, processes and prevention goals are discussed. Since the study is still in progress, up-to-date results will be presented at the congress.",

      "title": "La competencia emocional como recurso inhibidor para la perpetración del maltrato psicológico en la pareja",
      "abstract": "La violencia contra la pareja constituye, actualmente, la forma mas alarmante de violencia interpersonal. Sin embargo, a pesar de la magnitud del fenomeno, existe una tendencia general a restringir el foco de interes a la dimension fisica del mismo. De esta forma el estudio del maltrato psicologico es relegado a un segundo plano, ignorando aquellos trabajos que evidencian la presencia de agresiones psicologicas con secuelas de gravedad equiparada o superior a las de naturaleza fisica, aunque las primeras presenten una mayor dificultad en su deteccion.Diferentes investigaciones establecen una vinculacion entre una amplia gama de sintomas psicologicos y comportamentales consecuentes a la violencia psicologica en la pareja, con varias de las dimensiones de la inteligencia emocional. De esta forma, las parejas con elevadas tasas de conflictividad responsables de la instauracion de la dinamica relacional violenta, parecen responder en el plano interpersonal con registros comunicativos alejados de la inteligencia emocional o de competencias como la empatia, el autocontrol y la cooperacion hacia sus parejas. En la presente investigacion se analiza el maltrato psicologico en las relaciones de pareja (desvalorizacion, hostilidad, indiferencia, intimidacion, imposicion de conductas, culpabilizacion y bondad aparente) y su relacion con el nivel de competencias emocionales (emotividad, eficacia, rigidez e ilusion) que presentan los miembros que conforman la misma. Se desarrollo en el contexto de la Universidad de Extremadura (Espana). La seleccion de la muestra fue aleatoria y se compuso de 1 080 estudiantes universitarios/as. De ellos, 332 varones y 748 mujeres de edades comprendidas en cuatro categorias que abarcan el intervalo de 17 a 23 anos o mas. Una vez seleccionada la muestra establecimos un calendario para la aplicacion de los instrumentos, conjuntamente con los decanos, directores de centros universitarios y secretarias academicas. La aplicacion de los instrumentos se realizo de forma colectiva en una sesion en horario de manana y tarde, durante los cursos academicos 2007/2008 y 2008/2009. Los resultados del estudio confirman la presencia de patrones de violencia psicologica en las relaciones de pareja de los estudiantes universitarios/as. Destacan como subfactores de maltrato psicologico ejercidos con mayor frecuencia en estos jovenes los situados en el factor Indiferencia, en oposicion a aquellos menos habituales comprendidos en el factor Bondad aparente. En cuanto a la relacion entre las conductas psicologicamente abusivas y las competencias emocionales durante el noviazgo, se evidencian diferencias significativas. Finalmente se confirma la presencia de correlaciones significativas en la mayor parte de los factores y subfactores del maltrato psicologico en la pareja y las diferentes competencias emocionales. Los hallazgos del estudio sugieren en terminos generales que los indicadores del maltrato psicologico en la pareja comienzan a manifestarse durante las relaciones de noviazgo, concretamente: trivializaciones, reproches, no empatia ni apoyo, juzgar, criticar, corregir, insistencia abusiva, acusaciones, etc. Se aprecia como la manifestacion mas habitual la falta de implicacion afectiva que imposibilita la empatia, el apoyo y el respeto hacia la individualidad de la victima, promoviendo conductas de monopolio por parte del agresor en la pareja. Asimismo se confirma la existencia de una mayor tendencia al empleo de las diferentes manifestaciones de violencia psicologica por parte de aquellos estudiantes universitarios/as con recursos emocionales mas precarios. Datos que adquieren una mayor consistencia conforme revisamos los multiples estudios que actuan como soporte empirico. En este sentido, el mayor reto es la promocion del analisis cientifico de la violencia psicologica en las relaciones de noviazgo, asi como su orientacion al diseno de programas de prevencion primaria centrados en el desarrollo de la educacion emocional como elemento central para el establecimiento de relaciones de parejas plenas y saludables.",

For the child, sexuality is a rather general, pleasurable excitation, not a specific genital stimulation. Excessive attention to the perineal area, operation upon or injury to the genital area and injections are vicissitudes which may have an unhealthy influence on later sexual development. Healthy and informed parental attitudes are the key here, just as they are in the normal exhibitionism, curiosity and intense emotional attachments to parents. Parents infect children, healthily or unhealthily, with their attitudes. In healthy growth exhibitionism and peeping become transformed in socially acceptable ways. In unhealthy growth, either perversions or strong reactions like over-modesty or shame result. Masturbation is common and transitory in most children. Parents, and especially pediatricians to whom parents turn, have a golden opportunity to direct healthy growth by being well informed about the infant and child's sexual growth and thus be enabled to advise upon or manage the common developmental phenomena with good commonsense and patience. Infants and children do not enter the world possessing the morals, standards or inhibitions of adults.",

Your satisfaction can wane, and your level of commitment can go with it. You can be tempted by infidelity, or your partner may fall prey to similar temptations. These challenges can be particularly troublesome among emerging adults, who tend to have relatively little experience with forming and maintaining a successful long-term relationship.

      "title": "The Role of Moral Emotions in the Onset and Progression of Child Sexual Offending",
      "abstract": "This thesis investigates the role of moral emotions in child sexual assault. Despite an extensive literature on moral emotions among non-offending populations, there has been little investigation of the role of shame, guilt and pride in the onset and maintenance of child sexual assault. Current theories have generally paid little attention to moral emotions, instead relying on the concept of low self-control/self-regulation to help explain some aspects of this phenomenon.\nThe empirical data on child sexual assault has consistently found that extrafamilial offenders, offenders against boys and younger offenders are more likely to reoffend. The major theories of child sexual assault provide a degree of explanation for the age effect, but do not provide a satisfactory explanation of the findings related to extrafamilial offenders and offenders against boys.\nThis thesis argues that incorporating moral emotions into the existing theories will provide a much more satisfactory explanation of child sexual assault than the explanations yielded from self-control/self-regulation theory. A crucial distinction between self-control/self-regulation theories and an explanation based on moral emotions is that the former presumes a deficit (either ongoing or transient) in the offender, whereas the latter is encapsulated within a motivational balance model, which views the outcome as a result of an interplay between a number of competing motivations. This provides a much more satisfactory explanation for the amount of offending by people who “have” high self-control, while simultaneously helping explain the repetitive nature of chronic offenders.",

      "abstract": "Male suicide continues to be a significant issue worldwide for which there are a myriad of social risk factors. Amongst these, distressed and/or disrupted (i.e., separation, divorce) intimate partner relationships are known to heighten men's mental illness and suicide risk. The current qualitative study offers novel insights to the connections between masculinity and mental illness in and after men's intimate partner relationships. Drawing from in-depth interviews with 47 Canadian and Australian men, three themes were inductively derived: 1) The trouble inside, 2) Breaking up and breaking down, and 3) Finding help. The 'trouble inside' results revealed relationship transitions wherein challenges to couple dynamics flowed from diverse life course events (conflict, illness, bereavement, co-parenting). Partnership transgressions (most often infidelity) also featured to heighten men's mental illness vulnerabilities and threaten the feasibility of the relationship. 'Breaking up and breaking down' chronicled participants' anxiety, depression and suicidality in the aftermath of their relationship ending. Herein, substance use and other maladaptive behaviours were used by men to blunt feelings and/or self-medicate mental illness. These strategies were ineffectual for moving on from blaming partners or grieving the loss of support and social connectedness provided by ex-partners. 'Finding help' included men's eventual self-help, uptake of informal assistance from friends and family, formal professional care services, and the use of facilitated male peer group resources. Norming the use of these diverse help resources were men's alignments to strength-based asset-building masculine ideals, wherein their help-seeking was bridged to, and reflective of their (albeit latent) commitment to better managing their mental health and future relationships. Highlighting the gendered dimensions of mental illness in men's intimate partner relationships, the current study also thoughtfully considers content and contexts for the delivery of tailored upstream suicide prevention programs focussed on men building better relationships.",

However, some married persons perceive less size distortion of their spouses than a stranger. This instance of selective perceptual distortion, known as the Honi phenomenon, could perhaps reflect differential familiarity and/or emotional involvement toward these stimulus persons. Using heterosexual couples as subjects, we investigated familiarity (i.e., length of the relationship), type of relationship (i.e., dating, engaged, or married), and positive cathexis (i.e., love, liking, and trust of one's partner) as possible mediators of this effect and also explored the impact of some judgemental variations. Neither familiarity nor type of relationship influenced relative perceptual distortion of partner versus stranger. Rather, selective perceptual distortion was directly related to the strength of positive cathexis, principally among females. Only women high in positive cathexis exhibited the Honi phenomenon and perceived a stranger as being more distorted than their partners. In contrast, size judgements by men were affected only by the sequence in which stimulus persons were observed. Implications and interpretations of these findings are discussed.",

However, this oft-documented tendency presents an important ambiguity. Do people feel holier than thou because they harbor overly cynical views of their peers (but accurate impressions of themselves) or overly charitable views of themselves (and accurate impressions of their peers)? Four studies suggested it was the latter. Participants consistently overestimated the likelihood that they would act in generous or selfless ways, whereas their predictions of others were considerably more accurate. Two final studies suggest this divergence in accuracy arises, in part, because people are unwilling to consult population base rates when predicting their own behavior but use this diagnostic information more readily when predicting others'.",

      "title": "Yes, No, Maybe So: The Effects of Relationship Status on Perceptions of Inferred Consent",
      "abstract": "Despite the notion that sexual consent is either granted or refused, its communication can sometimes be ambiguous. This uncertainty stems from the tendency to rely on implicit, nonverbal cues to indicate consent. Without clear, explicit communication, people might be encouraged to rely upon contextual information when assessing whether a sexual encounter was consensual. Perceived levels of intimacy and familiarity in a relationship might influence these perceptions, such that prior intimacy might lead to ambiguously communicated consent being interpreted as more consensual. Gender roles can dictate the behaviors expected in a sexual encounter, with female-initiated sexual violence against men potentially being perceived as more consensual than the inverse. The current study examined how relationship type (Experiments 1 and 2) and gender pairing (Experiment 2) influenced participants’ perceptions of how consensual various sexual encounters were. Participants read a series of vignettes in which sexual consent was verbally granted, verbally rejected, or inferred using nonverbal cues. Additionally, the dyads’ relationships were either described as dating, friends, or strangers. Following vignette presentation, participants provided judgments regarding how consensual the interactions were. Experiment 2 expanded upon this by manipulating the gender of the initiators and targets. When consent was not clearly indicated, more established relationships were associated with higher ratings of perceived consent. Male targets were attributed more responsibility for sexual interactions, and they were also believed to want nonconsensual sex more than female targets. These findings highlight the importance of contextual information in instances where sexual consent is unclear.",

      "abstract": "The main task of generativity vs stagnation, Erik Erikson's seventh stage of normative psychosocial development, is to establish and guide the next generation through one's acts of care. Five broad statuses or prototypic styles of resolving the issues of this stage are proposed using combinations of (a) an individual's level of vital involvement, or active concern for the growth of the self and others, and (b) an individual's tolerance of different ideas, traditions, and values, which, by extension, determines the scope of caregiving concern. The Generative status is characterized by high vital involvement and tolerance, and represents the most positive psychosocial outcome. The Pseudogenerative-Agentic status is high in vital involvement and tolerance for self but not for others, while Pseudogenerative-Communal is high in vital involvement and tolerance for others but not for self. The Conventional status, high in vital involvement for both self and others, is low in tolerance across the board. Stagnant reflects the poorest psychosocial outcome, and is low in vital involvement and tolerance generally. A semistructured interview constructed to measure the statuses generated continuous and categorical ratings which were used to investigate inter-rater reliability and validity of the generativity prototypes (N=100). The dimensional scalings obtained higher reliability than the strictly categorical judgements, reaching acceptable levels. Convergence was",

This influence is evident in certain questionable presuppositions, logical errors and inconsistencies, suspensions of intensive inquiry, underemphasis on certain developmental variables, and confusions between observations, definitions, and value preferences. Under three headings-The Problem of Women's Morality and Objectivity, The Problem of Neglected Prephallic Development, and The Problem of Naming-I discuss Freud's generalizations concerning ego and superego development in boys and girls, penis envy, biologically predestined procreativity, the role of the mother, the fateful linkages male-masculine-active-aggressive-dominant and female-feminine-passive-masochistic-submissive, and other topics as well. In general, it is argued that Freud's generalizations concerning girls and women do injustice to both his psychoanalytic method and his clinical findings.",

Loneliness often occurs in conjunction with social isolation, but a person can be socially isolated without feeling lonely and can feel lonely without being socially isolated. In contrast with social isolation, loneliness is more closely related to the perceived quality than quantity of social relationships. Historically, emotional loneliness, defined as deficiencies in relationships with a close other such as a spouse, has been distinguished from social loneliness, defined as deficiencies in social networks or feelings of belonging (Weiss, 1973). Recent empirical evidence supports three distinct dimensions of loneliness reflecting perceived deficits in intimate, relational, and collective connections. Thus, not being married, having few friends and relatives and/or little contact with them, and not taking part in any voluntary groups are examples of specific risk factors for intimate, relational, and collective loneliness, respectively (Hawkley, Browne, &amp; Cacioppo, 2005).",

Sexual jealousy is of particular interest to the psychiatrist, since in its morbid manifestations it destroys marital harmony (Gillard, 1896) and may lead to homicide or suicide (Mowat, 1966). Sexual jealousy may be regarded as a normal reaction but it is abnormal when: (a) the jealous person is haunted by what the ‘man in the street’ would recognize as a groundless conviction that his or her sexual partner has been, or will be, unfaithful; or (b) jealousy engendered by actual infidelity is of such intensity as to render the person dangerously aggressive. Examples of the second category are Ruth Ellis, who shot dead her unfaithful lover; and Pilar Garcia-Compte, who killed her husband after he had refused to break with his mistress.",

      "title": "Human kin detection",
      "abstract": "Natural selection has favored the evolution of behaviors that benefit not only one's genes, but also their copies in genetically related individuals. These behaviors include optimal outbreeding (choosing a mate that is neither too closely related, nor too distant), nepotism (helping kin), and spite (hurting non-kin at a personal cost), and all require some form of kin detection or kin recognition. Yet, kinship cannot be assessed directly; human kin detection relies on heuristic cues that take into account individuals' context (whether they were reared by our mother, or grew up in our home, or were given birth by our spouse), appearance (whether they smell or look like us), and ability to arouse certain feelings (whether we feel emotionally close to them). The uncertainties of kin detection, along with its dependence on social information, create ample opportunities for the evolution of deception and self-deception. For example, babies carry no unequivocal stamp of their biological father, but across cultures they are passionately claimed to resemble their mother's spouse; to the same effect, 'neutral' observers are greatly influenced by belief in relatedness when judging resemblance between strangers. Still, paternity uncertainty profoundly shapes human relationships, reducing not only the investment contributed by paternal versus maternal kin, but also prosocial behavior between individuals who are related through one or more males rather than females alone. Because of its relevance to racial discrimination and political preferences, the evolutionary pressure to prefer kin to non-kin has a manifold influence on society at large.",

It is an act that not only endangers the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of victims but also compromises public health.

In addition, victims of stealthing are susceptible to psychosocial challenges such as low self-esteem, depression, fear and self-stigmatization. Patriarchal dominance plays a critical role in the occurrence of stealthing. Therefore, it is important for a standardized policy framework to be developed to deal with stealthing which is a threat to SRH and Public Health.",

      "abstract": "In this survey of literature on the subject, we discuss the question of whether or not and if so to what extent a mature, adult ability to love depends on relevant early experience, or whether it functions as a corrective to unfavorable emotional experience in early childhood. There is no compelling connection between certain disturbances of partner relations and concrete family circumstances in the first years of life. Such disturbances are regarded by traditional psychoanalysis as the result of an unresolved infantile conflict; however, since there is no psychoanalytical interaction theory for the description and explanation of interpersonal phenomena, recent discussions have drawn increasingly on a systematic approach. From a historical point of view, psychoanalytical discussions reflect essential changes in theories about the ability to love. More recent empirical studies point to a possible involvement of corrective and compensatory mechanisms for unfavorable early experiences of a medium degree of seriousness. Nevertheless, warm affection based on needs during the first years of life (at best from loving parents with a partner-oriented relationship) provides a basis for the adult's ability to love and form partnerships.",

So does marriage, of course. In both cases the state of life entered upon is not viewed objectively in all its stark reality, but as offering an immediate assuagement of the craving to be loved. It is an effort, not to give love, but – without necessarily earning it – to get love and, through it, an assurance of personal value which, for one reason or another, was denied in the earliest formative years. Whatever names psychologists give to the various compensations and defence mechanisms which the ego develops in reaction to primary experiences, the trouble is always born of fear out of devaluation. Whatever ideal self-image the individual sets up, and for which he seeks recognition and affirmation, the burning question in every relationship is always, at bottom, ‘Do you love me, accept me, value me . . . ?’ When the proffered ‘me’ is not the actual person but a ‘persona’, a construct based on who knows what borrowed notions, the quest is bound to be a disappointment for all concerned. A mature person is one who is free from the compulsion to play a part, who is content to be himself to the best of his ability and who is, therefore, free to pour himself out in love of others, and of another in particular. Maturity is developed by accepting and exercising responsibility.",

      "title": "[Adolescent pregnancy].",
      "abstract": "This exploration of adolescent pregnancy focuses on adolescents whose pregnancies are undesired. The physical and psychic transformations of puberty and adolescence may be experienced differently in different social contexts. The prolongation of school attendance in Western societies means that most adolescents remain financially dependent on their parents. But greater sexual freedom in the society at large has been reflected in an increase in early sexual activity among adolescents. Wider use of contraception has not completely eliminated prenatal pregnancy among adolescents. Adolescent pregnancies have actually declined in France as a proportion of all pregnancies carried to term, from 4% to 1.5-2% in the past 10 or 15 years. But in 1986, 42.5% of all induced abortions were performed on adolescents. Among causes of unwanted pregnancy in adolescents are their frequent inability to believe that they may be at risk of pregnancy, or that pregnancy can result from the 1st sexual intercourse. The episodic nature of sexual relations, the lack of ready availability of contraception, and specific shortcomings of different methods are factors in the frequent failure of adolescents to protect themselves against undesired pregnancy. Adolescents may become pregnant out of loneliness or to prove that they are women, or as a result of incest or prostitution. Adolescents who seek abortions are those who have discovered and acknowledged their pregnancies before the 12th week and had the courage to inform their parents and obtain legal permission for the abortion. Pregnancy terminations are more frequent in more advantaged societal sectors with more structured family life. The moral shock and sense of failure associated with abortion are often deeply felt by adolescents. Their experience is greatly influenced by the attitudes of those around them. Adolescents who carry their pregnancies to term are those who have not sought abortion in the 1st 12 weeks. Often they refuse to admit they might be pregnant. But adolescents from disadvantaged environments may wish to continue the pregnancy in order to attain social status. Most parents eventually resign themselves to the pregnancy. Adolescents who are closely monitored usually have normal pregnancies and deliveries. The proportion of adolescent mothers who place their infants for adoption has declined. Most of the infants kept by their mothers are entitled to 2 sets of social prestations, the allowances for the young infant and for single parents. School nurses have an important potential contribution in informing students about sexuality and contraception and in assisting those who become pregnant.",

      "abstract": "Abstract I suggest that the diagnosis that an individual self-diagnoses with can be influenced by levels of public awareness. Accurate diagnosis requires consideration of multiple diagnoses. Sometimes, different diagnoses can overlap with one another and can only be differentiated in subtle and nuanced ways, but particular diagnoses vary considerably in levels of public awareness. As such, an individual may meet the diagnostic criteria for one diagnosis but self-diagnoses with a different diagnosis because it is better known. I then outline a potential negative consequence of this. Psychiatric diagnoses can grant access to what I call social resources, namely, political advocacy, campaigning for support, participating in scientific research, building diagnostic cultures, and opportunity for social interactions with people who have the same diagnosis. The strength of the social resources for a particular diagnosis can be made stronger when more people have that diagnosis. As such, inaccurate self-diagnosis can result in the social resources for one diagnosis being strengthened whilst not being strengthened in relation to another diagnosis in comparison to accurate diagnosis. This shows how inaccurate self-diagnosis can alter the distribution of social resources. We need to consider whether this is unfair to people who are diagnosed with less well-known conditions.",

This research examines how men's suicides and attempted suicides are embedded in the contextual praxis of intimate relationships in Bangladesh. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with family members, close relatives, and friends of 37 men who died by suicide or attempted suicide. This research's findings identify five key risk factors associated with men's suicide and attempted suicide, namely: troubles over the designated family provider's responsibilities; troubles emanating from second marriage; betrayal of loyalties; complications in non-marital relationships; and feelings of no control over wife. Each theme suggests that men who died by suicide or who attempted suicide found it challenging to balance their culturally expected (hegemonic) masculine image with their intimate relationships. Suicide and attempted suicide surfaced as a consequence of such challenges in their life. Efforts are suggested to lessen the burden on men's masculine expectations and promote an egalitarian social space in order to reduce suicide risk in men.",

      "title": "Silent Rage: Queer Youth Self-harm as a Protest",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Self-harm among queer and trans youth has often been read in two ways: either as a mental health issue in the disciplines and professions of psychiatry and psychology or along the line of queer negativity as a refusal of the normative aspiration of health, prosperity, and reproduction. The medical discourse considers self-harm behaviors as an abnormality, away from the course of an individual's health, self-preservation, and development, which are considered to be natural. At the same time, many queer theorists critique such norms and, accordingly, such pathologization, and they argue that because of dominant heterosexual norms queer lives are often cast as abnormal and wrongly interpreted as a form of self-harm. In this essay, I consider both possible readings as inadequate for understanding the various meanings that self-harm actions may carry. While it is important to address the issue of queer and trans youth mental health, as well as to point out their possible resistance to heterosexual norms, I argue that self-harm may be the result of various causes, and its meanings cannot be exhausted by these two readings alone. Neither of these models are sufficient to explain all self-harm actions, as we cannot expect to explain all self-harm actions with one model. After discussing their limits, I offer a phenomenological reading of blogger Adrian Loya's narrative of gender dysphoria and self-harm thoughts, and I show how the anxiety and thoughts of self-harm are triggered by the transphobic gaze of others. In this instance, self-harm cannot be seen as arising from within the self but rather as arising from others. The self-directed violence is at first directed at the individual by and from hostile others who do not recognize or acknowledge the harm they cause, which has to be made manifest through other means, self-harm behavior being one of them. In this way, self-harm can be seen as a coping mechanism in that it is a silent protest—to manifest the harm that is so normative that it remains invisible to others, and thereby to manifest the social injury silently done.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition affecting many thousands of children. It is a condition that can have adverse health, social and educational outcomes. It also exacts significant societal costs, economically and socially. This paper hypothesises that the population of children receiving a clinical diagnosis of ADHD is aetiologically heterogeneous: that within this population, there is a group for whom the development of ADHD is largely genetically driven, and another who have a ‘phenocopy’ of ADHD as a result of very adverse early childhood experiences, with the prevalence of this phenocopy being heavily skewed towards populations living with poverty and violence. A third group will have a high genetic risk and have been exposed to violence. These groups will overlap, with epigenetic phenomena and other environmental factors, for example, preterm birth, poor intrauterine growth, foetal exposure to teratogens, playing an important role for all affected children in determining the severity of their functional difficulties.\n\n### Phenocopies\n\nPhenocopies occur when people exhibit a phenotype that appears identical to that found in other individuals who have a linked genotype, but do not possess this genotype themselves. Environmental factors may cause this, as occurs in Rutter's autism phenocopy described in Romanian orphans adopted by western families in the early 1990s.1 These children had experienced extreme, profound neglect; after adoption, they began to present to services with abnormal or delayed development. Many presented a clinical and behavioural picture indistinguishable from autism in preschool children. However, follow-up revealed a different natural history to that of childhood autism, with these children no longer fulfilling criteria for autism, with mild cognitive impairment, low empathy and conduct problems prevailing in adolescence.2 Animal models suggest a possible epigenetic mechanism for this, with environments of profound neglect associated with alterations in gene expression as a result of …",

      "abstract": "Cross-gender interests occur in both typical development and when developmental processes are disrupted. There are inconsistent data and significant controversy about the interpretation of existing research findings on the relationship between childhood Gender Identity Disorder (GID) and later sexual orientation. Childhood GID is a readily recognized syndrome characterized by persistent cross-gender fantasies and behaviour. The parents of children with GID have ongoing problems in affect regulation. Clinical studies of adolescents with extreme cross-gender behaviour have found a high incidence of peer-relation difficulties, depression, and suicidal behaviour. The child's construction of his/her gender identity is a slow and piecemeal process that is deeply rooted in the child's attachment relationships and will reflect the history of those relationships and its conflicts, including intergenerational conflicts. A different phenomenon involving cross-gender interests is sometimes observed in children who have a relatively well-established and positively affectively charged sense of their own gender identity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Pharmaceuticals or other emerging technologies could be used to enhance (or diminish) feelings of lust, attraction, and attachment in adult romantic partnerships. Although such interventions could conceivably be used to promote individual (and couple) well-being, their widespread development and/or adoption might lead to the ‘medicalization’ of human love and heartache—for some, a source of a serious concern. In this essay, we argue that the medicalization of love need not necessarily be problematic, on balance, but could plausibly be expected to have either good or bad consequences depending upon how it unfolds. By anticipating some of the specific ways in which these technologies could yield unwanted outcomes, bioethicists and others can help to direct the course of love’s medicalization—should it happen to occur—more toward the ‘good’ side than the ‘bad.’",

      "abstract": "Discussions of sexual misconduct often focus primarily or exclusively on the parties directly involved in sexual behavior. As a result, the discussion generally centers on consent. While consent is critically important, this Article instead focuses on harms to third parties resulting from sexual behavior—regardless of whether that behavior is consensual. Doing so reveals a dynamic that the conversation about sexual misconduct has not yet fully acknowledged: the presence or absence of consent between participants does not determine whether third parties suffer harm. Sexual behavior does not occur in a vacuum. Rather, it occurs in a particular context and often has significant consequences for other individuals beyond the participants in the behavior.Sexual behavior is problematic when it involves what this Article will refer to as an institutional power disparity: that is, one participant has power over the other as a result of their institutional roles. Institutional power disparities are inherent, for example, in sexual behavior involving a supervisor and their subordinate or a professor and their student.Such behavior risks significant harm to third parties within the institution. Third parties may be injured as a result of sexual favoritism. For example, a worker may be passed over for a promotion in favor of a less qualified worker who is having sex with the boss. Or third parties may suffer harm from a sexualized institutional environment. For example, students may avoid professors who are known for pursuing sexual relationships with students or may find it alienating to be viewed as a professor’s prospective sexual partner. And the institution itself may suffer harm when sexual behavior involving an institutional power disparity interferes with worker productivity and morale, or with student learning and intellectual growth.Harm to third parties justifies regulation of sexual relationships in the context of an institutional power disparity. In some circumstances, such relationships should be prohibited so long as the institutional power disparity remains. In other circumstances, careful regulation can mitigate potential harms to third parties and to the institution itself.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Children's prosociality emerges early in life, which suggests that helping others is rooted deeply in human nature. At the same time, the motivation underlying young children's instrumental helping poses a puzzle. Children do not express a specific emotion such as sympathy when removing physical obstacles for others. Instead of being motivated by a concern for others’ well‐being, toddlers may act to tie up loose ends or engage in social interactions, or they may be motivated because their goals align with those of others. Recent research has addressed the underlying motivation of children's helping by directly measuring children's internal arousal via changes in the dilation of their pupils. In several studies, children's arousal in response to others’ unfulfilled needs is genuinely prosocial and linked to the well‐being of others. This prosocial arousal may lie at the heart of not only children's instrumental helping but also their prosociality in general.",

Intervention to that effect, is it not demanded by plain common- sense, clear responsibility, a humane scale of values? The Christian Church, however, can never consent to the direct destruction of innocent human hfe—notice the qualifications direct and innocent , through the use of force to repel aggression is approved. Nevertheless our present question, which cannot be summed up in a single brutal or sentimental statement, has been charged with anxiety and misrepresentation: on one side, the Pope has been accused of preferring the unborn baby to the mother, and of a characteristically clerical unconcern for ordinary human tragedies; on the other, materialism and paganism can be too readily ascribed to some of his critics, and their reluctance to go to extreme lengths not allowed for. Let us begin by recognising how rare is a classical case of Mother v. Child; their relations, from beginning to end, should be for the health of both, and indeed so they are, when the physical, psychological, and moral rules are observed. Women are well designed by God to be mothers. We speak of an ‘expectant’ mother; and certainly she can look forward with happy confidence to the birth of her child. The situation is not abnormal, the condition not pathological, the business not a dangerous operation. A woman when she is in labour hath pain, because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a child is born into the world .",

      "title": "Recognition of Sexual Abuse in Children",
      "abstract": "Although sexual abuse of children has likely been present for ages, its recognition in the United States and other countries has dramatically increased in the past 5 years. Reported cases, which represent an unknown fraction of actual cases, now account for approximately 25% of all abuse and neglect reports. Local, county, and state agencies are staggering under the load, and many are relying heavily on pediatricians to assist them in their work. DEFINITION Sexual abuse can be defined as the engaging of a child in sexual activites that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the social taboos of society. This definition is broad and includes intrafamilial and extrafamilial forms and all types of sexual activities (eg, exhibitionism, fondling, child pornography, oral, anal, and genital sexual contact). The interface between \"normal sexual exploratory behavior\" and \"sexual abuse\" is not clearly defined. Pediatricians should, however, use common sense. If two 4-year-old children are found to be playing without clothes, touching each others' genitals and giggling, there is probably little to worry about. The same is true if two 15-year-old adolescents are discovered together. A probably exists if the 15-year-old child (some states set statutory 2- to 4-year limits within which sexual activities are not to be considered abuse) or if one 4-year-old child is engaging in fellatio or attempting intercourse with another preschool-aged child.",

There seems to be many reasons for this increase (which has different trends in different populations), but associations have been found with increased substance abuse, television and video violence, socio-economic status and easy access to firearms. Gender differences have also been observed with crime, suicide and substance abuse higher among males, while eating disorder, depression and suicidal behavior more prevalent among females. This paper will review prevalence and incidence of adolescent suicidal behavior, socio-demographic and psychological risk factors, associated cognitive factors and socio-economic factors. Risk factors include previous suicide attempts, a history of others in the family who have been suicidal, mental illness, alcohol and drug use, and other self-destructive behaviors as well as consideration being given to hopelessness, hostility, negative self-concept and isolation. At the individual difference level, factors such as trait depression, anger and hostility, perfectionism and social sensitivity would seem critical variables, as would age, gender and intellectual functioning. Sociological and family-related factors may also be implicated including dysfunctional family organizations, a history of physical or psychological abuse (sexual abuse) and limited extent of social support networks. A frequently reported precipitating event of suicidal behavior is family adversity including rejection, separation and interpersonal conflict. At a socio-economic level it would seem essential to provide comprehensive document about the social and economic conditions from which the adolescent comes.",

Family should be a place of happiness, security and mutual respect for every child. The problem of negligence of children has exsisted in every civilization and culture, and over the years there has been a great improvement in that area that today every negative and adverse consequences which affect the child and its development is being recognized. The most common types of family violence over children are: physical abuse, emotional (psychological) abuse, sexual abuse and neglection. Physical violence against children usually leaves visible physical marks, and it is therefore easier to identify than other forms. It is characterized by a bad intention to harm the\r\nchild and to cause physical injury. Consequences of pyhsical abuse can be short-term as well as long-term. They are usualy manifested in neurological and intelectual area, shool success, life expectations, socioemootional development and social realations, but also mental health in general. Emotional violence occurs primarily as parents long-term failure to show love and attention to the child. The consequences can be expressed trough many different areas: learning problems, difficulties in establishing interpersonal relationships, inappropriate behavior in ordinary situations, general depressed mood and dissatisfaction, frequent psychosomatic ailments etc. Sexual violence, on the other hand, includes every unwanted sexual contact and relationship in which a child is forced against their will. It leaves devastating consequences on children. Apart from pysical integrity, sexual abuse affects childs mental health, trust toward adults trusting adults and their selfrespect. Fear,depression, bad image of their body, sexual problems, poor achivements and other, are being expressed. The least attention is given to negligence because, unlike other forms of violence it leaves no\r\nvisible physical consequences. Negligence of children in their early age, during childhood, has severe and destructive consequences on their further development to be and is also a great cause of short-term and long-term emotional, cognitive, social and educational problems. Resarch proves that ignoring children during their childhood affects their development of personality disorder in adolescent and adult age. Many authors and associations have studied\r\nthe impact of violence on child development. In every case, violence negatively and adversely affects the cognitive, emotional and social development of the child and at the same time limits it, sometimes even leaving lifelong consequences.",

Having an SUD is not a matter of weakness, lack of willpower, or being “bad.” SUDs result from a complex interaction of genetic, psychological, social, and cultural factors. These disorders tend to run in families, so scientists believe a person inherits a predisposition or vulnerability to SUDs that interacts with environmental factors, increasing the risk of developing a problem. SUDs affect people of every age, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and occupation. Some people develop a problem in early life, while others do so later in life.

Because the discreditable can typically exert greater control over when, to whom, and how others in their social group or society come to know about the stigmatized attribute, informational control is an important and unique stigma management strategy and area of ongoing research.",

      "title": "Suicide and bereavement : an interpretive study",
      "abstract": "Suicide is the third leading cause of death of worldwide, and its social ramifications are far-reaching. Due to the stigma associated with suicide, as well as the unique emotional processes that occur during bereavement following this mode of death, suicide bereavement is regarded as different and more intense than other grief experiences. While the effects of suicide on the suicide-bereaved have been welldocumented using objective measures of outcome, the subjective, and often unquantifiable emotional, familial and social consequences of suicide have been largely under-researched. By using an interpretive approach, this study focuses on the subjective experiences of those who have lost a loved one to suicide. Five suicide-bereaved individuals were sampled from a particular community, and their experiences were elicited using semi-structured interviews. The results indicate a number of emotional as well as social processes that occur after suicide, including intense longing for the deceased; rationalisation, disbelief, and denial; feelings of anger, guild, regret, and sadness; a search for answers, meaning and closure; and blaming and social isolation. While these processes cannot be said to occur exclusively in suicide bereavement, they appear to be experienced more intensely during this form of grief.",

      "abstract": "Very often, the stereotyped image of a phenomenon generates effects by itself. The individuals are poorly evaluated by a formal assessment based on cliches, labels and stereotypes, their effect being the risk of producing relational jams, even before the existence of a relationship. In social relationships, blinded by the wide legitimacy of stereotypes, the individuals tend to show attraction or rejection towards a certain state, or even person, based on the set of socially associated cliches. In this regard, the access to a person appears to be inter-mediated by the cliche image a certain person or community attributes it, fact which may insurmountably affect the direct and objective relationship with the other. Today, the issue of in-laws and the way they understand to support the young family has many valences: there are young people who accept the in-laws co-participation in the role dynamic of the young couple, others consider any form of external intervention of the in-laws to be an abuse, as well as there are a wide range of in-laws ideologies regarding their „natural duty” to manage the conjugal relationships of their own children. The research is based oh Thomas’ theory (1982) which states that when people consider a situation to be real, it becomes real through its consequences. Our study aims to analyse the image of the mother-in-law in the eyes of the daughter-in-law, based on a quantitative research, the method used being the sociological inquiry and the research instrument – the survey. The study was conducted on a sample of 200 women with conjugal experience of at least 3 years, 100 being unmarried and 100 – married. The unmarried women were selected from the age group between 25 and 29 years old, being the age category before the marital peak, and the married women from the age category comprising the tip of marriage, namely between 30 and 40 years old.",

      "abstract": "The use of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) as a qualifying mental disorder for a sexually violent predator (SVP) or a sexually dangerous person (SDP) commitment continues to arouse controversy. Two common questions arise. Is ASPD considered a qualifying mental disorder in statutory or case law definitions? Can ASPD be the sole qualifying mental disorder? We review case law for guidance as to when ASPD may serve as a sole qualifying diagnosis in SVP/SDP evaluations. Other than the federal government and New York, all other jurisdictions with SVP/SDP commitments permit the use of ASPD as a stand-alone diagnosis when it can be linked to sexually violent behavior. ASPD is a viable qualifying disorder when the pattern of offending is atypical, severe, and can be linked to the risk for further sexual offending. ASPD is less viable as a qualifying diagnosis when it is manifested primarily by criminal behavior, the sex crimes are situational in context (e.g., substance abuse, negative peer affiliation), or the disorder cannot be linked to future sexual offending. Case law can provide guidelines, but the forensic clinician as the diagnostic expert bears the responsibility of providing a cogent and sound rationale as to why ASPD drives the risk for sexual reoffense.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing awareness that the marital and relationship programs must be addressed and worked upon if the chemically dependent person is going to maintain his or her sobriety. The involvement of the spouse or partner is important because of the family system dynamics that caused, perpetuated, and/or enabled the chemical dependency needs to be addressed and all involved need some treatment. Recognizing the source of marital or relationship discord is helpful in determining the chemically dependent and codependent couple's needs in terms of aftercare of therapy needed to resolve these conflicts. This article reviews the common probelms encountered by many chemically dependent and codependent couples: codependency, sexual identity conflicts, violence in their relationship, confusion in roles, communication difficulties, unhealthy sexual and intimacy attitudes and values and sexual dysfunctions. Essentially, the chemically dependent or codependent couple is experiencing intimacy dysfunction and is often lacking in intimacy skills. These skills need to be learned in order for them to experience intimacy and to feel more complete in their sobriety.",

      "title": "Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual behavior is ubiquitous and diverse. Beyond the sex act itself, sexuality permeates our culture and our daily lives. Therefore, as with all of the behavioral disorders, distinguishing “normal” from “abnormal” sexuality can be difficult. For example, there are no bright lines separating “low” sexual desire from “normal” sexual desire, or “premature” ejaculation from “normal” ejaculation. Whether a person even is bothered by a particular aspect of his or her sexuality is significantly influenced by personality, previous developmental experience, extent of education about sex, satisfaction with one’s relationships in general, and surrounding cultural attitudes about sex. Consider premature ejaculation. DSM-IV defines this as persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration, and before the person wishes it. The definition is deliberately subjective, taking into account the quality of the individual’s sexual relationship. Paradoxically, this subjective definition may be more reliable and valid than a definition based on the exact interval between penetration and ejaculation as measured by a stopwatch. Thus, while a man who ejaculates within a minute of vaginal entry might be considered by some people to be “premature,” if he and his wife engage in a half-hour of very pleasurable foreplay, followed by mutual orgasms after a minute of pleasurable intercourse, he could not be considered to have a sexual “dys function.”",

      "abstract": "One hundred and twenty couples applying for DI or involved in the procedure were seen in consultation or therapy at various stages. The clinical findings provide evidence that both partners experience conflict in two areas. The discovery of infertility generates transient impotence, loss of self-esteem and withdrawal in husbands, and anger, guilt and a wish to make reparations in wives. The DI procedure itself evokes oedipal conflicts. Clinical vignettes have been presented to illustrate these patterns and to provide evidence for the view that couples should recognize, discuss and come to terms with the conflicts generated by the discovery of infertility before tackling DI and the conflicts this procedure evokes. Although secrecy is advocated by most DI couples and physicians, a questionnaire study of 76 couples in our unit disclosed that many individuals consider it psychologically useful to discuss their infertility problems with others. Although secrecy may be useful, it may also, through the indirect sanction of denial and negation, interfere with the couple's acknowledging and discussing their problems. One useful purpose of a psychiatric assessment is that it can promote such acknowledgement and discussion. Conflict needs to be distinguished from psychopathology which may be the outcome of unresolved conflict.",

      "title": "The impact of delayed reporting on the prosecution and outcomes of child sexual abuse cases",
      "abstract": "Children and young people who have been sexually abused sometimes disclose that abuse soon after the event or events occurred, or at least later during childhood. However, many children and young people do not tell anyone about the abuse until decades later, long after they reach adulthood. An unknown number, the ‘dark figure’, never tell anyone or if they do, do not report it to the police. Delayed disclosure and reporting are associated with various characteristics of the victim and perpetrator, and the relationship between them. Older children, for example, are more reluctant to disclose than younger children, and boys are more reluctant than girls. Delayed reporting is particularly common in cases of institutional child sexual abuse; for example, where the abuser is a trusted church member, a teacher, or a staff member in a boarding school or residential care facility. In some cases, the victim has told someone at the time, but has not been believed, or the complaint has not reached the police. Where an adult has reported sexual abuse committed against them as a child, particular forensic difficulties stand in the way of prosecution that do not apply to contemporary reports. These include needing to prove the offence as it was on the statute book at the time it occurred, and addressing issues about the reasons for the delayed complaint. Another barrier to successful prosecution is the likelihood of ‘degraded evidence’. As time goes on, memories fade and evidence which may have corroborated some aspects of the complainant’s account may have been lost; for example, due to the death of another witness. This report examines how the criminal justice systems in New South Wales and South Australia deal with complaints of child sexual abuse reported to the police in childhood compared with those in which the report is delayed until adulthood, which is often referred to as historical child sexual abuse. The research investigates the trends in delayed disclosure and reporting of child sexual abuse, and maps the prosecution process and outcomes associated with varying degrees of delay in 18 reporting to the police, together with other case characteristics such as the age of the complainant victim, and the relationship between the complainant and the alleged offender.",

      "abstract": "I recently heard a young woman complain that a friend of hers couldn’t make up her mind about whether or not she was a lesbian because she alternated between dating men and dating other women. This oversimplified, binary view of sexual orientation is prevalent in society at large, as well as in undergraduate classrooms, where anything less than unswerving heterosexuality or homosexuality may be framed as the result of confusion, cowardice, or self-deception. Of course, scholars of sexuality understand that sexual orientation is neither monolithic nor static. And professors and teaching assistants are strategically positioned to destabilize students’ limited conceptions about sexuality and promote a more nuanced understanding. The following exercise seeks to complicate these issues by illustrating that sexual orientation consists of multiple components (behavior, identity, desire, fantasy, etc.) which may or may not align in ways that are seen as internally consistent. It also illustrates the fluidity of sexuality, as well the way sexual orientation is linked to gender.",

      "abstract": "To identify the offender and unravel the mystery, physical evidence must be found at the crime scenes. When it is first taken from crime scenes, the relevance of some pieces of evidence is unclear or seems inconsequential, but as the investigation goes on, it seems to gain significance. Although footprints are a common physical indicator of a crime, including homicide, burglary, and sexual assault, they are frequently overlooked or dismissed as inconsequential during the early stages of an investigation. Currently, individual identification is done through gait pattern analysis based on footprints. A branch of forensic science known as forensic podiatry examines foot-related evidence in the course of a criminal investigation using specific podiatric knowledge, including the foot and lower limb. Analysis of footprints and gait is most consistent with other pattern-based forms of evidence, such as blood pattern analysis. Most cases of homicide and burglary involve the gait pattern evidence. Additionally, detectives frequently disregard crime scenes due to their familiarity. Science in podiatry is lacking. The current crime scene report, which was researched by the corresponding author (Prof. T. Nataraja Moorthy, henceforth referred to as \"TN\") in India, highlighted the importance of footprint and gait pattern evidence in a distinctive homicide crime scene. In India, a woman reported her husband's murder to the police, but a footprint-based gait pattern analysis proved she was the murderer, not the unidentified assailant. She committed murder while hiding the crime, which is known as \"crime concealment\".",

By contrast, sacrifice of personal gain by non-human animals is often interpreted as frustration. Spite may thus be a uniquely human motivator. However, to date, no empirical study has demonstrated that psychological spite actually drives human behaviour, leaving the motivation for inequity aversion unclear. Here, we ask whether 4- to 9-year-old children and adults reject disadvantageous inequity (less for self, more for peer) out of spite or frustration. We show that children, but not adults, are more likely to reject disadvantageous allocations when doing so deprives their peer of a better reward (spite) than when their peer has already received the better reward (frustration). Spiteful motivations are thus present early in childhood and may be a species-specific component of humans' developing cooperative and competitive behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Curiosity is a psychological response to uncertainty that facilitates learning and other benefits, but little is known about how highly curious people interpret and process uncertainty differently from their less curious counterparts. We investigated the relationship between curiosity (both interest- and deprivation-type) and a variety of attitudes towards uncertainty. An adult sample from the United Kingdom (N = 398) completed an online questionnaire measuring dispositional interest- and deprivation-type curiosity, positive attitudes towards uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, and tendencies to focus on potential positive or negative outcomes. A higher score on interest was associated with finding uncertainty more enjoyable and focusing on positive possibilities. A higher score on deprivation was associated with being more intolerant of uncertainty and focusing on negative possibilities. The connections between curiosity and attitudes towards uncertainty differ according to the type of curiosity experienced. Interest may reinforce learning by promoting a fascination with the unknown and a focus on positive discoveries. Deprivation may reinforce learning by promoting discomfort with the unknown and a focus on negative discoveries that one wishes to be reassured of or prepared for.",

      "title": "Designing Anonymity",
      "abstract": "Creating anonymity means cutting connections. A common goal in this context is to prevent accountability. This prevention of accountability can be problematic, for example, if it leads to delinquents remaining undetected. However, imputability can also provide protection against discrimination. In medical, religious or legal matters, this is of fundamental importance. Thus, when individuals actively establish anonymity, they do so mostly because they want to prevent certain information about them, that is, sensitive and/or compromising information, from being associated with their identities. By remaining inaccessible as individuals with respect to certain information about them, they can engage in forms of exchange that would otherwise be impossible for them. Examples include practices of exchange in (self-organized) therapy groups, acting out stigmatized sexual preferences, the role of anonymity in the performing arts, or political resistance movements. Given the variety of examples in which personal anonymity is important, it is not surprising that it is primarily these personal dimensions that are the focus of current debates about the increasing precariousness of anonymity in the face of new technical possibilities of data mining and processing. In this paper, we nevertheless - or precisely because of this - want to focus on another aspect of anonymity that has received much less attention so far. Namely, we assume that researching and working with and about anonymity can open up new perspectives on and for contemporary forms of knowledge production.",

      "abstract": "The difficulties to distinguish between infanticide and murder of the woman own child, experienced by both experts and the court, have been discussed on the example of the psychopathological description of the perpetrator killing five of her children, and data from the literature.This paper describes an extremely rare case of the woman who has killed five of her children immediately after their birth over several years.It is very difficult to decide whether the seemingly rational motivation to kill her own child shortly after their birth can be a proof of specific psychopathological state which is a consequence of childbirth or an assassination planned in cold blood. The act of killing a child by their own mother is so contrary to nature that it seems easy to find the ground for psychosis or a state of emergency. However, when neither of them has been proven the experts are left with the conviction of both diagnostic deficiency and inexplicability of human behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Health and happiness influence each other. However, the relationship is quite complex, as a healthy person may be unhappy, and a seriously ill patient may experience happiness. Physical and mental health, and illness-related variables impact upon happiness, though it may be more pronounced by mental illnesses. Positive emotions, resilience, sex and intimacy, and social connectedness are usually associated with happiness, whereas stress, worry, pain, and depression are not. Happier people probably live longer, and there is excess mortality associated with unhappiness; however, many confounding variables exist. Interestingly, in recent years, biological substrates for happiness have been suggested. Genetics, neurotransmitters, specific areas of the brain, and biomarkers have been identified as being associated with the states of happiness. Achieving and maintaining happiness through health appears to have simple messages of being physically active, maintaining good health, preventing and managing illnesses well, having positive emotions, learning to be resilient against stress, and being generous and spiritual. Studies on health and happiness are building up in recent years, providing more insights into their interrelation. Happiness is being used as an outcome measure in clinical interventional trials and other health research, and there is an enhanced scope for its use in common clinical practice.",

Whilst experiences that may be associated with age, including changes in roles and social networks, losses and health challenges, may require adaptation of aspects of personality, personality across the life-span fundamentally influences how ageing is experienced. There are indications that extraversion, conscientiousness and openness show reduced levels in later life, but people’s rank order on personality traits remains stable. Development continues into later life, but builds on earlier experiences and ways of coping. Personality resources such as self-esteem, perceived control, self-efficacy and resilience shape the person’s response to adversity in later life, enabling older people to maintain high levels of well-being, despite the challenges. Dementia, the ultimate challenge, is accompanied by personality change, with raised neuroticism and lowered conscientiousness both predicting its onset and accompanying its course. Pre-morbid personality does also appear to have some influence on behavioural problems experienced.",

      "abstract": "Parents may use their child-naming rights to signal information about social class, intelligence, creativity, political persuasion, religion, or numerous other characteristics to family, friends, or even the child's future peers, employers or spouse. This signaling may reflect parents' status-seeking and concerns for their child's well-being. However, empirically testing for such signaling is problematic because what looks like signaling may actually be parents simply choosing names they like or are more aware of due to recent popularity. Disentangling signaling from simple awareness is difficult because we never know what signal parents are trying to send. Because of parental heterogeneity, different parents attempting to signal may even give or not give the same name. To investigate name signaling we need to observe behavior as the commonly recognized public value of a name changes. I use changes in presidents and their approval ratings to proxy for how the public perceives the value of that president's name. I find that simply being in office greatly reduces the number of times the president's name is given but this fluctuates substantially with his approval rating. This causal effect of changes in the perceived value of a name on parents' naming behavior strongly supports the signaling hypothesis.",

Problems of sexual arousal in women are now recognized to mirror erectile dysfunction in men in many ways and assessment of cardiovascular disease should form part of the routine assessment of women presenting with sexual problems of lack of vaginal arousal (including lubrication) or clitoral arousal. However, psychosocial issues can predominate and perpetuate sexual problems for women and often require concurrent assessment. The sexual difficulties may be concurrent to erectile dysfunction or another sexual problem in the man. An offer of multiple interventions should be recommended where indicated.",

      "abstract": "In our culture, it is widely accepted that one of the central tasks of parenting is the promotion of psychological autonomy in one's children. For parents who have achieved a reasonable measure of psychological autonomy themselves, a flexible response to the child's dual needs for dependence and independence will support the child's need for nurturance without thwarting strivings for independent mastery. In other cases, this balance is not achieved. This paper describes a particular form of relationship disorder between parents and infants in which the major theme of the relationship is an intense and unrelenting interdependence. Parent and child are inextricably bound by a shared belief that each is essential to the other's psychological well-being. The disordered relationship is characterized by mutual anger, disappointment, and/or anxiety that makes the intense closeness mutually dissatisfying. These relationships no doubt exist on a continuum, but at the clinical extreme, which is our focus, they are conflict-ridden and painful for both parent and child.",

      "abstract": "On a global level, from year to year there is an increase in the number of singles, that is, people who, either willingly or unwillingly, are not in any form of partner relationship, which increases the need for research into this specific phenomenon. This paper presents certain aspects of singlehood and the challenges faced by singles, which have been reviewed and researched in the previous literature: the reasons that lead to singlehood, ubiquitous stereotypes and discrimination, the psychological well-being of singles and their functioning in the context of the workplace and complying work with family and private life. Specific methodological challenges in the given field of research and guidelines for future research are also presented. Mainly, in this paper, singleness is analyzed taking into account the perspective of never-married adults without children, who are not in a committed romantic relationship. Despite the fact that, due to their status, they often have to face criticism from those who do not respect the plurality of attitudes and life choices, single people in terms of subjective well-being, generally did not prove to be inferior to married people. Nevertheless, the relationship between marital status and psychological well-being is still complicated and ambiguous. It has been shown that it is necessary to appeal for equality of rights and treatment in terms of working conditions, regardless of a person’s personal and family status, which would ultimately have a beneficial effect on organizations and society as a whole. The lack of a larger number of targeted studies of single people in Croatia is evident. In view of the above, it would be necessary to perform more detailed research that would thoroughly examine the role of the variables presented in this paper in the context of singlehood, but also other mechanisms and determinants of satisfaction and well-being of this group of people.",

However it occurs often in dynamically developing firms that ethical norms are not kept and this process is observed by lack of equal chances to get a job – people without connections remain without work. Due to different research the very serious problem is a phenomena of mobbing. Psychological terror or mobbing in working life involves hostile and unethical communication which is directed in a systematic manner by one or more individuals, mainly toward one individual, who, due to mobbing, is pushed into a helpless and defenceless position and held there by means of continuing mobbing activities. These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months´ duration). Because of the high frequency and long duration of hostile behaviour, this maltreatment results in considerable mental, psychosomatic and social misery.",

      "abstract": "Sex differences in jealousy have been reported widely in the social psychological, clinical psychological, psychiatric, and anthropological literature. Many of the studies conducted on jealousy have focused on the sex differences in the level of reported jealousy. Most research has reported that there is no difference between men and women regarding the level of reported jealousy, but there are some sex differences between sexual and emotional jealousy. Evolutionary psychologists divide jealousy into 2 dimensions based on their observations and empirical research findings: Sexual jealousy and emotional jealousy. Sexual jealousy is knowing or suspecting that one's partners has had sexual relationship with a third person, whereas emotional jealousy is triggered by partner's emotional involvement with and/or love for another person. The parental investment model, which extended Darwin's explanations of sexual selection, provides a useful theoretical framework for studying sexual and emotional jealousy. According to this model sexual selection is driven by differential parental investment by men and women; men should experience more sexual jealousy than women and women should experience more emotional jealousy than men. Considerable research has focused on testing this hypothesis and, with a few exceptions, the results are generally consistent with the evolutionary account. In this study, firstly, a brief definition of the sexual and emotional jealousy will be given. Then, sex differences in sexual and emotional jealousy will be explained according to the evolutionary theory. Finally, the results of empirical studies and critiques of the evolutionary model will be given.",

Case material is presented in which patients with narcissistic personality traits had grown up with an intrusive, controlling mother, and without a father to provide a buffer. This led to an inability to tolerate intimacy in adult relationships. The transference of both patients reflected their extreme sensitivity to impingement on their boundaries. Such patients suffer from inner emptiness because of their inability to incorporate positive experiences.",

      "abstract": "Sociologists tend to define deviance in one of two ways: by the negative reactions an act, the expression of a belief, or a physical characteristic generates, or by the violation of the norms or the rules that prevail in a given society or group. Reactivist definitions come in two varieties: the “hard” or strict reactivist definition, which defines deviance as acts, beliefs, or conditions that have already attracted a negative reaction from one or more audiences, and the “soft” or moderate definition, which defines deviance as behavior, beliefs, or conditions that are likely to generate negative reactions from audiences. In contrast, the normative definition identifies deviance as a violation of a norm held in certain social circles or by a majority of the members of the society at large. A norm is a standard about “what human beings should or should not think, say, or do under given circumstances” (Blake and Kingsley, 1964). Put another way, a norm is a social expectation concerning thought or behavior in particular situations. Violations of norms tend to draw reactions or sanctions from their social audiences. These sanctions generate the pressure that most people feel to conform to social norms. However, even if the actor, the believer, or the possessor is not detected or chastised for a normative violation, the non‐normative act, belief, or trait is deviant nonetheless. To the normative definition, what defines something as deviant is a formal violation of the rules. Although the wording of reactivists and normative definitions appear similar, each conceptualization focuses attention on very different aspects of deviance: the normative definitions focus on the person who engages in norm‐violating behavior while reactivist definitions focus on the social audiences that define deviants.",

Audio-visual mass media, like television and wide-screen movie in a cinema, influence and provoke the teenagers to begin early dating. Early dating causes a high risk since the persons involved do not possess adequate mental stability and psychological maturity to make a good and right decision. In early dating the teenagers easily get bored with their couple because they do not know their purpose to do a dating. Those who begin dating at very early age more frequently catch headache, abdominal trouble and waist pains. They risk to be a fragile person of poor health, unsecured feeling and depression.",

      "abstract": "Studies indicate that more students are opposing the use of invasive procedures on animals. When students are forced to use animals in ways that they view as harmful, painful, stressful or lethal to the animals, several reactions may occur. Such students may suffer psychological trauma as the result of seeing themselves or others engaged in behaviour that they find ethically objectionable. Their cognitive abilities may become impaired, resulting in less learning. They may withdraw and lose interest in science when not given the option to conscientiously object. Students--even those who believe they are willing participants--can become desensitised and may develop a utilitarian view of animals, thereby diminishing their capacity for compassion and ethical decision-making. Qualified, compassionate people--especially women--often decide to end their career in science rather than compromise their values. This loss contributes to the gender gap in science and to individuals feeling disappointed and derailed in their career aspirations. The psychological consequences to individuals combined with social, environmental, educational and scientific consequences present a compelling argument for the 100% replacement of the harmful use of animals in education.",

Consequently, it is often difficult to believe that religion or a particular manner of religious awareness can also be conducive to the degradation and humiliation of individuals, and that it can be maneuvered to justify abusive behavior. In this article we discuss the emotional repercussions of religious-related abuse in the family, an aspect that is rarely documented in the field of psychotherapy, but has many negative consequences. Religious-oriented emotional abuse is traceable to several levels of human functioning: the individual's internal level of experiencing themselves, the interpersonal and systemic levels, where the individual enters relationships, as well as within the framework of the individual's relationship with God.",

This paper presents a comparative study of children's interactions in four social contexts—with mother and with sibling at home, and with peers and teachers in preschool. The structures differ in several respects, and the differences reflect the nature of the relationships concerned. While all consisted of groups of positive and negative interactions, the extent of these groups differed between relationships: in general, they were not directly negatively correlated with each other. In some relationships, the partners played equal roles in initiating interactions, while others were more complementary. In some relationships, long sequences of interactions tended to be more positive than short, and in others the reverse was the case. Some behavioural items had different associations in different contexts, indicating the danger of equating behavioural items across contexts.",

      "title": "Choosing not to choose.",
      "abstract": "Choice can be an extraordinary benefit or an immense burden. In some contexts, people choose not to choose, or would do so if they were asked. In part because of limitations of \"bandwidth,\" and in part because of awareness of their own lack of information and potential biases, people sometimes want other people to choose for them. For example, many people prefer not to make choices about their health or retirement plans; they want to delegate those choices to a private or public institution that they trust (and may well be willing to pay a considerable amount to those who are willing to accept such delegations). This point suggests that however well accepted, the line between active choosing and paternalism is often illusory. When private or public institutions override people's desire not to choose and insist on active choosing, they may well be behaving paternalistically, through a form of choice-requiring paternalism. Active choosing can be seen as a form of libertarian paternalism, and a frequently attractive one, if people are permitted to opt out of choosing in favor of a default (and in that sense permitted not to choose); it is a form of nonlibertarian paternalism insofar as people are required to choose. For both ordinary people and private or public institutions, the ultimate judgment in favor of active choosing, or in favor of choosing not to choose, depends largely on the costs of decisions and the costs of errors.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for child sexual abuse",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Child sexual abuse (CSA) is the involvement of children and adolescents in sexual activities (usually for adult sexual stimulation or gratification) that they cannot fully comprehend and to which they cannot consent as a fully equal, self-determining participant, because of their early stage of development [Box 1].Box 1: Defining child sexual abuseIt is important to understand the nature and type of CSA as the severity of the impact of the abuse depends on not only on the type of abuse but also on the duration of the abuse and very importantly, whether the abuser is a known/trusted person or a stranger [Table 1].Table 1: Nature or type of child sexual abuseThus, CSA is a complex issue, wherein impact and recovery depend on all of the above variables and how they combine to influence the child's experience of abuse. Even where there are two children, who have been impacted by identical forms and processes of abuse (similar variables), they may still be different in terms of their responses. This difference is accounted for personality and temperament of each child, and social context and circumstances of each child, due to which each child perceives and internalizes the abuse differently, thus resulting in different emotional and behavioral states to the abuse, and necessitating different psychosocial and mental health responses. CSA is not a clinical condition or diagnosis. Clinical practice guidelines for standard child psychiatric conditions can be developed based on existing knowledge and practices. However, to develop clinical practice guidelines for an experience that is both nuanced and complicated by psychological and social processes is a particular challenge. Clinical practice guidelines for CSA, therefore, necessitate mental health professionals to work with many processes and systems to effectively assist the child. CONTEXT OF CONSULTATION There are broadly three contexts in which children present for consultation on sexual abuse issues. The first is when CSA is already established by agencies and individuals, and they refer the child to the mental health system. Such referrals may be received from: (i) District Child Protection Units; (ii) Childline and child care agencies/service providers; (ii) Police; and (iii) Courts and judicial personnel. Children are brought by such agencies and bodies either for interventions in the wake of trauma and emotional problems and/or for inquiry and evidence gathering for use in court cases. Thus, in this context, the mental health system is not required to establish whether or not CSA has occurred, as it is already known – usually, children would have reported abuse or in case of children in sex trafficking, they have been rescued through a raid on sex work institutions, and so the abuse has come to light. The second context is one in which the child has reported to his/her parents but they, in turn, have not reported the abuse to police or legal systems. However, they seek consultation to provide the child with mental health interventions. The third context is when it is not (yet) known that he/she has been sexually abused; the child comes to the mental health system for some psychological or psychiatric manifestation, but on enquiry and examination, CSA issues emerge in one of the following ways: The child discloses or reports abuse An adolescent girl is found to be pregnant (Frequent) urinary tract infections in the child are reported by the child/caregivers and/or genital injuries in the child are reported/observed Emotional and behavioral issues that are associated with anxiety, anger, and depression. There is what is called an index of suspicion in CSA, i.e., when to suspect CSA and how true one's suspicions likely to be. Figure 1 represents the index of suspicion in CSA. At the peak of the triangle, the index of suspicion is the highest, i.e., there is no doubt when a child reports or discloses that abuse has taken place, especially when a child spontaneously reports without particular inquiry by an adult.Figure 1: Index of suspicion in child sexualEqually high on the index is pregnancy (in adolescent girls) – a sure sign that sexual abuse has occurred. Genital injuries and frequent urinary tract infections must lead to suspicion that there is digital handling and sexual abuse is very likely to have taken place. Emotional and behavioral changes observed in the child are important indicators of CSA; however, they come lower on the index of suspicion because these psychological changes may occur due to some reasons (unlike pregnancy or genital injuries which do not have a range of reasons for their occurrence!). Emotional and behavioral issues relating to anxiety and depression may occur due to sexual abuse but may also be due to other difficult and traumatic experiences such as parental marital conflict, bullying, learning difficulties and academic pressures, loss, and grief (death-related) experiences… so, while emotional and behavioral changes may lead to CSA suspicion, further examination and inquiry needs to be made (by a psychosocial or mental health professional) to understand exactly what difficult event(s) or experiences they are attributable to in a given child. During the inquiry, if sexual abuse is ruled out, then the signs and symptoms may be attributable to other difficult experiences. Below are indices of CSA [Table 2].Table 2: Emotional and behavioral indices of child sexual abusePROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHING AND CONFIRMING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE The procedure for establishing and/or confirming CSA has three components, namely, (i) Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment; (ii) Developmental Assessment; (iii) Abuse Inquiry or Forensic Interviewing for CSA. The third component particularly, is predicated on the first two components, which makes it necessary for the three assessments to be done in the order in which they are listed and described. Psychosocial and mental health assessment It is important to obtain a detailed history and assessment of the child, including information on family and school context, developmental level and functionality, emotional and behavioral issues (pre- and post-sexual abuse), circumstances of the alleged abuse, the child's experience and understanding of the abuse and other related problems. Treatment and interventions for abuse must be developed based on the complete assessment of the child's context and issues; this is because every child is unique and has his/her own unique ways, based on age, developmental stage, personality and temperament, family and social circumstances, and the nature of abuse, of processing the abuse experience. Information requires to be obtained through the assessment of the child and family/caregivers. The immediate aftermath of the abuse, i.e., within the first few days is not the time for asking the child to provide the abuse narrative in great detail as this is likely to distress and traumatize the child further. The objective of the Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment [Box 2] is to establish that abuse has occurred and to know the nature of abuse, i.e., contact versus non-contact, penetrative versus nonpenetrative abuse with a view to making decisions regarding medical interventions, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) interventions, as necessary.Box 2: Psychosocial and mental health assessmentIt is important to understand any emotional and behavioral issues the child had before the abuse and compare these to those that may have occurred post-abuse. This is because (i) we need to understand exactly which emotional and behavioral problems that are attributable to abuse; (ii) we need to understand how pre-abuse emotional and behavioral issues may have determined the ways in which the child has processed the abuse experience and been impacted by it. In either case, the child would need to receive treatment and assistance for all emotional and behavioral issues, both pre-existing ones as well as those that developed as a result of the abuse. Developmental assessment The developmental assessment requires to be completed before any forensic interviewing processes and/or interventions are entered into with children for eliciting abuse narratives. The purposes of conducting a developmental assessment in the context of CSA are two-fold: To make decisions about the feasibility and use of methods to elicit the abusive narrative in accordance with the developmental abilities of the child, for treatment and intervention purposes and/or as part of evidence gathering for court cases/legal processes To be able to design and/or deliver age-appropriate interventions; this includes the use of communication and methodologies that are comprehensible to a child in the course of treatment, including to provide personal safety education and awareness (which forms a part of the treatment interventions). There are five specific domains of development that children require to be assessed in: physical or locomotor, speech and language, cognitive, social and emotional development. If the abilities and skills in these domains are not age-appropriate, then there are implications for forensic interviewing and evidence gathering for court cases and legal processes [Box 3].Box 3: Applying child development assessment to CSA inquiry and interventionInquiry with the child: Forensic interviewing for child sexual abuse This includes interviewing the child to obtain information on the sequence of abuse events and how they occurred according to the child, and how the child perceived and understood the abuse. The interview may have to be carried out in well-planned sessions, over a period of time, especially in the case of younger children or children with posttraumatic disorder. Creative play methods, such as stories, art and toys/dolls may have to be used to elicit children's narratives. Such indirect methods are gentle and nonthreatening and also allow younger children with less developed verbal abilities to communicate their experiences of abuse. During these sessions, while eliciting children's abuse narratives, open-ended questions that encourage children to express themselves freely should be used. A detailed verbatim recording of the interview should be done through written documentation as well as video recordings in case of play sessions with young children so that these can also be used for legal proceedings. Introduction and rapport building Greet the child and tell him/her your name and then, ask the child his/her name Sit at the same physical level as child (if the child is on the floor, sit on the floor… if the child is sitting on a chair, sit on the chair next to her) Use toys and play activities (dolls, puzzles, picture books, and coloring books…) to engage young children and give it to the child as soon as (s)he comes to the court (while waiting for you) Enter into play with the child and spend 5–10 min engaging child in play activity… \"what are you doing? What is the doll doing? May I see what you are coloring?\" Engage in neutral conversation with the child for a few minutes (this also helps to assess the child's developmental abilities and skills as well as mental state)--What did you eat for breakfast today? How did you come here today? Who are these people who have come with you?.... \" For older children and adolescents, you may say \"I really want to know you better. Tell me about the things you like to do\" Introduce the space and the purpose of the child being there, including your role: \"My name is… my job here is to make sure that children are safe and no one hurts them. If we hear that someone is hurting or troubling children, then we do things to stop that from happening\" \"You may be wondering about this busy place and many rooms…many people come here, just like you to talk about people who have hurt or troubled them…that's why we need a big space like this and many people to help\" \"Although this place may seem a little scary and confusing, you are safe here…and after we have spent a little time talking, you can go back home with your parents or caregiver.\" Explain the need for video camera/microphone (in case you are using such equipment) – \"As you can see, we have a video-camera and microphones here. They will record our conversation so I can remember everything you tell me. Sometimes, I forget things and the recorder allows me to listen to you without having to write everything down.\" (In case you are taking notes, you may provide a similar explanation to the child). Ensuring accurate reporting This is to ensure that the child has the competency to differentiate between truth and lies and to ensure that children tell the truth. Establish the need for telling the truth, and child's capacity to differentiate between what's true or not and to say \"I don't understand\" or to tell examiner when he makes a wrong statement: Part of my job is to talk to children (teenagers) about things that have happened to them. I meet with lots of children (teenagers) so that they can tell me the truth about things that have happened to them. Hence, before we begin, I want to make sure that you understand how important it is to tell the truth For younger children, explain: (\"What is true and what is not true\"). \"If I say that my shoes are red (or green) is that true or not true?\" (Wait for an answer, then say:) \"That would not be true, because my shoes are really (black/blue/etc.). And if I say that I am sitting down now, would that be true or not true (right or not right)?\" (Wait for an answer.) It would be (true/right) because you can see I am really sitting down.' \"I see that you understand what telling the truth means. It is very important that you only tell me the truth today. You should only tell me about things that really happened to you.\" (Pause) \"If I ask a question that you don't understand, just say, \"I don't understand.\" Okay?\" (Pause) \"If I don't understand what you say, I'll ask you to explain. \"What would you say if I made a mistake and called you a 2-year-old girl (when interviewing a 5-year-old boy, etc.)?\" (Wait for an answer.) \"That's right. Now you know you should tell me if I make a mistake or say something that is not right. You may record your observations as follows: Capacity to differentiated \"truth\" established Yes No Capacity to say \"I don't understand\" established Yes No Capacity to tell interviewer that she/he \"is not right\" established Yes No. Training in episodic memory Episodic memory represents our memory of experiences and specific events in time in a serial form, from which we can reconstruct the actual events that took place at any given point in our lives. It is the memory of autobiographical events (times, places, associated emotions, and other contextual knowledge) that can be explicitly stated. Individuals tend to see themselves as actors in these events, and the emotional charge and the entire context surrounding an event is usually part of the memory, not just the bare facts of the event itself (http://www.human-memory.net/types_episodic.html). It is essential to encourage children to provide detailed responses early in the interview as this enhances their descriptive responses to open-ended prompts in other parts of the interview, particularly those related to the abuse incident. Hence, at this stage of the interview, training in episodic memory or narrative practice should be done as follows: \" It is very important that you tell me everything you remember about things that have happened to you. You can tell me both good things and bad things\" Identify a recent event the child experienced- the first day of school, birthday party, holiday) and build up on that using qualifiers like tell me, what happened next, \"Think hard about (activity or event) and tell me what happened on that day from the time you got up that morning until (some portion of the event mentioned by the child in response to the previous question). \"Tell me more about (activity mentioned by the child).\" (Wait for an answer.) Use this prompt as often as needed throughout this section] \"Earlier you mentioned [activity mentioned by the child]. Tell me everything about that.\" Note: Focus on real-life events; avoid focusing on accounts relating to television, videos, and fantasy. Abuse enquiry Now transition to substantive issues to enable the child to provide you with the narrative by using open questions such as: \"Now that I know a little about you, I want to talk about why (you are here) today\" \"I heard you talked to \"X\" about something that happened – tell me what happened\" \"I see you have (a bruise, a broken arm, etc.,) – tell me what happened\" \"I heard you saw (the doctor, a policeman, etc.) last week – tell me how come/what you talked about\" \"Is (your mom, another person) worried about something that happened to you? Tell me what she is worried about\" \"I understand someone might have troubled you – tell me what happened\" \"I understand someone may have done something that wasn't right – tell me what happened\" \"I understand something may have happened at (location) – tell me what happened\" Young children, who either do not have the language to name private parts and genitals or are unwilling to name these parts due to fear and embarrassment, use pictures or dolls to assist the child--\"I will show you a picture (here is a doll)… can you show me/point to where this person touched or hurt you…\" Probe for disclosure Use gentle probes, including some close-ended questions to confirm some details. If child has mentioned telling someone about the incident(s), ask details, if not then probe about possible immediate disclosure by saying: \"Does anybody else know what happened?\" How did they come to know? [Box 4]Box 4: Techniques of Inquiry: Leading questionsClosing the interview The closure phase helps to provide an end to a conversation that may have been emotionally difficult for the child. \"You have told me lots of things today, and I want to thank you for helping me.\" \"I want to especially tell you how brave you are for telling me all that happened… things like this happen to many children, but they don't always want to tell others about it… because they are afraid. You may also have been scared, but you were brave to tell people about it – I am sure your parents are proud of you… I am too\" \"Is there anything else you think I should know?\" \"Is there anything you want to tell me?\" \"Are there any questions you want to ask me?\" \"If you want to talk to me again, you can call me at this phone number and come and see me again.\" (Give the child or caregiver your name and phone number). IMPACT OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION After eliciting the abuse narrative, it is critical to understand the methods and processes used by the perpetrator to sexually abuse the child. CSA is a process that consists of a series of actions entailing lure, seduction, manipulation and/or coercion and threat. Different methods and processes of abuse have different psychological impacts on children and adolescents. Not all CSA results in trauma; in fact, where CSA methods use lure, seduction, and manipulation to \"manufacture\" the consent of the child (versus methods of threat, violent coercion, and aggression), there may be the less overt or visible traumatic reaction in the child [Table 3].Table 3: Understanding trauma dynamics: The impact of child sexual abuseAbuse in the context of \"manufactured consent\" When abuse has taken place through grooming processes (i.e., lure, inducement, and manipulation) and violence, threat and coercion methods have played little or no role in the abuse process, children/adolescents are less likely to be aware of and acknowledge the abuse [Box 5].Box 5: When and why children do not acknowledge abuse experiencesImplications for intervention Focus on helping children recognize various types of child (sexual) abuse, including understanding why and how certain actions constitute abuse Reassurances to child on safety and protection (from the perpetrator) Arrangements with parents/caregiver to ensure the child's safety and protection. Abuse of young children In younger children, the methods of abuse entail (i) inducement and lure and/or (ii) coercion and threat. Inducement and lure entail the use of sweets and toys to get children to perform or cooperate in sexual acts for adult stimulation. Perpetrators also use attention and affection in exchange for sexual favors, i.e., provision of attention and affection when the child complies with the adult on sexual acts and withdrawal of attention and affection when the child does not. These methods are followed by the perpetrator creating excitement and secrecy around the sexual act, often presenting it to the child as a \"special new game,\" a \"secret game\" that no one else plays and no one else knows about; and young children, who have no understanding of sexuality are vulnerable to such ruses. Implications for intervention Medical assistance in case of violent abuse and physical injury Teaching children about safety issues related to strangers as well as known persons Enabling children to learn how to protect their bodies, i.e., which body parts should not be touched by anyone except for select family members such as mothers/caregivers during personal hygiene activities Helping children discern between \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" secrets Validation of emotions and provision of reassurance for children who may be traumatized by the CSA. Abuse of adolescents In older children and adolescents, the processes of abuse are similar, but the use of lure and inducement are slightly different and these processes are also known as 'grooming' [Box 6]. Given that adolescents are at a life stage wherein they are interested in issues of love, attraction and sexuality and are also keen to experiment with these experiences, perpetrators tend to use lure and inducements that are more emotional in nature (rather than the more material ones used with younger children). This means that they smooth talk adolescents about their physical appeal and qualities, making promises of long-term emotional, and romantic relationships with them—and adolescents interpret these actions as being loving and romantic.Box 6: The grooming processAgain, given the life stage adolescents are at, often also under peer pressure to experiment with sexuality, offenders have the perfect opportunity to manipulate them into sexual engagement by transmitting all sorts of misconceptions about sexual behaviors and norms. For instance, appealing to adolescents' need to \"fit in\" with their peers, perpetrators tell adolescents that it is necessary to gain sexual experience, that it would be \"uncool\" if they are ignorant about sexual acts. As a result, adolescents, who are still acquiring life skills such as (sexual) decision-making, are negatively influenced, believing in the misconceptions transmitted to them, confused by how they should respond. Following such manipulation and abuse, adolescents experience feelings of tremendous confusion, especially as they have shared \"deep\" sexual and romantic relationships with the offender. They find it exceedingly difficult to discern this as an abused process and defend the offender, often refusing to accept that this is abuse. Implications for intervention Medical assistance in case of violent abuse and physical injury In case of pregnancy, decisions around medical termination of pregnancy, depending on the medical issues as well as the adolescent's desire to have/keep the child, i.e., from a child rights' perspective, facilitating discussions with the adolescent to help her make decisions about her pregnancy Helping adolescents explore notions of love, romance, and relationships Enabling adolescents to understand various forms of coercion, ranging from material lure to persuasion and threat; focussing on an understanding of consent in sexual relationships [Box 7] Personal safety awareness and education focussing on equipping adolescents with sexual decision-making skills (a life skills approach) Validation of emotions and working with notions of self-identity, including feelings of guilt and shame, in children and adolescents who may be traumatized by the CSA. Box 7: The issue of consentINTERVENTIONS As also shown in Figure 2, CSA interventions can be broadly categorized into three types of responses:Figure 2: Child sexual abuse interventions Medical assistance Psychosocial interventions First level responses for children Depth therapeutic interventions for children Interventions for parents and caregivers. Legal assistance. Medical assistance In case a child is referred immediately after abuse, i.e., within a few hours or days), it is necessary to first proceed with a medical evaluation and requisite medical interventions as a priority. Treatment history and response to treatment (in case the child has already undergone or is undergoing treatment) should be recorded. Ideally, it must be ensured that the child is provided with emergency medical services within 24 h of filing the first information report (FIR) in case a police report has been filed or even otherwise. Physical examination Physical examination of the child to be conducted including 2 ID marks The child's family or caregiver should be present in the room during the examination Permission of the child and consent of the parent to be taken before the examination What physical symptoms does the child have at present/(e.g., burning sensation during micturition, White Discharge per Vagina, itching in the perineal area, bleeding, any injury, pain in any area, etc.) Post-exposure prophylaxis If a child is within the 36 h window period (especially in case of penetrative abuse): Has the child received Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) (within 36 h) in case of penetrative abuse? If not, refer to Paediatric ART Centre for PEP Even if the child is not in the window period and the penetrative abuse has occurred within a month, refer to the Paediatric ART Centre so that a decision can be taken regarding initiation of PEP Ensure that the child/adolescent has received oral contraceptive pills to prevent pregnancy Ensure that the child has been medically evaluated by a Registered Medical Practitioner, namely a pediatrician or gynecologist from a government hospital, for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), urinary tract infection and/or injuries. The STD investigation must be repeated at the end of 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Forensic examination Check whether an additional specific forensic evaluation has been done (examination requested by police documenting abuse, if swabs have been taken in case of penetrative abuse), and if so, whether the report is available. Obtain the report from the relevant source. Pregnancy tests Ensure that a urine pregnancy test has been done In case the results are a false negative, it would be best to obtain an additional gynecological opinion In case the child/adolescent is under 20 weeks pregnant, discussions about abortion may need to be done with the child/adolescent and her caregivers. It is also advisable to liaise with an obstetrician at this time. Psychosocial and mental health interventions for children and families Following medical assistance, or simultaneously, psychosocial and mental health interventions should be initiated for the child and family, based on the Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment completed. Developmental assessments and forensic interviewing may follow subsequently, and be embedded in the counseling and therapy processes. Pharmacotherapy Pharmacotherapy is not specifically indicated for CSA unless it results in severe anxiety and depressive states. Children who have undergone CSA and present with severe PTSD will require medication in addition to other psychosocial interventions: These medications include specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or benzodiazepines, in dosages recommended as per body weight. SSRIs are also indicated in situations where CSA results in severe depression associated with self-harm behaviors, dissociation, and agitation. States of agitation may call for SOS medication with low dosage benzodiazepines There are a group of children with pre-existing vulnerabilities or those in whom the trauma is so destabilizing that it results in mood dysregulation. This group of children may require mood stabilizers. Older children and adolescents, particularly, must not be coerced to take medication in case they are unwilling i.e. they require to be counselled, including on issues of need and adherence [Box 8].Box 8: Preparing the children and adolescents for medical tests and treatmentFirst level psychosocial responses for children Asking questions, and attempting to establish depth interventions when the child is facing a crisis, i.e., in the immediate aftermath of abuse, is not a useful beginning. This is not the time to for detailed enquiry. If there are serious and disruptive manifestations such as self-harm behaviors, incapacitating anxiety, PTSD symptoms with severe panic, appropriate psychiatric referral at this stage is important (as psychiatric medication may be required for anxiety symptoms to reduce before any counseling work is initiated). However, certain initial responses or what are know as first level responses [Box 9] of a supportive nature require to be provided to the child.Box 9: Objectives of first level responses to child sexual abuseEnsuring child's safety Depending on where the abuse occurred and who the perpetrator is, it is essential to immediately take measures to protect the child from further abuse. This is especially applicable when the perpetrator is a family member or a person known to the child, and where the abuse has occurred at home or in places the child frequents on a daily or regular basis (such as school/tutorials, etc).

It has become increasingly obvious that sexual behaviour is influenced by psychological factors such as attitudes, emotional responses, personality, imagery and learning, and that the clinician will need to be as aware of the psychology of sex as he is of the underlying anatomy, psychology and biochemistry. Psychologists and others have contributed to our understanding of sex through a number of survey investigations, and more recently laboratory studies; in addition, clinicians have been keen to develop and evaluate treatment techniques to alleviate sexual inadequacies. The importance of an understanding of sexual behaviour, for doctors and other professionals, is underlined by a number of factors.",

To test these opposing views, we asked 464 recently married spouses whether they had ever been uncertain about getting married and then compared 4-year divorce rates and marital satisfaction trajectories among those partners with and without premarital doubts. Doubts were reported by at least one partner in two thirds of couples. Women with premarital doubts had significantly higher 4-year divorce rates, even when controlling for concurrent marital satisfaction, the difficulty of their engagement, history of parental divorce, premarital cohabitation, and neuroticism. Among intact couples, men's and women's doubts predicted less satisfied marital trajectories. Premarital doubts appear to be common but not benign, suggesting that valid precursors of marital distress are evident during couples' engagements.",

      "title": "‘Mad’, ‘bad’ or misunderstood?",
      "abstract": "Children’s behaviour, its definition, assessment and regulation, is rarely out of the news. It remains the focus of both professional and popular discourses, constantly labelled and regularly invoking calls for greater intervention. Within the ensuing debates the ‘mad’, ‘bad’ or ‘sad’ child is publicly defined and rarely consulted. Invariably, the public and professional debates turn on the conflated issues of ‘acceptable’ behaviour and ‘normality’. The process of defining, identifying, explaining and responding to deviant or ‘abnormal’ behaviour becomes the vital reference point against which normality is itself defined. What has emerged is a process, in both professional and popular discourse, based on binary opposition. Yet it is an arbitrary process that sets boundaries around normality without reflecting on historical, cultural, ideological, socioeconomic and political contingencies. What follows is a critique of this process as it relates to children and young people whose behaviour is defined as ‘disturbed’ or ‘disturbing’. While clinical studies have attempted to give scientific rigour to judgements about disturbed or disturbing behaviour in children and young people, they rely heavily on adults – parents and professionals – to make initial judgements that determine particular behaviours as problematic. Thus, “we have to see clinicians in their social role as authoritative interpreters of disturbance, adding a further layer to the commonsense definitions used by parents” (Grimshaw and Berridge, 1994, p 8). As Steinberg states: The process by which adolescents become psychiatric patients has as much to do with the feelings and behaviour of other people, and with social customs and routines, as with anything happening inside their heads.",

      "abstract": "Freddy A. Panigua plantea en su artículo, utilizando innumerables datos internacionales, que la edad de casamiento y de tener relaciones sexuales en personas jóvenes varía a nivel regional y de país en país. También demuestra que la definición de pedofilia en el DSM-5 podría implicar un escenario en donde una persona no esté cometiendo una falta legal, pero sí podría ser juzgado con un disturbio mental como sería la pedofilia. Por lo tanto, puede ocurrir, y no es raro que ocurra, una disyuntiva entre lo legal y lo psiquiátrico. En el presente escrito, me propongo demonstrar que dicho hallazgo no es sorprendente cuando partimos de una perspectiva basada en la construcción social de la realidad. Al no haber una esencia inmutable, que trasciende épocas y regiones, la construcción social de lo que es un niño y un adolescente, y su madurez para mantener relaciones sexuales, variará de acuerdo a variables de corte político, religioso, social y económico. Asimismo, critico dos posturas del autor, las cuales me parecen insostenibles. La primera mantiene que un “niño” debe ser definido como una persona menor de 18 años. Tal postura ha sido denunciada como una infantilización de los adolescentes. La segunda es su propuesta de que se defina al pedófilo como una persona con 18 años o más y una víctima como una persona menor de 18 años. Esta clasificación llevaría a una persona de 19 años que tenga relaciones con su pareja de 17 años como una persona pedófila, lo que me parece que abre la puerta para que en psiquiatría se continúe la tendencia de ir estrechando cada vez más lo que son conductas normales.",

Robinson (2000) describes disenfranchised grief as grief which is:\r\nnot recognized and supported by the community…. The mourners whose grief is disenfranchised are, by virtue of this, cut off from the social supports and so have few opportunities to express and resolve their feelings….either the relationship is not recognized, the loss is not recognized or the griever is not recognized…Significant losses can occur even when the object of the loss it still alive (p. 127).\r\nThis paper argues that for a variety of reasons, which will be explored, such disenfranchisement is common for many donor-conceived adults. Those adults who grieve as a result of the intentional separation, and loss of nurturing and identity forming relationships with their biological relatives due to their donor conceptions. It is also proposed that though information and contact may become possible for a rare few donor-conceived adults (with their paternal family and siblings), there still are significant losses, which have been ‘created’, and are most commonly disenfranchised.",

Infertility causes profound adjustments in a couple, changing their views of themselves as women and men, spouses, and family members.

Ideas that current or past life choices could cause or contribute to infertility can cause feelings of guilt. Sexual function may be affected both by these complex feelings and by the impact of timed tests on a couple’s choices about when to have sex. Women experience their once familiar bodies as imperfect, often with a powerful impact on any future pregnancy experiences. Couples may have unrealistic expectations that modern medicine can fix any newly discovered problem.

Personality testing shows that the parents relate poorly to their children and to other people and that they have immature and impetuous personalities. Predictive studies show that abuse is commoner in families where the above characteristics are found, where family supports are minimal and where there are complications in the pregnancy, birth and in the neonatal period.

      "title": "(290) Exploring the Link Between Conformity to Masculine Ideologies and Responses to Sexual Rejection in Cisgender Men and Cisgender Women",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexual rejection occurs when a person’s sexual advances are terminated by a potential sexual partner, leading to responses that may disregard the partner’s choice, such as attempts to entice or express resentment. Traditional masculine ideologies (TMIs) could play a role in motivating enticing or resentful responses. TMIs often emphasize superiority, encompassing power, control, dominance, and frequent sexual activity. When individuals adhering to TMIs face sexual rejection, they may experience feelings of inferiority and respond with enticing or resentful behaviors to reassert superiority. Objective Explore links between TMIs and the use of enticing and resentful responses following experiences of sexual rejection. Methods A German-speaking sample of 351 cisgender men and 345 cisgender women (age: M = 28.11, SD = 8.05) were randomly assigned to read one of two hypothetical stories in which participants should imagine being sexually rejected by their partner (rejection condition), or engaging in sexual activity with their partner (no-rejection condition). Afterward, participants had to report how they would react to sexual rejection. TMI was assessed with the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory. Results Compared to cisgender women, cisgender men more often would react with enticing tactics (β = .77, p &amp;lt; .001). Compared to participants who were rejected, participants who were not rejected more often would react with enticing tactics (β = .43, p &amp;lt; .001). Participants with higher levels of TMIs (being a playboy, dominating women, holding heterosexual self-presentation) more often would react with enticing tactics (β = .18, p &amp;lt; .001; β = .15, p &amp;lt; .001; β = .11, p &amp;lt; .001, respectively). Compared to men with higher levels of TMI (heterosexual self-presentation), women with higher levels of TMI (heterosexual self-presentation) more often would react with resentful responses (β = .68, p &amp;lt; .001). This effect was reinforced through sexual rejection, as opposed to no sexual rejection (β = -.63, p &amp;lt; .001). Conclusions When sexual rejection hasn’t occurred men are more inclined to enticing behaviors. This tendency may stem from potential misunderstandings about desires and consent after initial sexual intercourse. Conversely, when sexual rejection does occur, resentful responses are more common among women adhering to a heterosexual self-presentation. Heterosexual self-presentation might align with adherence to traditional sexual scripts in which men are not expected to decline the sexual advances of a desiring woman. Consequently, rejection may be perceived as a direct challenge to their identity as a woman, triggering feelings of resentment. Therapists can apply these findings to better assist individuals or couples in their sexual relationships. By examining how adherence to traditional gender norms and scripts influences reactions to sexual rejection, therapists can help clients recognize these influences and promote respectful responses that honor all partners’ desires and boundaries.

      "title": "Comparative study of Suicide Attempters with and withoutPersonality Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nSuicide's history goes back at least to man's earliest written records.\r\nThere are many perspectives from which we can view suicide - historical,\r\nSociological, biological, psychological etc. These perspectives not just\r\nInfluence the way we see suicide and suicidal attempts, but also the\r\nEfforts at suicide prevention.\r\nSuicide is a serious public health problem. There have been\r\nDramatic and disturbing increases in suicide among youths. The study of\r\nSuicide risk and protective factors and their interaction form the empirical\r\nBase for suicide prevention. Understanding risk factors can help dispel the\r\nMyth that suicide is a random act or result from stress alone.\r\nRisk factors for completed suicide include male gender, extremes\r\nOf age, prior suicide attempts, family history of attempts, psychiatric\r\nDisorders - Axis I and Axis II diagnosis, substance dependence, adverse\r\nLife experiences and other social factors.\r\nSuicide completions and suicide attempts can be seen as\r\nRepresenting two distinct yet overlapping populations. Books describe a\r\nTypical suicide completer as a male with Axis I diagnosis of depressive\r\nDisorder with comorbid substance dependence. A typical suicide\r\nAttempter is a young female with Axis II disorders such as borderline,\r\nNarcissistic, or histrionic personality disorder. Those who have made an\r\nAttempt of low lethality are often treated dismissively as attention seekers.\r\nBut, the fact that, at the very least, such individuals are the victims of\r\nInadequate coping styles often is ignored. Between 8 to 10 percent of\r\nThose making an attempt will ultimately kill themselves. Suicide attempts\r\nRemain the single most important predictor of subsequent death by suicide\r\nOf all (WHO, 2002).\r\nSuicidal behaviour covers the whole range from suicidal thoughts,\r\nTo attempted suicide and completed suicide. Considering suicide as a\r\nSpectrum stretching from ideas and fantasies, wishes, acts to completions,\r\nStudying suicide attempters will give data that can be extrapolated to\r\nCompleters, keeping in mind that there can be significant differences.\r\nSuicide attempts can be up to 10 - 40 times frequent than completed\r\nSuicides in certain places (WHO, 2002). This indicates an enormous\r\nAmount of morbidity and burden.\r\nAccording to WHO/EURO multi-centre study on Para suicide,\r\nSuicide attempt is defined as An act with non fatal outcome in which an\r\nIndividual deliberately initiates a non habitual behavior, that without\r\nIntervention from others will cause self harm, (or) deliberately ingests a\r\nSubstance in excess of the prescribed (or) generally recognized dosage,\r\nAnd which is aimed at realizing changes that the person desires via the\r\nActual (or) expected physical consequences.\r\nPersonality Disorders:\r\nThe understanding of personality and its disorders is what\r\nDistinguishes psychiatry fundamentally from all other branches of\r\nMedicine. Personality disorders (pds) are common conditions in\r\nContemporary society. Pds occur in 10 to 20 percent of the general\r\nPopulation and in about half of psychiatric inpatients or outpatients.\r\nThe relevance of Personality Disorders in suicide completions has\r\nBeen evaluated by many studies (Cheng et al, 1997; Foster et al 1999;\r\nHenrikkson et al 1993; Foster et al 1997). Their relevance in suicide\r\nAttempts has been brought out by other studies (Suominen et al 1996;\r\nHawton et al 2003).\r\nAmong Indian studies, the rate of personality disorders in subjects\r\nWho have demonstrated acts of self-harm have varied from 7 %\r\n(Chandrasekaran et al, 2003) to 64 % (Nath et al, 2008). Sethi et al, 1978\r\nFound a rate of 47.8 % and Gupta et al, 1981 a rate of 62.2 % of\r\nPersonality disorders among suicide attempters.\r\nHowever, few studies have attempted to evaluate the characteristics\r\nOf suicide attempters with personality disorders and to study if there are\r\nMajor differences with those without personality disorders. Studying the\r\nDifferences would assist the management of these patients. This study is\r\nAn attempt in that direction.",

      "title": "Disability and Genetics: A Disability Critique of Pre‐natal Testing and Pre‐implantation Genetic Diagnosis (<scp>PGD</scp>)",
      "abstract": "Abstract Selecting against embryos or foetuses on the basis of predicted disability reinforces the belief that disability is inimical to a worthwhile life. The disability critique of pre‐natal testing and pre‐implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) flows from the belief that life with disability can be valuable to individuals, their families, and society. Disability should be understood as just another form of human variation. Reassessment of the crucial elements of the parent–child relationship is fundamental to create a welcoming society for persons with varying abilities. Reforms should be made to the information provided about the lives of persons with disabilities and their families in order to enhance women and couples’ informed reproductive decision‐making. Additionally, clinicians and genetics professionals need to understand that society contributes significantly to the difficulties that people with disabilities experience in attaining full participation in family and community life. Key Concepts: Neither PGD nor any method of pre‐natal testing can accurately indicate a potential child's quality of life. The expressivist argument is only one type of disability critique, which focuses on the negative message that PGD or pre‐natal testing followed by selective embryo implantation or selective abortion sends to current persons living with disabilities. The disability critique is not primarily expressivist. Most negative facets of life with disability can be attributed to societal attitudes and practices that are open to change, and not to the medical condition itself. Clinicians and professionals should understand that they have a role in ending discrimination against people with disabilities, much as they work to practice their professions without sexism or racism. Disability, like sex, race, and ethnicity, is a legitimate, respectable form of human variation. Preventing the incidence of disability is quite different from preventing the existence of persons with disability. Research indicates that people with disabilities and their families fare relatively the same as the rest of the population. The norms of good parenting include fostering and supporting the uniqueness of individual children, with all their mix of talents, personalities, strengths, and problems. Information about the nonmedical facets of life with disability and connections to disability support groups need to be provided to prospective parents deciding about their reproductive future.",

Anxiety is a pervasive factor. Total understanding of the aging person within the context of his cultural climate, as well as the test situation itself, is essential for accurate judgments of projective and objective tests in this age group. A more meaningful evaluation is obtained if allowance is made for the intricate pattern of psycho-social factors affecting test performance, and if various alternative interpretations are entertained.",

      "abstract": "Most people in Euro‐American and industrialized societies strongly believe in fidelity and most are, in fact, sexually faithful to their romantic partners. However, infidelity (also called extramarital or extrarelational sex) does occur. Several factors increase the likelihood of infidelity (e.g., gender, frequent travel); of these, relational factors (e.g., conflict, dysfunctional communication) are the most powerful. Infidelity has many negative consequences. The cheating partner often experiences guilt, anxiety, and fear; the cheated‐on partner typically experiences feelings of jealousy, anger, self‐doubt, and betrayal; and the relationship itself often does not survive. Researchers who study responses to (imagined) infidelity generally find that both men and women consider emotional infidelity (their partner falling in love with someone else) to be more upsetting than sexual infidelity (their partner engaging in sexual activity with someone else). However, two sex differences are commonly found: when asked to select the most distressing event, more men than women select sexual infidelity, and more women than men choose emotional infidelity. Although scholars continue to debate the origin of these sex differences, all agree that infidelity is an upsetting and destructive event in the life of most monogamous relationships.",

      "title": "A Tale of Cookies (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde)",
      "abstract": "QUESTIONS of anonymity, pseudonymity, the various degrees of privacy are connected with the technological fact that no generic system for identification in cyberspace currently exists. It is not possible to absolutely identify an entity or to tell accurately whether an object has a specific characteristic. The digital identity is a unique construction, one based on the lack of a physical presence . The political debate about the costs and benefits of anonymity presuppose that digital transactions cannot be traced. Possible digital transactions include exchanging e-mail, participation in a discussion group or in a chat room, browsing in cyberspace . Multiple identities; liberty of gender, age, name, and other constructions; social roles that follow the Pessoa ethics: the appearance of anonymity is unimaginable without the net. Consequently , almost nothing prevents the transmission of false identity information, or the duplication of the identity information of others . To avert these problems, the actual identity must not be transmitted along with the message; instead, a verification scheme needs to be used to convince the recipient that the message was actually sent by the sender. The culture of disappearance and pseudonymity raises the need to crystallize the sociology of multiplied identities. There are legal issues with pseudoanonymity: in reality, outside cyberspace , a unique characteristic serves normally as the representation or identifier for identity (for example, social security, driver’s license, or credit card number). SOCIAL RESEARCH, Vol. 69, No. 1 (Spring 2002) A Tale of Cookies (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) BY PÉTER GYÖRGY If cyberspace technically and practically allows the multiplication of identity, it means that digital identity can only be a useful metaphor, an intellectual concept in network games, because it lacks significance as a real social construction, with legal responsibilities and consequences. The aftermath of multiplied identity is the challenge of balancing the right to freedom of speech, the myth of the First Amendment, and defending privacy(!). There is the right to be and remain invisible, and the right to multiply identities: consequently, the right to be false. But there is the question of the intention of lying, or the creation of false identity. The analogy with the magazine Hustler—according to my impressions—is false. In the case of Hustler the Supreme Court defended the right of publisher Larry Flint to lie in order to protect the freedom of speech. The argument of public interest was stronger than the defense of privacy, but it does not mean that every false identity created by different users automatically represents public interest. Global Reach, Local Control There are the well-known cases, in which the false identity of the multiplied identities, the mask of the sender, could be the source of different dangers, of political and legal tensions. Child abusers, child pornography users, neo-nazi cyber-citizens artfully appropriate the benefits of digital freedom: the untraceable points of the network. Those who believe in the right to free speech are not interested in child pornography users, who appropriate the arenas of multiplied identities. In case of neo-nazis, the debate is more difficult: there are liberals who allow the Auschwitz-lüge and the other neo-nazi activities. They argue that the cost of controlling content could be higher than the benefit of exclusion of neo-nazis from cyberspace. I think it might be useful to pause for a moment to clarify certain elements of this narration. First, we have the example of the 240 SOCIAL RESEARCH neo-nazis and the level of regulation, the connections and interconnections between cyberspace and the real world, where nation-states and national laws are valid. In 1996, Germany tried and convicted neo-nazi Gary Lauck, who is an American citizen. From his home in the United States, Lauck had sent neo-nazi propaganda to countries around the world, including Germany. Along with other neo-nazis, Lauck maintained a website and sent e-mails and traditional letters also. The two forms of neo-nazi propaganda are not the same. The website could be interpreted as passive access for those browsing the net and who attempted to find a neo-nazi content. Sending e-mail, however, is an active act, which could be interpreted as a violation of...",

      "title": "Maintaining Multipartner Relationships",
      "abstract": "Abstract Humans maintain romantic relationships for sexual gratification, child care assistance, intimate friendship, and a host of other interpersonal benefits. In monogamous relationships (i.e., exclusive courtship between two people), individuals agree that certain benefits of the relationship (i.e., sexual contact, material resources, and emotional support) may only be shared within the pair-bond. That is, each partner is expected to maintain the relationship by provisioning sufficient benefits to satisfy the needs and desires of their partner. By comparison, consensual nonmonogamy (CNM) is a collection of relationship practices and structures whereby partners agree that it is permissible to have sexual contact or form intimate attachments with other people to satisfy these interpersonal needs and desires. In this chapter, we review literature examining who pursues CNM, how people who practice CNM derive and maintain satisfaction within their relationship(s), and when and how these relationships persist. We consider the role of CNM relationship maintenance practices, personality features that predispose people to CNM, and psychological and social barriers (e.g., jealousy, interpersonal conflict, sexual health anxiety, and condemnation) that prevent people from pursuing or maintaining CNM. Throughout, we consider how CNM compares to infidelity as an alternative strategy for pursuing multiple, concurrent romantic or sexual relationships. We close by discussing current directions in the scientific study of CNM and highlight which gaps in the literature are most pressing to address.",

      "title": "MEASURING INTERGENERATIONAL AMBIVALENCE TOWARD OLDER ADULTS IN THE FAMILY CONTEXT: A SCOPING REVIEW",
      "abstract": "Abstract Informal family caregivers may frequently feel ambivalent toward taking care of older family members. Ambivalence is the simultaneously held conflicting emotions, cognitions and/or behavioral tendencies due to countervailing expectations about how individual should act within the cultural norms. Most existing measurements directly or indirectly measuring caregiving or intergenerational ambivalence were developed from the West. Less is known how ambivalence is understood across distinctive sociocultural context globally. This scoping review examines the dimensions of existing instruments in measuring caregiver ambivalence toward older adults. Peer-reviewed articles were identified in five electronic databases. A keyword search was performed associated with ambivalence, caregiver or family, and measure development. Ten instruments were included. These instruments used different terms to represent caregiver ambivalence, not limited to intergenerational ambivalence and filial maturity. Existing measure items primarily capture the simultaneously held conflicting emotions toward older family members but limited to the domains of behaviors or cognitions. Moreover, existing measures are not inclusive of family caregiving to capture ethnic minorities who provide support to older family members motivated by filial responsibility beliefs. The scoping review uncovers the gaps between conceptual understanding and measurement of caregiver ambivalence toward older adults in the family. Findings will inform the direction of future research and the development of a culturally relevant measure that captures the intergenerational ambivalence experienced by ethnic minority who provide family support to older adults. The review will likely inform practice policy, and research in caregiving in a culturally sensitive manner.",

      "abstract": "Abstract First sexual intercourse is often viewed as a rite of passage to adulthood. While one's initial coital experience may lead to affirmation of self identity, it is disappointing for many, resulting an feelings of guilt and shame. If guilt feelings do emerge, the likelihood of future sexual dissatisfaction is greatly increased. In particular, women with high leuels of sexual guilttend to perceive less sexual arousal, resulting in less enjoyment from their sexual encounters. The purposes of this investigation were to identify those factors crrelated with feeling guilty about first sexual intercourse and to examine the injuence of guilt about first intercourse on current sexual satisfaction. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to never–married collegewomen, with the subsample for this investigation consisting of 570 women. Significant variables correlated with guilt at first sexual intercourse include uncommunicative mother and father figures, overstrict father figures, uncomfortabkness with sexuality, physiological and psychologzcalsexual dissatisfaction with first intercourse, guilt feelings about current intercourse, and psychological sexual dissatisfaction. These findings have substantial implications for sex researchers, sex therapists, family therapists, and sexuality educators who wish to promote healthy sexuality, through both attitudes and behavior.",

      "title": "Nurturing the Potential for Advanced Development: A Case for Identification of Indicators of Giftedness in Early Childhood",
      "abstract": "Giftedness is an elusive concept both to understand and define. Its very nature makes it difficult to capture its various facets in a prefabricated framework. Giftedness has been conceptualised depending on the needs of the society. The concept of intellectual superiority is inherent in any of the definition of the concept of gifted or creative. Talents are wasted because of the stereotyped and rigid concepts of intelligence and creativity. Not only do the schools and caregivers fail to realise the potential of the children but also kill their budding potential and curiosity. In a classroom there are many high achieving children whose abilities are unrecognised and their need for creative and original work is unmet. The classroom becomes an unchallenging and boring place for such children. This leads to underutilisation of the child's potential, and their achievements do not reflect their high abilities. When a gifted child does not get an opportunity for self-achievement he/she suffers mental agony. A realised individual is satisfied and holds a high self-concept. From the social-emotional wellbeing perspective of the child it becomes crucial that identification and nurturance of the child's potential should be given utmost importance. The present chapter tries to identify the indicators of high potential during early childhood years (6-10 years) and ways to nurture them so that the children can actualise their potential. Certain intervention strategies have been developed which try to motivate children to perform at a higher level as compared to their age. Concept of proximal development as envisaged by Vygotsky has been used in order to identify the children's potential in various areas of development and subsequently focusing on their actualisation.",

      "title": "The concept of mental disorder: an African perspective.",
      "abstract": "The concept of mental disorder is determined by many factors, including historical context, cultural influence, level of scientific knowledge and capacity to carry out scientific enquiry, level of education certain circumstances, as well as many others. In putting together a method of classification of mental disorders, expert's duty is primarily that of capturing and remaining faithful to current level of knowledge subject, acknowledging that, a matter of time, some or all above factors could change to variable degrees, making what was clear as a mental disorder a few decades previously less clear next edition of classification system.\r\n\r\nIn earlier editions of DSM, homosexuality was clearly categorized as a mental disorder and, by extension, a condition demanding or at least requiring medical treatment. In Western cultures, any suggestion that being gay or lesbian is anything but would now attract wrath of society. The situation Africa is quite opposite, and many Africans still view gay and lesbian people as mentally sick, because their sexual orientation is against order of nature. In this regard, one could view Africans as uncivilized or as holding a cultural belief that may or may not change course of time, much as it did Western countries.\r\n\r\nA similar but opposite position holds with respect to circumcision of women, a practice also described as female genital mutilation (FGM). There are still very strong pockets of Africans who practice FGM, presumably part as a cure for what Victorian physicians would have called clitoral orgasm, a condition then requiring preventive surgery. Many Africans defend cultural position with equal vigor to those who find it abnormal. There are those who would consider it a mental aberration to mutilate genitalia of young women and children.\r\n\r\nAnorexia nervosa is one of leading causes of morbidity and mortality adolescent girls Western countries. Crisp et al (1) found a prevalence of one severe case 200 girls independent schools, while, among girls aged 16 years and over, rate rose to one a hundred for severe cases. In Africa, condition is hardly known. Njenga and Kang'ethe (2) reported on a study Kenya and concluded that in a cumulative period of 320 years of practice, Kenyan psychiatrists had seen twenty cases of anorexia nervosa. Hulley et al (3) studied a sample of Kenyan and British female athletes and concluded that the effects of cul- ture were clear, women UK were more dissatisfied with their weight and shape and demonstrated significantly more eating disorder cases and associated psychopathology compared with Kenyan women.\r\n\r\nSo, who is deluding who? Is refusal to eat food by spoilt white girls a disease or simple foolishness?. Trying to explain to hungry African mother and child that there are girls who die Western countries because they refuse to eat food goes beyond reason and logic and would not make sense as a mental disorder, and yet West, there is no room for such a discussion.\r\n\r\nAnorexia nervosa raises many questions regarding its cause and origins. Is it primarily genetic, or is it a social construct of a search of thinness as required of females Western societies, or is it a combination of both? Should we conclude that pursuit of a cultural belief, such as belief that to be thin is good, is evidence of a mental disorder because it causes mortality and morbidity? How much is desire for a thin body normal and how much of same is abnormal, and who decides anyway? Are these cultural or biological conditions? The issue of dimensional and categorical systems of classification comes sharply into focus. The African is however clear! When food is available, one must eat to full!\r\n\r\nHistorically, African were believed to function as lobotomized Europeans (4), because of a smaller brain, and desire to free himself from French colonialist rule was evidence of a mental disorder, a fact taught French Universities 1960s (5). Few if any psychiatrists would now believe the as stated above, but 1950s and 1960s, these were facts as understood by well educated, well meaning men and women of science. It is therefore with this knowledge that we must approach subject of mental disorders with caution and humility, as we could, a generation or two, be viewed much as Carothers is now viewed by many.\r\n\r\nThat said, however, we must pick up courage of our conviction and do what man has done through years, which is to create order from chaos, which is, after all, whole purpose and function of a classification system. Our duty to posterity, therefore, is to use best available tools, to carry out ordering process and, even if we get it wrong eyes of next generation, we will be able to stand firm and tall knowledge that no system of classification will remain unchanged for all time. It therefore stands to reason that concept of what is and what is not a mental disorder is a dynamic one, which will change from time to time, from culture to culture and, as case of homosexuality, from generation to generation.",

      "abstract": "If we define irrationality as thought, emotidn, or behavior that leads to self-defeating consequences or that significantly interferes with the survival and happiness of the organism, we find that literally hundreds of major irrationalities exist in all societies and in virtually all humans in those societies. These irrationalities persist despite people's conscious determination to change; many of them oppose almost all the teachings of the individuals who follow them; they persist among highly intelligent, educated, and relatively undisturbed individuals; when people give them up, they usually replace them with other, sometimes just as extreme, irrationalities; people who strongly oppose them in principle nonetheless perpetuate them in practice; sharp insight into them or their origin hardly removes them; many of them appear to stem from autistic invention; they often seem to flow from deepseated and almost ineradicable tendencies toward human fallibility, overgeneralization, wishful thinking, gullibility, prejudice, and short-range hedonism; and they appear at least in part tied up with physiological, hereditary, and constitutional processes. Although we can as yet make no certain or unqualified claim for the biological basis of human irrationality, such a claim now has enough evidence behind it to merit serious consideration.

      "abstract": "Abstract Resilient adolescents are notable for their social competence, which enables them to form and maintain close relationships. The evidence is that adolescents' social competence is derived from their experience of close relationships within their family. On the basis of structured interviews, adolescents' working models of attachments can be categorized into secure, dismissive, or pre‐occupied. These attachment styles are associated with very divergent beliefs about the self and others, with differing patterns of emotion regulation and with differing risk profiles for maladjustment. Parenting styles and family relationships appear to have considerable influence on attachment behaviour. Further evidence for the importance of the family comes from research on ego development. Family level behavioural patterns have been discerned from family research interviews which are associated with stagnation or advancement in ego development during adolescence. Though the results suggest causal connections, the direction of effects is far from clear. Longitudinal research underpins the importance of childhood temperament as a contributing factor to the quality of the family environment that the child and then adolescent experiences.",

Conflict between a desire to connect and a wish to stand out can be particularly unacceptable in relation to other women, especially those who might be friends. In any analytic work, historical constructions and relational/intersubjective exploration can be both useful and also used defensively.

      "abstract": "Symptoms of domestic violence that occurs in marriage is due to the absence of equality or what is often called kafa&gt;’ah in the fiqh al-muna&gt;kah}ah between the prospective husband and wife. In this case the position of husband to wife is not equal, either in economic, social, education, culture, race/ethnicity, ancestry or religious level. Husband’s position which is not equivalent (as kufu&gt;’) with his wife or vice versa, often triggers dispute between the two. Ongoing dispute, then followed by hurting words, beatings or physical abuse, irresponsible behavior, don’t meet the economic or biological needs, marry again, and even can also lead to a sadistic action or killing. In this perspective the author considers that if the value embodied in the kafa&gt;‘ah concept is understood correctly and properly, it’ll actually give a positive chance to prevent domestic violence crime especially in the context of the relationship between husband and wife.[Gejala Kekerasan Dalam Rumah Tangga (KDRT) yang terjadi dalam perkawinan, salah satunya disebabkan tidak adanya kesetaraan atau yang sering disebut dalam fiqh al-munâkahah dengan istilah kafa&gt;’ah antara calon suami dengan calon istri.

Posisi suami yang tidak setara (se-kufu’) dengan istrinya ataupun sebaliknya, sering kali memicu perselisihan di antara keduanya.

      "title": "Childhood Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "Sexual abuse is defined as use of child or adolescent by the adults for satisfying of sexual urges and needs with forcing, threatening or tricking. Sexual abuse can be in the form of sexual abuse without touch, sexual touch, interfemoral intercourse, sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation. The prevalence of sexual abuse is reported as 10-40%. It is seen in female four times more than in males. Abusers are frequently male, only 5-15% of them are female. The abuse by females is usually towards male child. Thirty-fifty percent of abuse cases among child and adolescent are outside the family including strangers or familiar person. Some features of abusers are introvert personality, pedophilic and antisocial personality. Most of the abusers have a history of sexual abuse or aggression during childhood. Sexual intercourse between two people who are not allowed to marry by law is called as incest. Family pattern of incest is defined globally as disorganized and dysfunctional. The most commonly reported familial pattern is rigid and patriarchal family pattern with a harsh father using force quite frequently. The clinical features and impacts of the sexual abuse on the child varies according to the relation between abusers and the child, form of abuse, duration of abuse, presence of physical assault, developmental phase, child age and psychological development before the abuse. Sexual abuse history may result in psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, substance dependence, suicide act, borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder. Abuse negatively affects interpersonal relationships and self esteem of abused individuals. Several studies reported close association between risky sexual behaviors in adulthood and a history of of sexual abuse during childhood. Four traumatic dynamics including traumatic sexuality with abuse, feeling of betrayal, weakness, and stigmatization exist in childhood abuse. Trauma can cause behavioral and psychological results by itself, early trauma may also lead to biological effects. Especially traumas during neuron plasticity phase may lead hypersensitivity of neuroendocrine stress response. Early life stresses are shown to lead changes in corticotrophin releasing factor system in preclinical and clinical phase studies. In the treatment of sexual abuse, emotional process related with trauma should be focused on. This process may be conducted with play therapy. Development of higher level defense mechanism, increasing ego capacity, orientation to social activity and personal activity according to skills is aimed. For the elimination of guiltiness related with stigmatization, the child should be told that it is not herhis fault to incorporate into sexual interaction and the culprit is abuser. It is fairly important for medical staff, school and family to have sufficient information about sexual abuse for prevention and early recognition.",

In historical perspective, however, we are confronted with a radical desillusionment of trust that raises the question how the state can deserve our trust and how we are to avoid that mistrust reigns. The following considerations seek to make junctions plausible between the ontogenetic basis of trust on the one hand and the political precariousness of trust on the other hand.",

      "abstract": "Amorous passion is not a term that often goes with menopause; bringing them together may be intimidating. Once the capacity for reproduction is lost, and nothing stands in the way of death, menopause is more easily associated with old age. However, Freud insisted there was an increase in libido in menopause, which he compared to puberty. Deutsch supposed that there are also incestuous phantasies at this time, but that their object would be the now-adult son, or an equivalent. The struggle against such phantasies may be at the root of the rejection of all sexuality by some aging mothers; the mother-son bond is thus preserved by ignoring its erotic origins. The myth of Oedipus married to his mother Jocasta has very rarely been approached from the point of view of the mother as a woman. Whether she has an unconscious amorous passion for her son or can experience an amorous passion with a man her son’s age, it gives rise to a passion to ignore, which is very common. Did Freud himself have to struggle against this passion to ignore? On this point, Stefan Zweig’s Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman is an illuminating reading.",

A variety of influences—marital misinformation, counterproductive personal beliefs, romantic illusions, adverse events, attention to one’s alternatives, and the unanticipated costs of intimacy—only some of them avoidable, can all lead partners to expect more delight and fewer frustrations than they actually experience. Dangerous disillusionment can result, so the pursuit of relational realism is encouraged. Readers are advised to be reasonable and more realistic than romantic, and suggestions are provided.",

It is placed within the framework of science (Banks, H.N., 1989).  Those who believe in paranormal or psychical phenomenon are said to be paranormal believers. Their beliefs in paranormal activities are associated with their personality, spiritual belief and religious belief but this association is not significant as is reflected in the results of this study. There was a negative non-significant correlation between conscientiousness and agreeableness and paranormal belief. There was a positive non-significant correlation between openness, neuroticism, extraversion and spirituality and paranormal belief. Religiosity was significantly positively correlated with paranormal belief. Males and females also showed difference in paranormal belief. Gender difference was observed where females were found to be more religious and spiritual than males. Religiosity was significantly positively correlated with spirituality.",

      "title": "Normal feline behaviour: … and why problem behaviours develop",
      "abstract": "Practical relevance: Cats are descended from a solitary, territorial ancestor, and while domestication has reduced their inherited tendency to be antagonistic towards all animals larger than their typical prey, they still place more reliance on the security of their territory than on psychological attachments to people or other cats, the exact opposite to dogs. Many feline problem behaviours stem from perceived threats to this security, often due to conflicts with other cats. Others are more developmental in origin, often caused by inadequate exposure to crucial stimuli, especially people, during the socialisation period. Strongly aversive events experienced at any age can also contribute. A third category comprises normal behaviour that owners deem unacceptable, such as scratching of furniture. Evidence base: This review identifies three areas in which basic research is inadequate to support widely employed concepts and practices in feline behavioural medicine. First, classification of cats’ problem behaviours relies heavily on approaches derived from studies of their behavioural ecology and, to some extent, extrapolation from canine studies. Few studies have focused on cats in the home, the environment in which most behavioural disorders are expressed. Secondly, cats’ chemical senses (olfactory and vomeronasal) are far more sensitive than our own, making it difficult for owners or clinicians to fully comprehend the sensory information upon which they base their behaviour. Thirdly, although the concept of psychological distress is widely invoked as an intervening variable in behavioural disorders, there are still no reliable measures of distress for pet cats in the home. Global importance: Psychological distress of some kind is the primary cause of many of the behavioural problems presented to clinicians, but surveys indicate that many more cats display the same clinical signs without their owners ever seeking help. The welfare of this ‘invisible’ group could be improved by veterinarians taking a more proactive approach to educating their clients about the behavioural needs of pet cats.",

      "title": "Conceptual and Methodological Issues in Studying Alcohol's Harm to Others<sup>1</sup>",
      "abstract": "While there is a longer history of concern about alcohol's harm to others, researchers' interest has intensified in the last few years. The background of variation in concern over time in different societies is outlined. Three main traditions of research have emerged: population survey studies of such harm from the perspective of the ‘other’; analysis of register or case-record data which includes information on the involvement of another's drinking in the case; and qualitative studies of interactions and experiences involved in particular harms from others' drinking. In the course of the new spate of studies, many conceptual and methodological issues have arisen, some of which are considered in the paper. The diverse types of harms which have been studied are discussed. The social and personal nature of many of the harms means they do not ft easily into a disability or costing model, raising questions about how they might best be counted and aggregated. Harm from others' drinking is inherently interactional, and subject to varying definitions of what counts as harm. The attribution to drinking, in the usual situation of conditional causation, is also subject to variation, with moral politics potentially coming into play. For measurement and comparison, account needs to be taken of cultural and individual variations in perceptions and thresholds of what counts as a harm, and attribution to alcohol. The view from the windows of a population survey and of a response agency case register are often starkly different, and research is needed, as an input and spur to policy initiatives, on what influences this difference and whether and how the views might be reconciled.",

      "abstract": "Individuals, including researchers, often have to form beliefs about the political world from nonrepresentative samples—e.g., their friends, what they see on TV, or content on social media. Substantial evidence indicates that many struggle to account for this selection problem and generally form beliefs as if what they observe is representative. In this review, we provide a formal typology of how this phenomenon of selection neglect affects political beliefs. We identify three types of selection neglect: homophily leads individuals to believe others’ traits and beliefs are closer to their own; the squeaky wheel effect biases beliefs toward more visible or vocal groups; and the man bites dog effect leads to excessive belief in extreme or unusual events. Selection neglect is a unifying way to understand disparate literatures on perceptions of the economy and demographics, beliefs about others’ beliefs, partisan media, and social media. Much empirical research is consistent with biased beliefs driven by selection neglect but rarely directly tests this mechanism outside of lab settings. We discuss how future research can provide more direct evidence.",

The pathologic symptoms nearly always result from a combination of these four. The decisive causes of behavioral disturbance can, therefore, not be found in actual frustration but in unfavorable conditions of development in early childhood.",

Elements of risk are identified at individual and organizational levels and it is held that risk emanates from basically the same psychological or human factors.At organizational levels risk is taken to manifest as frictions or costs of transaction. At the individual level the commonplace phenomenon of substitution is proposed to mediate risk. The occurrence of substitution, i.e. acceptance without understanding or acceptance of what would normally not be accepted, may increase as well as reduce risk. The same holds for the non-occurrence or lack of substitution. The phenomenon is discussed regarding it´s relation to trust as well as to qualities of intercultural situations. It is argued that insofar as situations may be influenced or set, substitution may be favored or disfavored in order to reduce risks in intercultural contacts.",

      "title": "Child Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "The sexual abuse of children is not a new phenomenon, but the traumatic short- and long-term mental health consequences make it essential to study and, ultimately, prevent. The labels for child sexual abuse (CSA) vary and have changed over time, examples being “child sexual abuse,” “child sexual assault,” “child sexual exploitation” and “unwanted sexual experiences.” Each has slightly different meanings and implications. Researchers, practitioners, criminal justice personnel, and policymakers also differ on how to define other aspects of CSA (e.g., age of the child, age differential between child and offender, what acts constitute CSA [touch or penetration only, or non-touch such as exposure to pornography], and risk factors that may become targets of prevention strategies). Such definitional debates impact all aspects of studying the concept, such as examining prevalence, assessment, and clinical interventions. Whether the perpetrators are known to the child (true in the majority of cases) or are strangers affects the length of time that the child is victimized sexually and whether and how they disclose the abuse. The sexual abuse of boys, while a relatively small proportion of sexual victimizations, was not given the attention it warranted until relatively recently. Perpetrators are both males and females (an estimated 20 percent), but the type of CSA differs based on the sex of the offender. Special circumstances in which CSA occurs include the abuse of children in institutions and the CSA of children with disabilities. Disclosing CSA is difficult for many children and, rather than directly disclosing, many mention the abuse indirectly or much later on. Once disclosed, intervention typically consists of child protection services assessment and trauma-focused counseling. Child advocacy centers (CACs) have become the standard agencies to investigate and support CSA victims and non-offending family members. There are a number of ways to provide CSA prevention programs, such as media education, but the most common approach is educating children about the risks and teaching them strategies that may assist them in avoiding abusers or seeking assistance early on. The launch of the Internet has introduced new ways to sexually abuse children, with easier access to child pornography, abuse in real time, and trafficking children for commercial sexual exploitation.",

In general, and especially in children and adolescents, girls tend to be more indirectly victimized than boys. Indirect victimization has been linked to many short‐ and long‐term negative consequences. Both ontogenetic and phylogenetic theories of indirect victimization have been proposed.",

      "title": "Approach to the Patient: Transgender Youth: Endocrine Considerations",
      "abstract": "Compelling studies have demonstrated that \"gender identity\"--a person's inner sense of self as male, female, or occasionally a category other than male or female--is not simply a psychosocial construct, but likely reflects a complex interplay of biological, environmental, and cultural factors. An increasing number of preadolescents and adolescents, identifying as \"transgender\" (a transient or persistent identification with a gender different from their \"natal gender\"--ie, the gender that is assumed based on the physical sex characteristics present at birth), are seeking medical services to enable the development of physical characteristics consistent with their affirmed gender. Such services, including the use of agents to block endogenous puberty at Tanner stage 2 and subsequent use of cross-sex hormones, are based on longitudinal studies demonstrating that those individuals who were first identified as gender-dysphoric in early or middle childhood and who still meet the mental health criteria for being transgender at early puberty are likely to be transgender as adults. Furthermore, onset of puberty in transgender youth is often accompanied by increased \"gender dysphoria\"--clinically significant distress related to the incongruence between one's affirmed gender and one's \"assigned (or natal) gender.\" Studies have shown that such distress may be ameliorated by a \"gender-affirming\" model of care. Although endocrinologists are familiar with concerns surrounding gender identity in patients with disorders of sex development, many providers are unfamiliar with the approach to the evaluation and management of transgender youth without a disorder of sex development. The goals of this article are to review studies that shed light on the biological underpinnings of gender identity, the epidemiology and natural history of transgenderism, current clinical practice guidelines for transgender youth, and limitations and challenges to optimal care. Prospective cohort studies focused on long-term safety and efficacy are needed to optimize medical and mental health care for transgender youth.",

      "abstract": "People in violent neighbourhoods attribute violence in public spaces to, especially, poverty and unemployment, but agree that social disintegration, disrespect, drinking and drugs and the weaknesses of the criminal justice system also contribute substantially. However, data from a panel of young men in Cape Town provide little support for the hypothesis that unemployment and poverty are direct causes of violence against strangers. Growing up in a home where someone drank heavily or took drugs is, however, a strong predictor of violence against strangers in early adulthood. A history of drinking (or taking drugs) correlates with perpetration of violence, and might also serve as a mechanism through which conditions during childhood have indirect effects. Living in a bad neighbourhood and immediate poverty are associated with violence against strangers, but being unemployed is not. Overall, heavy drinking – whether by adults in the childhood home or by young men themselves – seems to be a more important predictor of violence than economic circumstances in childhood or the recent past. Heavy drinking seems to play an important part in explaining why some young men have been more violent than others in circumstances that seem to have been generally conducive to rising violence, for reasons that remain unclear. It seems likely that few young people in South Africa in the early 2000s come from backgrounds that strongly predispose them against the use of violence.",

The reasons are: (1) Economic Factors, (2) Mental or Psychological Factors, (3) Personal Factors and Experience, (4) Environmental Factors, (5) Medical Factors, and (6) Educational Factors. This research examines childfree from an Islamic perspective which aims to discuss the phenomenon of childfree which is being stirred up and reaping debate in society and is motivated by cases that are currently being discussed. This study uses a qualitative approach by using a literature review in collecting data. The sources used as references in this research are the Al-Qur'an, scientific journals, Hadith, and other sources. In Fiqh, childfree is a decision that is prohibited in Islam because the application of childfree is based on reasons that seem too mundane such as the economy, education, environment, and others. Whereas in Islam it has been explained that children have many advantages and blessings in this world and the afterlife. Even though no verse directly prohibits childfree, the choice for childfree-ness can be said to be a choice that cannot be justified or blamed because it is an individual right or a right that has been decided with the family which cannot be intervened by other people's views.",

Conflicts of interest can be real, perceived or potential and do not necessarily correspond toillegal situations, but are situations that may raise doubts about the integrity of researchers. In order to avoid the occurrence of situations calling into question scientific integrity, institutions must put in place a clear policy on respect for ethical principles and ensure that researchers conduct their research in a responsible manner. When faced with conflict of interest situations, the researcher must declare them to the ethics committee of his institution. Appropriate actions can then be proposed in order to mitigate any type of conflict of interest and to preserve scientific integrity.Keywords: conflict of interest ,ethics, scientific integrity ,policy,declaration of interest.",

While all or none of these factors may be involved, there is evidence that incidence of mental disorders in general, and schizophrenia in particular, may be at least partly a function of social status. This finding holds true, however, with some measures of social class but not with others. This paper suggests that the important factors here may not be social status per se, but frustration, which may be at least partially caused by a discrepancy between actual and desired group membership.",

      "title": "Reforming Juvenile Justice: A Developmental Approach",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a distinct, yet transient, period of development between childhood and adulthood characterized by increased experimentation and risk-taking, a tendency to discount long-term consequences, and heightened sensitivity to peers and other social influences. A key function of adolescence is developing an integrated sense of self, including individualization, separation from parents, and personal identity. Experimentation and novelty-seeking behavior, such as alcohol and drug use, unsafe sex, and reckless driving, are thought to serve a number of adaptive functions despite their risks. Research indicates that for most youth, the period of risky experimentation does not extend beyond adolescence, ceasing as identity becomes settled with maturity. Much adolescent involvement in criminal activity is part of the normal developmental process of identity formation and most adolescents will mature out of these tendencies. Evidence of significant changes in brain structure and function during adolescence strongly suggests that these cognitive tendencies characteristic of adolescents are associated with biological immaturity of the brain and with an imbalance among developing brain systems. This imbalance model implies dual systems: one involved in cognitive and behavioral control and one involved in socio-emotional processes. Accordingly adolescents lack mature capacity for self-regulations because the brain system that influences pleasure-seeking and emotional reactivity develops more rapidly than the brain system that supports self-control. This knowledge of adolescent development has underscored important differences between adults and adolescents with direct bearing on the design and operation of the justice system, raising doubts about the core assumptions driving the criminalization of juvenile justice policy in the late decades of the 20th century. It was in this context that the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) asked the National Research Council to convene a committee to conduct a study of juvenile justice reform. The goal of Reforming Juvenile Justice: A Developmental Approach was to review recent advances in behavioral and neuroscience research and draw out the implications of this knowledge for juvenile justice reform, to assess the new generation of reform activities occurring in the United States, and to assess the performance of OJJDP in carrying out its statutory mission as well as its potential role in supporting scientifically based reform efforts.",

      "abstract": "Public health concern regarding depression has recently increased as a result of the rise in the rate of adolescent suicide, with a probable concomitant rise in the rate of depression in this age group. The rise appears to be both a period effect, in that increased rates are now observed across age categories, and a cohort effect, in that being born after 1960 also contributes to the increase. The clinical phenomena and epidemiology of depression in adolescence are reviewed. Diagnostic criteria for depressive mood and depressive syndrome are similar to those in adults. However, the predictive value of a depressive episode in adolescence, and whether the occurrence of depression in adolescence is a transient developmental experience or whether it predicts a particular subtype of future depression, are at present unknown. The familial, social and personal risk factors for adolescent depression are reviewed, The major factors are: parental history of affective illness, childhood experience of parental loss, and female gender. Other factors, such as birth order and sibling factors, socio-economic status, race, religion, geography, concomitant medical illness, intelligence, career aspirations, substance abuse and life events, are reviewed, although their relative contributions as risk factors are less clear-cut. It is proposed that cross-sectional, retrospective and longitudinal studies are required to clarify important areas of uncertainty.",

Deliberate immersion of a child, in the family bathtub, is described as a further extension to the syndrome of non-accidental injury and neglect. Sub-fatal immersion leaves no specific signs of parental abuse, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of atypical immersion accidents. Evidence for it should be sought, as an alternative form of modus operandi, in children presenting with the more classical features of abuse.",

      "abstract": "Of the dozens or hundreds of problems which have been discovered listed classified and studied in parent-child relationships it may be that none is more crucial than the problem of talk between teen-agers and parents. In the voluminous literature of youth problems this one gets rather frequent mention. Evidence points to the fact that when parent-child relationships are out of adjustment when there is delinquency when there is severe and immature dependency or when there is open quarreling something is wrong in the lines of communication between the generations. All human relationships are fundamentally acts of communication. All human behavior is motivated by needs of the complex organism that is the person. No two people exist in the same social setting without some relationship activities. It is especially clear that a parent and child do behave so that fundamental needs are met. The activities or relating are for the most part overt pieces of business; they are visible and audible. Relationships are produced and maintained by signals no matter what motivates them. In infancy the child must develop his relationships through smiles random motions cooing sounds or varied squawks. By the time he reaches his teens he will have adopted the family language as his principal means of relating to other human beings. The problem of communication between teen-agers and parents is not crucial for teen-agers alone. When relationships are damaged oldsters are seriously hurt also. Whole households can be made miserable--if not whole communities. (excerpt)",

Whilst some youngsters misleadingly look as if they are 17 and sexually mature, others can almost literally be half their size and still be very much children in all respects. Physically mature 12-year-old girls may have to cope with confusing sexual feelings and experiences for which they privately feel emotionally unready, despite their apparent outward sophistication. Small 14-year-old boys who are late developers suffer agonies wondering if their bodies will ever change into those of men. The sense of being unable to control the body's physical destiny can bring enormous anxiety, frustration, anger, and distress, as acne takes a hold or breasts become too obvious a feature on a shy girl's body. This is the age of puberty, which can be protracted or rapid, during which young adolescents reach sexual maturity.",

If a person is incapable of consenting because they are temporarily non-autonomous – as in the case of an intoxicated adult or a pre-autonomous child – the infringement should be delayed until the individual becomes autonomous and can make their own decision. Given the seriousness of violating anyone's right to BI, and especially that of the most vulnerable persons, the appropriate likelihood-of-consent for proceeding with a BI infringement on a child is argued to be at or near the 'medically necessary' threshold. Depending on what the proposed BI infringement is, then, children will sometimes be able to consent – or withhold their consent – to a proposed alteration of their bodies in a way that is appropriate for their developmental stage.",

      "title": "Social and emotional development",
      "abstract": "There is widespread recognition that children with specific learning difficulties may experience social and emotional problems because of their learning difficulties, but it is often not realized that impairment of social skills may itself be a form of learning difficulty. This is due to a limitation in the way that the brain is able to understand social conventions. This is called a social cognition (or social learning) deficit. In this chapter, I shall first discuss social cognition deficit, and then discuss a number of behaviour problems that may occur as a result of a specific learning difficulty. Social skills, like any other skills, have to be learned. Yet much of what children learn about socially appropriate behaviour is not actually taught to them; they simply pick it up as they go along. Some children of normal intelligence seem to be less able to learn these things, even when taught. This may be their only area of difficulty, but it is commonly associated with other learning difficulties. These children have been accurately described as being ‘socially tone deaf’. They do not pick up the same cues as other children of the same age. They do not seem to predict the social consequences of their actions. They may be uninhibited, undressing in public without the same embarrassment that their peers would experience. They may be overfriendly to strangers. They may frequently say very tactless things without realizing the effect they are having. They often do not read facial expressions and are oblivious to whether someone is angry or upset with them. They may kiss classmates at an age where this is no longer appropriate. They may make unusual sounds in public. They may be insatiable in their activities, not knowing when to stop in the way another child of their age would. Although such behaviour may be apparent to all who meet the child, the people who are most likely to notice it are the child’s peers. With them, the child often sticks out like a sore thumb. This is something that may not be apparent if the child is only observed in a one-to-one relationship at a clinic.",

      "abstract": "Five cases of filicide committed by mothers are reported. Filicide remains an abnormality, primarily restricted to the female. Faulty relationships to either parent or extremely poor marital adjustment, or both, were present in each case. Four cases were combined with serious suicidal attempts, and a feeling of general inadequacy and inability to raise children was admitted by all mothers. All 5 appeared regretful of the act and state that they would never repeat it. The disparity between logic and affectivity was so strong in each case during commitment of the act that a diagnosis of schizophrenic break was justified in all 5. Motivations of punishment, revenge and secondary gain, as usually seen in ordinary murders were, to all appearances, completely absent. The primarily conceived suicidal attempts of the mothers rule these out almost logically. Thus, the suicidal attempts in no way represent an escape from the legal consequence of having done away with human life. A general feeling of unacceptance led to the suicide, and the \"total-all\"–including anything that belonged to the mother–had to abandon earthly existence, hence the combined filicide-suicide. Two cases involved 2 and 3 victims, respectively, the remainder one each. The mode of killing differed: two cases of shooting, one each of choking, poisoning and drowning. Ages of mothers ranged from 27 years to 47 years, of victims from 3 to 14 years.",

      "title": "Lessons Learned from Child Sexual Abuse Research: Prevalence, Outcomes, and Preventive Strategies",
      "abstract": "Until recently, there was much disagreement as to what should be included in the definition of CSA [1]. In some definitions, only contact abuse was included, such as penetration, fondling, kissing, and touching [2]. Noncontact sexual abuse, such as exhibitionism and voyeurism, were not always considered abusive. Nowadays, the field is evolving towards a more inclusive understanding of CSA that is broadly defined as any sexual activity perpetrated against a minor by threat, force, intimidation, or manipulation. The array of sexual activities thus includes fondling, inviting a child to touch or be touched sexually, intercourse, rape, incest, sodomy, exhibitionism, involving a child in prostitution or pornography, or online child luring by cyberpredators [3,4]. CSA experiences vary greatly over multiple dimensions including, but not limited to: duration, frequency, intrusiveness of acts perpetrated, and relationship with perpetrator. Although sexual activity between children has long been thought to be harmless, child on child CSA experiences, such as those involving siblings, is increasingly being recognized as detrimental for the emotional well-being of children as adult on child CSA [5-7]. While adult-to-child interactions in which the purpose is sexual gratification are considered abusive, sexual behaviours between children are less clear-cut as there is no universal definition of sexual abuse that differentiates it from normal sex play and exploration [8]. Although a 2to 5-year age difference between children was first suggested as necessary to consider sexual behaviours between siblings to be incest [9], this criterion is being questioned as studies have shown this age difference to be much lower in many substantiated cases of child-to-child abuse [10]. This formulation of CSA is in keeping with the recommendations from the 1999 World Health Organization Consultation on Child AbusePrevention, where CSA is defined as any activity of a sexual nature 'between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person'. That said, some definitional issues have not yet been resolved in the field. First, much disparity exists regarding age for sexual consent, or age for sexual maturity, which has an influence on the extent to which statutory sex offenses are considered CSA. Sexual activities that involve a person below a statutorily designated age fall under the large umbrella of CSA; however, the age of consent varies greatly across countries, from as young as 12 or 13 (e.g. Tonga, Spain) to 17 or 18 years of age (e.g. some states in the US, Australia). In virtually all European jurisdictions, sexual relations are legal from age 16 onwards, but some countries have set the age for sexual consent at 14 or 15 [11]. In other words, when no coercion or force is used, cases that involve sexual activities between an adult and, for example, a 14-year-old teenager, will be either perceived as a consensual sexual relationship or criminalized and defined as sexual abuse, depending on the legal statutorily designated age of the country where the event occurred. In Canada, a bill was recently adopted to change the age of consent from 14 to 16, a premiere in Canada's history, which emphasizes the impact governmental decisions can have on definitional issues of CSA in societies over time [12]. Second, although coerced sexual activities that occur in dating or romantic relationships is recognized as a form of sexual violence by the World Health Association (see for example a WHO multicountry study from Garcia-Moreno and colleagues [13]), the extent to which this form of interpersonal violence is socially recognized and acknowledged in different legislations around the world is unclear.",

Problemas para encontrar una pareja estable, problemas de afecto o problemas laborales. A nivel psicológico, los adolescentes se ven cada vez más sometidos a la discriminación, acoso, persecuciones. Sin embargo, se ha podido demostrar que, si se interviene de manera temprana y oportuna, observamos una mejoría en cuanto a los problemas emocionales y conductuales. Adicionalmente, encontraremos la importancia de la diferenciación sexual, comandada por el gen SRY y toda la cascada que desciende de allí. Encontramos entonces distintos síndromes desde el punto de vista genético asociados con disforia de género, por ejemplo, el síndrome de insensibilidad a los andrógenos y una deficiencia de alfa-5-reductasa que explicaremos en este artículo. El tratamiento se debe realizar siempre en compañía de un equipo multidisciplinario; en pacientes preadolescentes podemos encontrar tres enfoques: modelo terapéutico, espera atenta y modelo afirmativo, cuando tenemos el caso de pacientes adolescentes se puede iniciar desde la transición social temprana.",

      "title": "AYRIMCILIĞIN KAVRAMSAL ANALİZİ",
      "abstract": "“Discrimination” is a concept which has been discussed by different sides of the society throughout the history and which still keeps its importance and will do in future, as well. The word “discrimination” originates from the latin word “discriminare” which means “separate” or “divide”. The major thing which is emphasized in definitions concerning discrimination is the negative categorization of the individual or the groups in the society, the negative categorization of the individuals with the reasons which are not found reasonable and discourse and actions that are parallel to the reasons. The conceptual analysis means to indicate its compounds and indicators. The compounds of discrimination are “prejudice”, “dogma” and “benefit”. (i) Prejudice. Prejudice is described as “the negative approach”, which are usually known as unbased, discriminative and intolerant, towards a group of people or singular members of the group as a consequence of missing or mistaken judgment. Therefore, prejudice makes up the fundamentals of discrimination. Individuals may tend to adopt discrimination as spiritual concept without considering the prejudice that sometimes they are not aware to obtain or they are never aware. (ii) Dogma. On the other hand, the term “dogma” is described as the thought whose credibility is absolutely accepted without all kinds of examination and criticize. The dogmas that are based on believing without any examination are one of the major compounds of discrimination. Dogma may also result is not using the logic because it cancels the functioning of human mind and so it may make human beings more prone to acceptations. (ii) Benefit. Meanwhile, the term “benefit” is considered negatively in language and so it is not seen in the first common place in interaction of us and this case is often underlined. Because consideration of benefit is invariably evaluated as a negative factor in interactive relations of people. Individuals or group members may tend to make discriminations because they consider their own benefits and moreover they are aware or not aware of it. The major indicators of discrimination is “hate speech”, “applications of violence” and “favoritism”. (i) Hate speech. Hate speech is the violation of right to life. That’s why, we notice that “the hate speech” points to inequality and rejects the concerned individual or the group and insults some parts or groups in the society and feeds the prejudice. The speech of hate which is a major indicator of discrimination may result in the violence by leading to physically, performance of hate crimes which is mainly based on hate speech. (ii) Applications of violence. In descriptions concerning violence over an individual or the society, physical power, brutal force for bad purposes and the harm of people who are exposed to violence and any kind of morally and financially negative factors concerning the physical and spiritual well-being. One of the major reasons of the violence over an individual or a group is the discrimination. Violence which is also expression of the discrimination may result in irrevocable harm in individuals in terms of emotional and social points as well as being considered a “crime” in law. (iii) Favoritism. The term “favoritism” which also refers to “lookout” backing up refers to supporting someone without considering the law and social rules to give priority unjustly in a subject. Favoritism is also classified in four major groups known as “nepotism”, “kronizm”, “partisanship” and “gender discrimination”. For this reason, favoritism threats the individuals, organizations and the society by means of corruption. Therefore, favoritism with is negative effects and so it seems inevitable that favoritism should be prevented by means of legal measures due to its negative effects over individuals, organizations and the society. Despite the negative effects of favoritism over the individual(s), organization(s) and the society, it has almost become an everyday factor and this assumption has gradually enlarged in the society. One of the major indicators of discrimination is favoritism that the individual(s), right(s) are grasped and it is considered one of the most critical reasons for the social corruption. In this respect, favoritism should be regarded as a major concrete evidence discrimination, as well. In other words, favoritism is that discrimination for individual(s) turns out to be a physically visible factor as back-up or support.",

The distortions exhibited by the false uniqueness effect can reveal both positive and negative biases about the person making the estimates. For example, a man who is clinically depressed may not be aware that many other people experience grief and sadness throughout their lives, and thus may feel that his own suffering is more severe than the suffering of others. In contrast, some students with high grade averages may overestimate the extent to which their scholastic achievements qualify them for admission to a competitive university, because they are not aware of the many equally qualified applicants applying to the same institution.",

A convenience sample that included graduate and undergraduate students (N = 176; mean age = 37) completed a five-factor measure of personality as well as measures of spirituality, religiosity, shame, guilt, and sexual attitudes and experiences. Spirituality was negatively correlated with sexual permissiveness, and engaging in high risk sex. The moral emotion of shame increased when people had multiple sex partners within the past three months while those more spiritual or connected to God were less likely to have had sex after use of alcohol and/or drugs. Also, the more often someone attended religious services the less likely they were to have had multiple partners within the past three months. A sense of alienation from God predicted shame and guilt, but shame and guilt themselves did not predict sexual practices. These findings suggest that sexual attitudes and experiences are related to both spirituality and religious practices independently of personality, whereas they have no relationship to shame and guilt.",

According to concern to the children in the heteronormative society, I explore the role of lesbian mothers raising an adolescent child which goes to Primary School. Dealing with the case of study, I collect data on descriptive level. The findings demonstrate that lesbian relationship is not lasting short and due to that threatening for a child. Jealousy among partners makes relationship uncertain. Lesbian mothers are not raising a gay, child has no emotional difficulties, is enough self-esteem, no too gentle and too sensitive. A student is an ordinary teenage, self-initiative included in diversity of activities. At the sociometry pupil reaches medium sociometric status, his social preference is average and social influence high. A child is controversial and assertive. Furthermore, division of labour by gender is not known in this family. That is also reason for boy choosing typical female profession. Strategy of positionism is not means for mother's operating in school; teachers also consider it as unwanted. Experience with queer family in school sphere is important for non-structural and non-institutional violence. Homophobia is also not present. Teachers are not qualified for teaching about homosexuality, but they feel autonomous about it. Clearly written aim in the curriculum and a person who will protect teachers from hetenormative reaction of parents are not needed.",

      "abstract": "Objective: From a psychosexual point of view sexuality is the result of an integration of the biological and the erotical body. A complex integration that justify the complexity of human sexual life and his prowess to sexual malfunction. When sexuality is disturbed and no biological cause is found a specific psycho sexological and clinical methodology is required. Design and Method: Our approach is centered on a sexodynamic methodology and involves a careful investigation of the sexual objective behavior as well sexual fantasies and the imaginative world. We also compare the actual sexual behavior with the inner sexual erotic map. The sexual manifest reality is usually easily grasped from the individual and/or couple history. More cumbersome and tricky is the access to the inner emotional and reality. Through the investigation of sexual and dream fantasies as well as their potential development and a focus on gender identity, sexual attitude and relationship to the other and the other sex, the patient, in many cases, is able to better define the boundaries of his personal sexual likes and dislikes and to correlate them with his actual sexual behavior. In this way he can verify his willingness and possibility to go or not beyond his personal and sexual limits. Results: Our approach in very interesting and often allow us to cast a light where others approach seems to have more limitations. Conclusions: Our method allows to confront the problems difficult to investigate with other sexological approaches. In particular, allows the access to the intrapsychic mechanisms with profound impact on sexuality.",

Learning by doing should be an important part of relationship education. The two vignettes illustrate the importance of sexual intimacy and self-esteem in rehabilitation.

Satisfaction of the Self-Esteem need leads to feelings of self-confidence, but the thwarting of these desires produces feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, and a resulting lack of motivation. In the present state of the discipline, it is easier to concentrate upon the relationship between concrete behavioural performance and self-esteem than it is to struggle with the traditionally esoteric concepts of Love and Belonging.",

      "abstract": "Formation towards vocation necessitates continuity and discontinuity with one's former self. Some commentators understand the language of formation as potentially damaging given the implications of submission and \"unselfing\", though formation might also be understood as collaborative and agential. People with variant sex or gender may be particularly at risk in contexts which exhort self-emptying, given their already-threatened agency and physical and psychological integrity. However, failure to give adequate space to reflection on sex and gender identity during vocational discernment and theological education may be detrimental to all candidates for ministry, not just variant-sexed or variant-gendered ones. The concept of re-forming identity in relation to God and vocation is not necessarily psychologically sinister; however, questions of sexed, gendered and sexual identity require particularly sensitive handling in theological education institutions, since these facets of the self may be considered acutely vulnerable, especially in contexts where only some manifestations of them are deemed healthy (or even possible) in theological terms.",

      "title": "Predictors of depression for the male partner following miscarriage",
      "abstract": "Masters Research - Master of Clinical Psychology (MCIPsych)%%%%An abundance of research indicates that following miscarriage, both male and female partners can experience a grief reaction, similar in intensity to that which is felt following the loss of a loved one. There is less consideration of the possibility that miscarriage is a form of bereavement, with the potential to elicit complicated, long term grief that is associated with depression in both partners. This review evaluates the literature which indicates that expectant mothers and fathers become attached to the unborn foetus and argues that the strength of this emotional attachment may help explain why the loss of an unborn foetus can be so significant for the potential parents and can be included as an example of bereavement. Nevertheless, the literature on bereavement appears to have largely ignored miscarriage. Yet it is an experience of loss that shares risk factors, consistently associated with complicated grief reactions to bereavement including; being sudden and unexpected, involving the loss of a child (even if imagined) and a lack of social support. Despite this, the incidence of longer term psychological morbidity following miscarriage in either partner but particularly for males, has received scant attention. There is some evidence to suggest that a small group of males do experience depression and associated physical health problems. If this group of at risk males could be identified at an early stage, they may benefit from intervention and support. To that end, theories will be evaluated which suggest that moderating factors of this more complicated reaction in males may include; less active grief following miscarriage, higher levels of despair following miscarriage and a grief reaction that is incongruent with that of the female partner.",

Disasters are overwhelming events as they test the capability of the community and individuals to respond and can temporarily lead to massive disruption. The extensive and enduring effects of disasters are apparent on the psychological and physical health of survivors. Personality characteristics like gender, ethnicity and coping, variables connected to like injury and situation factors all are considered as threats for psychological problems after disasters. A disaster can be a frustrating and multifaceted task that proves difficult even for scholars. Natural disasters are often described as acts of God' a term that automatically eliminates human responsibility. The aftermath of natural includes an unambiguous physical impact, resulting in property damage, injury, and death of victims. These are catastrophic occurrences with the capacity to impose various kinds of hardship, e.g. loss of property and personal possessions, enduring hunger and physical discomfort, or injury to separation from family and close friends. Devastation of social support networks as well as loss of financial income is just a few examples of the long-term hardships many survivors have to experience. The present paper emphasized that individuals as well as societies can play a major role m the rehabilitation process and should be taken into account rather than just focusing on the impact of environmental factors on individual vulnerabilities.",

      "abstract": "RESUMEN La creación de un estoma intestinal representa mucho más que un procedimiento quirúrgico funcional; constituye una transformación profunda que involucra la identidad corporal, esfera emocional, sexualidad y vida social del paciente. El impacto emocional puede ser profundo, y muchas veces subestimado por los equipos de salud, afectando la calidad de vida y el proceso de recuperación del paciente. En muchos casos, los pacientes reportan sentimientos de despersonalización y pérdida del atractivo físico, lo cual afecta su autoestima y sus relaciones interpersonales. Los pacientes ostomizados presentan una prevalencia elevada de síntomas ansiosos y depresivos, especialmente cuando el estoma se percibe como permanente o si fue resultado de una cirugía de urgencia. El trastorno de adaptación es también común, caracterizado por dificultades emocionales persistentes para asumir los cambios en el estilo de vida, alimentación, sexualidad e higiene. Las preocupaciones sobre el atractivo físico, el miedo a fugas o el rechazo por parte de la pareja pueden conducir a una disminución del deseo sexual o incluso a evitar las relaciones íntimas. Así mismo, muchos pacientes reducen sus actividades sociales por miedo al estigma o a situaciones embarazosas en público. El estoma intestinal exige una respuesta clínica que trascienda lo técnico y abrace la dimensión humana del proceso, es fundamental trabajar en la reconstrucción de la identidad psicológica y corporal del paciente. Solo mediante un enfoque biopsicosocial, centrado en la persona, será posible favorecer una adaptación saludable, restaurar el bienestar subjetivo y promover una vida digna y plena más allá de la ostomía.

      "title": "Delinquency",
      "abstract": "Delinquency is a term that has different meanings and usages. Most commonly, a juvenile delinquent is defined as someone who has transgressed the law: 'a young person who has been prosecuted and found guilty of an offence that would be classified as a crime if committed by an adult' (Graham 1991). This definition has the virtue of precision. Its limitation however is that is does not take into account the full extent of behaviour or attitude. In psychodynamic terms, delinquency carries a much broader meaning: it relates to a more fundamental concern about responsibility and honesty, both in relation to oneself and to others. The essence of delinquency lies in its failure of duty to meet both the legal and moral requirements of the prevailing social order. The word itself draws its source from the Latin linquere – to leave, forsake or abandon. The delinquent is unable or unwilling to do that which is owed to the group, community or society. Delinquency is thus not an activity confined to a criminal minority, but refers to a tendency that is integral to the development of all social relationships.",

      "title": "Anticipatory grief: a theoretical challenge",
      "abstract": "The theories of loss and grief described by Freud and Bowlby have provided considerable interest in anticipatory grief. Anticipatory grief is assumed to be akin to post-death grief, but commencing prior to the loss of the loved one. 'Grief work' completed during the anticipatory period is purported to mitigate against abnormal grief reactions after death and enhance adjustment to loss. Research conducted to investigate the link between anticipatory grief and postbereavement adjustment has not, however, yielded conclusive findings. It is argued that the intellectual vision of researchers has been obscured by the traditional view of grief leading to conceptual confusion in the theoretical literature and equivocal findings of the empirical investigations. The limited view of the 'death event' as the only loss incurred fails to consider the past, present and future losses that may occur as a result of terminal disease. The physiological, psychological, interpersonal and sociocultural factors evident in the terminal situation serve to highlight the existence of many previously unconsidered variables which may determine the anticipatory grief experience. Until the influence of these determining variables is acknowledged and researchers learn to look beyond the parameters of the traditional models of grief, the costs and/or benefits of the anticipatory period will remain largely undefined. A good starting point may be the adoption of the alternative label, 'terminal response'.",

Although a definitive causal relationship between such difficulties and sexual abuse cannot be established using current retrospective research methodologies, the aggregate of consistent findings in this literature has led many to conclude that childhood sexual abuse is a major risk factor for a variety of problems. This article summarizes what is currently known about these potential impacts of child sexual abuse. The various problems and symptoms described in the literature on child sexual abuse are reviewed in a series of broad categories including posttraumatic stress, cognitive distortions, emotional pain, avoidance, an impaired sense of self, and interpersonal difficulties. Research has demonstrated that the extent to which a given individual manifests abuse-related distress is a function of an undetermined number of abuse-specific variables, as well as individual and environmental factors that existed prior to, or occurred subsequent to, the incidents of sexual abuse.",

This was an attempt to understand how personal environment or lifestyle of people puts them at risk of acquiring infection. It is not only the high-risk behaviour which put one at risk, even low-risk groups are getting infected. These relationships involve trust and love so a person naturally tends to go for unprotected behaviour believing that other person in the relationship is also loyal. Many people like to live in a world of denial and knowing their personal behaviour they will never get themselves tested. HIV/AIDS is usually considered to be a disease of others.

      "title": "Technologies of the Sacred, Part Three",
      "abstract": "Mainstream psychologists and psychiatrists attribute the specifically human aggression to frustration, abuse, and lack of love in infancy and childhood. However, explanations of this kind fall painfully short of accounting for extreme forms of individual violence, such as serial murders of the Boston Strangler or Geoffrey Dahmer type, and particularly mass societal phenomena like Nazism, Communism, bloody wars, revolutions, genocide, and concentration camps. Self-exploration using non-ordinary states of consciousness throws entirely new light on the problem of human violence. Probing the depth of our psyche, we discover that the roots of this problematic and dangerous aspect of human nature are much deeper and more formidable than traditional psychology ever imagined. There is no doubt that 'malignant aggression' is connected with traumas and frustrations in childhood and infancy. However, deep systematic inner work sooner or later reveals additional significant sources of human violence in the trauma of biological birth. The vital emergency, pain, and suffocation experienced for many hours during biological delivery generate enormous amounts of anxiety and murderous aggression that remain stored in the organism. We have seen earlier that this is reflected in the fact that the reliving of birth is typically associated with vivid experiential sequences depicting unimaginable cruelties. This typically involves scenes of wars, revolutions, racial riots, concentration camps, and genocide. Yet, the roots of violence can be traced even deeper, into the transpersonal domain. Here they take the form of evil archetypal principles, wrathful deities, and demons. I have given earlier in these writings several examples of these forces operating in the depth of our psyche. Additional potential repositories of aggression on the transpersonal levels are past life memories and phylogenetic matrices reflecting our animal past. As we have seen, the study of non-ordinary states of consciousness gives us a very shattering and discouraging image of human nature and of the scope and depth of aggression that our flesh is heir to. However, while it reveals the enormity of the problem, it also offers entirely new perspectives and hopes. It shows that there are unusually powerful and effective ways of dealing with human aggression. In deep experiential work that reaches the perinatal and transpersonal levels, enormous amounts of violent impulses and tendencies can be worked through and transformed in a relatively short time. This work also throws new light on the nature of aggression and its relation to the human psyche. According to the new insights, aggression is not something that reflects our true nature, but rather a screen that separates us from it. When we succeed in penetrating this dark veil of elemental instinctual forces, we discover that the innermost core of our being is divine rather than bestial. This revelation is in full agreement with the famous passage from the Indian Upanishads that I have quoted earlier. The message of these ancient scriptures is very clear: Tat Warn asp (Thou art That)--in your deepest nature you are identical with the Divine. In my experience, responsible work with non-ordinary states of consciousness has brought very encouraging practical results. Deep inner self-exploration leads regularly to a major reduction of aggression and self-destructive tendencies, as well as an increase of tolerance and compassion. It also tends to foster reverence for life, empathy for other species, and ecological sensitivity. This brings us to the third 'poison' of Tibetan Buddhism. This powerful force combines the qualities of lust, desire, and insatiable greed. Together with 'malignant aggression', these qualities are certainly responsible for some of the darkest chapters in human history. Western psychologists link various aspects of this force to the libidinal drives described by Sigmund Freud. …",

      "title": "The Breakup of Romantic Relationships: Situational Predictors of Perception of Recovery",
      "abstract": "People usually experience a great deal of emotional pain when a romantic relationship ends. It is not uncommon for people to refer to 'scars' when discussing a breakup, as if the experience was so painful, and the healing process so difficult, that it left a lasting mark just as a physical injury does. Of course, some breakups are more painful than others. Occasionally, breakup from a romantic relationship causes no lasting heartache, and recovery is reported to be relatively painless and easy. Many factors likely influence the extent to which people suffer after a breakup, and researchers have uncovered a number of them. Much of the research on recovering from a breakup has focused on recovery after a divorce. Wang and Amato (2000), for example, found that adjusting to divorce was associated with being the person who initiated the divorce, having a favorable attitude toward divorce beforehand, having a higher income, and dating a new person steadily or remarrying. Interestingly, stress (as measured by income decline, loss of friends, moving, etc.) did not make adjusting to divorce more difficult, except among people who were unemployed. Kitson (1982) found that lingering feelings of emotional attachment to the ex-spouse is another powerful cause of distress during and after divorce, with gender differences apparent at different stages. Women experience more distress during the initial separation, but men experience more distress from the divorce itself (Riessman & Gerstel, 1985). Women and men also have different coping styles when it comes to recovering. Women are more likely to discuss problems and emotions with close friends, while men tend to avoid such discussions and instead focus on beginning another relationship (Sorenson, Russell, Harkness, & Harvey, 1993). Other research has examined emotional recovery from romantic relationship breakups between people who were not married. A great deal of this research has focused on attachment style as a moderator of the impact of a breakup (e.g., Davis, Shaver, & Vernon, 2003; Feeney, & Noller, 1992; Pistole, 1995). Davis et al. (2003), for example, found that people with an anxious attachment style have the most difficulty dealing with a breakup, and people with a secure attachment style are more likely to seek social support to cope with loss. Sbarra (2006) examined factors that predicted how quickly people recovered from their sadness and anger after a breakup. Emotional recovery was defined as a point in time when the individual felt as good (for three successive days without relapse) as a comparison group of participants in an intact relationship. Results of the study revealed that sadness recovery was hindered by a preoccupied attachment style, difficulty in accepting that the relationship was over, a high level of love for the partner, and a high level of anger toward the partner. Anger recovery was hindered by a non-secure attachment style and feelings of sadness. Given the broad range of situational factors that could influence how rapidly a person recovers from a breakup, it is useful to begin to further identify which factors are most influential and whether they account for unique variance when multiple factors are considered simultaneously. Our focus was basic situational or behavioral factors that concerned the romantic relationship itself, rather than personality variables or general attitudes about relationships. As our interest is primarily in a person's self reported perception of recovery, we examined variables that may be related to positive or negative cognitions or behaviors concerning a breakup. Our choice of predictors was guided both by prior research that has provided evidence that a given variable is related to recovery from a breakup (including those related to recovery from divorce) or situational factors that co-occur with a breakup that have not yet been fully investigated but could reasonably be expected to have some influence. …",

      "title": "Is Ill-Being Gendered?",
      "abstract": "Ill-being arises from the multiple interactions involved in a specific tension, that between an individual with social characteristics and the values and norms promoted by the society that individual lives in. The way a person expresses ill-being tends to vary by gender: depression and suicidal behavior are more common among women, whereas suicide and alcohol dependence are more common among men. Focusing on a single way of expressing ill-being could therefore lead to misinterpretation of results. While divergences among ways of expressing ill-being expose the specificities of those ways and their differentiated effects for particular groups, convergences make it possible to arrive at conclusions that can be generalized to all individuals. Gender-specific indicators have been developed on the basis of recent data that capture major changes in the form of the couple and household types. These indicators can be used to examine whether and to what degree women are “protected” against ill-being by having an intimate partner and children. These elements are usually determined on the basis of suicide studies alone.",

It is found that there are certain social perceptions regarding the normative behavior of men and women in communication. Typically, men are attributed with aggressiveness, conflictiveness, independence, inclination towards domination, leadership qualities, while women are associated with passivity, tolerance, dependence, emotionality, and adaptability. The results of the study showed that women have a need for maintaining positive relationships with others, often employing control and authority, from a desire to control others to the need to be controlled. They prefer cooperation and interaction in relationships. The surveyed women often strive to be invited to participate in joint activities and desire communication. They believe that in conflictual or tense situations, it is necessary to maintain some emotional distance from other people.The surveyed men tend to exert control over others and assume dominant positions in interpersonal interactions. They also have a need for friendly and harmonious relationships with others, striving for cooperation and establishing contacts through inclusion and attention to others. They rarely display emotional expressions in the workplace, resorting to friendly communication. They see the importance of supporting relationships based on cooperation and interaction, reflecting the interests of others, inclusion, and a sense of belonging to the community. Additionally, they feel the need to feel important and significant to others. Men build harmonious relationships with others, using control, authority, and strength.Therefore, men focus on addressing current issues in interpersonal interaction through constructive resolution of tense situations, while women adhere more to norms, rules, standards, and roles. However, in interaction with men, women's behavior is characterized by greater flexibility.",

      "abstract": "Most people are self-reliant and have relationships that are mutually supportive. However some people get trapped in unique ways of relating to others that end up in conflict and suffering. You may have heard the word codependent if you know someone who has had a drug or alcohol problem. People who are codependent become absorbed in the problems of the person with an addiction and ignore a lot of their own needs, living instead mainly in reaction to the behaviours of the other person. However codependency-like behaviour is not restricted to people in relationships with someone with substance dependency. In fact, contrary to what some people say, codependency is not a disease and not a clinical term. Nevertheless it is helpful to think in terms of codependency to help people work through dysfunctional relationships and improve quality of life.",

ECC is a complex entity in which feeding practices alone does not play a prime role but is influenced by a myriad of cultural, behavioral, biological and microbiological factors.

It was noted that the child’s early consumption of alcohol led to the formation of severe chronic pathology and a decrease in general immunity, which led to early mortality. It is indicated that insufficient, both quantitatively and qualitatively, nutrition, which also suffered from poor quality, led to the birth of children with genetic anomalies, as well as the formation of severe pathology in growing children, as well as the prevalence of infectious pathology in them. It has been proven that early marriages, widespread in the Middle Ages, led to pathology, both in young mothers, and high mortality in children born to them. Key words: Middle age, child, disease.",

      "abstract": "Romantic relationships are an essential element of healthy living. Although difficulties in love are encountered often, it seems that three kinds of behaviors in a romantic relationship are more susceptible to physical or psychiatric disorders: playing (sexually transmitted disease), suffering (major depressive disorder or suicide), and stalking (violence or homicide). Oxytocin plays an important role in pair-bonding. Elevated plasma oxytocin concentrations have been observed in new lovers when compared with singles. It is hypothesized that those who display these dangerous behaviors in a romantic relationship might possess specific oxytocin receptor gene aberrancy and the resultant deviant pair-bonding pattern is likely to recur in successive relationships. It is postulated that a blunted oxytocin surge might be observed in playing, whereas exaggerated oxytocin surge might be observed in suffering and stalking. The distinction between suffering and stalking might stem from the difference in their aggression tendencies. Those who suffer displays aggression toward self, while those who stalk displays aggression toward others. The exaggerated oxytocin concentrations in people who suffer and people who stalk might not be suppressed by the discouraging attitudes of their partners and might be maintained by rumination. Considering the whole-body influence of oxytocin, intranasal oxytocin application or gene therapy should be used exclusively for those who display these dangerous behaviors and not for the general population. Future research is warranted to confirm this hypothesis with analysis of modifiers such as gender.",

Multiple psychological and behavioural symptoms of sexual violence have been described by various authors. These include excessive eroticisation of the child. Such abused children often display provocative and seductive sexual behaviour. Parents or guardians report depressed mood or anxiety in the child. Young victims of sexual offenses usually experience psychosexual problems and have low self-esteem, also in adulthood. Furthermore, masturbation inadequate for the stage of psychosexual development is another symptom, which was discussed in the historical context of sexual deviations involving children. There is full consensus in terms of sexology, sexual ethics and other sciences as well as strong social condemnation of sexual violence against children: the perpetrators are dangerous criminals, who sometimes try to justify their pathological sexual activity by describing it as ‘a harmless weakness of the elite which is rooted in antiquity’. However, this type of child abuse cannot be justified in any way.",

      "title": "ERECTION DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "The first physiological response to effective sexual stimulation, produced by a source of physical or mental stimulation, is the erection of the penis. Erection usually occurs within 3-8 seconds of the onset of arousal. When sexual tension and erection reach a certain level in the presence of the partner, the need for interference appears. The intensity of the erection may increase or decrease until it disappears, whether the arousal is prolonged or not. The complicated anatomical apparatus is regulated by a nervous mechanism, just as complex, being dependent to a remarkable extent on psychic influences. By the strong interweaving of these two components - psychological and functional - the sexual function is subject to changes. Erectile dysfunction, when it occurs, is obvious because, although there may be libido, the lack of an erection makes it impossible to perform sexual intercourse. Erectile dysfunction should not be confused with isolated or occasional failures to obtain or maintain a penile erection. They do not constitute a condition or disease that justifies medical attention and should be perceived as absolutely normal. The vast majority of men face such an episode at some point in their lives. One can speak of erectile dysfunction in the case of a recurrent or persistent inability to obtain an erection or to maintain it long enough to complete sexual intercourse, which lasts at least three months. It is especially important because in a normal activity, without erection, intercourse, ejaculation and orgasm cannot take place. (Pathologically, premature ejaculation can occur, without an erection, in the form of pollution!)",

But they also know that the young child who suffers inadequate nutrition, a severe infection, or physical trauma, is not thereby doomed, except in extreme cases, to a life of physical inadequacy. The human organism is resilient and in most instances capable of recouping the damage caused by malnutrition, infection, or trauma. The issue is the same for psychological development. It is desirable for the mother and the father to have immediate and active contact with their newborn baby. But absence of such contact does not prevent parent bonding to the infant nor does it doom the infant to less than optimal development. A relaxed and emotionally positive attachment between the 1-year-old infant and the mother is indeed valuable. But the mother does not need extraordinary capacities for this to occur. And if, for some reason, either the mother's bonding to the infant or the infant's attachment to the mother is impaired, this does not foretell failure in later emotional relationships. The establishment of reasonable feeding and sleep routines and ease in toilet training are assets for healthy development. But difficulties with these or other socialization landmarks do not necessarily predict psychological outcomes.

The authors of the article emphasize that despite the constant interest in the problem, the phenomenon of happiness today is still not sufficiently studied, there is no clear common definition. Happiness is difficult to rigorous, accurate analysis and psychodiagnostic measurement. Positions of understanding happiness are singled out: as a motive and purpose of life and as a result of human activity. It is noted that a person's desire for happiness is correlated with the idea of self-sufficiency, realization and creativity. The traps that can occur on the path to well-being and happiness are analyzed, as well as the important factors with which happiness correlates and does not correlate. The determinants and a wide range of factors of happiness are determined, which are determined by both the objective circumstances of human life and the uniqueness of the individual. It is objective (health, income, work, social status, leisure, education, age, gender, religion, etc.) and subjective (neuroticism, extraversion, humor, joy, love) factors to varying degrees. your contribution to the overall level of happiness. Also important are the principles of happiness, namely: optimism, love, the ability to forgive, self-development, etc., which simplify the path to a happy life. Happiness is associated with a sense of fullness of life, joy and satisfaction with life, which underlie the optimal, healthy and effective functioning of the individual, as an integral result based on the recognition of the priority of both public and personal interests. Based on integrated models and formulas of happiness, the authors built their own component model of happiness and well-being, which is determined by the variables of physiological, cognitive, affective (emotional), social and personal levels of the individual. A thorough analysis of the psychological phenomenon of happiness as a psychological formation, characterized by satisfaction and awareness of human life, the dominance of a positive emotional state and based on the integration of components of a happy life.

      "abstract": "Thinking about usually brings by feelings of fear and restlessness. Notwithstanding age, gender or profession, the end of life is rather connected to anxiety than to peacefulness. Still, as they get old, people tend to preoccupy more about when and how their life journey would end up. Aging causes varying levels of fear, anxiety, and apprehension each person. Biosocial, cognitive, and psychosocial changes as one ages cause people to realize their own mortality. Attitudes of aging and go together, because as people get older they are concerned with their own mortality (Benton, 2007 Suslick, 2013).Due to the continuous development of technology and life maintaining capabilities within health care systems and also due to improving overall living conditions, life expectancy has increased worldwide. Still, sooner or later does occur and postponing the inevitable cannot help individuals from facing the above mentioned feelings of anxiety while being terminally ill or suffering from incurable diseases. Even if you push a little further away you still get to it one way or another.The dilemmas regarding the end of life are neither of recent date nor are they soon to be vanished away. However, the entire progress aimed at bettering humans' life quality determined the re-emergence of an otherwise ancient paradigm regarding death. The consequence is that the end of life is more often considered a matter of how than a matter of when. Once they succeeded to be more and more control of their own lives, people's concern regarding the final act of their living gained importance also. Still, this approach is by no means recent as people are said to have been interested the topic for thousands of years. As a proof for the ancientness of the preoccupation regarding ones' stands euthanasia, a word considered to be coming from the ancient Greece where the procedure itself was widely practiced cases of incurable diseases (Otlowski, 2000, p.1).For the ancient Greek, was similar to a good/ easy and the values imbued within the construction pointed to the person's dying a dignified manner by dealing away with pain and feelings of helplessness.According to the online edition of the English Oxford Dictionary, the term euthanasia was introduced the basic vocabulary around the 17th century as referring to the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or an irreversible coma. Even if at a first sight the dignifying feature of a non-painful seems to have been left out of the recent definitions of euthanasia, it has been largely invoked by the public opinion especially given the prolongation of life on the one hand and the fact that various illnesses as Alzheimer or AIDS remained incurable on the other hand.Voluntary was not immediately embraced by society as a whole. In fact, was considered a taboo subject for a long time. The Catholic Church has been strongly opposing the concept (Otlowski, 2000, p.2) especially by frequently invoking the Fifth Commandment underling the sacredness of life. Still, secularization has diminished the influence of the Church. Moreover, the media made common knowledge out of the topic by introducing the issue of death on the public agenda. As a matter of consequence, in May 1995, ground breaking legislation was enacted the Northern Territory of Australia with the passage of the rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 which legalizes medical assistance dying certain circumstances (idem).At the moment this paper was written, human and/or physicianassisted suicide had been legalized a few European countries as Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Estonia or Albania and also some parts of the United States of America as Washington or Oregon (http://euthanasia.procon.org). As expected, the procedure is facing greater opposition from people and authorities more traditional countries where individualism and self-determination are not of primary importance. …",

      "abstract": "In the early stages of romantic relationships, sexual desire is often intense, but over time, as partners get to know each other, desire tends to decline. Low sexual desire has negative implications for relationship satisfaction and maintenance. Self-expansion theory suggests that engaging in novel activities with a long-term romantic partner can reignite feelings of passion from the early stages of a relationship. Across 3 studies using dyadic, daily experience, longitudinal, and experimental methods, we find evidence for our central prediction that engaging in self-expanding activities with a partner is associated with higher sexual desire. In turn, we found that higher desire fueled by self-expansion is associated with greater relationship satisfaction. Self-expansion, through sexual desire, is also associated with an increased likelihood that couples will engage in sex, and when they do engage in sex, they feel more satisfied with their sexual experiences. We also demonstrate that the benefits of self-expansion for relationship satisfaction are sustained over time, and that the effects cannot be attributed solely to increases in positive affect, time spent interacting with the partner or closeness during the activity. Implications for self-expansion theory and sexual desire maintenance in relationships are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "Friendship, a key element of social networks, has been under-studied in the social sciences. Chronic conditions can disrupt many aspects of life including identity, anticipated life trajectories and social relationships. Friendship relationships are important sources of support for chronic condition management. However, for individuals with chronic conditions, developing and maintaining close friendships may be particularly difficult. Despite significant scholarship on chronic health conditions, we know less about the ways in which chronic conditions impact the maintenance of long-standing friendships or the cultivation of new ones. Drawing on sociological theories of friendship and chronic conditions, we aim to advance knowledge of how people who live with chronic conditions navigate friendship. Data were drawn from a qualitative study with 40 people with a chronic condition and who also reported experiences of loneliness. Findings from interviews highlight the significant personal labour and performative identity work required to maintain connectedness within friendships. Normative expectations about able-bodiedness may hinder the continuation of friendships by limiting opportunities for social participation for those living with chronic conditions. Participants discussed both the emotional and physical 'work' necessary to maintain even tenuous social connections, hampering one's ability to cultivate emergent friendships. This work included having to trade authenticity for other desirable social gains, such as a desire for social inclusion. This research offers a nuanced exploration of how friendships are created, nurtured, maintained and dissolved and the role they play in the life trajectories of those living with chronic conditions.",

      "title": "Criminology: The Police Perspectives",
      "abstract": "The basic facts and trends of the current situation with regard to juvenile crimes and delinquency shows an observed increase in violent and aggravated crimes among youth all over the world. The number of drug-related offences is growing. The process of globalization and the increasing mobility of large population groups have somehow led to an increase in criminal tendencies among the people and further traits associated with intolerance towards members of other cultures acts as contributing factors in the increasing incidence of juvenile delinquency. The problems encountered by immigrants and their descendents in certain countries are sometimes related to the high levels of group crime deriving from the activities of ethnically based delinquent groups. In many cases juvenile crimes are linked to less obvious sources of motivation; various actions may reflect, for example, the standards of particular subcultures, teachings or traditions deriving from religious radicalism, or the compulsion to use of violence as a means of constructing gender identity. Aggressive and atimes violent behavior is positively portrayed in the media (including some cartoons, films & games), creating a confused picture of acceptable societal norms in concern with such behaviors. Children and adolescents in difficulty may out of such compulsions resort to organized crime, participation in armed conflicts, human and drug trafficking, and sexual exploitation. Other unfortunate events’ including disintegration of families, poverty, and the death of parents by the reason of say, armed conflict or from HIV/AIDS has led to the forced movement of many young people around the world from the safe hands of the good institutions of the society to the darker world of crime. We cannot rule out that there must be many socially responsible adults who would have committed various types of petty offences during their adolescence. Unfortunately often, the situation is far more serious. Poverty, social exclusion and unemployment often cause marginalized and young people chances for developing and maintaining delinquent behavior. Delinquency is largely a group phenomenon; it is frequently engaged in by certain subcultures of young people who have jointly assumed a particular identity. It is also primarily a male phenomenon, with crime rates for male juvenile and young adult offenders more than those for females. Some criminal activities are associated with intolerance of members of other cultures or religious, racial or ethnic groups. If delinquency policies are to be truly effective, higher priority must be given to marginalized, vulnerable and disadvantaged young people in society, and issues relating to youth in conflict with the law should be a central focus of national youth policies. The administration of juvenile justice should be decentralized in order to encourage local authorities to become actively involved in preventing youth crime and reintegrating young offenders into society through support projects, with the ultimate aim of fostering responsible citizenship.",

      "title": "Fears and Phobias",
      "abstract": "Definitions Fears and phobias represent a major segment of the psychological distress experienced by children while growing up. It is important to distinguish between the two. Fears are a normal part of life and usually are most vivid and ubiquitous during childhood. Fear is the emotional and physiologic response to an external danger. At their best, fears help keep one safe. The fear of being burned, being accosted by strangers, disappointing parents by doing poorly on an examination, or ending up in jail all can lead to a more healthy and productive life. One could speculate that heights and snakes are among the most common fears among adults because those ancestors who avoided snakes and high places were most likely to live long enough to ensconce these tendencies in the gene pool. The differential diagnosis of fears and phobias is easier during adulthood than it is during childhood. This is because the child9s physical and cognitive immaturity can confound reality testing on developmental and psychopathologic bases. The toddler who is so small, helpless, and unable to understand the forces of physical and human nature accurately often has many normal fears. These typically may include strangers, their parents9 leaving, monsters, the dark, or going to sleep.",

Se entiende como estigma una caracteristica que por lo general implica una connotacion negativa. Este rasgo caracteristico puede ser la apariencia fisica, una caracteristica emocional o de personalidad o un patron etnico-racial. Habitualmente, estos rasgos se consideran una amenaza o generan perturbacion en el contexto social o en los patrones de valores aceptados como dignos de ser reproducidos o preservados (1). El prejuicio proviene de una construccion colectiva en la que se acepta la caracteristica senalada como indeseable o poco valiosa y, simultaneamente, se considera que todas las personas con el rasgo senalado como negativo representan un conjunto homogeneo, es decir, que las personas incluidas en esa categoria son iguales (2). Finalmente, la discriminacion aparece en el momento en que se institucionaliza la exclusion o la marginacion de las personas que llevan el estigma y sobre quienes persiste un prejuicio. La discriminacion en si misma implica una negacion de los derechos de las personas (1,2).",

      "abstract": "Infidelity has been and remains one of the main reasons for crises in couples due to the repercussions it has on the relationship. It is regarded as one of the most frequent reasons for visits to clinical practices and the main cause of divorce worldwide. Partners in a couple capable of keeping their sexual intimacy and protecting themselves from invasions by third persons not only keep their obvious conventional boundaries but also reaffirm their \"couplehood\" in their struggle against rivals. The conduct of the offended partner is supported by the social system, which tends to protect them. Hatred in larger or smaller degrees and fantasies of revenge may appear as a kind of law of retaliation which demands \"justice\" and punishment for the unfaithful partner. The unconscious gratification of the fantasy of the excluded third person represents an oedipal triumph and simultaneously a subtle oedipal rebellion.",

      "title": "Dental Implications of Thumb-Sucking",
      "abstract": "Controversy continues to exist over the problem of thumb-sucking, not only as to its cause and implications, but as to the best method and time of treatment. Pediatricians to whom concerned parents bring their children with this problem may find it difficult to decide what are the implications and just what he should advise the parents from both the medical and dental point of view. HABIT AND PSYCHOLOGIC DISTURBANCE Although originally considered to be a symptom of deeper psychologic import, the idea that undesirable sequelae will result from punitive restrictions on thumb-sucking derives from Freudian concepts of psychopathology. However, this theory has not been supported by recent research, and nonnutritive sucking is now considered to be simply learned behavior.1-3 There is no evidence to substantiate the theory that prolonged sucking habits result from emotional disturbances.4 No relationship has been found between prolonged sucking habits and the child's place in line of siblings.5 The habit is to be expected to occur in a large percentage of infants but can only be considered pathological, associated as it is with deformity of teeth and related structures, when prolonged beyond infancy. INCIDENCE Age is a very important determinant in assessing the incidence of the habit. Thumb-sucking, including various types of finger sucking, is frequent in infants. Traisman and Traisman2 found that 45.6% of American children under the age of 4 years thumb-sucked with no significant differences between the sexes. Baalack and Frisk6 in a retrospective study of Swedish children found that 30.7% had been, or still were, thumb-sucking at the time of the study.",

      "title": "Consumer perceptions of family planning.",
      "abstract": "The ways in which methods of contraception are chosen in Britain are considered in light of the attitudes and perceptions of consumers. Methods are largely chosen according to how people feel about themselves sexually. Sexual adequacy and sexual identity are intimately bound up with self-esteem and self-worth. For example using contraception particularly a diaphragm cap or condom requires an affirmation of sexuality before every sexual act. Using the pill requires daily acknowledgement of sexual intentions. Consumers judge a method for its effectiveness how it is used and how it works. Information on consumer preference is still scarce on use of methods tolerable degree of inconvenience what can be accepted or ignored and how or if alternatives are perceived or compared. Views of men on contraception are also not well known--largely because until recently only a few people bothered to ask them. Their inclusion is important. Communication skills of service providers are crucial. Doctors or nurses with ambivalent feelings towards sex or contraception may adversely affect a very sensitive matter. Hostility and judgemental moralistic attitudes by doctors may cause aversion to particular methods. Some doctors limit the range of options; some do not fully explain side effects risks and how to use the methods. Many make assumptions about clients and may censor or limit the information given. Women generally prefer a family planning service to a general practitioner partly because of the greater chance of seeing a female doctor expertise greater choice of method and male partners being more welcome. When women do prefer a general practitioner reasons include more personal care and a familiar setting. Although media is viewed positively for its contributions to motivational and health promotional messages it regularly distorts or misinterprets information necessitating further efforts on the part of health educators.",

      "title": "Suicide is not exclusively a medical problem",
      "abstract": "Background: In the West, beginning in the early 19th Century, the belief was published that suicide was always, or almost always, the result of a mental disorder (a medical problem). This belief became established wisdom when psychological autopsies commenced in mid-20th Century. Should this belief be inaccurate, our response to suicide (medical treatment) will need to be reconsidered. Aim: To argue the case that metal disorder is not always, or almost always, the cause of suicide, and that suicide may occur in the absence of mental disorder. Method: The opinion of non-medical experts were explored, including philosophers, historians, sociologists, economists and ethicists, among others. The scientific basis of psychological autopsies was explored. Epidemiology of rates in different countries and gender differences were explored. Conclusion: Suicide is not exclusively a medical problem. While suicide is more common in people who have a mental disorder than people without a mental disorder, mental disorder is not a necessary condition. Suicide occurs in the absence of mental disorders. Thus, open discussions about the nature and causes of suicide are required, with a view to involving experts from a range of fields, and the general community, in dealing with the issue.",

      "title": "Half Sibling Relationships and Family Communication",
      "abstract": "Half siblings are brothers and sisters who share only one biological parent and are thus, half biologically related. Although half siblings may be the result of extramarital/partnership affairs or post-bereavement, most are the result of a divorce and remarriage. Half sibling research is rare, and existing research and even national and international statistical reporting agencies often incorrectly conflate half siblings with stepsiblings. Research that can be found on half siblings often illustrates a “deficit-comparison” approach where half and stepsiblings are compared to full biological siblings and studied for how they fall short of biological sibling outcomes. Early research speculates that children who reside with half siblings experience poorer educational outcomes, report significantly more depressive symptoms, exhibit poorer coping skills, are more likely to engage in risky behavior such as early sexual activity and drug and alcohol use, and have more strained sibling and parental relationships compared to those with no half siblings or those with only full biological siblings. The challenges that exist for half sibling relationships are often hypothesized as associated with either family structure (half siblings located within a complex stepfamily) or explained through evolutionary perspectives of Darwinian fitness. However, research on half siblings overall is mixed, with studies also positing these outcomes are not due to the presence of half siblings and that there are instead positive implications from having a half sibling on individual outcomes, sibling relationship quality, and overall family functioning. Overall, half siblings can form quality relationships and half brothers and sisters who share a residence, are closer in age, of the same gender, spend more quality time with one another, have parents who prosaically intervene on their behalf, and who emphasize their positive relationship and connection through addressing terms and sharing backstories of their family’s origins are more likely to report a positive relationship.",

      "title": "Privacy, Shame and the Anxieties of Identity",
      "abstract": "Many privacy advocates, and scholars, seek to liberate privacy from shame. We need to understand that privacy norms do more than insulate individuals from the exposure of shameful secrets and intimate information, the argument goes, in order to deal with contemporary privacy issues that concern the collection of information that is often not sensitive or intimate and may even be publicly available. This essay argues that privacy does not need to be liberated from shame — to the contrary, it is shame that can liberate privacy. A proper understanding of shame reveals that it involves a complex form of self-consciousness — how you feel about how others view you; it is triggered by a disjunct between how you would like others to see you and the consciousness that they do not see you in this way. Privacy norms can insulate us from shame because they protect our self-presentation from the disruptions that can cause us to feel shame. Accounts of privacy go wrong when they do not understand this idea of identity that is at stake in privacy norms. By relying upon different ideas of identity, such as self-revelation or self-determination, both control-based and limited-access accounts of privacy misunderstand the social dimensions of identity and end up with an impoverished account of privacy norms. By ignoring the centrality of identity, “contextual” accounts of privacy lose analytic rigour by running together a broad set of interests and norms under the category of “privacy.” A focus on the constitutive relation between privacy and identity can also show why the idea that privacy should be protected through legal rights is misplaced. Justifications for legal rights rely upon ideas of autonomy and harm but privacy’s focus on the conditions of self-presentation sound in an altogether different register. This essay argues that legal rights such as the tort of invasion of privacy lie, at best, on the periphery of the legal protection of privacy and that the emerging international standards of Fair Information Practices provide a better framework. The best way to understand this framework is not through the language of rights but through a set of alternative ideas about the role of law in enabling and empowering individuals to act within a context of settled expectations necessary for the production of identity and agency. The role of privacy law is not simply to protect identity but in fact to help produce it.",

Uncertainty remains regarding the neurobiological basis of gender identification, but it appears that prenatal intrauterine hormonal exposure in the second half of pregnancy interacts with multiple genes to influence brain development in ways that impact gender identification. Social cognitive theorists suggest that children learn basic gender categorizations due to social influences and observation that serve as the precursors of early gender identification. Gender identities are complex and varied, but worldwide, socially constructed gender binarism limits gender identity expression and contributes to norms supportive of stigmatization, harassment, discrimination, marginalization, and violence towards those with non‐conforming gender identities and expressions. Activists work to broaden notions of gender identity, depathologize non‐traditional gender identities, and gain legal and human rights protections for gender non‐conforming people.",

Objections to the “illness concept” may impede our vision and the range of services we develop. It is possible to agree with objectors to the illness concept that a unidimensional view is unhelpful; that explanations are often only attributions; that the construct “illness” is not needed for help to be offered, its use could undermine self‐mastery, and its misuse can breach civil fights. Learning can explain much over‐drinking. However, the concept need not imply bimodality of drinkers; the syndrome of alcohol dependence has uses and does not imply a cause; physical and mental explanations are not incompatible; genetic and biochemical research has promise. Developments in treatment are still limited, but the mysteries of the free‐will dilemma should not prevent us seeing physiological, psychological and social contributants of partners rather than rivals.",

Reactions are operationalized in terms of expressed rejection of the homosexual as indicated by responses to a social distance scale. The major variables examined are sex of homosexual, sex of reactor, and acceptance of two commonly held stereotypes. These stereotypes—perceived danger and psychological disturbance—both suggest that a sense of threat is associated with rejection of the homosexual. A particularly interesting finding was that male subjects are especially rejecting of male homosexuals. Presumably male subjects tend to view the male homosexual as a sexual failure and to perceive him as personally threatening or dangerous.",

It appears that what men “feel” is likely to be kept in for longer while women act upon their symptoms more readily as the symptoms arise. Purpose: To present the current research findings on depression and gender, with a focus on the factors that account for gender differences in rates of depression among women and men, and emphasis on the relationship between the male gender role and men’s experience of depression and coping with the symptoms. Method and Material: A critical review of this body of literature was carried out. Evidence was collected through Medline database. Results: Although depression is often traditionally thought of as a woman’s illness, there is growing evidence to suggest that men may not be adequately counted in studies examining rates of depression, that men are equally vulnerable to depression, and that depression in men is a serious and, if untreated, potentially fatal condition. This phenomenon is better supported by several explanations, namely, the gender bias explanation, and the gender role socialisation explanation. Conclusions: Depression predicted as the second leading cause of global disability burden by 2020 may well be underestimated if the direct and indirect effects of depression in men are not taken into account. Understanding depression in both men and women and help-seeking behaviours across genders is important because there are implications of the findings in the context of primary care in order to detect and cope with depressive symptoms in men.",

      "title": "Painful Side of Flirting: Role of Parents’ Education Level on Flirting Violence",
      "abstract": "Love is one of important needs that human beings meet to continue their lives. The reason is that people establish relationships with others to meet this need, and among these relationships, the love-based one is called flirting. The quality of these relationships determines whether this love will continue in future or not. Also, violence to be experienced in flirting is important to maintain the relationship. People are likely to be influenced by the structure of the society they belong to. In this respect, the family is a social unit, and it is important to remember that an individual shapes himself or herself within the family. An individual’s violent attitudes are shaped within the family as well, and this is also the case for flirting violence. The violence that individuals were exposed to in the past is likely to be a sign of future probable violence. Therefore, individuals may reflect that violence upon his or her partner in the period of flirting. In line with the suggestions put forward in the researcher’s previous studies on students’ thoughts about flirting violence, it was considered to be necessary to investigate parents’ education, which is thought to be likely to increase flirting violence. In this respect, the present study was carried out with 250 students taking the courses of psychology, developmental psychology, health communication, and communication within the family, which the researcher gave in associate degree, undergraduate and postgraduate programs at Anadolu University in the academic year of 2016-2017. The questions used in the study were distributed to the students in class, and they were asked to respond to the questions on voluntary basis. In the study, of all the students, 178 of them responded to the questions. In relation to the factors influential on the participants’ views about the flirting process and about flirting violence, the relationship between their views and their parents’ levels of education was examined. The questionnaire data were analyzed with Chi-Square test using the package software of SPSS. The results revealed that within the socio-cultural structure, the mother’s education level was not significantly influential on flirtingviolence while the father’s education level significantly triggered flirting violence.",

      "title": "Power and Autistic Traits",
      "abstract": "Autistic traits can help people gain and sustain power, and has probably done so throughout history, says the present paper. A number of testable claims follow from this assumption. First, the powerful should have more autistic traits than others - which they do appear to have. Among other things, powerful people, and those with many autistic traits, tend to prefer solitary activities and are often aloof. Moreover, they are often rigid and socially insensitive, low on empathy and with low scores on the trait of agreeableness - and as a rule they do not have many friends. Both groups are also more self-centered than others, more honest, less submissive, more sensitive to slights, and with a stronger tendency to engage in abstract thinking. They tend to behave in bossy or dominant ways, and their moral judgment is more based on rules than on feelings. In addition to experimental evidence, I cite biographies showing that a surprising number of presidents, prime ministers and other powerful people seem to have had traits like those in question - and interestingly, in animals, leaders are often rigid and insensitive to group members' needs and feelings, mostly acting the way they are themselves inclined to, not responding much to others. Problem solving is important in leadership, and people with many autistic traits appear often to be better thinkers than typical subjects with similar IQs. However, these and other congruities could be coincidences. Hence the question of whether traits the two groups have in common also have a common cause constitutes a strong test of the paper's thesis - and a common cause does appear to exist, in the form of testosterone's effects on the central nervous system. Finally, there is evidence that, other things equal, powerful men have more reproductive success than others. If men wielding power do indeed have more autistic traits than those less powerful, this will lead to, other things equal, such traits becoming more common - which can help explain the prevalence of autistic traits.",

      "title": "Death Anxiety",
      "abstract": "Abstract One of the few certainties in life is that once you are born, you are bound to die. This certainty does not make death a welcome thought, however. Thus, the most common response to the thought of one's death, or the death of other loved ones, is fear. Some researchers on this topic have suggested that the fear of death is a major motivator of much behavior, and can influence such behavior in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, this viewpoint suggests that people who are afraid of dying tend to do whatever it takes to ensure that they stay alive. Staying alive contributes to the continuity and socialization of the species because people so driven are more likely to want to have children and to raise them according to their society's acceptable standards. However, the same death anxiety can become a destructive force and could even result in both physical and mental problems. High levels of death anxiety in older adults are associated with lower ego integrity and more physical and psychological problems relative to individuals with low death anxiety. Death anxiety is a multifaceted construct that is difficult to define but has been conceptualized to include: fear of death of oneself; fear of death of others; fear of dying of self; and fear of the dying of others.",

      "abstract": "Two fundamental aspects of cultural intuitive conceptions of time's passage - cyclic and continuous temporality - are here related to clinical psychopathology of post-traumatic stress in Brazil. People with predominantly cyclical cultural perceptions of time tend to see life and death as part of an eternal movement. Severity and persistence of mental trauma are not directly related to the magnitude of the catastrophe or even of the traumatic experience, but rather to the way they pervade the mind and to the roles they represent on it. Modern culture tends to produce individuals prepared to a highly complex world, running in a frantic rhythm and under constant pressure. Nearly all events must be anticipated, planned or controlled, and obsessive traits tend to be facilitated. However, in catastrophic, unpredictable events, when nothing can be done, these full-schedule people may show frailty and despair. Traditional communities seem capable to bear extremely high levels of aggression or suffering - in traumatic and catastrophic situations - without showing proportional signs of mental stress. While in the high social layers of modern communities an act of violence as an assault or rape may have serious and long lasting consequences, in everyday public hospital practice we come across victims of potentially traumatic events without any of the expected devastating effects on their mental life. Periodic dissociative rituals may have a role in their resilience.",

This may lead to episodes of sexual miscommunication, which in turn sometimes result in sexual aggression. The study aimed to identify how following prevalent sexual scripts facilitates clear sexual communication or alternatives leads to miscommunication between Russian young adults. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 14 women and 11 men aged 19-25 years living in St. Petersburg (Russia) who had had at least one sexual partner of the opposite sex. Data were analysed thematically. Four themes were developed from the interviews: (1) endorsing (or not endorsing) traditional sexual scripts, (2) the presence or absence of sexual compliance, (3) softening refusal of sexual contact or intercourse, (4) the belief that asking for consent is unusual. Findings indicate that patterns and clarity of sexual communication differ depending on the type of relationship (serious, casual, and other), its stage, and partners' beliefs. Study findings underscore the need for sex and sexuality education for young people in Russia.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews empirical research to discover what support exists for theories that attempt to explain why adults become sexually interested in and involved with immature children. These theories are first organized into four basic categories: (1) congruence-why the adult has an need to relate to a child; (2) sexual arousal-why the adult could become sexually aroused by a child; (3) blockage-why alternative sources of sexual and gratification are not available; or (4) disinhibitionwhy the adult is not deterred from such an interest by normal prohibitions. The review shows (1) that the best experimental research has been directed toward establishing that pedophiles do show an unusual pattern of sexual arousal toward children, although no good evidence yet exists about why this is so; (2) a number of studies have concurred that pedophiles are blocked in their social and heterosexual relationships; (3) the use of alcohol is well established as a disinhibiting factor that plays a role in a great many pedophile offenses; (4) at least one study gives support to the emotional congruence idea that children, because of their lack of dominance, have some special meaning for pedophiles; and (5) there is evidence that many pedophiles were themselves victims of pedophile behavior when they were children. The article also demonstrates that pedophilia research is, in general, characterized by some serious theoretical and methodological flaws. As a result, caution should be exercised in generalizing findings until more careful research is undertaken. This article reviews the empirical evidence concerning theories of pedophilia. Many theories have been proposed,l-4 but there exist few comprehensive reviews of the problem that have looked at these theories in the light of empirical research, a gap that this article will try to remedy.",

      "abstract": "The problem of feeling guilty about a pregnancy loss is suggested to be primarily a moral matter and not a medical or psychological one. Two standard approaches to women who blame themselves for a loss are first introduced, characterised as either psychologistic or deterministic. Both these approaches are shown to underdetermine the autonomy of the mother by depending on the notion that the mother is not culpable for the loss if she \"could not have acted otherwise\". The inability to act otherwise is explained as not being as strong a determinant of culpability as it may seem at first. Instead, people's culpability for a bad turn of events implies strongly that they have acted for the wrong reasons, which is probably not true in the case of women who have experienced a loss of pregnancy. The practical conclusion of this paper is that women who feel a sense of guilt in the wake of their loss have a good reason to reject both the psychologistic and the deterministic approaches to their guilt-that they are justified in feeling upset about what has gone wrong, even responsible for the life of the child, but are not culpable for the unfortunate turn of events.",

Partiendo de la hipótesis de que la dificultad para encontrar una pareja considerada adecuada y estable en estos perfiles puede estar estrechamente relacionada con su habilidad para persuadir a mujeres a involucrarse sexualmente en etapas tempranas, se plantea que dicha capacidad incrementa la probabilidad de encuentros sexuales sin vínculo emocional suficiente para activar la liberación de neuroquímicos del apego como oxitocina y vasopresina.Esta combinación podría inducir un ciclo de disonancia cognitiva o evitación aparente tras el encuentro, no porque la pareja potencial sea inadecuada per se, sino como resultado de sus propios procesos neuroquímicos al no haber habido tiempo suficiente para consolidar un vínculo emocional previo a la relación sexual. Esto explicaría, desde una perspectiva neuropsicológica, por qué muchos hombres altamente persuasivos y con estructuras complejas pasan largos periodos solteros o perciben que “ninguna mujer es suficiente”, sin comprender que el origen del rechazo surge en ellos mismos y no exclusivamente en la pareja potencial.Este abstract plantea la necesidad de entender que este patrón no es solo un proceso de evitación psicológica aislada, sino una interacción entre neurobiología, capacidad cognitiva, impulsividad sexual y tiempo de exposición afectiva, lo que podría guiar intervenciones clínicas más precisas para fomentar apegos sanos en hombres con estas características.",

Nonostante questo, il ruolo del diniego sul recidivismo criminale sessuale e controverso. I risultati della ricerca scientifica sono infatti concordi nel ritenere il diniego un bisogno di rispondenza, che incide sulla compliance al trattamento e che impatta sulla funzionalita relazionale e sociale della persona, ma che non acutizza il rischio di recidivisimo criminale. Se il diniego non e un fattore che direttamente influenza il rischio di ricaduta criminale, la convinzione giuridico-sociale, secondo cui l’assenza di diniego favo-risce un processo di assunzione di responsabilita, non e piu sostenibile ne sul piano scientifico ne tantomeno su quello psico-criminologico e clinico. Questi avanzamenti empirici richiedono un cambiamento di prospettiva rispetto al diniego iniziando a considerarlo un target del trattamento e non un elemento da eliminare prima di iniziare il trattamento. Probabilmente il sistema sociale potrebbe beneficiare maggiormente di una politica di intervento che conduca gli autori di reati sessuali a desistere, nonostante il processo di ammissione del reato e di assunzione di responsabilita seguira il cambiamento comportamentale piuttosto che anticiparlo.",

      "abstract": "The possible association between heavy drinking and intoxication with aggression and violence has been debated for centuries. A select and concise review of some of the evidence on this topic will be presented. This seeks to draw some general conclusions from an extensive, flawed and often contradictory literature. The main focus of this review is on social and contextual factors. Experimental evidence suggests that alcohol consumption probably does increase the propensity for aggression in men, but less so for women. The effects of drinking depend upon the alcohol consumed, the drinker and the setting in which consumption occurs. Most drinking occasions do not result in aggression or violence, and drinking is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause violence. Heavy and inappropriate drinking is associated with both violent and nonviolent crimes; heavy and problem drinkers are at risk of being violent or of being the victims of violence. Experience of violence (including sexual abuse) in childhood or later in life are associated with the development of heavy or problem drinking. The risk of exposure to violence is influenced by a host of demographic, lifestyle and contextual factors. Responses to alcohol-related violence at the societal level involve a number of harm minimization strategies. At an individual level it has been shown that treatment for problem drinking can lead to reduced risk levels (for both perpetrators and victims of violence).",

Heterosexism represents society's implicit value of heterosexual practices over those expressed by sexual minorities. This sociopolitical construct is often evident via inequitable employment, healthcare, and educational practices.

Many such women must struggle with other forces such as the devastating effects of terrible emotional/physical neglect or physical and/or sexual abuse, often inflicted within a chaotic chemically dependent family system. Many lesbian and bisexual women with long-term recovery are plagued by such major problems as eating disorders, dissociative disorders, depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, compulsive debting/spending, sexual dysfunction, inability to be intimate, relationship problems, internalized homophobia, sexual identity confusion, and self-harming behaviors. A sense of defilement or stigma is unavoidable in the face of societal disgust and hatred both for those who are alcoholic and for those who are lesbian or gay or bisexual. Gay people who are subjected to the constant, ongoing totalitarian system of societal and familial homophobia intensified by their own personal, internalized homophobia learn to survive this emotional battering by \"numbing out.&quot",

      "title": "The role of migration processes and cultural factors in the classification of personality disorders",
      "abstract": "Migrants and ethnic minorities are at risk of being under- and overdiagnosed with personality disorders (PDs). A culturally informed approach to the classification of PDs guides clinicians in incorporating migration processes and cultural factors, to arrive at a reliable and valid assessment of personality pathology. In this article, we provide a tentative framework to highlight specific interactions between personality disorders, migration processes, and cultural factors. It is argued that migration processes can merely resemble personality pathology, activate certain (latent) vulnerabilities, and aggravate pre-existing personality pathology. We propose that these migration processes can include manifestations of grief about the loss of pre-migratory psychosocial and economic resources, and the struggle to attain psychosocial and economic resources in the host culture. Moreover, several cultural dimensions are outlined that can either resemble or mask personality pathology. The term \"culturally masked personality disorder\" is coined, to delineate clinical cases in which cultural factors are overused or misused to rationalize behavioral patterns that are consistently inflexible, distressing, or harmful to the individual and/or significant others, lead to significant impairment, and exceed the relevant cultural norms. Additionally, the role of historical trauma is addressed in the context of potential overdiagnosis of personality disorders in Indigenous persons, and the implications of misdiagnosis in migrants, ethnic minorities, and Indigenous populations are elaborated. Finally, clinical implications are discussed, outlining various diagnostic steps, including an assessment of temperament/character, developmental history, systemic/family dynamics, migration processes, cultural dimensions, and possible historical trauma.",

      "abstract": "The consequences of violence are far greater than may be initially apparent. The types of violence we cover in this chapter include self-directed violence; youth, intimate partner, and sexual violence; child maltreatment and elder abuse; and collective violence, which includes violent conflicts between nations and groups, state and group terrorism, torture, genocides, rape as a weapon of war, gang warfare, and the like. Consequences from these types of violence range from direct traumas to the less recognizable social, cultural, economic, and health consequences that may be at first be hidden. Health consequences can be both physical and psychological, with short- and long-term effects. Consequences may be different according to type of violence, but they may also follow principles that are common to all types. Stigma, isolation, and violence itself make the study of consequences difficult. Theories about the cyclical natural of violence, for example, show how violence can lead to other forms of violence. There is also a link between adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and adulthood health outcomes that uncover the widespread and enduring effects of violence. The costs of violence's consequences are enormous, highlighting the benefits of prevention. Better data collection could aid in directing prevention efforts and in reducing consequences.",

This investigation delineates sex differences in the psychopathology of medical students seeking treatment. Men and women did not differ in primary diagnosis, type of complaint, problem areas, or type of termination. However, women reported more depressive and total symptomatology, and men were more likely to receive a secondary diagnosis of personality disorder and evidenced a particular excess of obsessive-compulsive disorders. Men often requested treatment following a relationship loss or when school performance fell short of expectations. Women were frequently struggling to reconcile career desires with a feminine identification and with affiliation needs. Conflict about deviating from a traditional role was exacerbated by expressed disapproval from significant others.",

According to traditions that prevailed in the area in the past, and still believed by some people today, there are four main reasons for pregnancy loss: meeting with an unclean person; a dispute involving the victim; the displeasure of ancestor spirits; and illness or general physical weakness of the mother-to-be. The effects of the curse will be realized when there is a pregnancy loss from among the party that was cursed. The ancestor spirits choose one form of punishment, for example, to withhold an individual's fertility or cause pregnancy loss for a specific pregnant woman. It is considered wrong for anybody to pick a quarrel with a pregnant woman, because anxiety, a disturbed mind or frustration may destabilize the fetus and cause a miscarriage or stillbirth.",

The influence of implicit bias on perception may operate under the radar of consciousness: therefore it is irrelevant to the justification of epistemologists' beliefs according to accessibility. The person whose beliefs and judgements are influenced by implicit bias displays epistemic vices like negligence and lack of thoroughness. And since implicit biases often encode stereotypes, they are a hindrance to the achievement of virtues such as open-mindedness, leading to prejudice and closed-minded responses. It is worth noting that in various endeavours to address under-representation it has been argued that implicit biases are part of the explanations for continued marginalisation and exclusion of individuals – in particular women and Black and minority ethnicity individuals – from communities of enquirers.",

      "abstract": "There are two conceptions of suicides: suicide as completion of a pathological development and suicide as a voluntary, well premeditated rational act. Between these poles we see a spectrum of various modes in the genesis of suicidal acts. In its conceptional framework this spectrum is placed on two different levels which are incommensurable to each other. Suicide as a pathological event and suicide as a free act (voluntary death) are two aspects, related to each other in a relationship of mutual concealment. Against the background of this ambiguity we discuss a discrepancy of two different aspects: The aspect of the suicide-statistics of private life-insurance-companies and the conception of suicide in psychiatry. There is stated a higher suicide-rate among insurants, which we attempt to interpret. Following reasons are to be discussed: 1. different areas of experience; 2. correlations between traits of the personality of insurants and traits of the personality of men or women who later on will commit suicide; 3. a preference of suicides by temptation to commit suicide in order to get money for the surviving family (we leave undecided wether primarily planned or secondarily promoted). There might be a broader interest in the second hypothesis (= people with a \"Typus-melancholicus\"-personality structure [Tellenbach] seem to become more often depressive than other people). This hypothesis should be examined in further research.",

      "abstract": "The human health results from the interplay of lifestyle, genetic, psychological, and other factors. In addition, humans are exposed to numerous environmental factors that affect their physical and mental health. In the present piece of work, the impact of environmental exposure on mental and physical health is understood in the broadest sense. The environment has direct and indirect effects on mental and physical health. High-rise housing and other constructions are detrimental to the psychological wellbeing of people. Residential overcrowding, these high-density areas, and noisy exterior noise sources increase psychological distress and may contribute to the development of mental and physical disorders. Air pollutants with a pungent odor amplify negative effects, and environmental pollutants have also been linked to behavioral disturbances. Lack of adequate daylight is reliably associated with melancholic dispositions and increased depressive symptoms. Consequently, environmental factors continue to negatively impact both mental and physical health. The environment has the potential to encourage or inhibit human interaction. Along with this, individuals’ personal control, social support, relationships, and restoration from tension and fatigue may all be affected by various aspects and properties of the built environment. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when work from home had become commonplace, environmental factors had a significant impact on the health outcomes of individuals. Hence, this article is trying to shed light on the environmental factors that affect the physical and mental health of its users in more than one way and what can be done to make it less stressful, safer, and better by improving the tangible environment.",

      "abstract": "Parental alienation syndrome (PAS), as defined by its creator Dr. Richard Gardner (2001), is a poorly defined, poorly researched, and controversial pseudoscientific construct arising primarily in the context of child custody disputes. The syndrome allegedly manifests as a non-rational and unjustified campaign of denigration against one parent during custody proceedings. It is purported to result from the combination of a parent’s “brainwashing” and indoctrination regarding the vilification of the target parent. Unfortunately, there is little evidence to support that parental alienation represents a scientifically valid syndrome. There is no commonly recognized or empirically supported pathogenies, course, familiar pattern, or treatment selection indicated for the proposed symptoms of PAS. Additionally, it has been consistently excluded from both DSM-V and ICD-10, representing a near global rejection by the scientific community. When used in the legal context, PAS is exceptionally dangerous as it can conceal actual cases of abuse and cause children to be remanded into the custody of an abusive parent. Furthermore, it can be used as leverage to separate children from the caregiver that they are best suited to be with solely on the accusation of the non-preferred parent that they have been “alienated.” In the interest of improving the scientific quality of custody evaluations and the safety of children, pseudoscientific theories such as parental alienation syndrome should be eliminated from the custody decision making process.",

      "title": "The Paradox of Positionality: Avoiding, Embracing, or Resisting Feminist Accountability",
      "abstract": "Wrestling with the desirability and possibility of research objectivity, scholars across disciplines debate the claim that there can ever be value-free research. While many sociocultural scholars defend and strive for research objectivity, feminists tend to reject such approaches and instead continue to call on scholars to position themselves in their research presentations and publications in relation to the topic being studied, and in the case of empirical work, their participants. We might think of this call as a feminist accountability, which we suggest most scholars avoid, some embrace, and others resist. One can avoid positioning themselves in their research, but we contend in doing so they potentially stabilize dangerous claims that surround the desirability and possibility of research objectivity. Those who embrace accountability by positioning themselves in their analyses are not without their own risks. They often have to vulnerably share intimate details about themselves or their loved ones. For those who embrace accountability and are members of a marginalized community they are studying, they are also likely to experience heightened accusations that their research is biased and/or a self-discovery project derogatorily referred to as \"mesearch.\" Others who resist feminist accountability might do so for good reason especially for scholars studying very stigmatized phenomena, but it is likely folks who engage their work will still make problematic assumptions about their bodies, identities, and experiences. It is through the various ways of navigating this feminist accountability that we offer the paradox of positionality and contend that fat studies scholarship is an ideal entry point into its theorization.",

      "abstract": "The study sets to catagrafy the “violence” phenomenon in actual human society. The diversity of violence types, the education segments, the age segments who aggress and who are aggressed, get more and more extended. The social context is crucial for both the performance and understanding of violence. The term „senseless violence‟ is often heard in cases where a serious violent incident was apparently unprovoked or has emerged from “insignificant” insults or altercation. The notion of “senseless” violence is, by implication, contrasted to some other „reasonable‟ kind, or perhaps suggests that what we find repugnant needs to be placed beyond the bound of sense. Most people probably have a wordless conception of what is a reasonable response to offence or provocation, for example, a fatal shooting following an altercation over a parking place appears inexplicable and senseless. Still many acts of extreme violence occur in response to apparently minor incidents and violence nearly always has “sense”, that is, social meaning, to both perpetrators and victims. The targets of violence are rarely chosen randomly and the victims and perpetrators are frequently already known to each other. In some cases the attribution “senseless” refers to an assumed mental illness or other pathology that might account for otherwise incomprehensible behavior. Human society registered besides direct violence: war, murder, rape, assault, verbal attacks, that is the kind that we physically perceive, another two invisible forms and can‟t be eliminated without eliminating them, cultural violence and structural violence. Direct violence has its roots in cultural and structural violence; then it feeds back and strengthens them. All three forms interact as a triad. Direct violence reinforces structural and cultural violence. We are trapped in a vicious cycle that is now threatening to destroy life on earth.",

      "title": "Force And Threat Of Violence Are As The Ways Of Commission Of Rape: National And Foreign Experience",
      "abstract": "Rape and other sexual assaultsare commonly committed in industrialized countries, and are becoming more common throughout the world. Insome countries’ jurisdictions, male-female rape is the only form of rape counted in the statistics. many countries may not define forced and threat of violence sex on a spouse as “rape”. But those criminal acts are considered a crimein criminal law which belongs to those countries. Although rape is expressed the same in the legislation of different countries, it differs in some. rape as a crime is three the ways of commission crime. They are force, threat and sexual intercourse committed by abuse of helpless. Sometimes rape is committed by other means, with children, serious bodily injury and others. Some terms are used by legislation of different countries. They are: sexual act, sexual contact, force, threat, abuse of helpless, serious bodily injury from rape, by other means. Rape is committed by force or threat knowingly causes another person to engage in a sexual act by using force against that other person or by threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for any term of years or life, or both. On other hand rape is committed by other means knowingly renders another person unconscious and thereby engages in a sexual act with that other person or administers to another person by force or threat of force, or without the knowledge or permission of that person, a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby substantially impairs the ability of that other person to appraise or control conduct and engages in a sexual act with that other person or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for any term of years or life, or both. Rape is committed with children means that criminal act knowingly engages in a sexual act with another person who has not attained the age of 12 years, or knowingly engages in a sexual act under the circumstances with another person who has attained the age of 12 years but has not attained the age of 16 years (and is at least 4 years younger than the person so engaging). But in the criminal code of Uzbekistan with children is considered in a sexual act with another person who has not attained the age of 14 years.&#x0D; This article illustrates that the ways commission ofrape, including the theoretical and practical problems of the ways commission of rape. As well as in this article are given relevant conclusions, suggestions and recommendations by the analysis of the criminal law of developed foreign countries (USA, Canada, England and Wales, New Zealand, Germany, France and Russia).&#x0D; In addition, proposals and recommendations for further improvement of the criminal legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan.",

      "abstract": "The attachment of psychic meaning to relationships emerges in pre-oedipal life through the epigenesis of the representational world. The mother-child dyad is traditionally understood as the prototype of all subsequent one-to-one relationships, including to the father. However, developmental research data suggest that a child, even in optimal situations, has relatively little actual contact with the father in the first year of life. It is therefore suggested that father-representations derive from sources outside of the father-child dyad. The way a mother brings her youngster into contact with the father can catalyze or discolor the child's affective attachment to him. Mother can facilitate or retard the \"other-directedness\" of an infant in her husband's presence. During separation-individuation, the mother may affect father representations through her capacity to transitively vitalize or disenfranchise the father in his absence. Correlations from both clinical psychoanalytic work and infant-toddler observation are offered in support of these hypotheses.",

      "title": "The Power Principle: The Shame of the Father or The Emperor’s New Clothes",
      "abstract": "Freud’s paternal principle is a key unconscious presence that functions independently of the actual person of the father of childhood. As the third to the mother-infant dyad, this paternal function is of singular importance, while simultaneously placing the subjective experience of the father in the muted position of being an absent authority. As the paternal principle suggests and the power principle makes explicit, the father is largely a transference phenomenon enacted by the child to imbue the person of the father with his power, rendering him paradoxically in a vulnerable position. Furthermore, his power, dependent on the child’s perception, is often eventually attributed to others. Despite this precarious position, fathers retain their childhood perception of their own father’s omnipotence. This perception remains sequestered as an unconscious belief, a paternal bastion, holding fathers—even those who have awakened to women’s equality—accountable to an archaic and patriarchic ideal, but without the support of the patriarchal systems of the past. In the context of changing social structures, the presence of the paternal in the unconscious has direct implications for the treatment of men and women modeled on developmental theories of the mother-infant relationship.",

      "abstract": "As a physiologist or biomedical scientist, have you ever found yourself at some non-specialist social event, unable to help yourself but listen in to the criminal lawyer at the next table, entertaining her neighbors at said table for hours on end with stories from her professional life, while you—do not, because telling people what you do for a living is either considered TMI,* incomprehensible or deeply boring common knowledge? I sure have. However, on occasion, it fills me with awe when I discover that terms or concepts which I had myself always thought to be common knowledge, are, in fact, technical terms from subject areas I had been rather ignorant about. Growth and development are two such examples. An increase in size, for example, in the context of childhood development, is only defined as growth if it is constant and irreversible.2 Development, in the same context, is a growth in psychomotor capacity.2 Both terms are, in biomedical papers, often used in a much broader sense in relation to other subject areas: At Acta Physiologica, a number of excellent articles reporting growth and development research have been published. Parental health and genetic composition influence both processes from before conception, as evident in, for example, the developmental consequences of fetal programming, be it through maternal obesity,3, 4 paternal exercise or lack thereof,5 or a disruption of immune function at the maternofetal interface6 or gestational diabetes,7 for example. The role of individual regulating factors as well as mechanisms during mammalian ontogenesis are another focus area, examples being the role of syndapins,8 Vmat2,9 KCNMA1 variants10 or the microglia-leucocyte axis in the developing brain.11 Other recent advancements have expanded and refined the methodological toolbox to exactly characterize potential disruptions of growth and development. The list is huge - to name but a few examples, pertaining to, for example, analysis of mass imaging data,12 highly reliable non-invasive organ size determination,13 spatial transcriptomics14 or approaches to refine computational modeling of individual organ systems by improving bilateral feedback exchanges with experimental scientists.15 While growth and development are undoubtedly used beyond their specific meaning with regard to, for example, ontogenic or pediatric development, I would encourage non-native speakers, myself included, to keep our eyes and ears open at all times to the precise and specific meanings of terms we thought we knew fully well, and which we have been using confidently, all the time.16 Recently, at an interdisciplinary event, I found myself seated next to an engineer doing high-end field research on the defusing of rare historical bombs. And yes, there are scholarly articles and journals in the field17; I readily admit I had no idea. If this is not a topic for small talk—wow, he must be the star at every party, I thought. Wrong—he usually tells people that he is a gardener, as otherwise he will never get a moment of peace, let alone an opportunity to eat something, or listen to someone interesting himself. None",

      "abstract": "Until very recent times there had never been any systematic data collected on the phenomena of ongoing incest during adulthood – despite press reporting of such cases extending back at least one and a half centuries. Research now demonstrates that typically such abuse goes on for decades, is frequently multi-generational and almost inevitably the father (or step-father) is part of some sort of organized abuse network. Victims of such abuse experience extreme fear and shame, are highly dissociative, highly conditioned, and in keeping with an enduring extreme attachment to their primary abuser typically feel fused with their father and indeed do not experience themselves as owning their own body. Invariably the father and other abusers are represented in their psyche in the form of dissociative identity states. This chapter highlights the enduring attachment to the father, the early manipulation of sexual responses and the ways in which a child abused from a very early age remains very controlled by the father with ongoing polymorphous extreme (usually sadistic) sexual abuse.",

      "abstract": "Abused children need to be able to feel good about their bodies and to develop self-esteem. After years of aversion gaze, the tabloid press have suddenly discovered child sexual abuse and have over-sensationalized a complex and painful subject. Sexual abuse is not confined to nubile daughters and their fathers. It can occur at birth and continue throughout a whole lifetime. The causes of sexually transmitted diseases in children should always be investigated as should excessive masturbation and sexually provocative behaviour. The sad thing is that abused children do not know the difference between affection and sexual behaviour. Thus their behaviour can subject them to further abuse. Sexually abused children feel betrayed and respond to being used as a sexual object. They feel spoilt, debased and violated. Bewildering feelings of guilt are mixed with anger and shame. Children can leave the household, marry, have their own children and still be lured back into the sexually abusing set-up.",

      "title": "‘One Can Always Say No.’ Enriching the Bioethical Debate on Antisocial Behaviour, Neurobiology and Prevention: Views of Juvenile Delinquents",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Genomic and neuro‐scientific research into the causes and course of antisocial behaviour triggers bioethical debate. Often, these new developments are met with reservation, and possible drawbacks and negative side‐effects are pointed out. This article reflects on these scientific developments and the bioethical debate by means of an exploration of the perspectives of one important stakeholder group: juveniles convicted of a serious crime who stay in a juvenile justice institution. The views of juveniles are particularly interesting, as possible applications of current and future scientific findings are considered to be most effective if applied early in life. Based on their statements we come to the following provisional conclusions. Concerns about labelling and stigmatization are recognized and widely shared. Possible effects on one's identity are acknowledged too. Yet, a possible biological underpinning of one's antisocial behaviour is not considered to result in the development of a criminal identity. Nonetheless, psychopharmacological interventions are experienced as endangering one's current self. Concerns regarding the refusal of responsibility and the blaming of one's genes or brain can be put into perspective. Instead, participants emphasize the motive of own choice as underlying their criminal behaviour. Moreover, bioethical debate should pay attention to the role of parents of children at risk and the parent‐child relationship in families at‐risk. We argue that the short‐term and long‐term interests of children at risk, as well as their interests and those of society at large, may conflict. In order to deal appropriately with newly arising dilemmas, a normative framework needs to be developed.",

      "title": "The Risk of Loss",
      "abstract": "Schaeffer argues that anxiety and depression are more frequent in women than in men because men have an inherent defense against maternal anality. Initial dependency is an organic necessity for both boys and girls because of the immaturity of human infants, but the boy, destined to a sexuality penetration and castration anxiety, organizes himself readily in the activity and the mastery of waiting and loss. The woman, on the other hand, never stops repeating the painful excitement of waiting. All these expectations of the woman are linked to non-controllable experiences of real losses that she cannot symbolize, like the boy, in anguish of loss of an organ. So, she needs the anchoring of a solid primary erogenous masochism. This allows her to cathect erotically the painful tension. It is thus a powerful antidepressant factor. for the girl (sexual difference) to surmount this through the concrete unique, fear of loss associated with the penis. Female depression is a consequence, for both men and women, of a deficiency in the capacity to emerge, because of the lack of capacity to symbolize interiority; because of the repetition of a loss that is not biologically constituted and thus remains in a dependency constituted by maternal anality.",

      "title": "Aggression and violence.",
      "abstract": "It is fallacious to believe that agression and violence are features peculiar to the 1980s or even to the 20th century.Aggressive behaviour is a characteristic human trait and is sometimes even encouraged.However, it may progress to violence, although this is usually discouraged, since another trait of human beings is control.This may be from without or within, but most human interaction allows for some aggression, assumes it will be controlled, and breaks down when violence ensues.By its very nature an accident and emergency department is exposed to both aggression and violence.The staff of these departments witness the effects and treat the victims of physical violence in its most obvious form.In addition, however, the patients themselves may be aggressive, as may their relatives.The staff assume that most of this aggression will be controlled but often it isn't.Aggressive verbal outbursts are serious for they may often herald physical abuse.After a physical attack has been made the matter is usually one for the police.However, there are steps which can be taken to prevent this final outburst.People feel most threatened when they are frightened and seem unable to influence events.This frustration may be expressed as violence to others or to themselves.When directed inwards it may end in attempted suicide.It is known that when control is already impaired, for example by alcohol or mental illness, such attempts are more common (Kessel, 1965).Similarly, when unemployment is prolonged, and therefore influence is impaired, attempts at suicide are again increased (Platt & Kreitman, 1984).Mental illness and subsequent loss of control and influence tend not surprisingly to increase acts of aggression directed both inwardly and outwardly to others (Yesavage, 1983).An accident and emergency department may prevent some of the violence directed towards it by removing the frustration and lack of influence often felt by patients and relatives.Some departments have installed videos which both entertain and educate those waiting for treatment.The current waiting time should be displayed and people given regular updates on the reason for any serious delays.Specific and remedial causes of patients' fear and lack of control must be sought.The more obvious causes are diabetic hypoglycaemia, head injury, mental illness and epilepsy.Drugs such as alcohol are commonly used and often predispose to accidents (Wechsler et al., 1969).Alcohol is often abused by the pathologically aggressive (Nylander, 1979) and in otherwise normal people it impairs control and behaviour.Perhaps as important as its direct toxic effects on the central nervous system may be the neurological effects of its associated hypoglycaemia.This may occur after prolonged drinking and little intake of food (Freingel et al., 1963), or within a few hours when alcohol is taken with sugar (O'Keefe & Marks, 1977).The latter stimulates insulin which lowers the blood glucose.The former then potentiates the insulin and prevents release of glucose from the liver.Symptomatic hypoglycaemia can ensue and the subsequent aggression is well recognized.Not so well recognized is that taking alcohol with glucose is common, e.g.gin and tonic, rum and coke.If alcohol is consumed with starch, as in beer, this effect is not seen (Jaffe et al., 1982).",

      "abstract": "FLAVELL, JOHN H. On Cognitive Development. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1982, 53, 1-10. Does human cognitive development advance through a series of broad and general stages? If so, the child's mind at any point in its development should seem quite consistent and similar across situations in its maturity level and general style. That is, it should be relatively homogeneous rather than at any given age. There appear to be factors and considerations that make for both heterogeneity and homogeneity in the child's cognitive life. As to heterogeneity, many cognitive items (concepts, skills, etc.) may develop independently; they may not assist each other's development and there may be no common mediator to assist their codevelopment. Likewise, mental heterogeneity may occur because human beings have evolved to cope with certain cognitive tasks earlier or more easily than others. Intraindividual differences in aptitudes and experiences could also produce considerable heterogeneity. As to homogeneity, the child's information-processing capacity may impose an upper limit on how heterogeneous her mental level could be. There may also be more cognitive homogeneity (1) in the child's initial reaction to inputs than in her subsequent management of them; (2) at the beginning and end of an acquisitional sequence than in the middle of it; (3) in spontaneous, everyday cognition than in formal task or test situations; (4) in some cognitive domains than in others; (5) in some children than in others. It was concluded that cognitive development might appear more general-stage-like than many of us believed, if only we knew how and where to look.",

      "title": "Implicit race attitudes predict trustworthiness judgments and economic trust decisions",
      "abstract": "Trust lies at the heart of every social interaction. Each day we face decisions in which we must accurately assess another individual's trustworthiness or risk suffering very real consequences. In a global marketplace of increasing heterogeneity with respect to nationality, race, and multiple other social categories, it is of great value to understand how implicitly held attitudes about group membership may support or undermine social trust and thereby implicitly shape the decisions we make. Recent behavioral and neuroimaging work suggests that a common mechanism may underlie the expression of implicit race bias and evaluations of trustworthiness, although no direct evidence of a connection exists. In two behavioral studies, we investigated the relationship between implicit race attitude (as measured by the Implicit Association Test) and social trust. We demonstrate that race disparity in both an individual's explicit evaluations of trustworthiness and, more crucially, his or her economic decisions to trust is predicted by that person's bias in implicit race attitude. Importantly, this relationship is robust and is independent of the individual's bias in explicit race attitude. These data demonstrate that the extent to which an individual invests in and trusts others with different racial backgrounds is related to the magnitude of that individual's implicit race bias. The core dimension of social trust can be shaped, to some degree, by attitudes that reside outside conscious awareness and intention.",

      "title": "Redefining Addiction I. Making Addiction a Scientifically and Socially Useful Concept",
      "abstract": "Addiction is both a more complex-and a more common-phenomenon than either medical personnel or laymen have realized. It is impossible to link addiction as a medical syndrome to any one drug or family of drugs, or to trace it to a specific biological mechanism. As scientists have uncovered more data leading to these conclusions, they have turned away from employing the term \"addiction.\" Yet many drug researchers and workers in the helping professions continue to make incorrect assumptions about both addiction and drug use. In this paper the author attempts to broaden the applicability of the addiction concept in order to give it meaning. With this broader approach, we find that many involvements that people become engaged in follow the pattern of addiction, while some involvements with supposedly addictive drugs do not follow this pattern. The addiction cycle is explored by means of the following psychological definition: An addiction is any compulsive activity or involvement which decreases a person's ability to deal with other aspects of his life to the point where that activity or involvement comprises the dominant source of emotional reinforcement and identity for the person.",

      "abstract": "Children and adolescents within society are the most vulnerable to breaking their intrinsic rights as individuals and as human beings, as is the right to their sexual intimacy, the crime of rape being a frequent occurrence that is committed against them, Which, by not being old enough and maturing, does not allow them to defend themselves against rapists, since they access the fact by using physical force, or psychological and moral intimidation. Illegal is punishable by deprivation of liberty to the person who commits them according to the norms indicated in the Integrated Code of Criminal Integral.\r\nArticle 171 of the Integral Criminal Code punishes the crime of rape, indicating that it is the carnal access, with total or partial introduction of the virile member, orally, anal or vaginal; Or the introduction, by vaginal or anal, of objects, fingers or organs other than the virile member, to a person of either sex. Whoever commits it shall be punished with imprisonment from nineteen to twenty-two years in any of the following cases: 1. When the victim is deprived of reason or sense or when due to illness or disability he can not resist; 2. When violence, threats or intimidation are used; 3. When the victim is under the age of fourteen.- The maximum penalty provided for in the first subparagraph shall be sanctioned when: 1. The victim, as a result of the infraction, suffers a physical injury or permanent psychological damage. 2. The victim, as a consequence of the infraction, contracts a serious or mortal illness. 3. The victim is under the age of ten.\r\nIn the event that the victim is a minor of ten years, the maximum penalty that the offender can receive is twenty-two years, insufficient penalty, because the child is more than a person subject to rights, is protected by those of attention As stated in Article 46, numeral 4, of the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador, which states: Protection and care against all forms of violence, mistreatment, sexual exploitation or any other type of exploitation. In cases of children under 10 years of age, the penalty must be greater than twenty-two\r\nyears, because their rights intrinsic to their age, such as the right to liberty, as set forth in Article 66, paragraph 3 of the same Constitution, are violated.

      "abstract": "We can divide the study of deviance into two principal endeavors: the effort to understand how social norms are constructed, how such normative constructions are applied, and with what consequences; and the effort to explain why some people engage in behaviors that are considered wrong. Social norms can be violated in several ways – as a result of non‐normative behavior, beliefs, conditions, and physical characteristics. However, sociologists and criminologists apply explanatory theories almost exclusively to behavior , rarely to beliefs, and never to conditions; in addition, some sociologists have attempted to understand and account for mental disorder – especially mental illness – which manifests itself in particular kinds of deviant behavior. Of the many ways we might define deviance, statistical rarity and pathology are two that have no sociological purchase whatsoever. Deviance often enters into the picture when norms are violated, but not all normative violations result in censure or punishment; different observers may react to the same normative violation in different ways. These seeming contradictions are components of the fundamental complexity that constitutes deviance.",

Rehabilitation interventions are aimed to return the individual to full health by either restoration of past physical, cognitive or social capabilities or strengthening aspects of self to counter such loss. However, rehabilitation interventions do not result in a complete return to past physical, mental or social health. Does this mean that people with disability can never be healthy? Or does it indicate that our perception and definition of health does not reflect the essence of health? We argue that when people with disability redefine themselves in terms other than levels of physical, social and cognitive functioning, good health is an attainable goal. We discuss evidence that suggests why spirituality could be a primary determinant of health.",

      "abstract": "Few studies have investigated the association between religion and suicide either in terms of Durkheim's social integration hypothesis or the hypothesis of the regulative benefits of religion. The relationship between religion and suicide attempts has received even less attention.Depressed inpatients (N=371) who reported belonging to one specific religion or described themselves as having no religious affiliation were compared in terms of their demographic and clinical characteristics.Religiously unaffiliated subjects had significantly more lifetime suicide attempts and more first-degree relatives who committed suicide than subjects who endorsed a religious affiliation. Unaffiliated subjects were younger, less often married, less often had children, and had less contact with family members. Furthermore, subjects with no religious affiliation perceived fewer reasons for living, particularly fewer moral objections to suicide. In terms of clinical characteristics, religiously unaffiliated subjects had more lifetime impulsivity, aggression, and past substance use disorder. No differences in the level of subjective and objective depression, hopelessness, or stressful life events were found.Religious affiliation is associated with less suicidal behavior in depressed inpatients. After other factors were controlled, it was found that greater moral objections to suicide and lower aggression level in religiously affiliated subjects may function as protective factors against suicide attempts. Further study about the influence of religious affiliation on aggressive behavior and how moral objections can reduce the probability of acting on suicidal thoughts may offer new therapeutic strategies in suicide prevention.",

      "title": "A CHILD'S DEATH AND DIVORCE: DISPELLING THE MYTH",
      "abstract": "In view of the commonly held assumption about a high divorce rate among bereaved parents, a thorough review of literature was conducted to determine what evidence exists. Evidence was found to indicate that a child's death can strain marital relationships, which may lead to separation and/or divorce in some cases; however, there is no conclusive evidence that bereaved parents are likely to divorce as a result of a child's death. On the contrary, it appears that the majority of marital relationships survive the strain brought about by a child's death and may even be strengthened in the long run. The time it takes for bereaved parents to restore their relationship to the level it was before the child's illness and /or death varies depending on the couple and the circumstances involved. The ultimate effects of a child's death on marriage may not be known until after several years have passed. The quality of marital relationship prior to the child's death, cause of death, and circumstances surrounding the death may produce differential outcomes for the marital relationship. In the process of conducting a literature review, a number of questionable or erroneous citations that professionals made were discovered. In addition to those mistakes, confusion between marital distress and divorce appears to be partially responsible for perpetuating the myth of a high divorce rate among bereaved parents. It is time for professionals to dispel the myth. Recommendations for future research are provided.",

      "title": "Child Maltreatment and Eyewitness Memory",
      "abstract": "An important focus in scientific and legal fields is on children's and adults' eyewitness memory and suggestibility about child maltreatment experiences. Eyewitness memory is memory for events (particularly ones of a criminal nature) that people have either experienced as victims or witnessed as bystanders. The term 'child maltreatment' refers to caregivers' mistreatment of children that results in significant harm or potential harm to the children's well-being. Child maltreatment takes the form of acts of commission (e.g. physical abuse, sexual abuse) and/or omission (e.g. neglect). It is legally defined in each country's laws. From a legal perspective, failure to provide accurate eyewitness memory about child maltreatment can have serious consequences, such as wrongful conviction, or acquittal of a guilty perpetrator, both of which can leave child victims unprotected. On average, older children recount maltreatment-related events with greater detail and greater accuracy than younger children. However, various factors (e.g. embarrassment, secrecy) can reverse the age trend. Theories and scientific studies indicate that the relation between child maltreatment and memory depends on the nature of the to-be-remembered event. On the one hand, maltreatment experienced in childhood is associated with particularly accurate memory for stressful, personally relevant information; on the other hand, maltreatment is related to impaired memory for emotionally positive or neutral information. Individual-difference (e.g. trauma symptoms) and contextual (e.g. rapport-building) factors also play important roles. When child maltreatment is investigated by authorities, science-based interview protocols can be used to question children. If child victims are required to testify in criminal court, risk factors for psychological harm include having to testify multiple times and hostile cross examination, but with sufficient emotional support, many children can provide important eyewitness evidence and weather the experience without long-term psychological problems.",

Then, they attempt to offer a classification based on clinical examples. Secondary sterilities of psychogenic origin are only seen in women who have lost a child in the pre, per or post-partum period. This is even a characteristic example of non organic sterility. Primary sterilities may be psychological in origin, especially by absence of maturation of the child planning project (case of sterilities cured after adoption). They are seen more infrequently: in adult anorexia nervosa, psychological sexual differentiation disorders, masculine women. These difficulties are not easy to approach as much as psychological and organic factors may be entangled. In addition, one question is raised: who should take care of it? The psychiatrist or the gynecologist? Overall, the latter is preferable under the condition that he/she is properly trained. Anyway, it is ultimately the woman's choice.",

      "title": "Gaining trust as well as respect in communicating to motivated audiences about science topics",
      "abstract": "Expertise is a prerequisite for communicator credibility, entailing the knowledge and ability to be accurate. Trust also is essential to communicator credibility. Audiences view trustworthiness as the motivation to be truthful. Identifying whom to trust follows systematic principles. People decide quickly another's apparent intent: Who is friend or foe, on their side or not, or a cooperator or competitor. Those seemingly on their side are deemed warm (friendly, trustworthy). People then decide whether the other is competent to enact those intents. Perception of scientists, like other social perceptions, involves inferring both their apparent intent (warmth) and capability (competence). To illustrate, we polled adults online about typical American jobs, rated as American society views them, on warmth and competence dimensions, as well as relevant emotions. Ambivalently perceived high-competence but low-warmth, \"envied\" professions included lawyers, chief executive officers, engineers, accountants, scientists, and researchers. Being seen as competent but cold might not seem problematic until one recalls that communicator credibility requires not just status and expertise but also trustworthiness (warmth). Other research indicates the risk from being enviable. Turning to a case study of scientific communication, another online sample of adults described public attitudes toward climate scientists specifically. Although distrust is low, the apparent motive to gain research money is distrusted. The literature on climate science communicators agrees that the public trusts impartiality, not persuasive agendas. Overall, communicator credibility needs to address both expertise and trustworthiness. Scientists have earned audiences' respect, but not necessarily their trust. Discussing, teaching, and sharing information can earn trust to show scientists' trustworthy intentions.",

      "title": "Sexual Feelings in the Psychotherapy Room: Comparing Their Occurrence in Patients With Unipolar Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Neither of These",
      "abstract": "We read with interest the paper by Yaghmaei et al. [1], which highlights the significant impact of sexual challenges faced by individuals with bipolar disorder on their quality of life, as well as on their families. Their research underscores the need for early family-tailored sexual health interventions and the importance of recognizing these issues in both diagnostic and therapeutic contexts. We agree with Yaghmaei et al. and wish to extend the discussion to another crucial aspect of the lives of these patients: the psychotherapeutic context. Changes in the sexual patterns of psychiatric patients are evident not only within their families but also profoundly influence the therapeutic environment and dynamic. For example, behaviors such as innuendo, unsolicited sexual advances, changes in couture and make-up, and even sexual exhibitionism are notable, particularly during certain stages of bipolar illnesses. From its very beginning, the realm of psychotherapy is not immune to these erotic undertones. Most psychotherapists, at various points in their career, will experience romantic or sexual overtures from their patients. In certain situations, these advances can even evoke reciprocal feelings in the therapist. When not properly managed, such dynamics can jeopardize the therapeutic relationship, hinder treatment progress, and, in extreme cases, result in breaches of professional conduct. Although the literature suggests is it not the most common ethical violation providers are sanctioned for [2], sexual misconduct is a serious and recognized issue in the field. Herbert Strean's 1994 publication, \"Therapists who have sex with their patients,\" continues to be an enlightening read. Pooled data indicate that more than 4% of surveyed mental health professionals surveyed have admitted to crossing sexual boundaries with one or more of their patients [3]. Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that the prevalence and types of ethical violations can vary significantly by region, cultural context, therapist's unresolved personal problems, and the specific group of mental health professionals studied [4]. A pressing question remains: Are erotic behaviors in therapy sessions more prevalent among patients with bipolar disorder compared to those with other diagnoses? The forthcoming, original data seek to shed some light on this pivotal issue. The data presented herein are from a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study aimed at developing and preliminarily validating a self-report inventory that assesses patients' perceptions and affective reactions to their therapists during psychotherapy sessions [5]. The sample comprised 701 adults diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, all of whom underwent individual psychotherapy and resided in the United States. Participants were recruited from March through April 2022 through two national registers for clinical research funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS): ResearchMatch and Research for Me. Most were women (80%), and the predominant age groups were 18–29 years (40%) and 30–39 years (19%). Comprehensive details on the aim, rationale, methodology of the broader study, and sample characteristics are provided elsewhere [5]. No information on the type of individual psychotherapy participants were receiving has been collected. Nonetheless, it is important to note that patients' romantic and sexual feelings toward their therapists occur across various types of psychotherapy [6]. Participants were asked to rate a series of statements describing how they felt toward their therapist during their most recent therapy session. Three statements addressed, respectively, the feelings of (a) romantic attraction to the therapist (RA), (b) sexual attraction to the therapist (SA), and (c) perceived sexual attraction from the therapist (PA). For the purpose of this report, the patients were categorized into three primary diagnostic groups: unipolar depression (54%), bipolar disorder (17%), and neither of the above (29%). Regarding comorbidity with personality disorders that may exhibit sexualized boundary testing, 21% of patients with bipolar disorder, 4% of those with depression, and 3% of individuals in the third group were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Additionally, only one patient from the \"other\" category was diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder. As the main study did not focus on bipolar disorder, information on the specific phase of bipolar illness was not collected, representing a significant limitation of this report. It can be hypothesized, however, that bipolar patients undergoing psychotherapy would likely be in a state of remission. The prevalence rates of RA, SA, and PA were the following: 5%, 8%, and 1% for unipolar depression, 10%, 11%, and 7% for bipolar disorder, and 9%, 10%, and 6% for those without any mood disorder (see Figure 1). Univariate and multivariate regression analyzes (adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidity with personality disorders) consistently showed significantly higher odds of PA in patients with bipolar disorder (OR: 5.87; aOR: 4.80) or without any mood disorders (OR: 4.82; aOR: 4.25) compared to patients with unipolar depression. No significant differences were identified for RA and SA. Male patients had higher odds of RA (aOR: 3.90), SA (aOR: 5.90), and PA (aOR: 3.30). Considering that the research frame focused only on the very last therapy session, this suggests a relatively high prevalence of erotic feelings toward the therapist among patients in psychotherapy. However, these feelings do not appear to be more frequent in patients with bipolar disorder than in patients with a different psychiatric diagnosis. The only exception was the odds of perceiving the therapist as sexually attracted to the patient, which was significantly lower in people with unipolar depression. It is important to note that our study did not obtain data on the specific phase of bipolar illness in which patients were at the time, although it is reasonable to hypothesize that bipolar patients engaged in psychotherapy would be mostly in remission. Distinguishing between the illness phases would likely reveal significant differences in the outcomes measured. Consistent with our findings, we hypothesize that depression suppresses sexual interest, resulting in a loss of interest during the depressive phases of bipolar disorder, which is subsequently counterbalanced by increased sexual interest during hypo/mania. The higher odds found in male patients is clinically relevant when considering that recent findings indicate that dealing with a male patient increases the odds that the therapist experiences romantic attraction [2]. Furthermore, prior work found that dealing with a patient suffering from a mood disorder (83% of the sample was composed of patients with unipolar depression) increased the odds of feeling romantically attracted to them [3]. This could place the therapeutic dyad on a slippery slope toward boundary violation. The clinical importance of patient sexuality within the therapeutic setting is paramount and is overlooked at the provider's peril. Future research should not only examine the prevalence of these attitudes and behaviors and their correlations with specific mental disorders and current symptoms. It is equally vital to explore the varied clinical meanings associated with different types of mental disorders. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to explore the potential to craft disorder-specific approaches to managing sexuality within the therapeutic context. The authors have nothing to report.

      "title": "Dialectical principlism: an approach to finding the most ethical action.",
      "abstract": "Most forensic psychiatrists occasionally face complex situations in forensic work in which ethics dilemmas cause discomfort. They want to determine the most ethical action, but the best choice is unclear. Fostering justice is primary in forensic roles, but secondary duties such as traditional biomedical ethics and personal values like helping society, combating racism, and being sensitive to cultural issues can impinge on or even outweigh the presumptive primary duty in extreme cases. Similarly, in treatment the psychiatrists' primary duty is to patients, but that can be outweighed by secondary duties such as protecting children and the elderly or maintaining security. The implications of one's actions matter. In forensic work, if the psychiatrist determines that he should not assist the party who wants to hire him, despite evidence clearly supporting its side, the only ethical option becomes not to accept the case at all, because the evidence does not support the better side. Sometimes it can be ethical to accept cases only for one side. In ethics-related dilemmas, I call the method of prioritizing and balancing all types of conflicting principles, duties, and personal and societal values in a dialectic to resolve conflicts among them dialectical principlism. This approach is designed to help determine the most ethical action. It is aspirational and is not intended to get the psychiatrist into trouble.",

The aim was to see which experiences of neglect or abuse were more likely to be shared or non-shared, and whether the non-shared elements related to maternal characteristics such as her psychosocial risk or history of depression.",

      "abstract": "Binge drinking is a worldwide and multi-faceted phenomenon usually defined as having 4 or more alcoholic beverages per occasion for women or 5 or more drinks per occasion for men. Binge drinking also underlies many other risky behaviors (inter- and intra-personal violence, drunk driving, sexual risks, etc.) as well as negative health consequences (cancers, cardiovascular diseases, etc.). The three-fold nature of binge drinking (biological, psychological and sociological) encompasses a wide variety of areas ranging from endocrinology to social and cognitive psychology. Getting an overview of the problem, however, is made difficult by the very fact that few evolutionary analysis have been suggested. Here, we propose to frame the problem from a costly signaling perspective. What type of signals do the binge drinkers send? To whom is the signal directed? Are those signals courtship displays or threats to competitors in order to assure reproductive success or maintain social status? How can contextual factors influence drinking rates? Exploring causes, correlates and predictors of binge drinking and its interdisciplinary nature should serve as a relevant starting point to then reveal the necessity of an evolutionary framework.To address these questions, I first started by shaping an evolutionary-based approach to binge drinking taking into account current data and theories (Chapter 1). I then ran various laboratory studies (eye-tracking) and online experiments aiming at evaluating the mating and intra-sexual signals that binge drinkers send to others (Chapter 2 and 3). Based on those results, I implemented a field prevention program intended at reducing alcohol’s attitude and expectancies among French high school students as well as an online replication (Chapter 4). In parallel, I conducted an extensive meta-analysis of women’s drinking behaviors and other risks across the menstrual cycle to understand the endocrine influences at play (Chapter 5). Finally, I analyzed the life-history theory of risky drinking at a population level through a hierarchical modeling of binge drinking frequency and intensity from 1997 to 2006 across the United States (Chapter 6). Taken together, those findings can help to build the foundations for an inter-disciplinary approach to binge drinking and create specific micro-targeted prevention programs.",

      "abstract": "The differentiation of the self was examined in 7th, 9th, and 11th graders who generated self-descriptors for the following 4 different roles : self in the classroom, with friends, with parents, and in romantic relationships. The findings revealed that the self becomes increasingly differentiated into role-related multiple selves with age. A central focus was on intrapsychic and affective consequences of opposing role-related self-attributes (e.g., outgoing vs. shy, cheerful vs. depressed). Contradictions and conflict were lowest in early adolescence, peaked in middle adolescence, and then began to decline in later adolescence. From a neo-Piagetian perspective, though the young adolescent can construct single abstractions about the self, he or she cannot yet simultaneously compare these abstractions in order to experience opposing attributes. During midadolescence, one develops the ability to compare but not resolve contradictory self-attributes. In later adolescence, the capacity to coordinate, resolve, and normalize seemingly contradictory attributes emerges, reducing the experience of conflict within one's self-theory",

      "title": "Narcissism as a Consideration When Designing Health and Risk Messages",
      "abstract": "Narcissism is a personality trait characterized by perceptions of grandiosity, superiority, and the need for attention and admiration. There has been an increase in focus on examining the development of narcissism and how the trait influences a range of social and health behaviors. A key feature of narcissism is that it is characterized by high self-esteem with a simultaneously fragile ego that requires continual monitoring and manipulation. Therefore, much of the behaviors narcissists engage in are linked to the drive to maintain perceptions of superiority and grandiosity. In the area of health and well-being, narcissism has been positively correlated with psychological health, a relationship that may be accounted for by self-esteem. However, there has been less research on the relationship between narcissism and physical health and well-being. There is some evidence that narcissism is linked to a variety of physical appearance-oriented health behaviors (i.e., behaviors that could affect body weight or other aspects of physical appearance, including eating and exercise). Narcissism has also been positively linked to risk-taking behaviors, including use of substances, as well as risks that could significantly impact others, including sexual behaviors and risky driving. The relationship between narcissism and health is therefore complex, with some positive correlates (e.g., physical activity), but also various health risk behaviors. In considering how narcissism might interact with health messages, communicators have to keep in mind that narcissists seem to have some deficits in judgment and decision-making, such as overconfidence and a narrow focus on rewards associated with behaviors. Their behaviors tend to be driven by managing their own ego and by drawing attention and admiration from others to maintain perceptions of superiority and grandiosity. In turn, health communicators may need to rely on creative strategies that tap into these domains of narcissism in order to effectively modify health behaviors among narcissistic individuals. Further research on the influence of narcissism in healthcare seeking and related preventive behaviors would also help to provide a more detailed understanding for how the trait influences health decisions, information that would be useful for both health researchers and practitioners.",

This is a form of learning which differs from others in that it is more permanent, generalizes to all situations, and exists in conflict with the rest of the personality. A number of investigations are reported showing that introjection takes place for some children, but not others, particularly from the same‐sexed parent, and when there is a warm and dependent relationship. Several attempts to explain introjection in simpler terms are considered; it is concluded that the most plausible accounts are that parents persuade and teach children to react to their own behaviour in certain ways, and that two‐person interaction may lead to fantasied anticipation of the other's reactions.",

      "title": "Theoretical models and neural mechanisms of prosocial risky behavior",
      "abstract": "<p indent=\"0mm\">The risk-taking tendency in human decision-making is not entirely negative. It can be positive and pro-social when the purpose is beneficial to others or society. Recently, several scholars have investigated and compared the internal mechanisms of the generation and development of individual negative risk and positive prosocial behaviors using research methods from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience. They found overlapping neural circuits, thus, they proposed the concept of prosocial risky behavior. This term refers to the dual positive nature of individual risk-taking and prosocial tendencies in a given behavior. It provides a theoretical premise for the tendency of harmful human behavior to shift in a positive direction. Prosocial risky behavior is risk-taking for the benefit of others or for general social welfare. It is dangerous yet prosocial. Thus, it often alternates with risky negative behavior. Prosocial risky behavior is difficult to identify in everyday life. However, to some extent it shows the hallmarks of positive, healthy human development. For prosocial risky behavior, the current research is scattered, lacking systematic classification. Previous studies have interpreted only its mechanisms and neural basis regarding risk or social preference. Some previous studies have regarded prosocial risky behavior as simple prosocial behavior, focusing primarily on the influence of risk factors (risk preferences). Other researchers regarded prosocial risky behavior as simple risk-taking behavior, mainly focusing on prosocial motivation’s influence (social preferences). Less so, with this concern, but special social behavior. This study’s objective is to examine the concept of prosocial risky behavior, including its definition and measurement. It aims to achieve an integrated view of prosocial behavior and risk behavior, and clarify their connection from the perspective of risk and social preferences in the evolution of prosocial risky behavior. A novel theoretical model of prosocial risky behavior is constructed. Furthermore, the study provides a detailed explanation of the neural basis and temporal processing characteristics of prosocial risky behavior. Future research should clarify the psychological structure of prosocial risky behavior, optimize its paradigm, and compare framing effect features and their cognitive neural mechanisms, specifically with reference to economics and social decision-making. In addition, future research should explore the characteristics and developmental rules of prosocial risky behavior across the lifespan related to: Decision-makers, decision-making objects, and decision situations. This effort could deepen our understanding of its characteristics and mechanisms and reveal how the framing effect works in prosocial risky behavior. In addition, it should clarify its potential neural mechanisms providing a practical and reliable empirical basis for verifying a theoretical model of prosocial risky behavior. Simultaneously, it has important, instructive theoretical implications for the stimulation of prosocial risky behavior and the promotion of individual performance.",

      "abstract": "A navigation system is not normally changed for social reasons. When changes are made, they are intended to meet new or more stringent requirements, to utilize technological advances, to increase efficiency, to improve safety, or to extend the functions which can be fulfilled. Innovations are evaluated according to their technical feasibility and cost. Not only have social factors failed to influence the nature of changes, but the social implications of changes have also been ignored. Yet greater benefit would often accrue from changes if their social effects were predicted and allowed for. Such predictions are usually feasible. Social problems in navigation systems are gradually becoming more severe. In the past, man could often compensate for their effects because his role remained sufficiently dominant for him to be innovative and flexible in resolving difficulties, and he retained a full understanding of the system and control over it. More recent aids tend to curtail human communication, restrict the nature of teamwork, and reduce the social aspects of such functions as consultation, supervision, and verification. Man-machine relationships are emphasized, instead of relationships between people. Each man tends to be more remote from his colleagues, and to know less about what they are doing. These effects are generally incidental rather than the reflection of a deliberate policy.",

Some studies suggest that infants who are \"securely attached\" to their mothers are more confident and better able to explore both objects and peers, and to make new social relationships. The increase in social behaviour in pre-school children was first documented by Parten. Whatever the difficulties of proof, many psychologists believe that social skills training may be useful for those children who lack friends; this training is anyway usually directed to changing behaviours that are the correlates of peer rejection. Children differ in popularity and some less popular children may have less adequate social skills. Sex hormones may have some effect on behaviour. In normal foetal development male sex hormones perhaps predispose boys to become more physically active and interested in rough-and-tumble play.",

      "abstract": "Criminal behavior undermines both social and individual security. Exploring the motivational process in criminal acts focuses on searching for the sources of these acts and determining the factors that sustain criminal activity. Crime is not a homogeneous phenomenon, which makes the motives for crime diverse and complex.&#x0D; Criminological theories explore the causal factors of crime such as biological (including genetic), sociological (social), and psychological. A criminal act can be caused by an unformed drive, frustration, and be learned, including through following others. In the process of determining the motives for criminal behavior, it is not enough to point to direct motives because motivation should be approached as a process, which indicates the possibility of the development of motives over a certain time, and even many years. Thus, it is necessary to take into account socialization, personality traits (the level of aggressiveness, directiveness, and dominance), psychological needs (especially those unmet), and values, which, in a sense of responsibility, often can be considered anti-values.&#x0D; The major crimes against health and life are homicide, fights, and battery. In addition to ordinary murder, the Polish Penal Code lists aggravated murder (e.g., with extraordinary cruelty or as a result of motives deserving special condemnation) and privileged murder (committed under the influence of strong agitation justified by the circumstances), which can also be referred to as murder of passion. Fights and battery can be committed with or without the use of a dangerous object.&#x0D; A review of the literature indicates the following motives for homicide: robbery (economic), sexual, emotional, delusional, revenge, threat, insult, sense of harm, and jealousy. Perpetrators of fights and battery may be characterized by component factors of antisocial personality disorder as specified by DSM-5, such as non-compliance with legal and social norms, impulsivity, irritability, aggression, irresponsibility, and lack of guilt.&#x0D; In the case of crimes against life and health, it seems reasonable to identify several motives for the act. Motives are assessed primarily by a clinical interview. However, it should be taken into account that the perpetrators of these acts, for a variety of reasons, may obstruct justice.",

      "title": "ON THE DEFINITIONS AND FUNCTIONS OF DOMINANCE AND TERRITORIALITY",
      "abstract": "Summary 1. Dominance/subordinance is a relationship between two individuals in which one defers to the other in contest situations. Each such relationship represents an adaptive compromise for each individual in which the benefits and costs of giving in or not giving in are compared. Familiar associates in groups or neighbours on nearby territories may develop relatively stable dominant‐subordinate relationships based on individual recognition. Although the aggressive aspects of dominance are usually emphasized, the less conspicuous actions of the subordinate individual are actually more important in maintaining a stable relationship. 2. In evolutionary terms, dominance essentially equals priority of access to resources in short supply. Usually the subordinate, who would probably lose in combat anyway, is better off to bide its time until better able to compete at another time or another place. Both individuals save time, energy, and the risk of injury by recognizing and abiding by an established dominant‐subordinate relationship. 3. Dominance can be either absolute or predictably reversible in different locations or at different times. Of the various forms of dominance behaviour, rank hierarchies and territoriality represent the two extremes of absolute and relative dominance, respectively. A dominance hierarchy is the sum total of the adaptive compromises made between individuals in an aggregation or organized group. Many animals seem to be capable of both absolute and relative dominance, and within species‐specific limits the balance may shift toward one or the other. High density, or a decrease in available resources, favours a shift from relative to absolute dominance. Some species may exhibit both simultaneously. Social mammals may have intra‐group hierarchies and reciprocal territoriality between groups, while the males of lek species may exhibit ‘polarized territoriality’ by defending small individual territories, with the most dominant males holding the central territories where most of the mating takes place. 4. Territoriality is a form of space‐related dominance. Most biologists agree that its most important function is to provide the territory holder with an assured supply of critical resources. Territoriality is selected for only when the individual's genetic fitness is increased because its increased access to resources outweighs the time, energy, and injury costs of territorial behaviour. 5. Territoriality was first defined narrowly as an area from which conspecifics are excluded by overt defence or advertisement. The definition has been variously expanded to include all more or less exclusive areas without regard to possible defence, and finally to include all areas in which the owner is dominant. I define territory as a fixed portion of an individual's or group's range in which it has priority of access to one or more critical resources over others who have priority elsewhere or at another time. This priority of access must be achieved through social interaction. 6. My definition excludes dominance over individual space and moving resources, and includes areas of exclusive use maintained by mutual avoidance. It differs from most other definitions in its explicit recognition of time as a territorial parameter and its rejection of exclusivity and overt defence as necessary components of territorial behaviour. There is an indivisible continuum of degrees of trespass onto territories, and functionally it is priority of access to resources that is important rather than exclusive occupancy. 7. There is a similarly indivisible continuum in the intensity of behaviour needed to achieve priority of access to resources. Deciding whether or not an exclusive area is defended leads to the pointless exercise of trying to decide which cues indicating the owner's presence are conspicuous enough to merit being called defence. Concentrating on overt defence emphasizes the aggressive aspects of territorial behaviour rather than the equally or more important submissive aspects such as passive avoidance.",

It is an ultimate means of finding meaning and a system of values; and it is a sign of the adolescent’s active resistance and his attempts to find his place in the world again. It contrasts with the far more insidious risk of depression and the radical collapse of meaning. In spite of the suffering it engenders, risk-taking nevertheless has a positive side, fostering independence in adolescents and a search for reference points, it leads to a better self-image and is a means of developing one’s identity. It is nonetheless painful in terms of its possible repercussions: injuries, death or addiction. But let us not forget that the suffering is upstream, perpetuated by a complex relation between a society, a family structure and a life history. Paradoxically, for some young people who are suffering, the risk is rather that they will remain immured in their world-weariness, with a potentially radical outcome (i.e. suicide). The turbulence caused by risk-taking behaviours illustrates a determination to be rid of one’s suffering and to fight on so that life can, at last, be lived.",

      "abstract": "Loneliness is a pressing global health crisis. A combination of close and not close ties (i.e., weak ties) is optimal to combat loneliness and improve psychological and physical health. The literature has not differentiated among weak ties, however. We identify possible categories of weak ties along a spectrum from passing strangers to the edge of friendship. We propose that one type of weak tie, which we term \"fringeships,\" may provide unique benefits for well-being compared to other weak ties. Fringeships sit on the edge of close ties and are characterized by: a) regular contact in specific settings; b) volitional and mutual recognition of the connection; c) freedom from obligations that characterize close ties or formalities that characterize many types of weak ties; and d) a degree of shared affection and fondness. Fringeships engage in a balance of small talk and personal disclosure. We speculate on the potential benefits of fringeships, the contexts in which they are likely to arise, and individual differences in the propensity to develop them.

Sexual response often is considered only in isolation as a reflection of good general health or relevant solely for reproduction. Yet, altered responsiveness to sexual rewards is evident in a number of affective disorders not limited to sexual difficulties. Sexual stimulation has been neglected for its potential to treat a range of general physical and mental health problems. Relative to other emotion sciences, sexual psychophysiology is underdeveloped. The chapter reviews how sexual responses are affected in general emotional disorders, then attempts to distinguish these, often unsuccessfully, from related sexual difficulties.",

      "title": "Parent-Child Speech and Child Custody Speech Restrictions",
      "abstract": "The best interests of the child standard -- the standard rule applied in custody disputes between two parents -- leaves family court judges ample room to consider a parent's ideology. Parents have had their rights limited or denied partly based on their advocacy of racism, homosexuality, adultery, nonmarital sex, Communism, Nazism, pacifism and disrespect for the flag, fundamentalism, polygamy, or religions that make it hard for children to fit in the western way of life in this society. Courts have also penalized or enjoined speech that expressly or implicitly criticizes the other parent, even when the speech has a broader ideological dimension. One parent, for instance, was ordered to make sure that there is nothing in the religious upbringing or teaching that the minor child is exposed to that can be considered homophobic, because the other parent was homosexual. Others have lost rights based partly on telling their children that the other parent was damned to Hell. One mother was stripped of custody partly because she accurately told her 12-year-old daughter that her ex-husband, who had raised the daughter from birth, wasn't in fact the girl's biological father. Courts have also restricted a parent's religious speech when such speech was seen as inconsistent with the religious education that the custodial parent was providing. The cases generally rest on the theory (sometimes pure speculation, sometimes based on some evidence in the record) that the children will become confused and unhappy by the contradictory teachings, and be less likely to take their parents' authority seriously. This article argues these restrictions are generally unconstitutional, except when they're narrowly focused on preventing one parent from undermining the child's relationship with the other. But the observations that lead to this rule are likely, I think, to prove more interesting to readers than the rule itself: (1) The best interests test lets courts engage in viewpoint-based speech restriction. (2) The First Amendment is implicated not only when courts issue orders restricting parents' speech, but also when courts make custody or visitation decisions based on such speech. (3) Even when the cases involve religious speech, the Free Speech Clause is probably more important than the Religion Clauses. (4) If parents in intact families have First Amendment rights to speak to their children, without the government restricting the speech under a best interests standard, then parents in broken families generally deserve the same rights. (5) Parents in intact families should indeed be free to speak to their children -- but not primarily because of their self-expression rights, or their children's interests in hearing the parents' views. Rather, the main reason to protect parental speech rights is that today's child listeners will grow up into the next generation's adult speakers. (6) Attempts to limit restrictions to speech that imminently threatens likely psychological harm (or even cause actual psychological harm) to children may seem appealing, but will likely prove unhelpful.",

      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the analysis of subjective causes of loneliness in the different social behavior patterns of a person. It was assumed that among adolescents with deviant behavior, the subjective causes of their loneliness primarily included violation of contacts with their family and immediate relatives. To determine the level of subjective loneliness, the researchers applied the questionnaire developed by D. Russell and M. Ferguson, and in order to analyze the content of subjective causes - the modified methodology of unfinished sentences by L. Sachs and V. Levi. It was established that teenagers with different social orientations were inclined to experience loneliness. The explicitness and level of loneliness are found to be similar in the group of teenagers with deviant and prosocial behavior. Teenagers with different behaviour patterns clearly differentiate the causes of loneliness into social and personal ones. Among the causes of loneliness they include problems with communication in the family, with friends, peers, loved ones and their immediate environment. Teenagers with deviant behaviour are more likely than those with prosocial behaviour to see the source of loneliness in communicating with others and less likely to recognize personal qualities as a subjective cause of alienation. They see separation from the family, misunderstanding and neglect of current needs on the part of parents and family members as the main source of loneliness. Loneliness of teenagers with prosocial behaviour is associated with a reluctance to solve their own problems using the advice and life experience of their parents.",

      "abstract": "The development of attachment during the perinatal and/or postnatal periods between a child their mother, father and family as whole can be observed. This attachment provides the child with the safety and security feelings and may provide satisfaction to the mother and other family members. In children with physical and mental developmental disability, attachment may be challenged immediately after birth. It is typically recovered after a certain period. The authors describe the development of attachment of family members to children with somatic, mental or social disability based on an analysis of nine case reports. They conclude that the attachment of parents/mothers to their child with a disability is typically established after a certain period of time only. In the first period, there is a caregiving attitude of the mother even though the period of the origination of this tie takes place later. The mother is most frequently the person establishing attachment. However, this is not always the rule. In our cases, there were two fathers, who made the attachment earlier than respective mothers. Attachment was also evident in some grandparents and siblings. The parents, mostly the fathers, can lose the attachment established. Analysis of the degree of attachment to the child by parents may be complicated due to difficulty in assessing the extent and degree of the attachment of children with severe disabilities to their parents.",

It then draws on examples from empirical human genetic studies by the author and his colleagues in order to suggest that the concept of genes for human personality traits nevertheless does have some validity, and also that we may be on the brink of discovering genes with major effects on human personality. This possibility, in particular its ethical aspects, has aroused some public concern. It is suggested that confidential information about an individual's genes does not differ in principle from other confidential information about him or her, and that the ability (currently theoretical) to affect genes and their expression, temporarily or permanently, does not differ ethically from our current ability to affect other aspects of an individual's physical and psychological functioning. Genes for potential offspring, contained in ova and sperm cells, constitute a special case.",

      "title": "Lay theories of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism",
      "abstract": "Abstract In public discourse, narcissism is often portrayed one-sidedly and overly negative, rendering a picture of narcissistic individuals as “toxic people” or “evil characters”. Beyond these salient associations, psychological theories point to a more complex phenomenon, and different developmental mechanisms are being discussed in relation to it. We investigated the prevalence of different implicit theories on narcissism including beliefs about its developmental antecedents. We put forward the question whether grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic behaviors are regarded as congruent or incongruent expressions of underlying feelings and motives, that is whether grandiose behavior is attributed to underlying grandiosity or underlying vulnerability, and vice versa. Results of an online survey ( N = 177) show higher agreement with congruent rather than incongruent theories (i.e., grandiose narcissism is attributed to feelings of superiority rather than inferiority, vulnerable narcissism is attributed to inferiority rather than superiority). In line with this, participants displayed predominant beliefs in parental overvaluation as a developmental antecedent of grandiose narcissism/parental coldness as an antecedent of vulnerable narcissism. With higher self-reported prior knowledge of narcissism, endorsement of theories assuming incongruencies increased. The likability of narcissism was not associated with endorsement of the different implicit theories, but instead with perceivers’ own narcissism levels. Results suggest that laypeople employ an “it is what it seems” – heuristic facing both grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic behaviors and are less likely to attribute grandiose or vulnerable behavior to incongruent motivational states. Findings might help to better understand the public image of narcissism and its social consequences.",

We are now a long way from the Victorian, moralistic, judgemental view that masturbation must not take place because it is wrong. Temporary feelings of guilt are a normal reaction to masturbation; it is when this guilt seriously interferes with the person's whole life that we should take it as a 'danger sign'. Most male adolescents are normally more open about this activity and about some of the fears or worries accompanying it. Some female adolescents deal with it in a different way from males, and it is not unusual for girls not to have the conscious wish to masturbate at all. For a girl, this could be quite a normal reaction, whereas in the case of a boy we would see such a reaction as much more related to 'danger signs' either now or at some time in the future.",

The experience has often been described in literature, and in recent years has been the object of extensive gerontological research under the label ‘life review’. Such memories often include a reversal of judgment about a past act, relationship, event, etc. What earlier was judged to be so is, in the retrospect of late life, judged not to have been so after all. This presents a question: which judgment—the earlier or the later—has better epistemological credentials in such cases? Some obvious possible answers are considered and rejected. It would seem that the issue is not resolvable on epistemological grounds. A parallel dilemma seems to appear in other dimensions of experience. An example from aesthetic experience is briefly considered.",

It is proposed to consider the present state of knowledge as well as to indicate the historical and social basis for any tendencies for Jews to suffer from, or perhaps to resist, some diseases. No attempt has been made to analyse every single report in which Jewish pre-disposition to various diseases is mentioned; attention will be focused on those conditions that have received greater attention or from which it is possible to draw meaningful conclusions.",

      "title": "Substance Use After Release from Prison",
      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the substantial proportion of prisoners globally who have a history of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and dependence. Incarceration usually provides a period of abstinence or reduced substance use, but this reduction is often transientand many ex-prisoners rapidly return to pre-incarceration levels of substance use. Substance use after release from prison is affected by both individual factors, such as substance use history and personal expectations, and interpersonal factors, such as social networks. Released prisoners often return to environments in which drugs are readily available and substance use is accepted or normative. Structural factors, such as poor access to substance use treatment and other health services, unstable housing and limited employment options, can create additional stressors that increase the risk of harmful substance use. Given the paucity of epidemiological evidence, the natural history of substance use after release from prison remains poorly understood. In particular, there is a dearth of evidence relating to resumption of alcohol, tobacco, and non-injecting illicit drug use following release from prison. Furthermore, although substance use in ex-prisoners is affected by structural and interpersonal factors, interventions to address problematic substance use typically focus on the individual. Additional research in this area is urgently needed to inform evidence-based policies and interventions.",

These expectations are dashed however, if their qualifications and work experience, gained in their home countries, are not recognised as legitimate by potential employers and accreditation bodies. This type of social situation is the focus of Relative Deprivation Theory in which relative deprivation is defined as having a perception that an expectation has been dishonoured (the cognitive component) and possessing feelings of injustice, dissatisfaction and discontent at this dishonouring (affective component). Relative Deprivation may take one of two forms. Egoistic Relative Deprivation results when a person feels that he or she has been unjustly deprived relative to other individuals. The result of this is stress and lower life satisfaction. On the other hand, Collective Relative Deprivation, which forms the basis of this article, results when a person feels that his or her group is unjustly deprived relative to other social groups. The result of this is the basis for collective or group actions. Put simply, Relative Deprivation Theory specifies (and empirical evidence has substantiated) that affective relative deprivation is the proximal cause of engagement in protest action, which fully mediates the more distal effects of Cognitive Relative Deprivation.",

      "abstract": "There is clear evidence that the mother's stress, anxiety, or depression during pregnancy can alter the development of her fetus and her child, with an increased risk for later psychopathology. We are starting to understand some of the underlying mechanisms including the role of the placenta, gene-environment interactions, epigenetics, and specific systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and cytokines. In this review we also consider how these effects may be different, and potentially exacerbated, in different parts of the world. There can be many reasons for elevated prenatal stress, as in communities at war. There may be raised pregnancy-specific anxiety with high levels of maternal and infant death. There can be raised interpersonal violence (in Afghanistan 90.2% of women thought that \"wife beating\" was justified compared with 2.0% in Argentina). There may be interactions with nutritional deficiencies or with extremes of temperature. Prenatal stress alters the microbiome, and this can differ in different countries. Genetic differences in different ethnic groups may make some more vulnerable or more resilient to the effects of prenatal stress on child neurodevelopment. Most research on these questions has been in predominantly Caucasian samples from high-income countries. It is now time to understand more about prenatal stress and psychopathology, and the role of both social and biological differences, in the rest of the world.",

Three- and 4-year-olds monitor the accuracy or knowledge of informants, including those that are familiar. They prefer to seek and endorse information provided by someone who has proved accurate in the past rather than someone who has made mistakes or acknowledged ignorance. Future research is likely to pinpoint other heuristics that children use to filter incoming testimony and may reveal more generalized patterns of trust and mistrust among individual children.",

Recent theoretical and clinical developments in traumatology have highlighted the interpretative nature of the trauma response. This chapter examines the many symbolic meanings that are frequently assigned to a pregnancy experience and its manner of termination. Clinical experience working with individuals traumatized by pregnancy loss/interruption and a synthesis of the literature pertaining to theories of attachment, toss, grief, and trauma suggest a theory regarding the traumatogenic capacity of pregnancy loss/interruption. Contrary to many popular beliefs, attachment between parent and child begins in pregnancy, not at birth. Ambivalent feelings toward and projections of negative self-concept upon a child at any stage in the child's life may be viewed as potential precursors to child abuse. Ambiguity in relationships has long been studied as a source of stress in families and individuals.",

Particularly in the realm of sexual functioning, interacting psychological and physiological factors are always operating. Sexual disorders are divided into those that have been lifelong (called “primary”) and those that developed during adulthood (“secondary”). In addition, there are three general categories of difficulties: disorders of desire, disorders of arousal, and difficulty attaining orgasm. Many medications, including psychoactive medications, can affect sexual appetite and/or sexual performance significantly. Healthcare professionals should look up the possible sexual side effects of each medication that a patient is taking. The evaluation of an individual with sexual problems requires a sophisticated integration of knowledge from many areas, as biological, psychological, and social forces all strongly influence sexual functioning. Establishing a safe, non-judgmental interview setting will facilitate frank discussion of sensitive, private sexual matters.",

Stigma was experienced directly from others; it could be assumed or perceived; and bereaved family members sometimes stigmatised themselves. Their grief was often disenfranchised, with others – including professionals and other bereaved people – assuming the deceased was not worth grieving. Family members therefore had to decide whether or not to reveal to others that drugs or alcohol were implicated in the death. However, stigma could be mitigated by its opposite: kindness from those encountered after the death. Drawing on theories concerning the end of life, bereavement and emotional labour, the chapter analyses the relationship between stigma and kindness. Stigma entails stereotyping, othering and disgust, each of which has emotional and cognitive aspects; kindness entails identification and fellow feeling. Small acts of kindness displayed by practitioners were valued highly.",

There are many myths surrounding ageing and sexuality fuelled by assumptions that libido and sexual needs decline along with the loss of culturally valued signs of beauty or handsomeness. By 75–85 years of age, only one-quarter of the population is sexually active; the reasons for this are many and include psychosocial factors such as loss of a partner, age-related physiological changes and illness. In older women, the major problems are reduced libido, poor lubrication and inability to climax. In males, erectile dysfunction is the central problem. Health problems are the major reason for a decline in sexuality with ageing. Drugs for the management of erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors) and new delivery systems to treat low libido (patches, nasal, gels, injections of testosterone) are revolutionizing sexuality in older persons. There is increased awareness of the special needs of the older homosexual. Paraphilias are life-long and do not necessarily disappear with ageing. Management of inappropriate and aggressive sexual behaviours in older persons with dementia is a major problem.",

It is worth noting that such phases, while they may be appropriate for considering sexual development, are not the best way of looking at ego and superego development, nor at the development of relationships with others—matters dealt with later in the lectures. Any prohibition given to the child during the time of infantile sexuality can remain as an inhibition or develop into an inhibition, and can hold up adult sexuality; this does not mean that freedom given to infantile sexuality guarantees normality in the adult—far from it. There was no way of understanding from the theory of sex life, as it existed then, where all the many abnormalities of sex life come from. Even in those times, children before the age of adolescence or preadolescence were known to show sexual reactions and to have genital interests.",

      "abstract": "F or the chronic pain sufferer, sexual expression may become distorted, inhibited, sublimated, alienated, demanding or fearful-patterns frequently seen in people who view sexual activity as a duty or a means of procreation. The idea that sexual activity will cause, precipitate, or aggravate the pain may yield reluctance to participate, thus further anxiety and depression, which can diminish sexual function. Yet the human need and desire for sexual warmth is not negated by pain. Sexuality does not stop when pain strikes, it merely changes. Some form of sexual expression is possible for, and the right of any, regardless of disability, according to Weinberg(1). Although illnesses and surgical procedures may produce sexual difficulties, none have more devastating effects than diseases of the neuromuscular system(2). Any impairment of parasympathetic nerve activity, or loss of muscular and/or skeletal movement-such as with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, or arthritis-can involve sexual dysfunction. The most difficult position for people with restrictive movement is the one most frequently used for intercourse. Although the male-on-top position allows good vocal and visual communication, a female with arthritis may be unable to abduct and rotate her hips for the supine position(3). Alternative sidelying and rear-entry positions may be less strenuous and may ease the partner's fear of causing pain. Major tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, and narcotics are a major part of some pain treatments but a diminished libido and potency are common side effects. Patients need to be informed about these effects and should be helped in timing their doses.

Thus, the sexuality of people with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) is unde\u0002niable, even though the degree of intellectual commitment can influence the ability to mani\u0002fest and experience affective-sexual bonds. Stigma is a physical, mental or social mark that can be innate, acquired or attributed, and that puts the person who bears it in social disrepute. However, there is the stigma which is attributed to her from the moment that something different is perceived in her and society has attributed a negative mark to this difference. Imbued with this understanding, this study aimed to discuss the stigmas and prejudices that permeate the sexuality of people with intellectual disabilities, understanding it as an important attribute for social inclusion. We used as methodology the review of literature and documents on this subject, seeking re-reading, analysis and systematization in order to produce other possible contributions to debate. The results showed that: a) the belief that people with ID are asexual when they are not seen as infantile is still common, and b) the sexual behaviors of people with ID are considered inappropriate and/or problematic. We conclude that most reinforcement of prejudice about the sexuality of people with disabilities is directly related to the way society understands and recognizes differences and to the standards that define and establish normality.",

      "title": "The Personal Name Problem and a Data Mining Solution",
      "abstract": "Almost every person has a life-long personal name which is officially recognised and has only one correct version in their language. Each personal name typically has two components/parts: a first name (also known as given, fore, or Christian name) and a last name (also known as family name or surname). Both these name components are strongly influenced by cultural, economic, historical, political, and social backgrounds. In most cases, each of these two components can have more than a single word and the first name is usually gender-specific. (see Figure 1). There are three important practical considerations for personal name analysis: • Balance between manual checking and analytical computing. Intuitively, a small proportion of names should be manually reviewed, the result has to be reasonably accurate, and each personal name should not take too long to be processed. • Reliability of the verification data has to be examined. By keeping the name verification database's updating process separate from incoming names, it can prevent possible data manipulation/corruption over time. However, the incompatibility of names in databases can also be caused by genuine reasons as such as cultural and historical traditions, translation and transliteration, reporting and recording variations, and typographical and phonetic errors (Borgman and Siegfried, 1992).

      "title": "Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly",
      "abstract": "Elder abuse is a global problem with an estimated 10% of older people experiencing some form of abuse although many cases remain unreported and/or not referred to social services. As such, the true extent of elder abuse is relatively unknown, and this poses significant challenges given recent demographic changes with people living longer. Maltreatment of older people, commonly referred to as elder abuse, is multidimensional and includes psychological, physical, sexual abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Elder abuse exists within a socio-ecological context with influences at the level of the individual, families, communities and society. The complex interplay between factors influencing elder abuse is challenging. Elder abuse may involve one or more types of abuse and may occur as a single or repeated act. A confounding problem is that those who carry out the abuse are often someone the older person knows well, such as partners, family members and friends. It may also be carried out by service providers who older people rely on in institutional and health care settings. In institutions or health care settings, elder abuse is most likely if staff lack education and training and/or there are inadequate resources to meet the care and support needs of older people. The outcomes from elder abuse are numerous and may result in poorer health, physical injuries, psychological morbidity and premature death. Due to the significant morbidity and premature mortality which may result from elder abuse, the physical, psychosocial and economic costs of elder abuse are considerable. Primary, secondly and tertiary interventions exist to address elder abuse. However, it is unclear what are the most effective interventions to prevent or reduce elder abuse across the diversity of settings. Given the wide range of possible elder abuse interventions and the lack of population knowledge about these, it is important to assess their possible benefits, effectiveness and any implications. The overall aim was to establish the effectiveness of primary, secondary and tertiary intervention programmes to prevent and/or reduce the occurrence of elder abuse in any setting (organizational, institutional and/or community settings). A further objective was to identify whether the interventions' effects were modified by types of abuse, types of participants, setting of intervention or cognitive status of older people (Baker, Francis, Hairi, Othman, & Choo, 2016). Participants in randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized trials, and quasi-RCTs, before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series were older people (age over 60) and those who care for them. Studies eligible for inclusion included methods of preventing or reducing re-occurrence of elder abuse and required to have a minimum of 12 weeks of follow up. Elder abuse interventions were classified as any strategies intended to avoid potential abuse or its re-occurrence in home, communities and institutions. Examples of these interventions included those designed to improve the quality of care and living situations of older people and those designed to improve long-term care. Interventions included those which sought to increase detection of abuse, raised awareness of elder abuse amongst the public and professionals, provided victim support and delivered training for care providers. The researchers also sought to determine whether programmes of a greater intensity were more effective. Seven studies, four from the United States, one from Taiwan and two from the United Kingdom (all classed as high income countries) were included. A total of 1942 older participants and 740 other people (e.g., family carers and staff) were involved. Three studies focussed on education and prevention interventions for health care professionals and caregivers. One study aimed to improve the mental health of carers in order to reduce abuse in persons with dementia, and one study focussed on the detection of abuse compared with a control arm focused on preventing elder abuse. One offered a psychosocial group intervention to support victims of abuse and one examined a multi-agency/public health approach. There was some evidence of increased knowledge and improved attitudes to elder abuse; however, results were mixed, whether these strategies were successful in detecting and preventing elder abuse. Overall, there was uncertainty as to the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse due to the heterogeneity in the settings, measures and effects reported in the seven included studies. The teaching of coping skills appeared helpful to reduce anxiety and depression of family member carers, although it was unknown whether this led to less abuse. Interventions targeting re-occurrence may possibly result in a detrimental effect. Of the four interventions deemed as higher intensity, only one low quality study showed some effect. Review authors were unable to draw any firm conclusions as to the effects of elder abuse interventions on any of the main outcomes compared with control/standard care. The seven studies were of low methodological quality with only one study judged to have no domains at low risk of bias. Although raising awareness of elder abuse, it is unclear if educational interventions can aid detection and prevent elder abuse. Blending education and support for victims may improve reporting but the evidence was equivocal. The reviewers identified some potential for service planning interventions to improve awareness of the need for meticulous assessment and documentation of elder abuse. Teaching coping skills to family members of the elderly with dementia is a promising approach. Programmes need to be carefully evaluated, as there is a risk for inadvertent harm. The present evidence does not support the approach of simply doing more of a program, or more in combination. More research is required as the current evidence base offers little guidance for nurses as to the best approaches to prevent and detect elder abuse. The review identified forthcoming research, but even so, given the breadth of the definition of elder-abuse and possible strategies, the evidence remains scarce. Elder abuse is a societal problem which can take various forms, may be carried out by those whom older people are reliant on and can be invisible. The findings of this review suggest that education interventions may improve attitudes to elder abuse but there is little evidence that such interventions have a positive impact on the prevention or reduction of elder abuse. A significant challenge for nurses is that elder abuse may be carried out by people well known to the older person or colleagues. Therefore, nurses need to be alert to the possibilities of elder abuse and have a duty of care to investigate if they have concerns. Nurses in the community or institutional care provide care for older people. They are therefore well placed to be alert to the possibility of elder abuse. Building a relationship with the older person and their family alongside impeccable assessment is important. Given education and training has been shown to change attitudes such training is important and staff need to be aware of policies around elder abuse. From an organizational perspective, the knowledge that the pressures of inadequate resources also positively correlate with an increase in elder abuse should be considered in the management of organizational risk. Given that family members often struggle with caring for elderly people with dementia, teaching coping skills appears a promising approach. Each situation should be evaluated to ensure that the actions are not resulting in detrimental effects. Furthermore, this review highlights the need to consider not only the responsibilities of individuals and organizations but also that of wider society in preventing and tackling the issue of elder abuse. In the absence of robust research evidence, it is recommended that primary, secondary and tertiary interventions continue to be funded, provided and engaged with in order that they may be fully evaluated.",

After a filler task, they categorized as seen or novel the original set of faces intermixed with a new set. Findings showed an Own Age Bias for novel young faces but no evidence that emotion eliminates it. Recognition accuracy was better for emotional faces, but the two factors did not interact. Importantly, low loneliness was linked to an Own Age Bias for novel happy faces. These findings are discussed in the context of current theoretical accounts of the Own Age Bias and of the effects of loneliness on attention and memory.",

The present study uses longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; 1998-2016) to consider linkages of parental death, social isolation, and health (self-rated health, functional limitations) for Black, Hispanic, and White older adults. Findings suggest that exposure to parental death before later life is associated with higher levels of isolation, greater odds of fair/poor self-rated health, and more functional limitations in later life. Moreover, social isolation partially explains associations between parental bereavement and later-life health. Racial disparities in bereavement are central to disadvantage: Black and Hispanic adults are more likely to experience parent death early in the life course and this differential exposure to bereavement has implications for racial and ethnic disparities in social isolation and health throughout life.",

These conditions are very heterogeneous and can present in a variety of different ways, most commonly with ambiguous genitalia noticed in the newborn period or delayed puberty in adolescents. The impact of these disorders on the lives of these patients and their families should not be underestimated. These clinical situations can often be difficult to manage, particularly in those cases where the sex of rearing is uncertain. The needs of each individual patient presenting with DSD conditions must be fully considered, along with the needs of their families and where appropriate, cultural practices. The multidisciplinary team should be involved from early in the diagnosis and ethical principles must be considered at all stages of management of the condition. Key Concepts: Disorders of sex development usually present in the newborn or adolescent periods. There are three broad groups of DSD: sex chromosome DSD; 46,XY DSD and 46,XX DSD. Where there is uncertainty about the sex of a patient, sex assignment should be delayed until appropriate investigations have been carried out. A multidisciplinary team should be involved from an early stage. The psychosocial implications of a diagnosis of DSD must be considered for the family and the patient.",

      "title": "The Sexual Addiction Controversy: A Disorder or Not?",
      "abstract": "The status of sexual addiction as a mental disorder remains controversial.Regardless of the popularity of the term sexual addiction today, the fact is that the proposal of sexual addiction diagnosis has been unclear.This has sparked a debate among clinicians, there are clinicians who support the inclusion of sexual addiction as a mental disorder and clinicians who believe that sexual addiction should not be considered as a mental disorder.This paper aims to examine the evidence and arguments from both sides through literature review, so that it can be concluded whether sexual addiction is an independent mental disorder or not.Based on literature review that has been conducted, it can be concluded that declaring sexual addiction as an independent mental disorder is a statement that is still premature and has potential negative impacts, especially because the scientific boundaries that underlie the diagnosis are still unclear and inconsistent.Another reason is due to the fact that other psychological problems and emotional regulation problems often comorbid in patients who have excessive sexuality problems, so there is a possibility that what we have known as sexual addiction is actually only a manifestation of another mental disorder and is not an independent mental disorder.The contribution of this research is to clarify misunderstanding that happens among clinicians and society about the term sexual addiction, especially about its status that is not classified as a mental disorder.",

      "abstract": "Most often, sex therapists are used to seeing one partner with low sexual desire, along with his or her disgruntled mate. However, this couple accused one another of having low sexual desire. While the wife admitted her desire problem, she primarily blamed her husband's lack of passion for her decreased libido. The husband denied that he has low sexual desire for his wife. He claimed that he is extremely attracted to her, and that she continues to reject him. The treatment model integrated psychoanalytic conflict theory and psychodynamic systems theory. The hypothesis was that underlying loyalty conflicts emanating from each partner's family of origin have been primarily responsible for the couple's sexual symptoms, and therefore must be resolved in order to help the couple achieve a healthier sex life. Following 5 years of treatment, the couple did become closer and less volatile. They have also achieved great financial success. However, their sex life has not prospered to the couple's satisfaction; thus they have decided to continue treatment.",

      "abstract": "As we analyze Black male/female relationships, we find that there are numerous negative interpersonal relationship played that are destructive to sustaining a positive and healthy relationship. Most often, these games people play are responsible for the disintegration and disunity existing in Black male/ female relationships. Eric Berne, in his book Games People Play (1964) defines as a recurring set of transactions, often repetitions, superficially plausible, with a concealed motivation (conscious or unconscious) toward a hidden payoff. In a more colloquial term, he defines as a series of moves with a snare or gimmick. It is pertinent to emphasize that the played may be conscious or unconscious. That is, individuals may not be consciously aware of the they may be playing, and may be resistant to having those brought to consciousness by the nonplayer. Unconscious are probably the most destructive, in that the player is not aware of the unmet need being aroused, and those unconscious drives are brought into the relationship from early childhood relationships with parents and others.",

It is possible not to have recalled, or to forget having recalled, a memory for an extended period of time, but to remember it subsequently when presented with a retrieval cue. Some recovered memories, both actual and false, can lead to trauma symptoms. Heated debate over the validity of recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse and satanic ritual abuse led to the so‐called “Memory Wars.” It is well established that one can use hypnosis and other suggestive techniques to lead individuals to develop false memories. Recovered memories can become important to identity. Individuals have reported a wide variety of recovered memories, such as for alien abductions and for past lives.",

This complex psychical process explores, among other things, the quality of the father’s gaze which follows the evolution of the organization of genital sexuality in his adolescent daughter. This work deals with a rather neglected aspect of the relation between daughter and father. In the analytic treatment of adolescents weak fathers, absent or even violent,can often be the object of huge protective movements and positive judgments on the part of their daughters, who’ll do anything to place the paternal image on a pedestal. In these cases, the Œdipal father seems to have to be kept alive and promoted in order to fulfil his function sufficiently. Indeed, it is only under such conditions that the parricidal fantasy may be fully recognized, its symbolic value fully elaborated, and the Œdipal father can disappear over the horizon.",

There are no well-established or exhaustive explanations for the development of gender identity disorder. Gender identity appears to be established and influenced by psychosocial factors during the first few years of life. However, many authors have argued for biological factors, if not causative, may predispose an individual to a gender identity disorder. Because most gender dysphoric individuals have adamant requests for sex reassignment (many often already taking opposite-sex hormones supplied by other physicians), it is extremely difficult to engage the patients in treatment with anything other than surgical reassignment as the goal. However, because surgery is irreversible, it is important to engage these patients in psychotherapy, even if surgery is indicated. The therapist should be careful to base the goals of therapy on what is desired by the patient. Behavior therapy has been used to modify specific cross-gender behaviors of child with gender identity disorder.",

      "title": "Inﬂuences of the present on the past: The impact of interpretation on memory for abuse",
      "abstract": "Although the future may be open, it is tempting to think of the past as set. However, there is a sense in which the past too is changeable. New perspectives sometimes colour or even alter our view of the past. In some cases, new perspectives offer a deeper understanding of our own past experience. For example, in reflecting on what at the time seemed like a minor spat, an estranged spouse may look back and recognize unappreciated tensions. On other occasions a fresh perspective may distort memory. From the bitter vantage of a relationship gone awry, one might come to misconstrue innocent bickerings as the reflection of dark feelings that never actually occurred. If memories for prior social interactions are indeed influenced by present understanding then they may be particularly vulnerable when our understanding of the social relationship changes over time. Memory for sexual abuse may fall into this category. The label of \"sexual abuse\" is somewhat fuzzy, particularly as it is applied to oneself (Joslyn, Carlin, & Loftus, 1998). One could experience an abusive event, but not categorize it as such at the time. Later, if the experience is recalled in the context of abuse, it may be remembered quite differently than if it were recalled in some other context.",

      "abstract": "Un gran numero de victimas de abuso sexual infantil nunca revela su victimizacion y en otros muchos casos, la latencia de revelacion es de anos e incluso decadas. Aunque existen numerosos estudios sobre los factores que influyen en la revelacion, ninguna publicacion reciente en Espana recoge y sintetiza las evidencias cientificas disponibles sobre los factores relativos a las figuras de la victima, el abusador y la relacion entre ambos. En este trabajo se revisan diversos estudios y metaestudios sobre las razones que llevan a las victimas a mantener en secreto los abusos. A las dificultades que los ninos presentan en general para revelar un secreto, especialmente cuando implican a algun adulto o estan relacionados con aspectos sexuales, se anaden otros como la etapa evolutiva del desarrollo y el sexo del menor durante los abusos, la percepcion de responsabilidad y culpa y el miedo a las consecuencias, reales o imaginadas. La situacion de superioridad del abusador, las estrategias empleadas para acercarse o coaccionar a la victima y la relacion o el vinculo entre ellos son factores que dificultan la revelacion del abuso. Para explicar el fenomeno de la revelacion se acude a dos modelos basicos: el de la revelacion segun el Intercambio Social y el Cognitivo-Social, a partir de los cuales se propone un modelo interaccional y multidimensional. Los factores que inhiben la revelacion del abuso en las victimas constituyen un importante ambito de investigacion que puede contribuir a la prevencion, la deteccion y la intervencion en estos casos.",

The challenge of physical development, especially the demands of mature sexuality and the push to become free of dependence on parents during adolescence, places the individual in a critical situation, when he can either move forward or cling to infantile modes of functioning. We do not fully understand the smooth transition from adolescence to adulthood, but our work with disturbed individuals helps us to recognize some of the factors that interfere with this process. Before giving examples of disturbed individuals, I would like to spell out some of the special features of adolescent development.",

      "abstract": "Shyness and embarrassment are frequently encountered in everyday life, and expressions such as “he's come over all shy” or “I was so embarrassed I didn't know where to look” can readily conjure up for us the image of a person in some difficulty in a social encounter. In everyday talk we do not always make a sharp distinction between the two words, and sometimes they refer to much the same thing, so that to call someone shy is to say that he or she is easily embarrassed. Despite their ubiquity, it is only recently that these phenomena have received any detailed consideration by psychologists. Shyness and embarrassment have been studied in isolation from each other and often have been regarded as separate phenomena. In particular, shyness has tended to be viewed as characterising a person, whereas embarrassment has been seen as a property of social interactions. Whenever the focus in research into embarrassment has been on the individual, it has been on the person's role, with the implication that embarrassment is a temporary phenomenon that can be experienced by anyone. On the other hand, the trend has been to regard shyness as a personal dispositional attribute, a potential that the individual brings to the interaction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract King Lear makes his daughters compete for inheritances by declaring “which of you . . . doth love us most.” His youngest refuses to let her dowry depend on displaying filial piety, instead declaring her fealty in the old, less emotional language of lineage: “I love your Majesty / According to my bond; no more nor less.” Brontë’s Heathcliff expresses the dialectic of lineage and affect in terms of affective will and testamentary wills. By asserting the former, he succeeds in revising the latter – forcing his dying son to name him his heir. Faulkner’s protagonists identify with grandparents in order to reassert older, extended lineage ties over unacceptable affective ties to parents or siblings. Or else they do just the opposite: repudiating lineages to miscegenetic or incestuous grandparents in order to form more responsible emotional bonds. Whichever generation they consciously identify with, they often end up unconsciously perpetuating the example of the generation they rejected. In family systems, role reversal often keeps things essentially the same. A homeostatic tendency resists the inevitabilities of children growing up and becoming parents, of parents growing old and reliving some of their former feelings of dependency as children, only now vis-à-vis their own children.",

The general opinion is that this group of people is characterised by specific psychological and physical functioning and they are thought to have distinct needs and expectations as regards family life. To verify and confirm the above, comparative research was undertaken to find out how young able‐bodied, blind and persons using wheelchairs evaluate marriage. The subject of the research was the importance ascribed to the hierarchy of values related to marriage and family, and the types of needs satisfied through these institutions of social life. The participants were asked to evaluate such phenomena as love, sexual life and parenthood as well as expressing their attitude and opinion on conjugal infidelity. The results obtained do not indicate any significant differences in attitudes and views presented between the groups under consideration. All valued marriage and family life very highly and had similar expectations, however, not all will be able to fulfil their needs and aspirations in these areas. It will be quite complicated, especially so for those who are disabled. All possible failures are caused by, first of all, negative attitudes of the society towards erotic activities of people with disabilities.",

Sexual perversion may be considered as the expression of a narcissistic personality organisation which makes massive use of splitting and projective identification as a defence against separation anxiety. This prevents homosexual perverts from dis-identifying from their mothers and from attaining a distinct gender identity. The clinical case of a homosexual male patient is presented, where the absence of the father underlay his resentment, conveyed in the transference by means of lamentations and boredom, with which the patient sadistically tormented the analyst, thus giving vent to his deep resentment over an absent and unreliable father and over a mother from whom he could only be separated at the cost of persecutory anxiety and feelings of jealousy.",

While morality seems to require us to remain impartial between persons, friendship seems to generate demands or obligations of partiality toward our intimates. But the difficulty can be removed once we cease to focus on categorizing reasons as moral or non-moral. This tendency to divide reasons into categories of moral vs. non-moral leads us to give those that we label ‘moral’ pride of place and to assume that the category must be uniform. If we abandon these assumptions, then reasons of intimacy or friendship will no longer be so puzzling. We will then be able to see that all reasons, in the end, are importantly egocentric, and that deliberation must always proceed from an egocentric perspective.",

      "abstract": "In the modern society offering many variants for identification, the question of forming preference for and choosing social movements and subcultures is acute. This paper aims to identify the different types of preferences for social groups, as well as their relationship with psychological self-regulation, identity, well-being and coping behavior. On a sample of 268 adult respondents, three types of preferences were revealed having different motivational grounds. The choices of political and religious movements as well as the desire to become a sports fan have common traits with to the choice of radical movements. These preferences can be characterized as non-conformal ones, associated with the desire for demonstrated or real influence on global events and with the formation of identity by the type of identity fusion. Regardless of age, it is associated with greater hostility, signs of paranoia and use of denial in a stressful situation. Interest to most subcultures often could be classified as choice of hobby, providing the opportunity to participate in joint activities and self-presentation, but not limiting other life spheres and values. Most relevant for adolescence, it can contribute to a safe \"trying\" of the self in various roles, especially in those having psychological difficulties – and is associated with a wide range of complaints about psychopathological symptoms and mental disengagement. Interest to the volunteer movement is based on the prosocial motivation and importance of close interpersonal relationships and more typical for women. It is associated with positive self-esteem, better positive reformulation and planning, but also with complaints of predominantly anxious-phobic nature and concentration on emotions. The connection between the preferences of social groups with well-being and coping is moderated by the psychological self-regulation in two ways: a perpetuation of the existing difficulties of self-regulation and a compensation of existing difficulties. In the first case, the preference of the group is particularly closely related to specific psychopathological complaints or coping strategies in those with low levels of self-regulation. The second case is revealed only with respect to prosocial choice, which is more closely associated to active coping and positive self-esteem in people with low rates of access to the self and volitional regulation, respectively.",

Cooperative behavior is all the more difficult to establish when none of the above-mentioned elements are shared or when they are opposed. Cooperation depends on the degree of anxiety and pleasure resulting both from the relationship and the thought of it ending. The latter case may cause a belligerent attitude expressed in the fight or flight response. In addition, the more stifling the relationship is, the higher the risk of it breaking up. Cooperative behavior appears as an emergence process affecting several different levels. It should be noted that a bond created at one level often results in a breaking off at another level—couple, family, school, company, political world, religion, and oneself.",

The reasons for childlessness are more likely to be explored when two brothers are childless than when one brother is fertile and the other childless. Subfertile men may actively seek the explanation of their brother's childlessness in an attempt to explain their own subfertility. Cases and controls may interpret unexplained childlessness from their own experience as involuntary or voluntary. Additional bias may be introduced if the collection of information was not blinded. The use of reported childlessness also assumes that all such childlessness is due to male subfertility, the partner's contribution being ignored. Misclassification could easily explain these results.\n\nWe agree that the difference in …",

      "title": "Cambio terapéutico y eficacia del tratamiento psicológico de los agresores sexuales = Therapeutic change and effectiveness of psychological treatment of sex offenders",
      "abstract": "[spa] En la actualidad los delitos de abuso y agresion sexual generan un gran rechazo y alarma social a la vez que son conductas prohibidas y castigadas penalmente en la inmensa mayoria de los paises. Pese a que los delitos sexuales tienen una prevalencia baja en relacion al resto de delitos conocidos, su gravedad y los severos danos que causan a las victimas (generalmente mujeres y ninos) los convierten en conductas criminales de alto riesgo. De ahi que la investigacion especializada haya dirigido una gran atencion a ampliar el conocimiento sobre la genesis de la agresion sexual y sobre su posible prevencion y tratamiento. Hasta el momento se han descrito numerosos deficits y carencias personales y sociales vinculados al inicio y desarrollo de la agresion sexual, tales como baja autoestima, dificultades de control emocional, deficits de comunicacion y de relacion interpersonal, aislamiento social, experiencias de victimizacion, etc. necesidades Algunos de estos elementos, a los que se ha denominado criminogenas (o factores de riesgo dinamicos), son susceptibles de mejora a traves de una intervencion psicologica adecuada. Por este motivo, las necesidades criminogenas suelen constituir los objetivos principales de los programas de tratamiento con agresores sexuales. En coherencia con ello, actualmente existen numerosos programas de tratamiento para agresores sexuales dirigidos a promover en los individuos cambios y mejoras en factores de riesgo dinamicos, de cariz cognitivo, actitudinal, emocional y conductual. Por lo que se refiere al tratamiento de los agresores sexuales en los centros penitenciarios espanoles, desde 1996 se aplica el Programa de Control de la Agresion Sexual (PCAS), que incluye ingredientes terapeuticos de necesidad criminogena como los siguientes: entrenamiento en relajacion mecanismos de defensa; desarrollo de la empatia con la victima; etc. muscular; restructuracion cognitiva; conciencia emocional. Segun se ha concluido en la investigacion sobre reincidencia delictiva tanto nacional como internacional, los programas de tratamiento de agresores sexuales tienen una eficacia significativa aunque de tamano moderado. No obstante, pese a que la participacion de los delincuentes sexuales en los tratamientos parece reducir su reincidencia delictiva, todavia se desconoce en gran medida el proceso individual de cambio y mejora terapeutica de los agresores sexuales que podria vincularse finalmente a una menor reincidencia. Por todo lo anterior, el objetivo principal de esta Tesis Doctoral es la evaluacion de la eficacia terapeutica del Programa de Control de la Agresion Sexual aplicado en los centros penitenciarios espanoles. En esta direccion, los objetivos especificos planteados en este estudio son los siguientes: (a) revisar la investigacion cientifica sobre las principales necesidades criminogenas de los agresores sexuales, con la finalidad de evaluar en que medida los programas de tratamiento contribuyen a la solucion de dichas necesidades y a la mejora terapeutica de los agresores; (b) explorar la existencia de diversas tipologias de agresores sexuales en funcion de sus necesidades criminogenas o de tratamiento; y, por ultimo, (c) evaluar el cambio y la mejora terapeutica en una muestra de agresores sexuales tras su participacion en el programa de tratamiento. En consonancia con los objetivos planteados en esta Tesis Doctoral, presentada como compendio de publicaciones, se integran aqui cinco estudios sobre la evaluacion y el tratamiento de los agresores sexuales encarcelados en Espana. Las principales conclusiones que se derivan de los estudios realizados son las que siguen. En primer lugar, tras la revision de la bibliografia cientifica efectuada sobre necesidades criminogenas y tratamiento, se ha podido constatar que el Programa de Control de la Agresion Sexual aplicado en Espana es susceptible de promover cambios y mejoras en las necesidades terapeuticas de los agresores sexuales que podrian disminuir su riesgo delictivo. Paralelamente, se ha comprobado que pueden establecerse categorias y tipologias de agresores sexuales en funcion de la intensidad de sus necesidades criminogenas, orientadas a facilitar la aplicacion del tratamiento. Por otro lado, se ha observado una tendencia hacia el incremento de la motivacion para el cambio de los agresores sexuales a lo largo del proceso de desarrollo del tratamiento, desde estadios de cambio menos avanzados a estadios mas avanzados. Y finalmente, ha podido concluirse que la participacion de los agresores sexuales en un programa de tratamiento promueve la disminucion de sus necesidades criminogenas y su mejora terapeutica global. Sin embargo, como en toda investigacion sobre eficacia terapeutica, deben tenerse en cuenta diversas limitaciones que se han destacado a lo largo de los diferentes estudios compendiados y de esta Tesis Doctoral en su conjunto. En sintesis, aunque los resultados de estas investigaciones deben interpretarse con cautela, la conclusion general que puede extraerse es que el programa de tratamiento de agresores sexuales aplicado en las prisiones espanolas favorece en los individuos mejoras terapeuticas vinculadas a la reduccion de su futura conducta delictiva. [eng] Nowadays, sexual abuse or sexual assault crimes generate a great rejection and social alarm, since they constitute as prohibited and criminally punishable acts in the vast majority of countries. Although sexual offenses have a low prevalence in comparison with other known offenses, they need to be considered high-risk criminal behaviours due to their severity and the serious harm they cause the victims (usually women and children). So far, numerous personal and social deficits and deficiencies related to the onset and development of sexual aggression have been described, such as low self-esteem, emotional difficulties, communication and interpersonal deficits, social isolation, victimization experiences, etc. In relation to this, there are currently numerous treatment programs for sex offenders aimed at promoting changes and improvement in individuals’ cognitive, emotional, behavioural and attitude-related dynamic risk factors. Since 1996, the Sexual Offending Control Program (SOCP) is applied in Spanish penitentiary centres. For all of the above, the main purpose of this Doctoral Thesis is the assessment of the therapeutic effectiveness of the Sexual Offending Control Program applied in Spanish prisons. Accordingly, the specific objectives of this study are: (a) to review the scientific research on the main criminogenic needs of sex offenders in order to evaluate the extent to which treatment programs contribute to offenders’ therapeutic improvement and related needs; (b) to explore the existence of different typologies of sexual aggressors according to their criminogenic or treatment needs; and, finally, (c) to evaluate change and therapeutic improvement in a sample of sex offenders after their treatment participation. In line with the objectives outlined in this Doctoral Thesis, presented as a compendium of publications, five studies on the assessment and treatment of sex offenders imprisoned in Spain are included. In summary, although the results of these studies need to be interpreted with prudence, the general conclusion that can be drawn is that the Sexual Offending Control Program implemented in Spain is likely to promote changes and improvement in the sex offenders’ therapeutic needs, which could reduce their criminal risk.",

It is a well‐evidenced fact that most criminal careers start in early adolescence and end in the late twenties regardless of whether or not individuals have been processed through the criminal justice system. Maturational, structural, and interactionist desistance theories attempt to explain why and how desistance occurs. Maturational desistance theories perceive offending as an inevitable part of youth's transition into adulthood. Structural desistance theories explain desistance through key life‐events that provide for improved social bonding with others; and interactionist desistance theories see a change in offenders' narrative identity, which is triggered by certain life‐events, as the cause of desistance. Desistance research and related concepts are still evolving, but heir theoretical implications for the criminal justice system and intervention policies are already evident.",

Blaming is a worldwide problem. People do it without realizing their mistakes. When we blame other people, situation or environment around us for things that happens to us and avoid taking responsibility of our actions, though it is a sign of lower confidence and self-esteem it needs behavioural modification. This study was an attempt to find out opinion, and factors behind a peculiar behaviour called blame game. A small community of married and unmarried men and women were chosen for the purpose. The finding of this study shows that family, education, age, and gender may play a significant role in adopting and avoidance of this behaviour.",

Although it does not involve direct violent behavior, behaviors such as disturbing frequent phone calls, text messages, waiting and keeping watch around the workplace, university or home are among the persistent stalking behaviors. Persistent stalking can lead to an increase in the victim's feelings of fear and anxiety. Individuals exposed to this situation may experience psychological and/or physical health problems. According to researches, persistent stalking is a sexist act. The victims are mostly women. Stalking actions are generally carried out by men whom women know and have emotional relationships with. The difference between being a perpetrator or a victim in stalking actions depending on gender change also causes the formation of stalking myths in countries. In this study, stalking, which is a very current concept in the field of forensic sciences, was examined in terms of some sociological variables. Stalking and gender, the effects of honor culture and the meaning attributed to stalking in terms of gender were examined.",

      "title": "ReelAbilities: Heart-Opening Insights, Mind-Boggling Questions",
      "abstract": "Quality of life is a standard phrase that can often be tossed into medical and bioethical discussions. When referring to a patient, this term sums up values such as respect for all persons, dignity, and serving the best interests of the patient. However, it can also be used to add validity to what would otherwise seem like an emotional response. “I wouldn’t want my child’s quality of life to be affected by...” “Well what sort of quality of life would they have if...” “Yes, but that’s not a good quality of life! They are missing out on...” “Not everyone can handle that type of quality of life though...”\r\nPhrases like the above are used to mask one key emotion: fear. Fear of the unknown. Uncertainty about our ability to thrive with a life we are unaccustomed to. Anxiety over accepting an unexpected challenge. Nonetheless, quality of life plays such an important part in our decision-making because all of our fears and concerns stem from a place of love.\r\nAs potential parents are faced with the opportunity to screen embryos, mix and match selected DNA, and generally have more influence on the genetic make-up of their child, the questions surrounding “quality of life” are beginning to manifest themselves in a whole new way. No longer are the outcomes shaped by what type of life they had been living, and what a person would want moving forward. Reproductive technologies allow us to ask what we want for this potential person, and then make choices that will affect their entire lives. For those that have limited experiences interacting with people who are living with disabilities, answering quality of life questions may be negatively impacted by a lack of understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReelAbilities: NY Disabilities Film Festival promotes awareness and appreciation of the lives of people who have different disabilities. The films include showing the day-to-day lives, medical experiences, work experiences, and artistic expressions of people with a wide variety of diagnoses. A quick scan through the film descriptions shows unique themes that are often not discussed or easily found in the media: a successful matchmaker, a car manufacturing company with over 1200 developmentally disabled workers, views about the implications of genetic enhancement, and much more.\r\nThe festival lasts from March 6-11 and is hosted by the JCC in Manhattan with venues throughout the city. Tickets, scheduling, and further information can be found by going to www.newyork.reelabilities.org. This is an excellent opportunity to watch great films, learn more about a variety of disabilities, and speak with others who have experiences within the disabled community.

      "title": "Preservation of Function in Genitourinary Cancers: Psychosexual and Psychosocial Issues",
      "abstract": "GU cancers are commonly associated with treatment-related sexual dysfunction, varying from mild to severe. For the clinical oncologist, it is important to be aware that sexual problems or sexual dysfunction may occur as a result of any aspect of cancer and cancer treatment. Sexual function is sensitive to the effects of trauma, both physical and emotional. This is particularly the case for patients whose cancer affects their genitals. Despite some commonalities of psychosocial and psychosexual issues in GU patients across diagnostic categories, GU patients do not present as one distinct, homogeneous group. GU neoplasms, with the exception of bladder cancer, affect mostly men. Men and women tend to differ in their ways of dealing with emotional distress and physical illness. While the man may typically do well using denial as a defense and may not want to discuss his feelings about his diagnosis and treatment, his partner may suffer if her way of coping is oriented toward communicating thoughts and feelings about the situation. Another important difference in this population is related to age and developmental differences. Testicular cancer typically is diagnosed in young men between the ages of 15 and 34 (46). The patients often still live with their parents or have just formed families of their own. In contrast, prostate cancer is diagnosed in older men, who are at a completely different stage in their lives when they have to deal with this challenge. Developmental stage at the time of diagnosis and treatment is an important variable in adaptation to cancer (47). Since GU malignancies and their treatments directly or indirectly affect sexual organs and sexual functioning, issues of sexual body image and identity as men or women are frequent concerns for GU patients. This is most obviously the case for men facing penectomy or orchiectomy. Similarly, women undergoing cystectomy with its simultaneous removal of uterus, ovaries, and parts of the vaginal wall face issues regarding their femininity as well as doubts about future sexual functioning. However, body image concerns are not limited to these two groups but may affect any cancer patient. The experience of having lost all hair due to chemotherapy, bearing of surgical scars, lost or altered functioning, and just the realization of having had cancer may change the way a patient feels about his/her body permanently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Getting definitive evidence that life events are risk factors turns out to be difficult because, although it is easy to show that life events and mental disorders are related, it is difficult to decide which is cart and which is horse. The role of a life event as a consequence of disorder can be relatively clear when the employer who precipitated a job loss, the doctor who recommended hospitalization or the spouse who sued for divorce directly states that his or her action was a response to behavior that is known to be a symptom of the mental disorder. The comparable claim by an affected person or his or her relative that an event precipitated the illness is viewed with more suspicion because people are known to be motivated to search for explanations of their misfortunes.",

A refusal which summons the primal phantasies and a link to the mother which is full of hatred and partly established by inherited non-symbolised sexual traumas. The subject unburdens herself of this imaginary identification on one or several others by the means of projective identification. We can admit that hatred can have a saving and reorganising value for the subject’s structuration when she is trying to remove an incorporated identification. Advising therapy in a multisubjective set-up is judicious when hateful passion is at work in a couple and a family, where some members are victim of hateful projections.",

In this chapter, we examine the role of parental attachment in the development of violent behavior. We find consistent evidence that attachment to parents is negatively associated with physical aggression and violence in children. There are nuances to this conclusion; some measures are better than others, and the findings are not as strong as the findings for some other criminogenic factors. Regarding the differential etiology of violence, there is weak, preliminary evidence that indicators of substantial attachment problems (e.g., parental loss and separation) are more strongly associated with violent than nonviolent-only offending, but otherwise, we tender no conclusive evidence that measures of attachment to parents are strong differential predictors of violent behavior.",

      "title": "Depression in adolescence and young adulthood: the difficulty to integrate motivational/emotional systems",
      "abstract": "Depression is presented as a multi-factorial bio-psycho-social expression that has evolved primarily as an effect of stressors related to the motivational/emotional systems that regulate the BrainMind in our relationship with conspecifics. These stressors may be caused by two sources of threat, firstly, the loss of bonding with the caregiver and later with a partner and/or group which relates to the SEPARATION (PANIC/GRIEF) system, secondly, social defeat as an expression of the social competition and social dominance. The sexual maturity drives the individual to social competition and social dominance, even if the latter often occurs before sexual maturity, e.g., chickens, dogs, non-human primates, and humans. Depression is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in mammals to terminate both separation anxiety, so as to protect the vulnerable social brain from the consequences of prolonged separation anxiety, and the stress of social competition when social defeat is predictable. Adolescence and Young adulthood are particularly susceptible to these two types of threat because of human developmental characteristics that are summarized by the term neoteny. This refers to the slowing down of growth and development, resulting in both a prolonged period of dependence on a caring/protective adult and the persistence of juvenile characteristics throughout life. Therefore, neoteny makes the transition from childhood to sexual maturity more dramatic, making the integration of the SEPARATION (PANIC/GRIEF) system with the dynamics of social competition and dominance more stressful and a source of depression. Stress is an expression of the HPA-Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis that articulates with other systems, mainly the autonomic nervous system and the immune-inflammatory system. The latter is believed to be one of the most significant components in the dynamics of depressive processes, connected to the prodromes of its activation in childhood, under the pressure of environmental and relational stressors which can lead to learned helplessness. The recurrence of stressors makes it easier for the immune-inflammatory system to be activated in later life, which could make a significant contribution to the establishment of a depressive disease. The possible contribution of children's identification processes with their parents' depressive personalities through observational learning is considered.",

      "title": "Recognizing Normal and Disordered Pubertal Development",
      "abstract": "Abstract Pubertal maturation is a time of dramatic physical, reproductive, and psychological changes, including the development of secondary sex characteristics and changes in body composition. It requires a complex series of hormonal changes initiated by alterations in hypothalamic regulatory mechanisms that are incompletely understood, culminating in gonadal sex steroid secretion and associated maturation. While genetics play a major role in the timing and progression of pubertal maturation, other inputs such as nutrition, environmental factors, and social milieu yield individualized variations in the maturational pattern. It is likely that these factors are in part responsible for changes in timing and tempo of pubertal maturation noted over the last few decades. When a child begins to mature at the earliest or latest extremes of the normal ranges, the clinician must determine if the child is undergoing normal puberty, a non-pathologic variation, or a medically concerning condition that requires further investigation or treatment.",

      "title": "Against Racial Profiling",
      "abstract": "A police officer sees a suspicious bulge in the pocket of a passing pedestrian and deliberates whether to stop and search. The pedestrian is also a young, black man and from past searches and convictions the police arguably know that such men are much likelier than other people to carry an illegal firearm. Should the police officer be instructed to take this information into account? This paper objects to racial profiling because it relies on the following type of inference: from the individual’s membership of a certain racial group, the searcher is invited to infer that he is likelier to exhibit some culpable behaviour. The paper shows that such an inference to culpable behaviour requires contradictory presuppositions about the freedom of the suspected behaviour. On the one hand, racial profiling ought to presuppose that the individual suspect’s behaviour is unfree because the inference it involves takes the suspect’s behaviour to be determined by his race, age and gender, none of which is within his control. On the other hand, similarly to criminal trials, search practices also ought to presuppose the exact opposite: that the individual is free to determine her own behaviour. If the suspected behaviour is free, the involved inference to culpable behaviour is not probative of the individual suspect’s behaviour, so profiling methods which rely on it are useless. And if the suspected behaviour is unfree, the inference is probative but the suspect is not culpable and should thus not be put to trial, whatever the profiled-search yields.",

      "abstract": "Biology doctoral students face a myriad of barriers that may extend or impede their degree completion. These barriers result in a less diverse workforce, considering that institutionalised prejudices have created more barriers to academic success for some groups than others. Here, we aimed to understand the role that non-cognitive and demographic factors play in predicting doctoral students' perceived barriers, and identify which factors best predict personal/psychological, situational, and institutional barriers to degree completion. We surveyed 289 current biology doctoral students in the U.S. We measured grit, sense of belonging, and science identity as well as participants' perceived barriers. We tested the efficacy of non-cognitive factors alone in predicting the three barrier types versus models including demographic factors. We found that both non-cognitive and demographic factors were important in explaining perceived barriers. Higher scores of grit were associated with lower perceived personal/psychological barriers. However, we assert that grittiness is shaped by unique experiences and is highly situational. We do not imply that grit should be used as a main predictor of 'success' in doctoral programs. We suggest future research on what mechanisms facilitate growth of inherently gritty characteristics in biology doctoral students which lead to fewer perceived barriers to degree completion.",

      "title": "Is It Bad to Prefer Attractive Partners?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Philosophers have rightly condemned lookism—that is, discrimination in favor of attractive people or against unattractive people—in education, the justice system, the workplace, and elsewhere. Surprisingly, however, the almost universal preference for attractive romantic and sexual partners has rarely received serious ethical scrutiny. On its face, it is unclear whether this is a form of discrimination we should reject or tolerate. I consider arguments for both views. On the one hand, a strong case can be made that preferring attractive partners is bad. The idea is that choosing partners based on looks seems essentially similar to other objectionable forms of discrimination. (In particular, the preference for attractive partners is arguably both unfair and harmful to a significant degree.) One can try to resist this conclusion in several ways. I consider three possible replies. The first has to do with the possibility of controlling our partner preferences. The second pertains to attractiveness and ‘good genes’. The last attempts to link certain aspects of attractiveness to a prospective partner's personality and values. I argue that the first two replies fail conclusively, while the third only amounts to a limited defense of a particular kind of attractiveness preference. The idea that we should often avoid preferring attractive partners is thus compelling.",

It is commonly believed to play a role in decreased worker productivity, increased unintentional injuries, aggression and violence against others, and child and spouse abuse. Research findings support the idea that drinking is involved in or associated with many of these social harms, but do not offer evidence that it causes these effects.

Use of better design and statistical methodology is necessary in order to clarify the relationship between drinking and the harmful consequences it is believed to cause.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We have argued that anxious somatic depression afflicts women who aspire to achieve in areas historically reserved for males, particularly during periods of changing gender roles. If these women confront societal prejudices against “acting like men” that serve as barriers toward achieving in these areas, they may develop ambivalent feelings about themselves and their femininity that lead to other psychological and physical symptoms. But to fully understand this ambivalence, it is not enough for us to point to some general societal attitudes regarding female inferiority. We must learn how those attitudes become integrated into women’s self concepts, how some women come to experience such mixed feelings about something so central as their femininity and the bodies that define them as female. Every society disseminates attitudes that are negative toward particular groups of people, with results ranging from inconvenient to devastating. Gender bias, racism, ethnic or religious prejudice can cause economic hardship, promote violence, and almost certainly lead to minor putdowns and major disappointments on a regular basis. Clearly, great suffering can be entailed in being a member of a group that is the subject of bias. The response to such suffering, however, is not preordained and varies greatly from person to person.",

      "abstract": "Discrimination is pervasive and harms physical and psychological well-being. Understanding associations between reasons for discrimination and consequences could provide insight for harm-reduction efforts, including identifying vulnerable youth. Unlike other types of discrimination, some people unfortunately consider weight-based discrimination \"socially acceptable\" because of the misperception that higher body weight is caused by low self-control and motivation. The present study examined reasons for discrimination, including weight-based discrimination in childhood and adulthood, and associations with mental and physical health. Adults (N=397) reported perceived reasons for discrimination and experiences of childhood bullying related to weight, as well as current physical and mental health. Analyses of variance tested whether perceived reasons for discrimination, both independent and intersectional, were related to health. Weight-based discrimination was most frequently reported, followed by gender-, physical appearance-, race/ethnicity-, and age-based discrimination. Weight- and race/ethnicity-based discrimination were associated with greater frequency of discrimination experiences. Weight as a main reason for discrimination was associated with more weight self-stigma and internalized bias, and weight as a contributing reason was additionally associated with eating-disorder psychopathology, depression, and poor current health. Over half of participants had a history of childhood weight-based bullying, which was related to poor current health, eating-disorder psychopathology, weight self-stigma, perceived stress, and depression. Intersectional discrimination did not contribute to worse consequences than those from weight-based discrimination alone. Weight-based discrimination during childhood or adulthood appears to have negative health consequences. Further research on strategies to mitigate the harms of weight-related discrimination is a crucial next step to protect vulnerable populations.",

      "abstract": "Fear of missing out (FoMO) creates a strong urge to stay continuously connected and informed about peers’ activities, identified as a risk factor for problematic social media use and risky behaviors. Sexting is generally defined as the exchange of sexually suggestive or explicit photos, videos, or text messages through cell phones or other technologies. Despite its social relevance, the link between FoMO and sexting remains underexplored. This study examines their relationship in young adults—an understudied group compared to adolescents—while controlling for age, sex, and sexual orientation. The study surveyed 911 Italian young adults (18–30 years, Mage = 22.3, SDage = 2.57, 74% women, 70.4% heterosexual) through an online questionnaire. The results indicate that FoMO predicts only risky sexting behaviors (sexting under substance use and sexting for emotion regulation) while not influencing experimental sexting (sending one’s own sexts). Additionally, the link between FoMO and sexting for emotion regulation is stronger among LGB individuals. Therefore, FoMO has proven to be strongly related to the two kinds of risky sexting but not to experimental sexting. Understanding this relationship can inform prevention and intervention programs on relationships, online communication, and sexting in young adults.",

However, even 6‐ and 7‐year‐olds had some difficulty grasping the relation between critical or unambiguous evidence and knowledge, and in basing their ascriptions of knowledge exclusively on the availability of such evidence. Two important transitions in epistemological understanding were observed. The first at about 5#fr1/2> years of age was the transition from ascribing beliefs to others on the basis of one's own beliefs to ascribing them on the basis of the evidence available to that person—a transition that may depend on their understanding of the possibility of someone holding a false belief; the second was the transition from 6 to 7 years of age when they begin to understand the implications of critical evidence.",

From social, cultural, and medical perspectives, human suffering is often hidden under an assortment of other defined experiences, for example, colonization, marginalization, stigmatization, or illness symptomatology such as physical, mental, or chronic pain. As such, a focused examination of the condition of human suffering as a distinct entity has often been lacking. However, work in several disciplines within recent years has brought a specific focus to suffering as an object of study. As part of this effort, research has also centered on the experience of suffering in later life. Suffering can be defined as immersion in a profoundly difficult or troubling event or episode. Of critical significance to an understanding of suffering – and what makes it different from many negative experiences – is that suffering often provides a challenge to personal identity and threatens a stable sense of who one is in the world. Six negative factors relating to suffering may each form the basis of a more profound level of existential suffering. Some research on suffering in later life has focused on the relationship of suffering to both personal meaning and the experience of control.",

It is clear however that, for reasons still poorly understood, there is a great interindividual variability in the self-disclosure behavior. Thus, while some people are very reserved even to friends, others are willing to provide self-describing information to a person he/she had just met. As these trends are relatively stable within individuals, this study aims to identify some personality factors associated with the level of self-disclosure.",

Recent research suggests, however, that friendship quality affects primarily children's success in the social world of peers. Friendship quality could also have indirect effects, by magnifying or diminishing the influence of friends on each other's attitudes and behaviors. Having high-quality friendships may lessen children's tendencies to imitate the behavior of shy and withdrawn friends, but little evidence supports the hypothesis that high-quality friendships magnify friends’ influence.",

Dependence development is not attributable directly to the consumed substance, but takes also all the other issues into regard. One of all these issues might be that gender represents an influencing factor and impacts on tolerance of a substance, on abuse patterns and finally on development of dependence as well as on addiction related disorders. Therapeutic programs' needs might be different too. In general, more men than women are alcohol dependent or have alcohol problems, but women are at greater risk for adverse effects and alcohol related diseases. Death rates among female alcoholics are 50 to 100 percent higher than those of men.

      "abstract": "Abstract A QUESTION OF REPRODUCTION is usually an academic matter in individuals with a cytogenetically detectable functional autosomal aneuploidy. But toward the milder end of the phenotypic range, social and emotional development may be such that forming a stable relationship is possible. Some who lack that degree of maturity may yet have a social freedom that opens the possibility of a sexual encounter. Either on their own behalf, or through the agency of parents or other carers (whose agenda may include sterilization), such people may present to the genetic clinic. Ethical issues raised in this context are aired in Chapter 1. With some of the deletions and duplications of lesser genetic imbalance revealed by molecular techniques, the phenotypic effects may be very mild, with social and intellectual functioning well within the normal range.The mosaic state may on occasion be associated with an apparently normal phenotype, or at least very close to normal. Some of these persons will have been identified by their having had a child with the imbalance for which they themselves have a low-level mosaicism. Some present with infertility. The theoretical risk will depend upon the extent to which the gonad carries the aneuploid line.In contrast, some structural imbalances are without discernible phenotypic effect. Deletion or duplication of a small segment of euchromatin, or the presence of a supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC), is occasionally recognized fortuitously in normal and fertile individuals.",

      "title": "Blurring the Lines Between Life and Death — Ethical and Psychological Considerations in Posthumous Conception",
      "abstract": "ART practitioners routinely offer embryo and oocyte/sperm cryopreservation services to patients and couples who are interested in future family building. Unfortunately, some patients, whether due to disease or accident, die after cryopreserving their genetic material. In the event of a patient’s death, their partner or other family members may desire to use those materials to achieve pregnancy. However, posthumous reproduction (reproductive attempts after the death of a partner) has resulted in a number of ethical issues regarding pre-death consent from the deceased patient and ambiguous legal and social status for the resulting child(ren). Multiple psychological issues also arise during the course of posthumous reproduction. This includes decision making in the context of grieving the death of a loved one, family disagreements about posthumous reproduction, and coping with potential pregnancy-related adverse events. Further, it is unknown what if any psychological burden posthumously conceived children or their family members will bear as the child grows. From an ethical standpoint, it is often unclear as to who should have rights to these gametes or embryos as pre-death consent forms have often not been completed. Because of the psychological and ethical concerns regarding posthumous reproduction many practitioners have concerns about facilitating such treatment. This presentation will address the psychological and ethical issues in posthumous reproduction and will provide direction to providers for how to address these issues with surviving loved ones.",

We use the example of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder to show that it is necessary for people with cognitive differences to seek legal protection from discrimination within a disability framework. This approach can be problematic because of the stigma that attaches to disability and because of the way that provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) are interpreted. An alternative approach is to treat cognitive and behavioural attributes within a framework that recognises different abilities, rather than starting from a presumptive provision of disability, in much the same way that gender or religious beliefs are treated.",

This chapter suggests that the possible positive benefits of hypo-egoicism associated with experiences of transcendence may be interpreted as vertical (more common in psychology of religion) or horizontal (more common in positive psychology). However, the empirical consequences may be similar. The measurement of hypo-egoicism associated with reported mystical experiences is well established and the correlates of such experience are seldom associated with psychopathology. Likewise, that mysticism can be facilitated by appropriate set and setting circumstances and associated triggers such as isolation and chemicals suggests that hypo-egoicism is a human ability that can be facilitated among those interested in its likely positive outcomes for lives framed in terms of religion, spirituality, or both.",

Women more frequently have problems in experiencing sexual arousal and pleasure, whereas men more often suffer from erectile dysfunction or dysfunctional ejaculation. From an evolutionary point of view, many sexual dysfunctions are caused by conflict relating to intra- and intersexual competition or cultural practices of controlling sexual activity of the opposite sex. Suppression of sexual interest in women may, for example, occur in patrilocal societies, where curbing one’s daughter’s sexual activity before her arranged marriage may eventually increase the parents’ reproductive success. Evolutionary hypotheses of female orgasm suggest that the function of orgasm in women could signal satisfaction and fidelity to their male partners. Premature ejaculation in men may relate to performance anxiety. Finally, hormonal contraceptives impact on the experience of sexual pleasure and mate choice in relevant ways.",

      "abstract": "Men and women were asked to imagine a romantic partner being sexually unfaithful and/or emotionally unfaithful. Three hypotheses regarding gender differences in subjective distress to sexual and emotional infidelity, and in the inferences linking the infidelities were tested. The results indicated that more men than women were distressed by imagining a partner enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with another person, and more women than men were distressed by imagining a partner forming a deep emotional attachment to another person. Asking another group of women and men to imagine a partner committing both infidelities at the same time, and then to indicate which component of the combined infidelity was the most distressing, produced the same sexual asymmetries. The prediction that men will infer from a partner's sexual infidelity the co-occurrence of emotional infidelity and that women will infer from a partner's emotional infidelity the co-occurrence of sexual infidelity was not supported. An evolutionary perspective, rather than an alternative analysis emphasizing the different inferences men and women draw from sex and love, provided a satisfactory explanation of the sexual asymmetries in the cues to jealousy.",

      "title": "Key individuals catalyse intergroup violence",
      "abstract": "Intergroup violence is challenging to understand: why do individuals cooperate to harm members of other groups when they themselves may be killed or injured? Despite progress in understanding the evolutionary and proximate mechanisms that underlie violence, we still have little insight into the processes that lead to the emergence of coalitionary aggression. We argue that an overlooked component is the presence of individuals who have a crucial role in initiating violence. In instigating intergroup violence, these key individuals may expect to face lower costs, receive greater benefits, or garner benefits that have a greater value to them than others. Alternatively, key individuals may be motivated by individual traits such as increased boldness, propensity for aggression or exploratory behaviour. Key individuals catalyse the emergence of coalitionary violence through one of several processes including altering the costs and benefits that accrue to others, paying a greater share of the startup costs, signalling privileged knowledge, or providing coordination, among other factors. Here we integrate diverse lines of empirical research from humans and non-human animals demonstrating that inter-individual variation is an important factor in the emergence of intergroup violence. Focusing on the role of key individuals provides new insights into how and why violence emerges. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Intergroup conflict across taxa’.",

In some cases elder abuse causes permanent injury and even death. Elder abuse, especially abuse perpetuated by family members, dates back to ancient times. Recognition of elder abuse as a social problem and one type of family violence came after that of child and domestic abuse. Elder abuse was initially called “granny battering” and attracted the attention of medical personnel and later that of legal and academic personnel as well as the general public. Elder abuse continues to impact the lives of older adults, especially women, 60 years and older in several ways. It is a worldwide problem that impacts the quality of life of elders in several ways. Research and policy literature tend to classify elder abuse into seven main types: physical abuse, sexual abuse or abusive sexual contact, emotional or psychological abuse, neglect, self‐neglect, abandonment, and financial abuse or exploitation. Though several incidence and prevalence studies have been conducted, the need for more intervention studies is recognized.",

In the 1970s there was a proliferation of literature reifying the concept of life events and relating it to various illnesses and conditions. The hypothesis implicit in most of the life events literature is that, under the impact of a certain number of stressful life events, the organism succumbs to certain diseases or conditions such as heart disease or clinical depression. Protective factors such as having the support of a loving and understanding relationship are clearly important when coping with stressful life events such as loss and bereavement. The whole process of changing drinking behaviour and life-style is likely to affect the occurrence of negative and positive events of the implicated type, such as events surrounding relationships, work, physical health or finances.",

      "title": "The acquisition of autonomy, through benevolence, of children who are victims of domestic violence",
      "abstract": "From its etymology bene (good) and volens (will), benevolence means desire to do well. Benevolence is not an arbitrary notion or a theoretical apprehension. It unquestionably reveals man's humanism, which must combine in its daily practice and management with his fellow human beings and even with himself. In education, benevolence is crucial in mother-child relations. We believe that a mother must be benevolent, at the same time as; a child who has received the love of his mother (or parents) can love himself. This is a prerequisite for the acquisition of independent thought. The true cement of any family unit is the mutual love of all those who are called to live together. Paradoxically, love is not the foundation of all families. Unfortunately, there are dysfunctional families in which there are various and varied forms of violence. Children from this type of environment find themselves victims of abuse with all the possible traumatic consequences. Based on this observation, it is easy to reason by deduction: if family love conditions the acquisition of autonomy and children who are victims of family violence do not benefit from it within their families, then children who are victims of family violence are at a disadvantage in acquiring autonomy, or even that they cannot be autonomous. Thus, one may wonder to bring a child victim of family violence to the acquisition of his autonomy? What tools can be used to help a traumatized child become autonomous? How to rebuild a child who has suffered family trauma with a view to his or her autonomy? This article offers the reader benevolence, not as an instruction manual or prescription to be applied, but as a transferable and impactable posture.",

These include grandiosity, the need to control the therapist, empty depression, and a preoccupation with the imagery of death and battle. These patients tend to evoke in the therapist emotional responses that the patients subsequently deny. These characteristics are so pervasive among men that they may be endemic to manhood. The heroic model of manhood is an attempt to strengthen and stabilize the gendered self‐representation. Because fathers tend to be absent from the nurturing matrix, their sons have little early experience in an affective, preverbal relationship of mutual influence with another who is essentially like themselves yet outside their omnipotent control. Men, therefore, are raised with a pervasive experience of “otherness,”; their infantile experience and affectivity forever trapped in the world of women. Although the yearning of men for their fathers is recognized in psychoanalytic theory, the wish for the nurturing father has been underemphasized. The underemphasis causes the f nalyst to miss, or misunderstand, important transferential constellations.",

      "title": "Psychological development",
      "abstract": "Psychological development refers to growth and progress on the full gamut of human dimensions across the lifespan. The study of psychological development has been concerned with questions such as: What develops?; In what sequence?; Are there identifiable stages and phases of development?; What processes underlie developmental change?; Are there general principles of development and change that apply across all ages?; What factors enhance or retard development?; What explains inter-individual differences?; and To what extent is development socially and culturally determined? An engagement with the literature reveals a range of very different theoretical and empirical approaches to the above questions. Furthermore, the questions that are posed are typically framed within a particular theoretical position and/or contain basic theoretical assumptions about development. In the developmental literature there are two broad fields of enquiry: one concerned with the devel-opment of cognitive and intellectual capabilities across the lifespan; the other concerned with social and emotional development or one's sense of self or identity. The early research in both these fields of enquiry focused on child development – arguably because of the need to understand children's learning given the growth of education in the latter part of the nineteenth century and also because of a commonly held belief that adult maturity was the end-point of development. Nowadays a great deal of research has been undertaken on adult development. Once again this may beconnected with the need for adults to engage in lifelong learning in the context of continuing technological, social and organisational change and the subsequent increasing educational provision for adults in formal and informal settings throughout life. A common thread in the developmental literature, then, has been the application of developmental theories across the entire lifespan. In many ways the application of developmental theories to adults has raised new questions and issues that have helped shape thinking in relation to the development of children. For example, in adult developmental research there has been a general move away from identifying common sequences of predictable stages and phases, which characterised earlier attempts to document development. Instead the emphasis is now placed on the impact of social and historical factors in accounting for multidirectional change and variability in life trajectories (see for example, Smith and Baltes, 1999; Elder, 1998). Research into child development has followed suit, paying greater attention to the social and historical factors that influence the direction and timing of development. Of course this trend is also a response to the increasing need to recognise cultural diversity among those attending educational institutions. I am not suggesting that the pragmatic needs of educators alone drive the theory construction of developmental psychologists in a direct and explicit way, however,it is clear that broad social concerns, including those of educators, provide a context in which it is possible for developmental theorists to raise new questions and issues in their research. It is also worth noting that the education sector is a major user of the research on developmental psychology and this is understandable given that both education and developmental psychology have a common focus on learning.",

Multiple losses, challenges and problems can place a significant strain on the individual, particularly if these occur in quick succession. It is not surprising that adjustment, adaptation and various expressions used to refer to the individual's experience of well-being, morale, life satisfaction and depression are some of the most commonly used terms in social and psychological studies of ageing.",

      "title": "Motives for Suicide",
      "abstract": "Abstract Contemporaries had clear notions about the kinds of behaviour and moods that preceded suicide and the sorts of people who were more or less likely to commit it, however broad and imprecise the folk psychology of suicide may have been. They also had definite ideas about the motives that moved men and women to slay themselves. And just as juries were unlikely to find an ambiguous death a suicide without evidence that it fitted the psychological profile they associated with self-slayers, so they were highly unlikely to return a suicide verdict without evidence of a plausible motive. When they tried to explain why people killed themselves, observers typically mentioned calamities that might befall anyone. Their conception of the stresses that shattered the psychological well-being of men and women was grounded on their own frustrations and disappointments and on widely held beliefs about the sources of unhappiness. It was the mirror image of the vision of an ideal life in early modern society. To sustain their social positions and navigate through the uncertainties they encountered, people relied on a shared set of beliefs about security and danger, about the actions and events that promoted their well-being or destroyed it. The commonly accepted motives for suicide marked out dangerous passages in the social world, like the legends on old maps warning of hostile peoples and perilous seas.",

      "abstract": "Religious beliefs often persist among unaffiliated young adults, and certain beliefs about God have been shown to support subjective well-being.Yet we know much less about the persistence or psychological impact of religious experiences, specifically miracles from God.I conceive of such experiences as faith pinnacle moments which express and reinvigorate the individual's reciprocal bond with God, frequently occur in response to certain types of stress, and support well-being by solidifying one's sense of that bond.My results show that net of institutional religiosity, young adults who experience stress from traumas are more likely to report miracles.This suggests that these reports often refer to healings or similar interventions.Stress from family breakups, however, is negatively correlated with miracles, presumably since these disruptions damage the bond with God due to the established connection between parental relationships and perceived relationship with God.Finally, miracles are positively correlated with life satisfaction and partially protect against the negative effects of stress on life satisfaction.",

      "title": "Dealing with Ambiguity and Contradiction",
      "abstract": "In both our professional and personal lives we often face ambiguity and contradiction. Ambiguity means more than having two choices, one “good” and one “bad.” It often means many choices, all of which may have some good purpose and all of which may have contradictory side effects. In medicine, for example, keeping a hospital or a practice financially solvent, providing more labor intensive, attentive service to patients, satisfying doctors' and nurses' needs, and respecting their values are all good and worthwhile goals. But many times these complex goals are filled with conflict and contradictions. We see this in staffing levels of nurses, paying for new and glitzy equipment at the cost of more patient-friendly services, and the use of chemotherapy with no chance of making a positive difference instead of having a difficult and frank discussion about shifting to palliative or end-of-life care (there may also be financial factors). But ambiguities are found in all aspects of life. For the young there are often no ambiguities; the world, political views, religious standards, social behavior, and personalities are put into hermetically sealed boxes of black or white, right or wrong, good or bad. In effect, the existence of ambiguity and alternative opinions is dismissed out of hand. And for some, this mind-set does not change with age. ‘With Growing Wisdom and Intellectual Adulthood…” With growing wisdom and intellectual adulthood, which doesn't always correspond to chronological or hormonal adulthood, one realizes that ambiguities and contradiction are engrained in life and must be dealt with constantly. An excellent description of the topic was written in 1968 by Thomas Merton, the famed Trappist monk who wrote a great deal about life, conflict, and ecology in addition to religious and spiritual matters. He describes the challenges of ambiguity: “Man is a creature of ambiguity. His salvation and his sanity depend on his ability to harmonize the deep conflicts in his thought, his emotions, his personal mythology. Honesty and authenticity do not depend on complete freedom from the contradictions—such freedom is impossible— but on recognizing our self-contradictions and not masking them with bad faith. The conflicts in individuals are not entirely of their own making. On the contrary, many of them are imposed, readymade, by an ambivalent culture. “This poses a very special problem, because he who accepts the ambiguities of his culture without protest and without criticism is rewarded with a sense of security and moral justification. A certain kind of unanimity satisfies our emotions, and easily substitutes for truth. We are content to think like the others, and in order to protect our common psychic security, we readily become blind to the contradictions—even the lies—that we have all decided to accept as ‘plain truth.’” The last paragraph could have been written by Irving Janis, who coined the term “groupthink” in the 1970s, or by Eric Hoffer, who wrote The True Believer in the 1960s. All three authors deal with some aspect of the fragility of independent thought and the difficulty of sustaining it, instead of yielding to the attraction of comfortably conforming with the resulting paralysis that prevents action. In Merton's case, he was writing “The Ecological Conscience” for the Catholic Worker (reprinted in December 2008), specifically about ecology and the environment, a bit surprising coming from a cloistered monk in the year 1968. But his words apply equally well to social morality of any type, such as destructive greed, as we will see as we follow his thought with excerpts from the article. He points to a familiar ambiguity in the American mind, our frontier mythology, which, ironically, has grown in power even as our frontier disappears and rural populations have declined. The Puritan and pioneer are our frontier culture heroes, who at the same time are destroyers of the wilderness. In fact, success depends on winning a fight with the wilderness, and victory means turning wilderness into farms, roads, and towns. And then come factories and cities and our urban culture that has been accompanied by the growing consumption of natural resources and destruction of wilderness, much of the damage being irreversible. He continues: “There are plenty of people who are aware of the need for ‘something to be done,’ but just consider the enormous struggle that has to be waged, for instance in eastern Kentucky (he lived most of his life in a Kentucky monastery), to keep mining interests from completing the ruin of an area that is already a ghastly monument to callous human greed…When a choice has to be made, it is almost invariably made in the way that is good for a quick return on somebody's investment—and a permanent disaster for everybody else.” This story is well known today. He then speaks about the view of Aldo Leopold, a follower of John Muir. Leopold believed that the erosion of American land was only part of a more drastic erosion of American freedom. Merton says that if “freedom” means purely and simply an uncontrolled power to make money in every possible way, regardless of consequences, then freedom becomes synonymous with ruthless, mindless and absolute exploitation. For me, this message has a broader application that includes medicine and life in general. To paraphrase Merton, one's professional conscience is, or should be, centered on an awareness of a medical professional's true place as a dependent member of the social community. He must become fully aware of his dependence on a balance within his free will and of his obligations toward the other members of that vital community, which in different ways includes every one and every thing. Having a conscience and heeding it when confronting ambiguity is a difficult path to follow. I assume most everyone has failures; I have my share. The goal may be perfection in a well-balanced, well-informed, fearless conscience. I myself will settle for trying to get better at it every day. www.oncology-times.com",

      "title": "Do attachment styles influence the sexual function of an individual?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Attachment theory, first proposed by John Bowlby and later extended by Mary Ainsworth and others, outlines how experiences of early childhood attachment with caregivers can affect one’s emotional and interpersonal relationships throughout adulthood. Typically, attachment styles are categorised into four main types: secure, anxious-ambivalent, avoidant and disorganised. Conversely, it is recognised that various biological, psychological, relational, social and iatrogenic factors elements can impact an individual’s sexual function. Objectives Our aim with this research was to present the most current literature on whether there is a correlation between attachment styles and sexual function. Methods We conducted a non-systematic review on the topic using PubMed and PsycInfo. Results There is evidence indicating a link between attachment styles and sexual function. People with secure attachment styles tend to experience more positive and fulfilling sexual relationships. Such individuals typically have a more positive self-image, they feel at ease with emotional intimacy, and are therefore able to openly communicate their needs and desires. They exhibit a healthy balance between seeking closeness and maintaining independence. Individuals with anxious attachment styles may experience heightened levels of sexual anxiety and insecurity. Concerns regarding rejection or abandonment within sexual relationships may impact their sexual function and satisfaction. These individuals usually have a negative self-image and may be more prone to seek reassurance and validation through sexual activities. People with avoidant attachment styles may encounter obstacles in developing emotional intimacy and closeness, which can negatively affect their sexual relationships. Such individuals might experience commitment anxiety and prioritise physical aspects of sexual activity over emotional bonding, ultimately decreasing sexual satisfaction for both them and their partners. Disorganised attachment styles are linked with challenges in regulating their emotions and behaviours in intimate situations, which can have a negative impact on sexual function and satisfaction. Conclusions While the literature proposes attachment styles may impact sexual function, it is important to acknowledge other factors that contribute to sexual function. In addition to biological and iatrogenic factors, individual personality, relationship dynamics, past experiences, and cultural influences all have a significant role in shaping one’s sexual behaviour and satisfaction. All of these should be addressed in order to alleviate sexual difficulties. Moreover, attachment styles may develop and change over time through positive relationships and therapeutic interventions, potentially leading to changes in one’s sexual functioning and relationship dynamics.

      "abstract": "Aim: The present research aims to investigate the civil and criminal liability for emotional damages inflicted by spouses on each other in married life. Methods: This research employs a descriptive-analytical method and is conducted using authoritative legal and jurisprudential library sources. Results: Undoubtedly, the primary objectives of marriage for spouses are not profit and benefit, but rather to achieve peace, respect, loyalty, intimacy, and security. Among the damages that can be inflicted on a person is moral damage, which is not about losing property; rather, these damages affect the individual emotionally and psychologically. Moral damage is often related to the rights associated with a person's character and includes harm to physical and moral integrity, such as physical suffering, identity, reputation, emotions and feelings, and dignity. Conclusion: Consequently, we find that if spouses suffer from mental illness or are harmed due to constant quarrels, blame, suppression, or slander, the culprit is liable for civil and criminal damages. However, it is also understood that compensating for emotional damage is not solely through monetary payment but should also involve expressions of affection, commitment to not repeating behavior, public apologies, psychotherapy, etc.",

Nevertheless, our understanding of behavior and our ability to influence it by psychological means are slowly growing, and the social and ethical implications of this knowledge are so immense as to dwarf even the importance of our understanding of the physical world.

      "abstract": "On the basis of the analysis of past case studies of crashes or disasters, it has been clarified how cultural difference and cognitive biases become a trigger of serious crashes or disasters. Heuristic-based biases such as confirmation bias, groupthink, and social loafing surely appeared in the process of crash or disaster breakout. Overconfidence-bases biases such as illusion of control, fallacy of plan, and optimistic bias are also ubiquitous in the route to a critical crash or disaster. Moreover, framing biases contribute to the distorted decision making, and eventually turn into the main cause of critical crash or disaster. In this way, as well as human factors or ergonomics approaches for designing man-machine systems, the prevention and the deletion of cognitive biases are indispensable for the preventing serious crashes or disasters from occurring. Until now, the distortion of decision making has not been discussed from the cultural differences of way of thinking. As well as a variety of cognitive biases, cultural difference in behavior is expected to be important for understanding the root causes of critical crash or disaster. We found that cultural difference distorted judgment through case studies of critical crashes or disasters. It was also demonstrated that considering cultural difference, as well as cognitive biases, is important to prevent irrational and biased decision making from occurring in safety management.",

      "abstract": "T NHE MAJOR scientific interest in the study of social problems has been focused principally on causation. It is now becoming apparent in sociological research, at least, that causative factors are very elusive things and are not satisfactory handled. Perhaps the etiology of the particular social problems which sociologists study will largely remain speculative and undetermined. Perhaps causation is not very applicable to the study of social problems in the first place. If the emphasis on causation is deflated, one might ask, not what our social problems texts will do, but what truly scientific considerations will be left for the sociological study of social problems? There would remain still a large body of shrewd and better-than-commonsense insights into the nature and characteristics of social problems.' There would remain a slight residue from an interest in behavior sequences or processes, such as may be used to describe the development of criminal attitudes and techniques, the progressive slump to lower levels (demoralization), the mounting tensions of family conflict, and so forth.2 The interest in interaction or behavior sequences has shown a considerable growth but is still largely a matter of qualitative analysis from special cases. There would remain also the contributions from the spatial studies. The rebirth of the Ioo-year old cartographic method, under the miscast name of ecological approach, has yielded many valuable clues as to the variation in intensity of reported incidence of social problems in unit areas. However, the validity of these spatial studies has been seriously questioned.3",

      "abstract": "Despite affecting millions of families around the world, parental alienation has been largely unacknowledged or denied by legal and health professionals as a form of family violence. This complex form of aggression entails a parental figure engaging in the long-term use of a variety of aggressive behaviors to harm the relationship between their child and another parental figure, and/or to hurt the other parental figure directly because of their relationship with their child. Like other forms of family violence, parental alienation has serious and negative consequences for family members, yet victims are often blamed for their experience. In order to be recognized as a form of family violence and to secure protection for victims under law and social policies, a formal review and comparison of parental alienating behaviors and outcomes to child abuse and intimate partner violence has been sorely needed. The result of this review highlights how the societal denial of parental alienation has been like the historical social and political denial or other forms of abuse in many parts of the world (e.g., child abuse a century ago). Reframing parental alienating behaviors as a form of family violence also serves as a desperate call to action for social scientists to focus more theoretical and empirical attention to this topic.

      "abstract": "The paper raises the problem of the negative impact of patronizing attitude towards older people on their life practices, which is one of the manifestations of ageism. Patronizing behavior that is implemented towards the older generation in the form of simpli-fied language, exaggerated intonations, slow speech, a tendency to make decisions about the life of an elderly person, ignoring his opinion, etc., in turn, can have an infantilizing effect on the elderly person, forcing him to take a subordinate position. The study, based on empirical data, proves that this, in turn, causes self-limiting practices of older peo-ple. Representatives of the older generation who succumb to the influence of the negative social construct of old age transmitted by others, and as a result adopt a subordinate position, have higher risks of minimizing interpersonal, social and creative activity. Their way of life, in comparison with those who oppose the patronizing attitude or evaluate it negatively, is more focused on the “generally ac-cepted”. They are more likely to abandon their goals, plans, due to their own idea that at their age they are “not up to the task”, less often they act contrary to the opinion of others “about the right and wrong at this age”, refusing to defend their position. Accept-ing the patronizing attitude with gratitude, at the same time, they are more likely than those who are annoyed by this attitude to ignore health-saving practices, considering that diseases are an indis-pensable attribute of old age, so it is pointless to fight them. They are more likely to give up pleasures, joys, desired things in favor of younger people, con-sidering themselves unworthy of them. In conclu-sion, the article suggests ways to solve the identi-fied problem.",

Introduction The World Health Organization defines child sexual abuse as the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or that violates the laws or social taboos of society. Child sexual abuse is evidenced by this activity between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person. This may include but is not limited to the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful activity, the exploitative use of a child in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices, the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials (1). A similar definition has been stated in Article 18 of The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, 2007 which is yet to enter into force (2). The risks that minors face online include sexual solicitation, exposure to problematic and illegal content as well as harassment and bullying. These risks are not confined to their local area but occur from people all around the world. Parents and teachers do not have direct experience with the risks posed by new-media technologies. Addressing the risks online therefore carries different challenges and requires broader collaboration to find innovative solutions (3). The need for a multi-layered approach to internet governance in India is highlighted by a comparative study of the various measures available internationally to make communications over the information and communication technologies safe. A concerted effort is very essential from various actors in order to prevent online child sexual abuse. Those who can help report child sexual abuse have been identified as social-service workers, healthcare practitioners, education providers, law enforcement officers, photo developers, IT professionals, ISPs, credit card companies and banks (4). Other actors are telecom service providers, network service providers, web-hosting service providers, search engines, online payment sites, online-auction sites, online-market places, and cyber cafes. A multi-level sensitisation about the need to collect statistics as well as report suspected internet child abuse should be effected among these actors. In India, the government does not take a pro-active stand against child sexual abuse, in contrast to the USA where law enforcement officials lure potential sex offenders in decoy. In sting operations conducted in the USA, where paedophiles are lured over the internet to contact people below the age of consent over the Internet for sexual liaisons, many highly-educated and well-to-do Indians are turning up as potential molesters. This is particularly disturbing, as there are no statistics on this in India (5). Child-to-child solicitation and abuse through the medium of mobile telecommunications is becoming a serious problem in India. Other kinds of abuse occur through social networking sites like Orkut where pictures of girls have been posted on communities with lewd allusions and a listing of the victims' mobile numbers. With new-media technologies available at lower costs, child sex abuse images are being increasingly made and uploaded from India (6). In a recent case in Kerala State, three girls committed suicide after increasing blackmail that the film of classmates raping them which had been taken on a mobile camera would be publicly circulated. Generally, it is a fact that unwanted publicity and fear of victimisation by law enforcement machinery are reasons why the largely conventional Indian families fear reporting child sexual abuse. 2. A Comparative analysis regarding definition and criminalisation of Online Child Sexual Abuse The word 'online' means all forms of information and communication technologies like the internet, mobile phones etc. …",

      "abstract": "An intriguing question in the field of stress is what makes an individual more likely to be susceptible or resilient to stress‐induced depression. Predisposition to stress susceptibility is believed to be influenced by genetic factors and early adversity. However, beyond genetics and life experiences, recent evidence has highlighted social rank as a key determinant of susceptibility to stress, underscoring dominant individuals as the vulnerable ones. This evidence is in conflict with epidemiological, clinical, and animal work pointing at a link between social subordination and depression. Here, we review and analyze rodent protocols addressing the relevance of social rank to predict vulnerability to chronic social stress. We also discuss whether a specific social status (i.e., dominance or subordination) is the appropriate predictor of vulnerability to develop stress‐induced depression or rather, the loss of social rank and resources.",

      "abstract": "Ageing and personality interact. While experiences that may be associated with age, including changes in roles and social networks, losses and health challenges, may require adaptation of aspects of personality, personality across the lifespan fundamentally influences how ageing is experienced. There are indications that extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness show reduced levels in later life, but people’s rank order on personality traits remains stable. Development continues into later life, but builds on earlier experiences and ways of coping. Personality resources such as self-esteem, perceived control, self-efficacy, and resilience shape the person’s response to adversity in later life, enabling older people to maintain high levels of well-being, despite the challenges. Dementia, the ultimate challenge, is accompanied by personality change, with raised neuroticism and lowered conscientiousness both predicting its onset and accompanying its course. Pre-morbid personality does also appear to have some influence on behavioural problems experienced.",

The ability to express oneself is crucial for social, emotional, educational, and vocational success in society. A popular theory of language development suggests that humans are social creatures who crave contact with one another. In view of this need to communicate and interact, it is apparent that people without adequate communication skills may face obstacles in many areas of life. As children grow and develop, there is an expectation that they will learn to talk. Numerous factors, from hearing loss to developmental delays, contribute to communication impairment. When the expectation of normal speech and language is not met, social and emotional problems can result, in addition to the communication disorder. Many problems secondary to communication disorders, such as isolation, ridicule, and academic failure, can be prevented with early identification and intervention.",

      "abstract": "Claims to understanding the nature of human nature must be evaluated empirically. Specifically, understanding implies and ability to predict (although not vice versa), an ability greater than the benchmark ability based on characteristics and categorizations naively used in social prediction - such as age, gender, social and educational status, medical and legal history, and so on. Moreover, an understanding of human nature implies a predictive ability that is greater than that obtained from a consideration of single characteristics and variables additively combined. A range of results indicates that such additive, ceteris paribus, prediction is all that results from social science research-and that many of the variables used in such prediction are of the benchmark variety. Given the lack of validity of predictions based on nonlinear, hierarchical, or interactive assumptions about human nature, we can conclude that social science claims about understanding it are unwarranted. Psychologists and other social scientists can, however, use their ceteris paribus knowledge of important characteristics to influence human behavior and important social outcomes",

      "title": "Media psychology: Modern man and nonlocality of psyche",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe relatively new concept of psychology[1] is steadily gaining ground in modern science, as well as in the minds of researchers, despite skepticism on the part of those who are used to the division of into the traditional branches, one of which is the of mass communication. However, more and more scientists are beginning to realize that psychology is not just a buzzword or a handy term but the name of a new phenomenological field, which goes beyond the boundaries of traditional classifications and concepts. In the past several decades, it has become clear that none of the existing disciplines can give a satisfactory answer to such questions as What is mass communication as such? and What are the patterns of its development? problem is that every time, depending on the position of the researcher, mass communication turns out to have different qualities and appears either to be in the technological or psycho-phenomenological sphere. It is impossible to limit ones research to only one approach because the accountability and controllability of technological processes are nullified by the intangibility and polyvalence of psychological processes, and psychological phenomena make complex causative links with technological ones. more advanced the communicative technologies are, the more unpredictable man's reaction is. Thus, attempts to control information flows lead to psychodynamic social processes going out of control and, in contrast, free stochastic communication leads to the processes becoming more streamlined. No sound explanation for the paradoxical phenomena of controllability / unpredictability, conditionality / spontaneity, openness / impermeability has been given so far. It seems as if we are dealing with an antinomy that cannot be resolved in the framework of the traditional linear-discrete model of mass communication, which implies the opposition of the speaker and the recipient, cause and effect, means and content. first man to go beyond the linear way of thinking typical of people working in this field was the Canadian philosopher and researcher M.McLuhan who expressed the essence of his ideas in the well-known formula The medium is the message (McLuhan, 1965), and even in the more defiant and seemingly illogical thesis The medium is the massage (McLuhan, 1967).Fifty years later, we see that the industrial era has given way to a digital age, which proves that McLuhans words were not a play on words but a clue, the elementary algorithm of the new paradigm of thinking created by mass communication itself. There is no doubt that electronic technologies have facilitated new thinking and the emergence of a new man and that people who lived in the days that the new technologies were introduced are different from those who see and hear the world through them today.The electronic mass media have changed the psycho-technique of perception, thinking and behavior and expanded man's mental abilities. Within the global information processes, mans thinking has acquired new qualities that could be defined as net-thinking[2]. It is a special form of psyche, rather independent and self- contained, with its own phenomena, paradoxes and system of self-regulation.Until recently, these phenomena were not considered to be a subject for serious scientific study, leaving only bold guesses, hearsay and much vagueness. Scientific publications were full of new terms, such as internet-dependence, virtual reality, virtual self (Gumanitarnye..., 2000), which marked, similar to milestones, flashes of research enthusiasm every time a new fact was discovered. However, most of the academic community looked on them as simply local phenomena that did not affect the existing system of concepts and the structure of knowledge.A global digital space, with its unprecedented possibilities, opened up so suddenly and without fanfare that, at first, nobody realized that a transition to a new stage in the development of science had occurred. …",

For example, inconsistent rates of time discount are largely eliminated when considered relative to the individual's perception of time. Preference reversals in real time from patient to impatient behavior occur only in a minority of cases. Time inconsistency, when it occurs, need not be associated with actual harms to decision-makers. Evidence for the existence of endowment effects is problematic. Gaps between willingness to pay and willingness to accept have no normative significance. The evidence for impact bias is confused and weak, and to the extent that it occurs, its function has eluded most analysts. In addition to these concerns, we find that the preferences typically treated as normatively superior by behavioral paternalists are often implicated by biases as well.",

      "title": "Mate Poaching, Infidelity, and Mate Switching",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most humans today practice social monogamy, characterized by exclusive, long-term attachments with a single other individual with whom they share emotional and sexual intimacy. However, people are prone to stray from these bonds. We review research on infidelity, mate poaching, and mate-switching behaviors. Infidelity entails the intimate (i.e., sexual, emotional, or both) involvement of one individual with another while in an exclusive relationship. Mate poaching entails attempts to seduce an individual who is already mated to another with the intention to usurp their partner, and mate switching consists of dissolving one relationship to form a new relationship with another. We review theory and empirical findings related to these phenomena, with a focus on evolved psychological mechanisms that explain why and how people engage in these behaviors, and what consequences they have. This research suggests that infidelity, mate poaching, and mate switching are influenced by sex differences in desire for emotional investment and in sexual frequency and variety, and by individual differences in preferences for novel experiences, antisocial tendencies, sexual permissiveness, and attachment orientation. It also suggests that relationship attributes, including relationship satisfaction, and situational factors, including quality of alternatives and opportunity, relate to why and how people pursue extradyadic partners, poach, and switch mates. We describe the evolutionary significance of these mechanisms, assess the extent to which research findings relate to these mechanisms, and discuss future research directions to increase our understanding of why and how these behaviors have been selected for over human evolutionary history.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "Although the criteria for the sexual disorders are relatively straightforward, they hint at the challenge of categorizing sexual problems. For example, a diagnostic system that intends to meaningfully describe sexual dysfunction must take into consideration the broad range of normal sexual response. The system must take into account the fact that dysfunction and distress depend heavily on the individual's expectations, wishes, and opportunities regarding sexual activity (as well as those of his or her partner). It should consider the effects of aging. It should consider the effects of proscriptive societal and religious norms on sexual behavior as well as take into account what it means to sexually function as a man or woman (or elsewhere on the modern gender continuum). The system should also take into account medications and illnesses that predictably reduce sexual desire and/or function, as well as those that predictably intensify desire and/or function, in addition to the reality that most assessments of sexual function and dysfunction are incomplete without an understanding that although sexual response has a biological underpinning, it is experienced from intrapersonal, interpersonal, and cultural perspectives. In that biopsychosocial context, making a diagnosis of, for example, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is potentially more complicated than briefly exploring whether the patient is interested in having sex. DSM-5 identifies eight sexual dysfunctions, four specific to men, three specific to women, and one that can apply to either gender (substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction). DSM-5 terminology and criteria vary somewhat between the genders. For example, men may have erectile disorder and/or male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, but for women, the somewhat comparable condition is merged into female sexual interest/arousal disorder. DSM-5-TR addresses the fact that both men and women can have difficulties with orgasm. Whereas women may meet criteria for female orgasmic disorder, men may be diagnosed with either delayed ejaculation or premature (early) ejaculation. Women can also have genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, a diagnosis that is new to DSM-5 and that was developed in response to the increasing recognition that the prior diagnoses of vaginismus and dyspareunia were highly comorbid and difficult to distinguish. In addition, as is generally the case in DSM-5, there are categories for clinical presentations that either do not quite meet criteria or are incomplete (i.e., other specified or unspecified sexual dysfunction). Except for substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, all of the sexual dysfunctions require a minimum duration of 6 months. In addition, each disorder can be noted to be lifelong versus acquired and generalized versus situational. If a medical condition is deemed pertinent, it can be listed as a specifier, but DSM-5 has specifically excluded the previous diagnosis of sexual dysfunction due to a medical condition because of the view that most of the sexual dysfunctions can be attributable to both psychological and biological factors. The sexual dysfunction diagnoses are applicable to gender-diverse individuals. In particular, DSM-5-TR encourages clinician judgment when assessing sexual dysfunctions among transgender, nonbinary, agender, and other individuals who may not appear to fit this chapter's categories. When the diagnosis is based on anatomy (e.g., erectile dysfunction), DSM-5-TR guides the clinician to base the diagnosis on the person's current anatomy rather than on the sex assigned at birth.",

      "title": "Mixed and conflicted: The role of ambivalence in romantic relationships in light of attractive alternatives.",
      "abstract": "People in romantic relationships tend to have positive feelings toward their partner and want their relationship to last. However, maintaining a romantic relationship over time is challenging, and people can often experience mixed and conflicting feelings (i.e., ambivalence) toward their significant other. While research has identified the serious consequences that ambivalence can have for personal and relational well-being, very little is known about the factors that can lead people to experience ambivalence in relationships. The present work examines how extradyadic desire (i.e., desire for someone other than the partner), a common difficulty people face in the context of monogamy, is a situation in which people feel more ambivalent toward their partner. In three studies (N = 1,178) using experimental, daily diary, and longitudinal approaches, we find that feelings of desire for an attractive alternative increase ambivalence toward the current partner, above and beyond how much people actually value their partner, and that this has short- and long-term negative consequences for personal and relational well-being. Furthermore, while most people could identify an attractive alternative in their life, desire for the alternative-rather than just their presence-seems to play a stronger role in increasing ambivalence. This work highlights the emotional processes through which attractive alternatives pose a threat to romantic relationships and the role that ambivalence plays in daily life and over time.

Attempts have been made to expand this principle to cover institutional discrimination. Discrimination is morally wrong because its premise that one group is less worthy than another is insulting to its victims, because it harms its victims by reducing their self-esteem and opportunities, and because it is unfair.",

Use of criminal history variables exaggerates differences between minority and white offenders, and increases racial and ethnic disparities. It is unjust ever to punish someone more severely than he or she deserves because of a prediction of dangerousness (or for any other reason).

      "abstract": "The clinical approach to pseudo-hermaphroditism shows the extent to which the subjective assumption of sex cannot be reduced to its determinants, be they biological or related to gender identity. One cannot discard the subject’s choice, which at times goes beyond the processes of identification or attribution. This is revealed through clinical practice, which, despite each case being unique, tends to align with the contemporary controversies raised in patients’ associations or subversive movements concerned with gender. Therefore, the treatment of children and their parents, while still being confronted with biological data, must be scrutinized through the irreducible subjective contingency to which it has to be referred. Whereas sexual difference is clear, each person contains a mixture of both sexes depending on his/her identifications and object choices.",

      "abstract": "Infertility deeply affects psychosocial aspects of young couples, who often erroneously take fertility for granted. The inevitable transformation from apparently healthy adults into patients can lead to loss of self-esteem, confidence, health, close relationships, security, and hope. Frequently, when emotional and psychological resources are diminished after prolonged infertility, the couple may express their desperate wish for a family in the form of accepting without reservation the risks of a multiple pregnancy, ignoring the undeniable increased morbidity and mortality associated with these gestations. It is unclear why a couple embarking on the journey of infertility treatment may prefer a pregnancy that is tenfold as likely to have a serious adverse outcome. Of the three potential explanations for such an attitude--desperation, denial, and ignorance--only the last one can be solved with patient education and adequate counseling. At the same time, it is unjustified to avoid assisted reproductive technologies because of potential adverse outcome, however necessary it is to acknowledge the risk of multiple births.",

      "title": "Sexual jealousy: Gender differences in response to partner and rival",
      "abstract": "Young women (N = 64) and men (N = 52) were asked to imagine discovering that their romantic partner had been sexually unfaithful. Fewer men than women gave positive endorsements to sets of aggressive actions against the unfaithful partner and against the rival. Gender differences did not appear in the motive for taking action against the rival, but more men than women endorsed releasing frustration as the motive for aggressive action against the partner. The genders appeared equally interested in maintaining the relationship with the unfaithful partner, preventing future infidelity, and attracting another partner. More men than women said they were uncertain about their partner's sexual fidelity. The results were interpreted as evidence that women are devalued more than men by an act of sexual infidelity, resulting in men's greater frustration with the partner's transgression but relative behavioral indifference to both the transgressing partner and rival. Men's greater uncertainty about a partner's infidelity may provide the basis for, as suggested by other data, men's greater tendency to ensure that a partner's infidelity and consequent devaluation never occur. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Claims of parental hostility or allegations of child sexual abuse in custody cases may trigger concerns about PA. Family court professionals (N = 280) rated young children's accuracy of report (e.g., suggestibility, honesty) in general and also read three custody scenarios varying as to whether or not they included allegations of parental hostility or child sexual abuse, or no such allegations. For each scenario, the alleged alienating parent's gender was experimentally varied between subjects. Participants rated the likelihood that each case involved PA. For the scenario that included allegations of child sexual abuse, professionals who viewed young children as more inaccurate reporters or who read about the mother (rather than a father) as the alleged alienator were more likely to rate the scenario as involving PA. For the scenario that described parental hostility but no child sexual abuse allegations, professionals who were older or female were more likely to judge the scenario as involving parental alienation when a mother (rather than a father) was the alleged alienator, whereas there were no significant predictors of responses to the no-allegation scenarios. Findings are discussed in relation to the difficult task of evaluating custody cases for PA when parental hostility or child sexual abuse is alleged.",

Index subjects are significantly more likely than controls to have a history of<i>role redefinition in family of origin</i>, and this is seen as being causally related to a motivational structure which predisposes them to risk unwanted pregnancy. Principal components of role redefinition are: (1) the daughter taking over some elements of her mother's role as wife or housekeeper; (2) the daughter's alienation from the mother; and (3) intimacy between the father and daughter which excludes the mother. The etiology appears to be distance and hostility in the parents' marriage. In addition to some combination of these circumstances having been present during adolescence, index subjects differ from controls in saying that their most important relationships have been with men, in disliking sex, and in receiving inadequate support from female friends and relatives.",

Yet other effects may be subtle and may be elucidated by a developmental biological perspective. In early life, when growth rates are highest, conditions of war may have their greatest impact. Depending on local circumstances, a developing embryo, infant, or child growing in a place embroiled in armed conflict is likely to face—directly or indirectly—various stressors, including malnutrition, infectious disease, and/or psychological stress.

      "abstract": "One likely consequence of the genetics revolution is an increased tendency to understand human behavior in genetic terms. How might this “geneticization” affect stigma? Attribution theory predicts a reduction in stigma via reduced blame, anger, and punishment and increased sympathy and help. According to “genetic essentialist” thinking, genes are the basis of human identity and strongly deterministic of behavior. If such ideas are commonly accepted, geneticization should exacerbate stigma by increasing perceptions of differentness, persistence, seriousness, and transmissibility, which in turn should increase social distance and reproductive restrictiveness. I test these predictions using the case of mental illness and a vignette experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey. There was little support for attribution theory predictions. Consistent with genetic essentialism, genetic attributions increased the perceived seriousness and persistence of the mental illness and the belief that siblings and children would develop the same problem. Genetic attribution did not affect reproductive restrictiveness or social distance from the ill person but did increase social distance from the person's sibling, particularly regarding intimate forms of contact involving dating, marriage, and having children.",

      "abstract": "The term wrongful birth denotes a claim brought by the parents of an unwanted child who was conceived or born due to medical negligence. The claims are often dismissed as contradictory to good morals or public order. However, there remains a neglected question whether the court decision to award or dismiss damages could constitute discrimination against the child concerned. While the child is not a party to the litigation, it is nevertheless unacceptable for the court not to take into account the effects of its decision on the child. In the case of award of damages, the court publicly affirms the legitimacy of the parents’ need for compensation, that is the fact that the child’s birth represents recoverable harm to them. The court decision therefore means a different treatment in respect to other children whose benefits for the family are generally recognized and praised by the society. That might have serious psychological consequences for the child, depriving her or him of the full enjoyment of the right to dignity. This fact constitutes discrimination on the grounds of birth, which can be justified only by very weighty reasons. Such reasons may be arguably given in the case of a child incapable of understanding the meaning of wrongful birth litigation, whose special needs are extremely burdensome on the family. On the other hand, the dismissal of the claim cannot represent a negative discrimination against the child.",

      "title": "Why are some individuals more resilient than others: the role of social support",
      "abstract": "Trauma is an inextricable component of the human condition. Most individuals are exposed to one or more traumas during their lifetime, but there is great psychological and neurobiological variability in how people respond to these events. While the majority of individuals are largely psychologically resistant or resilient to the negative consequences of trauma, a significant minority develop chronic, debilitating psychological symptoms that markedly interfere with their capacity to function; others may initially develop symptoms and recover, or develop late or delayed symptoms over time. What explains these differences? The answer is complex and only partially understood. Resilience is generally defined as the ability of an individual to bend but not break, to bounce back, and \"to adapt well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or even significant sources of stress\"1. However, this definition primarily focuses on the individual. In so doing, it fails to explicitly acknowledge that individuals are embedded in social systems, and that these systems may be more or less resilient in their own right, as well as more or less able to support the adaptive psychological capacities of the individual. Thus, responses to trauma and significant stressors are determined by multiple dynamic, interacting individual-level systems (e.g., genetic, epigenetic, developmental, neurobiological), which are embedded in larger social systems (e.g., family, cultural, economic, and political systems). Like resilience, social support is a complex construct with many definitions. One is from Cohen, who defines it as \"a social network's provision of psychological and material resources intended to benefit an individual's capacity to cope with stress\"2; another is from Eisenberger, who defines it as \"having or perceiving to have close others who can provide help or care, particularly during times of stress\"3. There are many facets of social support which, while overlapping to some extent, reflect unique aspects of this construct. These facets include: structural social support (i.e., the size and extent of the individual's social network, frequency of social interactions); functional social support (i.e., the perception that social interactions have been beneficial in terms of meeting emotional or instrumental needs); emotional social support (i.e., behavior that fosters feelings of comfort leading the person to believe that he/she is loved, respected, and/or cared for by others); instrumental/material social support (i.e., goods and services that help solve practical problems); and informational/cognitive social support (i.e., provision of advice or guidance intended to help individuals cope with current difficulties). These facets of social support can be facilitated and maintained by different systems, including family, community, and state, national, and international systems. Notably, while social support is a key correlate of psychological resilience, it is not universally helpful, as its effectiveness may vary by the type of support provided and the extent to which it matches individual's needs, which may change over time. For example, among Iraq/Afghanistan combat veterans, perceptions of family members' understanding of deployment-related concerns (i.e., functional support) was more strongly related to mental health and resilience than structural and instrumental support4. A large body of research has found that psychological resilience is generally fostered by environmental/caregiving conditions during childhood that are loving, emotionally responsive, consistent, and reliable5. This work suggests that, when the environment also provides ample opportunities to master challenges and stresses, it can have an \"inoculating\" or \"steeling\" effect, which can help promote resilience. Such social and environmental conditions can also support the development of individual attributes and skills commonly associated with resilience, including the ability to regulate emotions, self-soothe, solve problems under stress, form secure attachments, sustain friendships and intimate relationships, and acquire a realistic and positive sense of agency/self-efficacy5. However, when the caregiving environment is highly stressful and chaotic, animals and humans are at increased risk for developing exaggerated sympathetic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and emotional and behavioral responses to future stressors, which can persist into adulthood6. Many features of personality are heritable and some of these, such as extraversion and dispositional optimism, are associated with one's capacity to seek and utilize social support. However, the social caregiving environment may influence whether and to what extent these inherited features are actually expressed. For example, short allele carriers of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism were found to be more susceptible to the influence of parenting than long carriers7. Positive social support was also shown to moderate genetic risk for depression in maltreated children8. There is also emerging evidence that one's social environment may moderate genetic vulnerability to stress by triggering epigenetic modification of genes implicated in the stress response system9. Social support appears to be associated with resilience to psychopathology via a number of psychological and behavioral mechanisms, including motivation to adopt healthy and reduce risky behaviors; feelings of being understood; appraisal of potentially stressful events as being less threatening; enhanced sense of control or mastery; increased self-esteem; use of active coping strategies; and impact of social influence and social comparison. For example, in a study of individuals with cardiac disease, high functional and emotional social support (i.e., perceiving understanding from and confiding in family members, work employees, and the broader social network) was associated with increased use of active problem-solving, a coping mechanism that has been associated with resilience in several traumatized populations10. An emerging body of research has shown that threats to social connectedness, such as rejection and loneliness, activate many of the same neurobiological systems associated with physical threats and fear, including the amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, sympathetic nervous system, and HPA axis3. In contrast, positive social support has been shown to inhibit activation of fear-related neurobiological systems by activating the parasympathetic nervous system and brain regions, such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and caudate, which are implicated in the processing of safety cues3. Positive social support has also been shown to stimulate the release of oxytocin11, which is critical for social cognition and social behaviors, including accurate facial affect identification, social approach, affiliation, perceptions of trustworthiness, and sexual behavior11. Oxytocin has also been shown to have anxiolytic effects and to attenuate physiological, hormonal, and brain-level responses to aversive and potentially stress-inducing signals11. Overall, positive social support, through a variety of neurobiological mechanisms, can have a buffering effect on physiological stress responses, with a resultant salutary effect on mental (e.g., depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD) and physical health (e.g., cardiovascular disorders, immune function)3. On the other hand, preclinical and clinical research finds that weak social support and isolation are associated with indicators of compromised physical and mental health. The magnitude of impact of poor social support on all-cause mortality is similar to that of obesity, cigarette smoking and physical inactivity. Social support also influences rates of mental disorders. For example, meta-analytic findings have reported that low post-trauma social support is a consistent risk factor for PTSD12. Psychological interventions to increase individual resilience typically target personal skill development (e.g., training in physical fitness, cognitive reframing, mindfulness, social skills). However, they can also target family and community social systems13. For example, there is substantial evidence that one of the most effective ways to increase resilience in a child is to focus on the well-being and child-rearing skills of his/her parents6. A number of studies and programs have demonstrated that teaching at-risk parents to understand their own needs as well as the emotional and mental needs of their infant/child may enhance attachment security, and reduce a variety of later maladaptive outcomes, including child maltreatment and criminal behavior. Social support from one's community can also help foster resilience in the individual. Community members are strongly affected by the coping strategies of other community members, as well as by the community's capacity to prepare for and deal with adverse events and conditions. This becomes apparent during disasters, when individuals who are linked to pre-existing organizations and communities that are well prepared to deal with adversity tend to fare better than those who are not connected to or supported by community13. Communities can also enhance resilience in the individual through policies and programs that promote safe neighborhoods, affordable housing, food and employment stability, access to healthcare, effective schools, emergency and disaster preparedness, and ample public spaces for relaxation and exercise. Like other animals, humans have been endowed with great potential to weather and adapt to trauma and significant stressors. However, for natural protective systems to develop and operate effectively in the individual, ample social and material resources are necessary. Because resilience is dependent on multiple individual-level systems, which are embedded in larger social systems, future advances in understanding resilience and how to best foster it will require a broad-based multidisciplinary approach.

      "title": "Moral Decision and Information Aversion",
      "abstract": "This paper investigates an individual who has the rule-based and consequence-based moral tastes and has time-inconsistent intertemporal preferences caused by immediate gratification. The individual decides whether to undertake the activity that maximizes her own self-interest, but is uncertain whether it harms others. The individual at the earlier stage decides whether to access the information channel as the commitment devise for avoidance of preference reversals between the earlier-stage and later-stage selves, but is uncertain about whether this access is beneficial. The decision whether to access the information channel greatly influences the probability that social harm occurs. The relation between moral taste and pattern of information acquisition is clarified in the following way.

      "abstract": "This paper investigates an individual who has the rule-based and consequence-based moral tastes and has time-inconsistent intertemporal preferences caused by immediate gratification. The individual decides whether to undertake the activity that maximizes her own self-interest, but is uncertain whether it harms others. The individual at the earlier stage decides whether to access the information channel as the commitment devise for avoidance of preference reversals between the earlier-stage and later-stage selves, but is uncertain about whether this access is beneficial. The decision whether to access the information channel greatly influences the probability that social harm occurs. The relation between moral taste and pattern of information acquisition is clarified in the following way. The rule-based individual follows the morally bad pattern of information acquisition, while the consequence-based individual follows the morally good pattern. The individual with moral constraint follows the morally bad pattern if the moral constraint improves the earlier-stage self's morality, while she follows the morally good pattern if the moral constraint only serves to avoid preference reversals. It is shown that even if the access is beneficial, the individual is likely to misperceive it as being against her own interest and be averse to costless information.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A discussion of gender and conduct disorder must first answer the basic questions of whether or not there are any differences in prevalence, symptoms, and correlates of conduct disorder by sex. Several epidemiologic studies have found no difference in the prevalence of conduct disorder in adolescence by sex. Correlates of conduct disorder in girls are similar to those in boys (including aggression and internalizing disorders), once base rates of the correlates are accounted for. A major problem in studying conduct disorder in girls is the lack of appropriate criteria; the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (3rd ed., rev.) criteria are not appropriate for girls. A case is made for sex-specific criteria for conduct disorder that take into account known differences in male and female childhood cultures and base-rate differences in aggression and criminality. Until basic issues of diagnosis and prevalence are resolved, other issues such as risk factors and developmental pathways cannot be successfully addressed.",

      "abstract": "A infidelidade refere-se a qualquer forma de envolvimento romântico e/ou sexual, de curto ou\nlongo periodo, que ocorre enquanto o individuo esta em um relacionamento com outra pessoa.\nSeus impactos sao diversos, especialmente no que se refere as perdas do que se esperava para si,\no parceiro e o relacionamento. Pode-se compreender a infidelidade conjugal como uma perda\nambigua, dado que mesmo com a presenca do parceiro infiel, este nao e visto da mesma maneira,\nocorrendo mudancas em seu papel na familia. Por envolver ambivalencia, pode gerar luto nao\nreconhecido, um fator de risco para o luto complicado. Diante disso, o objetivo do presente foi\ncompreender a experiencia de mulheres que vivenciaram a infidelidade de seus conjuges e\nidentificar as perdas envolvidas nesse processo. Foram realizados estudos de caso com quatro\nmulheres heterossexuais que tenham descoberto ou tenha sido revelada a infidelidade do conjuge.\nAs informacoes foram coletadas por meio de entrevistas semiestruturadas e analisadas\nqualitativamente com base nas teorias que se referem a relacionamento conjugal e luto. Com a\nanalise dos casos, foi possivel perceber que a infidelidade conjugal realmente acarreta perdas\nmultiplas. Todavia, pode apresentar aspectos positivos, como criatividade e amadurecimento,\nsendo propulsora de mudancas. Foi perceptivel que todas as participantes, de alguma forma,\nvalorizam o amor romântico. Por outro lado, influencias historicas no que se refere a\nnaturalizacao do comportamento sexual masculino estao presentes em seus discursos. Foram\nconfirmados os riscos inerentes ao nao reconhecimento social ou intrapsiquico das perdas, o que\npode dificultar o processo integrativo de elaboracao. A compreensao da infidelidade conjugal\ncomo perda ambigua e luto nao reconhecido pode auxiliar na validacao social e intrapsiquica\ndessa vivencia, contribuindo para a construcao de uma sociedade que reconhece o luto em suas\ndiferentes manifestacoes.

      "title": "Indirect Discrimination",
      "abstract": "Discrimination is not a static phenomenon. It is changeable, and adapts to new circumstances; under attack it becomes subtle, even elusive. Its resilience rests on the self-perpetuating nature of power and on the hard-wired implicit biases carried even by those of us who cognitively abhor discrimination. In law, indirect discrimination involves an apparently neutral practice or policy which puts members of a protected group (say, women) at a disproportionate disadvantage compared with members of a cognate group (say, men), and which fails to satisfy a means-end justification test. Indirect discrimination occurs when an act impacts members of a protected group disproportionately, in comparison with its cognate groups. The line between direct and indirect discrimination is famously blurred. Conceptual untidiness, on its own, may not be worrisome enough, especially for a practical discipline like law. Once it is established that a protected group has been disproportionately affected by the concerned act, prima facie indirect discrimination has been established.",

      "title": "Self-Injury during Adolescence",
      "abstract": "In a society where boundaries become blurred and where appearance serves as identity passport, most teenagers seek to be distinguished from adults and to share with their peers marks which are understood as codes of integration. They do so through clothes and ornaments, and are tempted to mark the skin itself (piercing and, to a lesser degree, tattooing). But these signs of recognition are not enough, at least in their usual form, for teenagers who suffer from narcissistic and identical disorders. They try to distance themselves in the break by exaggerating this auto-labeling and/or by mistreating their skin. Among teenagers aged around 16 years, between 5% and 10% recognize that they deliberately harm themselves, more often females than males. The boys bruise themselves by banging voluntarily against hard surfaces, whereas the girls cut and, less often, abrade or burn their skin. The author describes these forms of self-inflicted violence and identifies them as typical or atypical, knowing that they have a diagnosis and prognosis as such self-inflicted wounds may express a temporary failure of the Oedipal process or reveal deeper personality and/or mood disorders. The author shows how self-inflicted injury constitutes an inaudible language that at the same time seeks relief and demonstrates an unconscious representation of psychic suffering. In addition, the author questions the functions of expression, inscription, and communication of these act-symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Berpacaran merupakan suatu tahapan bagi manusia untuk membangun attachment dengan lawan jenis yang umumnya dijalani saat berada di usia dewasa awal. Konflik tidak dapat dihindari dalam hubungan pacaran dan isu ini sering dikaitkan dengan masalah komunikasi. Self-disclosure dianggap menjadi salah satu cara untuk meminimalisir konflik. Individu yang merasa aman dalam membangun attachment memiliki kecenderungan untuk lebih banyak melakukan self-disclosure dan komunikasi secara langsung dibandingkan individu yang merasa tidak aman dalam membangun attachment. Studi ini bertujuan untuk meneliti apakah attachment yang terdiri dari dua dimensi, yaitu anxiety dan avoidance, memiliki pengaruh terhadap self-disclosure pada 72 pria dewasa awal yang sedang berpacaran. Penelitian dilakukan secara kuantitatif dengan menggunakan instrumen penelitian yaitu Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised dan Revised Self-Disclosure Scale. Hasil menunjukkan bahwa terdapat pengaruh negatif yang signifikan antara attachment anxiety terhadap self-disclosure (R2=.09, F= 7.127, p&lt;.05) dan attachment avoidance terhadap self-disclosure (R2=.22, F= 20.258, p&lt;.05). Artinya, semakin tinggi tingkat attachment anxiety dan/atau attachment avoidance seseorang, maka semakin rendah tingkat self-disclosure seseorang, dan sebaliknya. Namun, saat diperhitungkan bersama sebagai sebuah konstruk, hanya attachment avoidance yang memiliki pengaruh signifikan terhadap self-disclosure. Penemuan lain yang berkaitan dengan attachment dan self-disclosure juga turut didiskusikan.&#x0D; Kata Kunci: attachment, self-disclosure, berpacaran, dewasa awal",

      "title": "Strategies adopted by sexual offenders to involve children in sexual activity",
      "abstract": "The findings suggest prevention tactics that recognize the importance of structuring children's interaction with adults outside the family, rather than fostering informal or private contacts. The study found that offenders who used persuasion to involve their child victims in sexual activity were more likely to have a prior history of such offending, which suggests that this tactic has worked for them in the past and reduced the risk that their offense would be detected. In many cases, the same victim had been abused repeatedly. In some cases, keeping the victims silent about the abuse involved subtle, manipulative threats such as the withdrawal of love and abandonment. The study also found that offenders who abused older children were more likely to use persuasive rather than forceful tactics. This may mean that older victims, although initially resistant to sexual activity with the offender, may be more responsive to being treated as a sexual partner than are younger children. A third finding was that offenders who acted under the strong influence of deviant sexual fantasies were more likely to use persuasive tactics with their victims. Such offenders tended to have avoidant and dependent personalities, which not only explained their attraction to non-threatening children, but also explained their reluctance to behave aggressively. The study sample consisted of 226 adult males who had been convicted of a sexual offense against a child 13 years old or younger. Data were obtained from a 6-week assessment of risk level and treatment needs when admitted for incarceration in Canada between 1995 and 2000.",

      "abstract": "The characteristic of patheticness in the case of a young female victim of child abuse has been presented, underscoring the phallic quality of this trait and its root distinctiveness from the tragic character. Many patients, historical figures, and other individuals are prematurely judged as tragic when, in fact, we are reacting uncritically to the impact of their profound patheticness, at a point when, more often than not, such patheticness has not yet reached its lowest ebb, when it is still not too late to transform mute resignation to the neurosis of tragic fatalism into a more heroic deployment of destiny (Bollas, 1991, pp. 31-4). Phallic patheticness, in fact, represents a higher psychical achievement by virtue of its transient quality and its propensity to enable basic, if conflictual object-relationships and the recovery from psychic trauma. To be sure, many individuals with advanced personality structures have introjected into their personal value system a sense of the tragic, an identification with the tragic, or a special proclivity toward the tragic aspects of life, but this in and of itself does not render such individuals tragic, nor do they typically evoke in others the inner experience of maximum catastrophe or calamity. It is argued that the distinction between pathetic and tragic psychic structure can be clarified through carefully interpreted counter-transference.",

      "title": "Phenomenological Interview and Gender Dysphoria: A Third Pathway for Diagnosis and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Gender dysphoria (GD) is marked by an incongruence between a person's biological sex at birth, and their felt gender (or gender identity). There is continuing debate regarding the benefits and drawbacks of physiological treatment of GD in children, a pathway, beginning with endocrine treatment to suppress puberty. Currently, the main alternative to physiological treatment consists of the so-called \"wait-and-see\" approach, which often includes counseling or other psychotherapeutic treatment. In this paper, we argue in favor of a \"third pathway\" for the diagnosis and treatment of GD in youths. To make our case, we draw on a recent development in bioethics: the phenomenological approach. Scholars such as Slatman and Svenaeus have argued that the extent to which the body can (or should be) manipulated or reconstructed through medical intervention is not only determined by consideration of ethical frameworks and social and legal norms. Rather, we must also take account of patients' personal experience of their body, the personal and social values associated with it, and their understanding of its situation in their life: their narrative identities. We apply this phenomenological approach to medicine and nursing to the diagnosis and treatment of GD in youth. In particular, we discuss Zahavi and Martiny's conception of the phenomenological interview, in order to show that narrative techniques can assist in the process of gender identification and in the treatment of youth presenting with GD. We focus on two case studies that highlight the relevance of a narrative-based interview in relations between patients, HCPs, and family, to expose the influence of social ideologies on how young people presenting with GD experience their bodies and gender.",

      "abstract": "Feeling lonely motivates people to reconnect with others, but it can also trigger a vicious cycle of cognitions and behaviours that reinforces their loneliness. In this study, we examined the behavioural consequences of loneliness in a virtual social environment. A total of 176 participants navigated a character (protagonist) through a two-dimensional browser game and rated the character's loneliness multiple times during the game. In the first part of the game, another character is introduced as the protagonist's spouse. At one point, the spouse leaves for an undetermined period of time but later returns. Immediately before this separation, higher ascribed loneliness of the protagonist was associated with more frequent interactions with the spouse. After the reunion, however, higher ascribed loneliness was associated with less frequent interactions with the spouse. Ascribed loneliness was not significantly related to the frequency of interactions with others nor to the frequency of solitary activities. These patterns held after controlling for ascribed positive affect. Participants' levels of loneliness were related to the level of ascribed loneliness only when the spouse was present but not when the spouse was absent. In sum, these findings suggest that the conditions that trigger the vicious cycle of loneliness are person- and situation-specific.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Across successive chapters, three recurrent themes have emerged. First, it is part of a child’s biological endowment to be attuned to the beliefs and practices of the surrounding culture. This implies, contrary to the standard portrait of the child as steadily moving toward rationality and enlightenment, that children may end up with various assumptions and beliefs that have little connection with objective reality or secular reward. Second, children display a disconcerting mix of autonomy (in both the cognitive and the moral domains) whilst often deferring to the views of those around them. This disconcerting mix is illustrated by children’s attitudes toward gender. Many children go along with the expectations that come with the gender they are assigned at birth, but some transgender children do not. Third, children like adults often display inconsistency in their responses; for example, they may not overtly express prejudice toward outgroups, but, when appropriately tested, they reveal implicit biases against such groups. Finally, children display a mix of naturalistic and supernatural thinking.",

But in reality, in social life, a woman often gets inhumane treatment, be it in public life or domestic life, is treated rudely, and impressed as not considered, women are very vulnerable to violence, whether physical violence, psychic violence, violence sexual even neglect of household. Or even men do not respect women in the realm of the outside or inside the dwelling. Result in a significant difference to gender equality itself. The most important and protected women's rights are freedom, being treated equally in the eyes of law, teaching and education is absolute, as well as health, legal certainty and justice and legal certainty. Social ethics arises in everyone, according to their nature and character. Human nature can be seen from their actions in treating and respecting others, especially treating the opposite sex, not in accordance with ethics and social sense, then the person is considered disrespectful to others. The literature study is the method used in this study is to have a purpose to know gender and its equality be the cause of violence against women, and its relation to social ethics. The result is a patriarchal culture that assumes that men as rulers, while women are in a weak position or are perceived as \"male\" owners, and social ethics greatly affect respect for women, where social ethics strongly determines one's behavior and how to respect and respect for women's rights.",

      "abstract": "Inability to live out emotional reactions through adequate channels makes for efforts to forget and attempts to push the disagreeable thoughts from attention. Women in this situation often seek a means of flight, so to speak, from themselves. Work for them may be a form of protection. Many women disappointed in love or marriage take up nursing or go into a sisterhood. If conceive of the psychobiological development of a woman as a growth of mental and physical capacities, will recognize that there must be a unification of functions in the mental and physical realms. The components must be developed harmoniously if there is to be ease of activity. In modern civilization, a new problem has been presented to women in the breaking down of old economic and social barriers and the opening up of new opportunities. The traditional limitation of activity, the necessity for protection and support, are being challenged on all sides.",

The boys become uncertain of their gender identity and sexual orientation. Talking about the sexual arousal is mostly very difficult for the boys concerned. Although it is a considerable problem for them, there is a lack of research on the topic of sexual arousal in this context. In counseling and therapy it is a taboo issue.

This, in turn, has been claimed to require the use of a risk‐avoidant risk function when making decisions that primarily affect future people, and to decrease the desirability of efforts to prevent human extinction, owing to the significant risks associated with continued human survival. I raise objections to the claim that respect for others' risk attitudes requires risk‐avoidance when choosing for future generations. In particular, I argue that there is no known principle of interpersonal aggregation that yields acceptable results in variable population contexts and is consistent with a plausible ideal of respect for others' risk attitudes in fixed population cases.",

      "title": "Psychoanalytic Constructions of Female Development and Women's Conflicts about Achievement. Part I",
      "abstract": "Central to the dynamics that underlie women's conflicts about their own autonomous achievements are the reappraised psychoanalytic concepts of penis envy and masochism. These ideas need not be abandoned because of the phallocentric bias that is responsible for their initial formulation. When they are conceptualized as serving defensive ego-maintaining functions for the woman, their richness in expressing aspects of women's psychological experiences becomes evident. Both culturally ascribed meanings to physiological differences and the physical differences themselves have an impact on an individual's developing psychological sense of self, and of self in relation to others. Girls and boys have different anatomies, which give rise to different bodily sensations, different definitions of what is acceptable and what is taboo, and arouse different feelings and reactions in caretakers on whom the child is dependent. The girl's developmental task of separation and individuation is complicated in two major ways that are relevant to adult women's achievement-related conflicts. First, as a female child, she is both more closely identified with her mother and more closely identified with by her mother. Her sensitivity to relationship and loss--particularly in her bond to her mother--grows in part from the intensities of these reciprocal identifications and from the capacities for empathic, affective relating that cultural and maternal expectations impart to daughters. Because mothers are so identified with their same-sex children, and because, as women, they themselves have learned to sacrifice aspects of their autonomy for either nurturant or dependent functions, mothers communicate ambivalent wishes and expectations to their daughters. On the one hand, a daughter receives the injunction that she carry on for her mother by fulfilling her thwarted longings and by compensating, with her own achievements, for her mother's disappointments. On the other hand, the daughter receives the simultaneous message that her accomplishments arouse her mother's envy and potential retaliation, but, most destructively, threaten to leave her empty, without a dependent appendage through whom she can live and bolster her self-worth. The second, complicated, aspect of the girl's task of separation and individuation, which relates to her adult conflicts around achievement, lies in the relationship between the cultural devaluation of whatever women have to do, and the kinds of fantasies and experiences to which the more hidden, internal and mysterious female genitals lend themselves.",

The distinguishing characteristic of a cross‐sex friendship is that the friends are of different biological sexes. Similar to other kinds of friendships, such as same‐sex friendships, interracial friendships, and friendships of sexual minorities, cross‐sex friendships are characterized by generic benefits in the form of mutual trust, loyalty, fun, enjoyment, and social support which manifests itself as aid, affect, and affirmation. From a symbolic interactionist perspective, however, cross‐sex friends also offer one another the unique benefit of providing an insider's perspective on how members of the other sex think, feel, and behave. The bestowing of insider perspectives between cross‐sex friends enables males and females of all ages to take the role of the other sex, thereby increasing their understanding of their friend and the gender their friend represents.",

      "title": "From a Plane Crash to the Conviction of an Innocent Person: Why Forensic Science Evidence Should be Inadmissible Unless it has been Developed as a Safety-Critical System",
      "abstract": "In a criminal trial, it is acceptable to rely on scientific, specifically forensic, evidence. Forensic evidence is often produced through devices omprising both hardware and software, such as a breathalyzer - which measures the level of alcohol in an expired breath - and the equipment used to create a DNA profile. According to existing law, a person may be convicted on the basis of a single piece of evidence. Once a person has been convicted of a serious offense, such as murder or rape, an “ultimate penalty” may be imposed on him, such as life imprisonment or even a death sentence.Many studies conducted in the past few decades have revealed a significant phenomenon whereby innocent persons are convicted. This phenomenon can no longer be doubted or ignored. Hence, the inaccuracy or unreliability of forensic equipment could lead to the death or prolonged incarceration of an innocent person.Scientists and legal scholars have pointed out that some areas within the forensic sciences are nearly barren of a scientific foundation, that error rates are in fact higher than usually acknowledged by forensic scientists, and that laboratory regulation and quality control are weak compared to medical, research, other government, and private industry labs. This article adds something new to the scholarship in this area. It draws attention to the development of software and hardware used in crime laboratories, and to other forensic equipment used by the police, and questions why those are not held to the same development standards as other safety-critical devices in other realms where the safety of the public is concerned. As we shall see below, safety-critical systems, which pose a danger to human life or body integrity and could lead to significant economic loss, are found in many fields and industries, such as medicine, aeronautics, and transportation. In such fields, statutory rules have been enacted that are designed to minimize the danger of mishaps that could lead to catastrophes and significant damage. Regulatory bodies have also been established whose role it is to monitor the procedures used to develop these systems and to guarantee the safety of the end product. These bodies are not satisfied with a test of the final product as a “black box,” because that test is concerned only with the device’s output and not the way it works or its method of development.Instead, regulatory authorities demand that the device be developed safely at all stages. In particular, the manufacturer is subject to strict requirements related to the software of the device. One of the principles of software validation is that testing the program after it has been coded is not enough to verify software integrity and coherence. It is also necessary to ensure that the design, development and coding of the software, as well as its testing, were conducted in a manner that has prevented the introduction of defects. As we shall see below, the same caution is not applied to devices used to produce forensic evidence, despite the potential of such evidence to determine the fate of an individual. This is the case in particular with regard to evidence obtained through the use of computer software, which the courts are still willing to admit with an unfounded, dangerous optimism. This lack of caution is reflected in the evaluation of scientific evidence, while the device used to produce it is treated solely as a “black box.” The result is that findings obtained from a device such as a breathalyzer, which would not be approved based on standards applied to medical devices, are considered admissible evidence for the purpose of convicting a person in a court of law.In Part II of this article we will first explain, in detail, what safety-critical systems are, the importance of the standards applied to their development, and what system safety engineering is. In Part III we will illustrate the current attitude in a court of law towards scientific evidence, acquired using the breathalyzer, which is used to detect drunken driving, as a test case. In Part IV we will try to convince the reader that it is essential to develop forensic equipment as a safety-critical system. Finally, in the epilogue, we call on lawmakers to subject forensic evidence to the standards that apply to safety-critical systems in order to reduce the danger of convicting the innocent.",

      "abstract": "[EN]\r\nThe definition of cyberspace addiction concerns a relatively new and poorly studied problem in clinical and consulting psychology. The most common definition of internet addiction defines this specific behavior as obsessive pursuit of the patient to enter the network and his inability to get out of it in time. Our study shows that the gender more endangered to development of addiction to Internet are women, although men have the same habits of stay in the virtual environment plus two additional activities to which women do not exhibit substantial interest - computer games and eroticism. Cyber-dependents compensate for failures in social, family and personal life by the reality experienced in front of the monitor commutating their relationships - live (Internet mostly) or computer-modeled (games mostly) to achieve recognition, pleasurable experiences or a getaway from frustrating obligations and expectations.\r\nEntering in a role is an essential component of the experience in the virtual environment. Thus insecure, introverted or hypomanic personalities, individuals who do not know any better way of mastering their emotions and contact with others, achieve subjectively satisfactory social realization.\r\nThe computer can serve as means to satisfy compensatory behavior. Through the PC the individual can offset the need for independence and rejection of rapprochement with others and to oppose privacy interference. Essential element of compensatory behavior in the use of computer is the need to avoid failures. This is the risk profile of a student 14-15 years of age with negative social resonance regardless of location, with pronounced either dominant, or subordinate type, and low self-control (regardless of location). The chance of developing cyber-dependence is three times higher in people with hypomanic type compared to those within the norm.\r\nIn the city, the chance pupils 14-18 years of age with positive social resonance type to develop an addiction to cyberspace is 66.8 percent lower than a the one of a student with negative social resonance. For individuals designated as dominant type the risk is 3.2 times higher than for those identified as neutral type; the likelihood for individuals defined as subordinate type to develop dependency is 4,778 times higher than for the neutral type.\r\n////////////\r\n////////////\r\n[BG]\r\nОпределението пристрастеност във виртуалното пространство касае един относително нов и недобре проучен проблем в клиничната и консултативната психология\r\nСпоред най-разпространеното определение интернет пристрастеност е обсесивен стремеж на пациента да влезе в мрежата и неспособността му да излезе навреме оттам.\r\nПо-застрашеният пол за развитие на зависимост към интернет е женският, въпреки че мъжете имат същите навици при престой във виртуалната среда, както жените, плюс още две дейности, към които жените не проявяват съществен интерес – компютърните игри и еротиката. Зависимите компенсират неблагополучия в социалния, семейния и личния живот посредством реалността, която преживяват пред монитора, като комутация на връзките си със субекти – живи (предимно в интернет) или компютърно моделирани (предимно в игрите), за да постигнат признание, удоволствени преживявания, бягство от фрустриращи задължения и очаквания към тях.\r\nВлизането в роля е съществен компонент от преживяването във виртуалната среда, като неуверените, интровертни или хипоманийни личности, индивидите, които не умеят добре да владеят емоциите си и контакта с околните, постигат посредством компютъра субективно задоволителна социална реализация.\r\nКомпютърът може да служи като средство за удовлетворяване на компенсаторното поведение. Посредством компютъра личността може да компенсира потребността от самостоятелност и отказ от сближаване с другите, както и да се противопостави при намеса в личното ? пространство. Сред съществените елементи на компенсаторното поведение при употребата на компютър е потребността от избягване на неуспехи.\r\nРисковият профил е на ученик на възраст между 14-15 години, с негативен социален резонанс независимо от населеното място, с добре изразен или доминантен, или подчиняем тип и понижен самоконтрол (също независим от населеното място).

      "title": "he Relationship Among Adolescents’Self-esteem, Emotional Intelligence and Friendship Quality (Preprint)",
      "abstract": "<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Individuals will have a need for interpersonal intimacy during their adolescence. This need for intimacy depends on the sensitivity and mutual satisfaction of the needs of friends to meet each other. If teenagers lack the experience of interaction with close friends, it is easy to cause obstacles in life, personality and socialization ability in the future. Some scholars believe that individuals with high-quality friendship relations are easier to cooperate with others and have more social behavior characteristics than those with low-quality friendship relations, and have confirmed that there is a significant positive correlation between friendship quality and self-esteem1. Some literatures also further discussed the positive correlation between individual self-esteem and peer relationship2, Moreover, The concept of youth friendship will develop from concrete to abstract with age, and the importance of friendship to young people also increases with age3. Most studies agree that adolescents' self-esteem has a positive impact on their intimate friendship with their friends4.But some studies think that the relationship between friendship intimacy and self-esteem is weak5. Therefore, the correlation between self-esteem and friendship quality is worthy of further discussion. Although there are few literature on the relationship between emotional intelligence and friendship quality, there are still traces to be found. If adolescents can perceive the feelings and beliefs of others and adjust their own emotions in the interpersonal communication experience, it is helpful to the formation of friendship relations6. With the growth of age, friendship is more and more important for teenagers' emotional adaptation. Those who have better emotions are less likely to feel lonely. If individuals can not effectively control their own emotions or use emotion regulation strategies, they will fall into interpersonal difficulties and be difficult to establish close friendship with others7. In the research on children's peer relationship and emotional ability, it is also found that the higher children's cognitive ability and ability to understand multiple emotions, the better their interpersonal relationship8.As the individual，s emotion regulation strategies and expressions change dynamically with age, timely research on the relationship between adolescents，emotional intelligence and friendship quality is also a topic worthy of in-depth discussion. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> Introduction: The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship among self-esteem, emotional intelligence and friendship quality of adolescents. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> Methods：Data collection and analysis were conducted between March 12 and May 14, 2021. a total of 333 adolescents were investigated with the help of a questionnaire and the qualitative data of interviews were used to demonstrate the results. The data were analyzed by exploratory analysis and typical correlation analysis. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> Results：Self-esteem can explain 21.3% of the variance of friendship quality. All levels of self-esteem are positively correlated with company help, intimate communication, positive value, trust and respect in friendship quality, but negatively correlated with conflict and betrayal in friendship quality. Emotional intelligence can explain 36.4% of the variance of friendship quality, and all levels of emotional intelligence are positively related to the level of companionship, intimate communication, positive value, trust and respect in friendship quality, but negatively related to the level of conflict and betrayal in friendship quality. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> Conclusions：There is a typical relationship among self-esteem, emotional intelligence and friendship quality, and interpersonal self-esteem, trust and respect, companionship and help, and intimate communication are the main explanatory factors. Emotional adjustment, cognitive reappraisal, emotional control and company help, trust and respect, positive value, intimate communication are the main explanatory factors. </sec> <sec> <title>CLINICALTRIAL</title> 0000-0003-2962-934X </sec>",

Transsexualism has a biological etiology, but the outcome of the disorder is crucial interaction of social and psychological factors. Transsexualism or Gender Identity Disorder is present in all societies and civilizations. It also occurs in children and adult. Much higher incidence of transsexualism is in childhood and male. Treatment of transsexuals includes: psychotherapy, psychopharmacotherapy, hormonal and surgical treatment. During psychotherapy patient determines actual life goals for relations with a partner, family, friends and their job. Conducted training and inclusion in the group to make it through other people's experiences gained more realistic insight into the difficulties brought by the change of gender. If a person meets the criteria for a sex change, and after psychotherapy still has a strong desire to change sex, then it is subjected to a wide range of medical interventions. During this period is introduced in hormonal therapy. The procedure requires that the person before submitting to surgery has to be subjected to so-called real-life experience. For a period of 1-2 years, a person needs to live in the desired gender. If the person is still determined to change gender, then they approach to a surgical sex change.\r\nIn Croatia, a small number of experts are dealing with transsexuality. Transsexuality is considered just as a psychiatric disorder which contributes to the stigmatization of transsexual people. These people really suffer and often face rejection by family, friends, do not have the financial resources needed to treat, often suffer from depression.",

      "abstract": "Although definitions of illegal material, laws and practice within the criminal justice system (CJS) of various countries differ quite significantly, there is increasingly compelling evidence that only a minority of those found to be in possession of illegal images are likely to have been previously convicted for contact sexual offences (see Chapter 9 for further discussion). One possible explanation for this is that these offenders were arrested at an early stage in a process of escalation of deviant interest and behaviour which would probably, or even inevitably, result in a contact offence against a child or children. This belief has some face validity, and it is often implicit in the representation of Internet offenders in the media and in the accounts of some professionals. The assumption is that even in the absence of evidence for contact offending, consumers of child pornography present an inevitable, if not immediate, direct risk to children. It is very difficult to identify the processes implicit in the assumptions of risk, often because they are assumed to be self-evident. One possibility is that the accessing of sexually explicit material (SEM) reflects a covert planning process to engage in the behaviour depicted. Alternatively, it may be felt that SEMs are so toxic that they will inevitably drive an interaction between sexual fantasy and behaviour such that contact offending becomes inevitable, or at least highly likely.",

      "abstract": "People find inherent satisfactions in helping and contributing to others for nonselfish reasons. Self-determination theory (SDT) suggests that being benevolent is often intrinsically motivated, or alternatively done out of deeply internalized social values that are autonomously enacted. In turn such behaviors satisfy basic psychological needs and thereby enhance subjective well-being. A further question concerns more ultimate explanations. Drawing on both SDT and evolutionary psychology, this chapter argues that the association of these proximal need satisfactions with moral and prosocial actions has persisted because these propensities and satisfactions have yielded manifold selective advantages. In addition, need-thwarting conditions evoke more aggressive, competitive, and self-protective strategies. The fact that people typically experience benevolence as deeply need satisfying, and doing harm to others as need frustrating, is thus an aspect of how proximally experienced satisfactions in individual development are linked with the evolutionary roots of our human nature.",

It plays an important role in determining women‟s status in the household and men’s status within the male community at large. In some societies, there is a stigma attached to female children. Giving birth to a baby girl or not having a son can lead to the feelings of shame , embarrassment, disillusionment and ignominy on the side of the parents , specially for the mothers who have to see having sons as the signs of prestige, popularity and glory. Strangely enough, the male dominated society treats sonless fathers as impotent! This propels the fathers to point the finger of accusation at their wives, an act which is manifested in abuse or pejorative disparaging discourse and forcing the wives to bear more children under duress. This study has been an attempt to shed some light on the interplay between love, gender, discourse, emotions and identity. The whole process of the interrelation between love, gender and behavioral patterns is surrounded by prejudice, hegemonic patriarchal discourse and cultural beliefs and value systems. This study aimed to analyze the situation in Turkish families to see the extent to which children’s genders are intermingled with the parents’ and communit’s love towards them. Key words: Motherhood, Gender, Fatherhood, Love, Discourse, Patriarchal attitude, Identity, Preference for male children.",

      "title": "We share more attributes than we think: the crucial input of epidemiology",
      "abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology, as is the case for most domains in psychiatry, does not have strict borders in what goes under its umbrella. Still, it can be broadly defined as covering, among other subjects, the various environmental and genetic etiologies, the course and prevalence, and the two-way relation of societal factors in mental disorders, all in large samples of individuals. An interesting observation is that psychiatric epidemiology consolidates a major axiom, simple at first look, but profound in its implications: broadly speaking, humans share much more common mental attributes than we had thought. In fact, studying very large populations across the globe has taught us very clearly that there are major highways which seem to be predetermined by the simple fact that we belong to a given species. Be it the effects of prenatal factors, including genetics, of childhood adversities, of major trauma, war, economics, chronic illnesses or temperament; be it schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or phobias; all studies point increasingly in cross-national samples to similar conclusions. This makes the field of psychiatric ep­­idemiology quite interesting, echoing its origins in the more sociological approach to mental health and now looking at the variety of biological markers and their relation to determinants of onset, course and treatment of mental health disorders. This has been, understandably, a very exciting field, which has defined the lifelong commitment of members of the WPA Section on Psychiatry Epidemiology and Public Health over the years. This Section was founded in 1967 and re-named \"Epidemiology and Community Psychiatry\" until 1997, when it acquired its present name. The Section gathered progressively the most prestigious experts in psychiatric epidemiology and public health, such as J. Wing, who was its president for years, and designed the famous Present State Examination (PSE), followed by the Schedule for Clinical Assessment of Neuropsychiatry (SCAN)1; H. Hafner, who conducted a unique work on the epidemiology of schizophrenia2; and N. Sartorius, who worked on behalf of the World Health Organization all over the world, and led among others the influential International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia3. Other prominent Section members pioneered the discipline by launching exten­sive populations surveys, such as T. Helgas­on in Iceland, with a birth cohort of more than five thousand probands followed up to their deaths4, and A. Leighton and J. Murphy in Canada, who set up the Stirling Country Study, a large population survey allowing to study population mental health up to the fourth generation5. To this list we can add L. Robins, who de­signed the Diagnostic Interview Survey (DIS)6, the first diagnostic interview usable by lay interviewers, a huge step in mental health epidemiology, whose DSM-III computerized algorithms allowed to evaluate the prevalence of mental disorders in the US in the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study, a landmark in the field under the leadership of D. Regier7. That instrument stimulated the development of the now worldwide used and continuously evolving Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)8, which, under the inspiring leadership of R. Kessler, was used in the World Mental Health (WMH) Initiative, that gathered surveys in 40 countries all around the world, and is still growing, with more than 1,000 publications so far (www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmh). The output from WMH covers a huge variety of subjects, including prevalence, risk factors, burden, course, treatment, conceptualizations and definitions of most mental disorders. Many of the WMH contributors are active members of our Section. Looking back, the Section has been able to organize twenty meetings all around the world. The themes of these meetings reflec­t­ed the large scope of epidemiology and public health in the domain of psychiatry and mental health. Some meetings were more clinically oriented, such as \"The Chronical­ly Mentally ill\" (Baltimore, US, 1982), \"Primary Care and Psychiatric Epidemiology\" (Toronto, Canada, 1989), and \"From Epidemiology to Clinical Practice\" (Turku, Finland, 1999). Others focused on longitudinal perspectives, such as \"The Course and Outcome in Mental Health Disorders\" (Groningen, The Netherlands, 1993), \"Prediction is Psychiatric Epidemiology: from Childhood and Adolescents to Adulthood\" (Lisbon, Portugal, 2010), and \"Epidemiology of Mental Disorders Across Lifespan and Development\" (New York, US, 2018). Some focused more on research, such as \"A Search for Causes: Epidemiological Approaches\" (New York, US, 1995), \"Psychiatric Epidemiology and Social Sciences\" (Oslo, Norway, 1991), \"Theory Evidence and Psychiatric Epidemiology\" (Paris, France, 2003), and \"Psychiatric Epidemiology Meets Genetics: The Public Health Consequences\" (Munich, Germany, 2016). Two meetings focused on \"The Future of Epidemiology\" (Edinburgh, UK, 1985, and Baltimore, US, 2001). Public health aspects were the focus of several more meetings: \"Unmet Needs\" (Syd­ney, Australia, 1997), \"Epidemiology­ and Medical Economics\" (Brisbane, Australia, 2006) and \"From Epidemiology to Mental Health Planning\" (Saskatoon, Canada, 2008). Others focused more on risk factors, such as \"Mental Health and Urbanization: Challenges of Societies in Transformation\" (Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2012) and \"Trauma and Mental Health\" (Nara, Japan, 2014). The forthcoming meeting will be held for the first time in Africa, in Morocco: \"Learning from Diversities Across the World: Implications for Psychiatric Epidemiology\", scheduled for October 2022. We carry a tradition in our meetings, which is to minimize parallel sessions, in order to foster real exchange between the presenters and the audience. We thus set up a theme and then try, as much as possible, to organize sessions coherent with this theme, with highly recognized speakers and much time devoted to active discussions. The concentration of highly committed specialists during these meetings has been a great source of inspiration for many beginners in the field, and has been decisive for the career of many young researchers. The atmosphere is typically friendly, and sessions deal with a very limited number of topics, which allows beginners and experts to dig deeper. In conclusion, the broad perspective of epidemiology and public health in all areas of mental health encourages international collaboration, and crucially examines how much, in fact, humans look alike and how lessons learned from one site can be generalized to humans all over.",

The development of an individual is a complex of processes which work individually to the production of specific organs, and collectively to the development of the individual as a whole. Modern studies in heredity indicate that, typically, each part develops to a certain extent independently of every other, at least in the early stages. Later the secretions of thyroid and thymus, testis and ovary, and doubtless other organs, exert a general or a specific influence on development.

      "abstract": "1. The superego is a group of compromise formations, all having to do with morality, which originate, in large part, in the oedipal phase of development. 2. Once formed as a consequence of conflict, the superego functions as a major component of (subsequent) conflicts. 3. Its role in conflict is diverse. It functions now as defense, now as the equivalent of a drive derivative arousing unpleasure, and now as a calamitous unpleasure to be avoided or mitigated. 4. For a young child \"moral\" equals approved by parents, while \"immoral\" equals the reverse. The crucial moral questions at the time of life when the superego is largely formed are, \"What will win or forfeit parental approval?\" and \"What will rouse or dissipate parental wrath?\" 5. From the side of ego functioning, superego formation involves much more than identification with parental superego demands and prohibitions. Any aspect of ego functioning which furthers parental approval and/or avoids disapproval and punishment can and does participate in superego formation. 6. From the side of the drives, both libido and aggression are involved in superego formation. Hence masochism plays a role in normal superego formation and functioning as well as in those pathological cases which Freud called moral masochism. 7. Superego pathology is not to be understood, as it has been generally understood by analysts until now, in terms of defective or incomplete development. Everyone has a fully formed superego. Superego pathology must be understood on the same basis as is the pathology of any compromise formation.",

      "abstract": "Context: Effect of sexual relations on mental and physical health has been the concern of the Iranian physicians, over a thousand years ago. Sexual ethics is one of the specific health topics of Iranian medicine archives. From the Iranian medicine point of view, because of different mental and physical differences in human, their sexual power and need for sex is different. It is necessary to observe the normal range, since the sexual indulgence causes different illnesses. Evidence Acquisitions: In Iranian medicine, different variables such as time, location, mental and physical situation, and also various forms of sex are discussed in sexual health. Safe sex not just reduces many mental disorders, but also prevents many neurological, digestive, urinary and genital disorders. Also, sexual indulgence is most harmful for health and causes stiffness, weakness and different diseases; therefore observing moderation in sex, according to the therapeutic characteristics and power, has been emphasized. Results: To have safe sex, it is necessary to consider time, mental, and physical status. Having sex when the stomach is full impairs digestion. Sexual relationship after heavy sports and severe emotional reactions such as anger or sadness, and after diarrhea or blood sampling is harmful. It has been recommended that having sex in temperate weather, and after evacuation of urine and feces, considering necessary arrangements, make the couple reach orgasm. Also, in the Iranian traditional medicine references, specific nutritional and health recommendations have been proposed for the sexually active people. Conclusions: Health care recommendations of Iranian physicians involve precious and new points for the updated scientific communities. Scientific revision of these recommendations can be promising for public health improvement.",

Its details are not pretty, they can repel and disgust and bring on demands for retribution. The numbers are large, Patterns are beginning to take shape showing who the victims are and who the abusers, and why. The impact is becoming known and it is huge. What one father does to his three children can grow in geometric proportions as those children each do the same to their three children, and these to theirs. The impact on crime is just becoming known: sexually abused children are prone to criminal activities and may well be a major cause of crime. The impact of false reports is also becoming know. The Salem witch trials are always before us. The possibilities of false accusation out of revenge or on a dare, or in a pique are not new, accusations satisfy a child's need for attention and status, and other children may see the possibilities for themselves. But where the sexual abuse is within the family, a hard choice must be made: to punish the offender heavily or to work with the abuser and the family to prevent future abuse. You cannot do both. It appears that the courts can bring highly beneficial results: they can provide comfort for a child victim, but more, they can provide treatment for that child and reduce the pain and guilt and fears and for that child break the cycle of abused children abusing their children who abuse their children who abuse. The courts can provide comfort for a family, but more, they can provide rehabilitation for most families where there has been abuse, restoring their strength and security. The courts can prosecute the abuser and punish him, but more, they can instead often provide rehabilitation for the abuser which is a surer way of preventing a recurrence than the disgrace of a prison. Much needs to be discovered. But from what is now know, the courts and the police and the social agencies need to be sensitized to the problem in all of its aspects. The opportunities for positive accomplishment are great.",

Grave difference is that death of older person is rarely scrutinized carefully. It is regardless of risk factors of possible abuse or neglect as it is for children and younger victims of sexual and domestic violence, who are healthy and unexpected to die. Additional differences include old age often bringing medical and physiological attributes that mimics or masks, markers of elder abuse and neglect, further complicating analysis and detection. Elderly have multiple medical problems and dependencies, misguiding assumption that these are prone to stressors causing natural death. Factually, older persons have fewer support systems and reserves—physical, psychological, and economic, magnifying impact of abuse and neglect. A single mistreatment is more likely to trigger a downward spiral, leading to dependency, serious complicating illness and even death.",

Against the background of fundamental processes of individualization careers are ever less explainable by class and social strata. Rather biographies have become fluid and therefore less and less clear and expectable; they can develop in quite different ways. How can one under such conditions decide and develop expectations regarding the life course? Even though traditional and rational patterns are under pressure we do not expect that conventional certainty constructions will be supplanted by non-rational constructions as luck, trust or affect. Indeed, when stability is improbable and rational explanations meet their limit, such constructions are appropriate and are used to manage greater contingencies. But they are used in a rationalised form. Therefore it is rather observable that rational and non-rational constructions mingle to produce biographical certainty and this is shown by examples.",

      "title": "Phases in the drinking history of alcoholics. Analysis of a survey conducted by the official organ of Alcoholics Anonymous (Memoirs of the Section of Studies on Alcohol)",
      "abstract": "The study of the genesis of alcoholism seeks, as a rule, such landmarks in the personality development as may indicate the problem which the individual attempts to solve by means of intoxication. There may or may not be a further attempt to understand why the alcoholic man or woman chooses this particular solution instead of some other means. Supplementarily there is usually a search for environmental elements which presumptively foster such artificial adjustments as habitual inebriety. Thus etiological research on what is commonly called alcohol addiction but less pretentiously may be designated as habitual inebriety† concerns itself primarily with psychodynamics leading up to—and social factors which may precipitate—gross inebriety. The weight is nearly all on the prealcoholic phase of alcoholism. The drinking career receives little attention in such studies. Phases of inebriety, forms of drinking, changes in the drinking pattern and even changes other than drinking habits occurring in the course of inebriety, do not appear to be regarded as significant landmarks in the development of alcoholism. Drinking histories of sorts are nearly always obtained but they are limited to such questions as the time heavy drinking began, what and how much the drinker consumed and how frequently, what kind of relief or discontent was brought about by drinking, why—if ever—the drinker went \"on the water wagon\" and whether there had been any hospitalization because of alcoholism. Such data are gathered routinely and seldom form the basis for any theoretical elaborations. There are, nevertheless, some investigators who see significance in the drinking behavior itself. Tiebout's thoughtful paper on the syndrome of alcohol addiction* is one of the exceptional instances.",

      "title": "Belief traps: Tackling the inertia of harmful beliefs",
      "abstract": "Beliefs can be highly resilient in the sense that they are not easily abandoned in the face of counterevidence. This has the advantage of guiding consistent behavior and judgments but may also have destructive consequences for individuals, nature, and society. For instance, pathological beliefs can sustain psychiatric disorders, the belief that rhinoceros horn is an aphrodisiac may drive a species extinct, beliefs about gender or race may fuel discrimination, and belief in conspiracy theories can undermine democracy. Here, we present a unifying framework of how self-amplifying feedbacks shape the inertia of beliefs on levels ranging from neuronal networks to social systems. Sustained exposure to counterevidence can destabilize rigid beliefs but requires organized rational override as in cognitive behavioral therapy for pathological beliefs or institutional control of discrimination to reduce racial biases. Black-and-white thinking is a major risk factor for the formation of resilient beliefs associated with psychiatric disorders as well as prejudices and conspiracy thinking. Such dichotomous thinking is characteristic of a lack of cognitive resources, which may be exacerbated by stress. This could help explain why conspiracy thinking and psychiatric disorders tend to peak during crises. A corollary is that addressing social factors such as poverty, social cleavage, and lack of education may be the most effective way to prevent the emergence of rigid beliefs, and thus of problems ranging from psychiatric disorders to prejudices, conspiracy theories, and posttruth politics.",

      "abstract": "Curiosity, which is the human motive to seek information, is extremely valuable, since it enables people to widen their horizons and develop their capacities. However, there are many cases in which curiosity is harmful and not learning more information is preferable. In the romantic realm, this complexity is particularly relevant. Although knowledge is valuable in romantic relationships, there are circumstances in which ignorance and avoidance of information may be more beneficial. I suggest the restriction of central virtues of romantic love, such as curiosity and sensitivity, while giving some limited weight to oft-called vices in romantic relationships, such as ignorance and indifference. This suggestion has significant implications for the nature of romantic relationships, and in particular, for enhancing flexibility and diversity of such relationships, and the ongoing need to find an optimal balance.",

      "abstract": "Delinquency and criminal behavior are multidimensional and complex process involving the interaction between environmental factors and individual tendencies. These behaviors are defined as acts and attitudes that violate social norms and individual or privacy rights of others. Social and economic costs of delinquency in society are caused that understanding its causes participation of some adolescences in antisocial behaviors and non-participation of some adolescences, is considered as priorities of prevention of social pathologies. Despite being a multidimensional delinquent behavior, pattern of antisocial and delinquent behavior can partly be explained by some personality characteristics. Thus one of the important directions in the study of criminal behavior is investigation of the link between the personality traits with inclinations of crime and delinquent behaviors. However, criminal behavior is influenced by some personality traits. Various researches show that the psychotic personality traits, extroversion and neuroticism can predict delinquency positively. Some of the researches have also discussed that main personality traits such as impulsivity, are better predictors than psychotic features, extraversion, and neuroticism for delinquency. In particular, high negative emotionally, the tendency to experience avoidance affective states and lack of inhibition, predict antisocial and delinquent behaviors. Considering the better understanding of personality traits of delinquent people can help in perception, assessment, and design interventional planning, the aim of present study is deeper study and identification of personality traits and psychological backgrounds such as cognitive abilities in delinquent people, and providing necessary recommendations and guidelines in connection with the prevention of social pathologies",

      "abstract": "The term sex is ambiguous, referring to both sexual difference and sexual behavior. Most psychoanalytic research over the past few decades has focused on the former (often under the rubric of gender) to the neglect of the latter. Likewise, the academic field of queer theory has drifted away from thinking about sex in favor of other objects of inquiry. In this chapter, Dean thinks through the difficulty of sex, and specifically the challenge of dispelling certain assumptions about it—such as its dyadic relationality, ineluctable heterosexuality, vulnerability to pathologization, and its status as either symptom or cure. For Dean, what is most proper to psychoanalysis is not heterosexuality, but a sexuality that undoes stable binary categories. He refers to Freud's famous quip that there are at least four people present in any coupling of two, showing how psychoanalytic insight makes simple arithmetic not so simple at all. What may be symptomatic, in the end, are our assumptions that we can say with certitude what sex is. Our confident descriptions and prescriptions are perhaps symptomatic of the relentless pressure induced by the enigmas at the heart of sex.",

      "title": "The impact of maternal depression on familial relationships",
      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric illnesses. It is particularly common in women of childbearing age. It is recurrent and tends to have a chronic course and is often comorbid in nature. It is important to view depression within its social context, as it is a disease, which impacts not only the individual but also the wider community. Evidence abounds as to the negative impact of maternal depression on children, husbands/partners, and family. Children of depressed women show deficits in social, psychological, and cognitive domains and are at increased risk for depression themselves and other psychiatric illness such as conduct disorder. They are also at an increased risk for child abuse. The mechanisms by which maternal depression may lead to child psychopathology including genetics, poor parenting, modelling, and environment are explored. Many children with depressed mothers cope well and escape negative effects; consequently the concept of resilience is elucidated. Research shows that a significant percentage of men become depressed when their wives/partners are depressed particularly if they have postnatal depression. There is an increase in marital discord and conflict within families of depressed women, all of which can have a deleterious effect on children. Children with two depressed parents are at an elevated risk of a negative outcome as compared to those with only one depressed parent. Finally the various interventions, management, and recommendations are examined.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Research provides evidence of a distinctive gendered landscape of mental illness, with women and men differing in the types of disorder they commonly experience – a landscape that is not specific to Western societies. While there are no marked gender differences in the rates of psychoses like schizophrenia or in dementia, women have higher levels of affective disorders, such as depression, and of anxiety disorders, and men have higher levels of substance abuse and conduct disorders. Consequently the observed gender difference in overall levels of mental illness depends on what disorders are included in the measure. The gendered patterning of mental disorders is now usually linked to differences between women and men in gender‐related tendencies to internalize or externalize their feelings, women more often internalizing their feelings and men more often externalizing them. While such differences may be influenced by genetic factors, they also relate to the socialization of women and men in childhood – a gender socialization that is linked to the expectations of what is required of them in adult life. Further differences in women's and men's social situations also have a direct impact on the gender‐related expression of feelings in the face of life events and difficulties.",

Hence, the reasons for, and circumstances of, sexual homicide differ from one offender to another. Still, subgroups of sexual homicide offenders are currently defined in terms of a fairly limited combination of risk factors. The purpose of this chapter is to suggest that neuropsychological/neurological assessments may help in confirming the presence (or absence) and severity of key risk factors in sexual homicide offenders. Based on data obtained with other types of offenders, it will be argued that using a few targeted neuropsychological tasks, and low-cost electroencephalography, would help evaluate pivotal factors in sexual homicide offenders, such as empathy, impulsivity, deviant sexual interests, social cognition, proclivity for outbursts and rage, and intelligence. These evaluations should help not only in confirming the presence of these neurologically related traits, but also in determining objectively the therapeutic effects (or lack thereof) of these specific factors in a given individual (e.g. higher empathy, lower impulsivity).",

      "title": "What About the Exculpatory Effects of Ignorance?",
      "abstract": "Even if we have epistemic responsibility, exculpatory reasons exist for holding undesirable beliefs. One of the most important of these is ignorance. While a variety of ignorances exist, some ignorance is a socially constructed obfuscatory practice. When this occurs, individuals may not reasonably be expected to know any better—and if we can't know better, then there is an important sense in which we are not responsible. In systemically racist or sexist societies where those beliefs are built into the epistemic practices of the community, individual epistemic agents might just have good epistemic reasons to hold undesirable beliefs. We can ask, however, to what extent we are obligated to overcome socially constructed ignorance. While it is surely impossible for us to challenge all our biases, it is possible for us to challenge some of them. There are occasions when we encounter other epistemic communities with beliefs that challenge our; there are times when we encounter evidence that potentially undermines the beliefs we hold. That there may be some specific instances of exculpation does not mean all socially constructed ignorance is always exculpatory. Each of us has an epistemic responsibility, but not each of us has the same epistemic responsibility.",

This loss, with its deeply destructive consequences (in terms of personality development) is one of the factors that can possibly sign the entrance to child psychosis. Although one can rarely attribute, with certainty, the onset of such severe emotional disturbances to only one factor, the hypothesis can be maintained that the desires and wishes of the woman, while expecting a baby, play a determining role on the fate of child. One should also add that it is not infrequent to observe various changes and fluctuations in the attitudes of mothers after the child is born. Still, the material of the cases under discussion (of which only two will be presented here) seems to point towards a development in which the pre-birth way of experiencing the child on the part of the mother puts a definite and particular sign on the object relations to follow.",

There are two key aspects to emphasize in this definition: first, the sexual interest in children is persistent, and second, the children of interest are prepubescent and thus show few or no signs of secondary sexual development. This means that someone who has expressed a sexual interest in children or who has engaged in sexual behavior involving a child is not necessarily a pedophile. It also means that individuals who are attracted to sexually maturing children or sexually mature adolescents, even if they are below the legally defined age of consent, are unlikely to be pedophiles.",

      "abstract": "Demoralization is a feeling state of dejection, hopelessness, and a sense of personal \"incompetence\" that may be tied to a loss of or threat to one's own goals or values. It has an existential dimension when beliefs and values about oneself are disconfirmed. Numerous sources describe high rates of dissatisfaction and burnout in physicians and other health professionals. This article reviews historical and empirical findings that describe the professional and personal value orientations of physicians and other health professionals. It reviews empirical and theoretical findings to consider the implications of conflict between these values and negatively perceived ethical and values orientations of health care organizations and commercial health care entities. Conflicts between personal and professional values of health professionals and larger health care related organizations and commercial entities with which they are associated may contribute to the development of demoralization and burnout. Physicians and other health professionals frequently experience values related conflicts with larger social, organizational or bureaucratic systems. These conflicts place health professionals at risk for demoralization and burnout. \"Remoralization,\" or renewal of morale, depends on the reestablishment of the potential for fulfillment of one's values in the work environment. This depends on organizational, group, and personal efforts. Continuing education and continuing professional development programs should have a programmatic focus on the importance of a values orientation in health care and support program development aimed at recognizing, addressing, and reducing demoralization and its potential for negative health care consequences for health professionals and patients.",

Medical disorders, drugs, lifestyle, relationships, and age might affect libido (e.g., puberty). Hypersexuality is having frequent or suddenly increased sexual impulses; hyposexuality is the opposite. In psychoanalytic thought, libido is a mental drive or energy, connected with sexual instinct but is also present in other innate urges. A man may want sex but not be able to act on it, or may not for medical, moral, or religious reasons. Repressing or sublimating an urge is psychological. One can participate in sexual activity without a sire. Stress, illness, and pregnancy affect sperm drive.

      "abstract": "Mr Jones sought treatment for what he experienced as his \"ambivalence\". He did not know who he was and was deeply unhappy that he could not have any meaningful relationships. At the beginning of his therapy Mr Jones declared that he was gay, but he consistently tried to find out whether he could be heterosexual. Mr Jones' anxiety about his father's hostility and passivity and his mother's seductive acquisitiveness made it impossible for him to find a safe object – either man or woman – to relate to sexually. Instead, his identifications with his oedipal couple led to alienation. He could not satisfactorily express his sexuality or engage in a relationship of his choice, whether homosexual or heterosexual. He retreated into masturbatory activities, taking his own body as his sexual object.",

      "title": "THE PROBLEM OF CO-DEPENDENCY AS A LACKING SENSE OF INTERNAL SELF-IMPORTANCE",
      "abstract": "The article reveals the problem of co-dependency as a lacking sense of internal self-importance. The problem of co-dependency which is being raised by psychiatrists, drug treatment specialists, psychologists, neurologists is increasingly actualized due to every year expansion and deepening of chemical addiction scale. The article exposes the concept of co-dependency, examines the psychological component of a personality that seeks to control the behavior of others rather than care about the satisfaction of his own vital needs. A co-dependent person ceases to distinguish between his own needs and goals and the goals and needs of his loved ones. Feelings and interaction methods circle around, inevitably bringing the individual back to reproducing the same mistakes, problems and failures. The article emphasizes that any significant relationship generates a certain amount of emotional co-dependency, since letting our loved ones in our life, we will surely respond to their emotional state and one way or another, adjust ourselves to their lifestyles, tastes, habits and needs. However, healthy or mature relationship always leaves enough space for meeting our own needs, achieving personal goals and individual personal development. Psychoactive substance addiction is a family disease that is why addiction therapy system should include not only drug addiction treatment, but also co-dependency treatment. Help is required for the patient, as well as his wife, parents and other relatives living together with him. Addictive behavior correction program can not purport to be effective without the representation of a personalized approach directed at a specific addict and his family. The emphasis on the significance of this position is extremely important at the initial stage of correction, drug addicts differ in addiction development degree. Keywords: co-dependency, need, value, personality disorder, adaptation disorder, controlling behavior, scope of emotions, external evaluation.

      "abstract": "Abstract : Male erectile disorder (ED) impacts the sexual functioning of ten to twenty million men in the United States. Erectile disorder, as withother sexual dysfunctions, may be caused by, or associated with a number of diseases that impact the cardiovascular and nervous systems. However, men who have few physical problems may also experience the disorder due to psychological factors. Men who suffer from ED due to psychogenic factors are believed to differ from functional men in five key cognitive and behavioral domains. Barlow and Sbrocco (1996) used these differences to formulate a model of male sexual dysfunction that explicitly addresses the cognitive mechanisms involved in ED. The model proposes that a key point in the development of ED is whether or not a man feels challenged or threatened when experiencing a discrepancy between expected and actual performance. Men who are challenged by the experience typically have the skills necessary to identify and alleviate the discrepancy in performance. They are believed to use positive outcome expectancy and confidence to overcome suboptimal sexual performance and maintain function. In contrast, men who are threatened by discrepancies between expected and actual performance may expect a negative outcome and have little faith in their ability to sexually perform.",

To determine whether evidence is logically relevant to a matter requiring proof the judge must formulate a generalisation from his own experience and what he understands to be conventional wisdom. There are problems with this approach, however, for some aspects of human life are more widely understood than others, and what is thought to be a valid generalisation may in fact be nothing more than a vague or unwarranted stereotype. Moreover, conventional wisdom itself may be suspect because different cultural groups (including different generations) are unlikely to view the world in the same way or share the same values. What might appear to be a valid generalisation to one generation might well be considered absurd by another. Problems such as these have bedevilled the law governing the admissibility of the complainant's sexual experience in cases where the accused is alleged to have committed rape or some other sexual offence against her.",

States of ignorance are often closely aligned with oppression, subordination, and exclusion, are socially situated, and arise from unequal and unfair differentials in power.

In prior prejudice attribution research, the stigma that made the victim subject to discrimination was a characteristic beyond the individual's control, such as age or race. In the present research, controllability of the stigma was systematically varied. Subjects read scenarios in which persons with flaws of speech or appearance were subject to discriminatory behaviors of derogation, exclusion, or unfair treatment. The flaws were either within or beyond the control of the individual possessing them. More prejudice was attributed to those who behaved in a discriminatory way toward persons whose flaws were beyond their control. The theoretical explanation offered for the outcome is that discrimination can be thought of as form of harmdoing, and prejudice attribution as a form of blame attribution.",

Among a sample of 260 self-identified kinky users of a kink-oriented social networking website living in 21 countries, we examined self-reported narratives of the origins of kink desires. An inductive coding process by four independent coders yielded 20 categories of responses, organized into five broad discourses about the origins of kinky desires: identity (e.g., personality, personal taste, and role exploration; 72.7% of responses), nurture (e.g., both traumatic and non-traumatic life experiences; 38.1% of responses), negation (e.g., disavowing or doubting a particular idea about the origins of their kink interests; 24.6% of responses), nature (e.g., biology and genetics; 22.7% of responses), and uncertainty (e.g., not being able to identify an origin of kinky desires; 10.4% of responses). Fewer than 19% of participants mentioned any kind of trauma in their responses. We discuss implications for scientific understandings of kinky sexual desire within the umbrella of sexual diversity.",

      "title": "VIOLENCIA: UNA REVISIÓN DEL TEMA DENTRO DEL MARCO DE TRABAJO DE INVESTIGACIÓN EN EL INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE PSIQUIATRÍA*",
      "abstract": "Hasta hace relativamente poco no se le daba importancia plena a las diversas manifestaciones de la violencia, pero en la actualidad cada vez son mas los trabajos de investigacion que se realizan para conocer este problema en sus diversas areas. La violencia es un fenomeno extenso que se manifiesta tanto en el ambito interpersonal e individual como social. En consecuencia, como concepto es igualmente amplio, multisemantico, ya que senala distintos atributos que hacen enfasis segun el campo especifico del que se habla. El fenomeno esta imbricado lo mismo en la guerra que en el crimen organizado y la delincuencia comun. En ocasiones se da en las instituciones del Estado, pero tambien se manifiesta en la familia, ya sea entre los conyuges o la pareja, hacia los hijos o cualquier otro integrante de esta. Existe violencia con implicaciones particulares como la violencia sexual hacia los ninos, el incesto y la violacion, asi como violencia autoinfligida, como el suicidio. Para los profesionales de la salud mental, cada forma en que se manifiesta la violencia tiene implicaciones particulares en terminos de los efectos, ya sean en la salud fisica, la salud mental o en los aspectos psicosociales. En este sentido es importante obtener conocimiento sobre el tema, ya que muchas de estas areas no han recibido la atencion que merecen. Dado lo anterior, el interes del presente trabajo ha sido organizar y sintetizar la informacion de las diversas investigaciones llevadas a cabo en el Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria sobre el tema de violencia, con el fin de ofrecer una panoramica que nos permita ubicar las principales areas y como se han trabajado, asi como discutir hacia donde seria conveniente continuar los esfuerzos. Durante la vida academica de nuestra institucion de salud se han llevado a cabo diversos proyectos de investigacion vinculados con la problematica de la violencia. Por un lado, estan los trabajos que asocian el consumo de alcohol y violencias como los accidentes de transito, los delitos, los ingresos a salas de urgencia y la violencia en la familia, entre otros. Por otro, se encuentran los trabajos que asocian el consumo de drogas con alguna forma de violencia, particularmente las muertes violentas como los accidentes, la violencia delictiva y la familiar. El mayor numero de trabajos se concentra en el area de la salud mental, ya que esta incluye una amplia variedad de temas como la conducta suicida -que incluye ideacion, intento y suicidio consumado-, ademas de trastornos asociados, intimamente ligados con hechos de violencia, como el estres postraumatico. Asimismo se han abordado gran variedad de aspectos psicologicos y psicosociales, como la violencia de genero. A pesar de lo anterior, aun hace falta mayor investigacion en areas especificas como los efectos del secuestro, la tortura y el abuso sexual, asi como investigacion centrada en los perpetradores. El resultado de la investigacion es fundamental ya que, previo a la intervencion, es necesario conocer las diversas implicaciones en la salud mental; por ejemplo, que trastornos se asocian y por que a las distintas violencias, y que otras consecuencias pueden surgir. Precisamente, todo el conocimiento generado es de gran ayuda para una intervencion oportuna en las victimas. Pero tambien se puede incidir en un ambito mas amplio; por ejemplo, utilizando la informacion obtenida para influir en las instituciones, tanto legales como educativas, asi como considerar la posible influencia de los medios masivos de comunicacion. Esto podria tener una repercusion positiva en el nivel social, ya que el fenomeno de la violencia comprende por igual a las victimas y a los perpetradores. Ambos grupos han recibido una influencia cultural y social que hay que conocer para hacer lo posible por contrarrestarla.",

      "abstract": "The great variety of developmental mechanisms which may be involved in the genesis of abnormalities is emphasized. The following examples are presented: Too little growth; too little resorption; too much resorption; a resorptive process normal in character but occurring in an abnormal location; a growth process normal in character but occurring in an abnormal location and, finally, too much growth of some particular structure or tissue. With this variety of developmental mechanisms involved, the futility of expecting to find any blanket cause of congenital defects should be self-evident. Moreover, one would not expect to find the various causative factors even in the same category. See figure in the PDF.file In cases of too little growth, i.e., cases of the \"developmental arrest\" type, one would naturally look for deficiency factors, or for inhibiting factors-genetic or environmental. In the case of too much or too little resorption as a secondary moulding process, or with growth or resorptive processes out of their normal territory, one would look for regulatory factors. So, also, with disturbances in timing, which were not discussed but which I believe we will find of great importance when we know more accurately the rate at which critical developmental process should normally progress. See figure in the PDF.file Finally, especial emphasis is placed on defects involving the overproduction of a tissue, or a structure, because the factors which might cause overgrowth must be of a different nature than the inhibiting or deficiency factors we have so long been accustomed to emphasize. See figure in the PDF.file I feel certain that in other papers in this conference there will be stressing of the multiplicity of etiologic factors, as well as similar emphasis on the variety of developmental mechanisms involved. I believe that we shall gain the conviction that each type of defect and each possible etiologic factor must be intensively studied on an individual basis if we are to make sound progress instead of bogging down in a morass of vague generalizations.",

For many women who\nenter adulthood with no memory of CSA, coming to ‘know’ they were\nabused relies on a redeﬁnition of memory to include not only ‘recall memory’\nbut also ‘alternative memories’ such as imagistic memory, body memory,\nfeeling memory and acting-out memory (Fredrickson, 1992; Herman, 1992;\nWhitﬁeld, 1995). These memories, often shown as lists of symptoms, can take\nthe form of dreams and ﬂashbacks, physical or bodily experiences, feelings\nsuch as sadness or anxiety and other events or diﬃculties experienced in\nadulthood. They are often said to be held by an inner child, or children, who\nmay be stuck at the time of the abuse and inﬂuence the thoughts, feelings\nand behaviours of adult victims. Alternative memories occupy a central\nposition in the sexual abuse recovery literature but there are many other\ninterpretations for such symptoms. It is only because they are deﬁned as such\nwithin this literature that these ‘symptoms’ can be identiﬁed as ‘memories’ of\nsexual abuse.",

Whereas friendship is, in most cases, a socially accepted and highly valued relationship, there is a form of friendship which appears to be, if not unacceptable, at least discouraged and ignored– opposite‐sex friendship with a married person. Because it is discouraged, the role remains undefined. The reason for the lack of a socially accepted and defined role of friend of the opposite sex to a married person seems to be related to society's negative evaluation of adultery and its fear that this type of close relationship may become adulterous. It is ironic, however, that society's lack of definition of this role may actually be causally related to at least some adultery.",

Children correctly labeled talk about nonpresent others as gossip and considered it inappropriate. Skepticism was higher for gossip than for firsthand information and was greatest in the presence of cues suggesting that speakers were unreliable or harbored ulterior motives. Surprisingly, skepticism of gossip decreased with age. Attributions for speakers' behavior were sensitive to subtle contextual cues, and in the absence of clear motives, children, particularly girls, were likely to assume that gossipers spread false information out of jealousy. Overall, preadolescents appear to have a relatively mature understanding of the limitations of gossip, treat gossip with skepticism, and judge harshly gossipers who spread false gossip.",

Stress is not the sole causative factor, but genetic as well as biological changes in the depressed individual play important role in the onset of depression.

      "abstract": "The (Dis)value of Commitment to One's Spouse anCa ghEauS IntroductionMarriage is about commitment: future spouses typically say-among other things-to each other, and to the world, that they are willing to remain in a close relationship \"for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health.\"That is, they declare that the survival of their relationship will not depend on whether the relationship will turn out to be convenient and that their marital intentions do not depend on their future life circumstances.Whether marriage vows are to be understood as a promise, as an attempt to promise, or as a mere statement of intention, they express the future spouses' commitment to each other.Common sense usage links commitment with a promise to do something or an intention to be loyal to someone or something.Entering marriage with somebody usually involves all senses of commitment.Many believe that marriage is the paradigmatic case of an attitudinal commitment to another person or to a relationship.Throughout this essay I discuss (marital) commitment as being \"to a relationship or to a person,\" rather than settling for any of these.Philosophical literature on close relationship and love in general sometimes focuses on the value that a relationship has for an agent, and sometimes on the value that another person can have for an agent.There is clearly a difference between being committed to a relationship-and therefore being willing to do what it takes to protect that relationship and help it flourish-and being committed to a person-and therefore being willing to do what it takes to protect the (dis)value oF coMMitMent to one's spouse | 205",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this literature review was to get an overview about the research on lived experiences of elderly spousal dyads, in which one partner has early cognitive problems. Couples might first experience forgetfulness as something normal for old age. If symptoms become too great, the dyad will go and search for meaning. Through medical assessment the affected spouse will be diagnosed as either non-demented or demented. Both situations are experienced as hard and worrisome. However, if diagnosed with non-dementia, the dyad remains confused about what is going on and how to anticipate the future. In spite of the enormous impact of early cognitive problems on the relationship, both partners are still able to contribute to the quality of it and seem to have few reciprocity issues. How couples are different and what this means for the experience of early cognitive problems remains largely unexplored.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Relationships with brands are like relationships between people. Even when they were very close, they can fail for diverse reasons. The disadoption of favorite brands doesn't happen overnight. It tends to be an extended, often painful process and not a clear-cut, one-off event. Breakups are not isolated to the person and the brand. Friends and family often get involved and offer their opinions and advice. Other brand relationships are also affected by the disconnection, and this can speed up or delay the process of breaking up. The brand relationship changes its form and can go from being a best friend to a platonic love, a distant friend, a stalker or even an enemy. A breakup is never the end of the relationship. Rather, it redefines the relationship and is part of a never-ending cycle of change. If the former relationship is perceived positively, it is easier to eventually activate and intensify it. If negative aspects prevail, negative word of mouth is a danger and companies must be able to counter it. Some relationships reach a point of no return. But there are also customers who might regret having abandoned a brand. With some sensitivity, it might be possible to win them back.",

      "title": "Personal Ethics versus Professional Ethics",
      "abstract": "Abstract : Integrity, honesty, and moral conduct are essential elements in a good leader. Most people would agree with that statement. Disagreement comes when these standards are applied equally to personal and professional lives. The general thinking of society today maintains that if it doesn't hurt anyone else, I can do whatever I wish. What I do in my private life is my business. My employer has no right to evaluate or punish me for my private conduct as long as my job performance is not degraded. This philosophy is applied -- especially in the civilian sector -- to using drugs, drinking alcohol, having sex, lying, and cheating. Increasingly, the courts are agreeing with this position. In the military, we take a different view. Drugs are not tolerated. Alcohol abuse can ruin a career. Sexual involvement with other people in the workplace is disciplined -- and in many cases prohibited. Dishonesty is severely punished. Since becoming a general officer, I have heard senior leaders say at various times to closed-door gatherings of general officers, you are sleeping around with someone other than your spouse, stop it! You will be discovered. If you insist on such conduct, have the integrity to resign and take off your uniform. These are strong words, and the implication is clear: for senior leaders, private and public lines are almost erased. We do not have the freedom to conduct ourselves any way we desire in private. Unfortunately, we can no longer assume that ethics and integrity are givens for people who solemnly take their oath of office as military personnel. Thus, we must institute controls and accountability. In so doing, we are saying that private and professional ethics must be the same. I am firmly convinced that integrity and ethics must be built from within, reserving the law and fear as last choices only. The real question is, How do we do this? In this article, I submit a number of suggestions for consideration.",

      "abstract": "Structured interviews with 3.5-12-year-old children and their mothers were directed at documenting the development of 4 psychological categories of food rejection. The first to appear is rejection based purely on sensory characteristics, usually taste ( distastes ). Rejection based purely on anticipated harm following ingestion appears next (danger). Finally, the oldest children and adults show rejection based on the idea of what something is or where it comes from. This ideational type of rejection further differentiates into affectively laden rejections of substances that become offensive ( disgusts ) and more neutral rejections of substances as simply not food (inappropriate). A critical psychological feature of disgusting substances in adults is that they are \"contaminants\": they render an otherwise liked food inedible if present even in trace amounts, or if associated with a liked food. Contamination sensitivity is not present in the younger subjects, and appears gradually in the age range studied. Young children are unaware of the physical chemistry of solutions (e.g., diffusion and its lack of reversibility) and therefore do not show a \"contamination response.\"",

      "abstract": "Is higher social class associated with greater happiness? In a large nationally representative U.S. sample (N = 1,519), we examined the association between social class (household income) and self-reported tendencies to experience 7 distinct positive emotions that are core to happiness: amusement, awe, compassion, contentment, enthusiasm, love, and pride. Consistent with past research indicating that social class underlies differential patterns of attending to the self versus orienting to others, higher social class was associated with greater self-oriented feelings of contentment and pride, and with greater amusement. In contrast, lower social class was associated with more other-oriented feelings of compassion and love, and with greater awe. There were no class differences in enthusiasm. We discuss that individuals from different social class backgrounds may exhibit different patterns of emotional responding due to their distinct social concerns and priorities. Whereas self-oriented emotions may follow from, foster, and reinforce upper class individuals' desire for independence and self-sufficiency, greater other-oriented emotion may enable lower class individuals to form more interdependent bonds to cope with their more threatening environments.

      "title": "A Consideration of the Validity and Reliability of Suicide Mortality Data",
      "abstract": "The question of the validity and reliability of suicide statistics may be considered at three levels: (1) Are suicide deaths misidentified or differentially identified across jurisdictions or over time? (2) To what degree are suicide deaths misidentified? and (3) Is the degree to which suicides are misidentified sufficient to threaten the validity of research based on suicide statistics? There is general agreement that suicides are likely to be undercounted, both for structural reasons (the burden-of-proof issue, the requirement that the coroner or medical examiner suspect the possibility of suicide) and for sociocultural reasons. There is also substantial anecdotal and empirical evidence suggesting that the mode of death for some true suicides is in fact certified as other than suicide. Overall, it does not seem that very many true nonsuicides are incorrectly certified as suicides. There is not, however, much agreement as to the degree to which true suicides are undercounted. At least some of the inconsistencies in the findings of different investigators arise because the validity of suicide certification seems to vary from place to place. But the source of apparent conflicts in many of the findings is undoubtedly the lack of a \"gold standard\" against which the verdicts of any given death certification process can be measured. At best, we can estimate that the sensitivity with which coroners and medical examiners certify true suicides varies from approximately 55% to 99%. A central question in estimating the sensitivity of suicide certification is this: What proportion of true suicides are either equivocal or likely to go unsuspected by the coroner or medical examiner? Very little has been done to investigate this issue. Yet the sensitivity of suicide certification clearly varies for equivocal versus unequivocal suicides. As shown in Table 1.2, specificity is also at issue when it comes to certifying equivocal cases. The final question--whether the degree of undercounting of suicide deaths is so great that it threatens the validity of research based on official statistics--is at the crux of the general concern about suicide certification. There are examples of studies in which conclusions based on crude comparisons of reported suicide statistics appear to be invalid. For the most part, these are comparisons among nations with substantially differing death certification procedures. When official statistics are interpreted with a degree of caution and an understanding of the source and direction of biases likely to affect the published rates, however, it seems unlikely that major conclusions based on these statistics will be in error.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Thc c~hical issues arising in social science research tend to vary as a func­ tion of the particular research methods employed. Fer-example, certain genres of social-psychological experiments have created ethical concerns because they involve mlsrecresenrarion of the purpose of the research to the partici­ pants or because they subject participants to stressful experiences. Some organi2ational or large-scale social experiments have been troubling because participation may be seen as damaging to the long-term interests of certain groups. Survey research has on occasion been criticized for probing into sensitive areas, such as sex, religion, or family relations. Participant observa­ tion research may constitute invasion ofpri\\'acy, particularly when Invesuga­ lars I;aln access by misrepresenting themselves or make covert observations. Cross-cultural studies have been charged with exploitation of Third World populations and disrespect for their cu\\lural values. I The purpose of the present chapter is to provide an overview ofthc types of ethical .ssues that confront the different methods used in social research. The overview is intended to be more than a checklist, ticking ofTthe problems that arise with each research method. but less than a comprehensive, overarching scheme for categorizing and organizing all orme problems.

Two aspects of the process by which these consequences occur are described: a breakdown of the personÆs systems of interpretation and valuation, which may leas to reality shock; and the reconstruction of those systems that take into account the stigmatized characteristic. The latter aspect is associated with frequently noted sequels to stigma, including identity reconstruction, changes in affinitive patterns, and revisions of long-range plans and goals. Key elements in both major aspects are the master-status character of stigma or, in other words, its being a status that takes precedence over all other; the widespread knowledge of stereotypes associated with a given stigma; and the actual and imagined responses of others.

That is, in many circumstances, happiness is more effectively achieved when other objectives are regarded as worth pursuing for their own sakes than when happiness alone is regarded as worth pursuing for its own sake ( see Happiness; Hedonism; Intrinsic Value). These other objectives might be regarded as ultimately valuable instead of happiness, or merely in addition to happiness; but they must be valued for their own sakes, and not merely as means to the achievement of happiness. These other objectives may include loving family relationships and friendships, meaningful professional relationships, immersion in rewarding work, the exercise of skills and abilities, accomplishments and triumphs, participation in religion or a large cause or movement, and contributions to one's culture or nation.",

      "abstract": "The paper discusses the reasons why conspiracy theories emerge (the desire to belong, survive, be close with the members of the group, and maintain a positive image of ourselves and the community). Theories and results of research about psychological factors that are believed to influence the emergence of conspiracy theories are presented. The authors conclude that belief in conspiracy theories is highly dependent on epistemological, existential, and social motives. Research has not yet shown that these theories serve to satisfy these motives, and it is even possible to the contrary, that these theories do not strengthen social cohesion at all, do not lead to improvement of self-esteem and a more positive image of ourselves or the group we belong to. Important questions remain open and more research needs to be done about the consequences of believing in conspiracy theories, especially in vulnerable populations, which have been found to have the highest motivation to accept these theories. The tendency to believe in conspiracy theories is a phenomenon influenced by many factors. Some of these factors are belonging to a lower socio-economic background, a lower educational level, a tendency to outsource one's own responsibility for life's failures, or to neglect the genetic and educational factors that led to it. However, many other factors, such as mental health status, also determine this phenomenon. Poorly integrated, deeply insecure personalities who have not overcome the schizoid-paranoid position of development, tend to perceive the environment as perceptual and threatening, with the aim to protect their own self from deeper disintegration.",

We normally ignore this and treat humanity as the deciding mark of personhood, no doubt because the terms are locally coextensive or almost coextensive. At this time and place human beings are the only persons we recognize, and we recognize almost all human beings as persons, but on the one hand we can easily contemplate the existence of biologically very different persons—inhabiting other planets, perhaps—and on the other hand we recognize conditions that exempt human beings from personhood, or at least some very important elements of personhood. For instance, infant human beings, mentally defective human beings, and human beings declared insane by licensed psychiatrists are denied personhood, or at any rate crucial elements of personhood.",

Except that I am not an academic and this is not an academic essay but a story of someone usually identified as a (transsexual) woman. Except I don’t identify myself as a binary transsexual woman but as a non-binary assigned male at birth (AMAB) person. In writing about my sex life I want to ask a few questions about (my) gender, sexuality, identity and deception. \r\nSex, at least for me, can be risky in more ways than one. I’m anally receptive but sexual risk for me is not all about possible exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), it is also whether a sexual encounter might leave me as a victim of “trans panic”: will the next person who fucks me perhaps beat me senseless before claiming I deceived them and they didn’t know I was AMAB until it was too late? Am I at more risk, and also more deceptive, if a partner thinks I’m a cis-gender woman or a binary transsexual woman? Just where does the line between being “out and proud”, passing and deception lie for me as a non-binary AMAB surviving in a largely binary world? \r\nIn this essay, I thus wish to explore how issues of sex and deception might interact and raise questions for me as a non-binary, AMAB person. In doing so I will attempt to interweave a critical analysis of some media stories of sexual deception with an autoethnographic account of sex. I am not wise enough to have answers to my questions, however, but instead hope that others may do so.",

When true parental abuse and/or neglect is present, the child’s animosity may be justified and so the parental alienation syndrome explanation for the child’s hostility is not applicable.3 Absent from this definition is specific reference to sexual abuse allegations, but these are often the “denigration” to which Dr. Gardner referred in his definition. In this context, PAS becomes a litigation tool for the accused parent to discredit the validity of the child’s sex abuse allegations by mounting an attack against the “inducing parent.” Although PAS may be hailed as a “syndrome” (a group of symptoms that occur together and constitute a recognizable abnormality), in fact it is the product of anecdotal evidence gathered from Dr. Gardner’s own practice.4 The purpose of this article is to briefly discuss the major premises upon which PAS is based, and to identify key weaknesses. Part 2 of this Update considers case law and strategies for meeting PAS defenses. PAS is based primarily upon two notions, neither of which has a foundation in empirical research.",

      "abstract": "The sex and gender identity disorders of the DSM are reviewed. The major male and female sexual dysfunctions, concerns, and problems are described, including assessment, diagnostic considerations, and causes of these difficulties. Controversies surrounding how to conceptualize sexual problems are discussed, as are theoretical and practical problems of classification in the DSM. Psychogenic, interpersonal, psychosocial, and organic factors in the development of the sexual dysfunctions are reviewed. Such distinctions are more accurate in theory than in practice, where sexual problems are typically multi-determined. Sexual problems tend to be intertwined, as when difficulties with arousal and lubrication lead to pain on intercourse as well as lack of orgasm. The importance of appreciating the context in which clients/patients, their partners, and clinicians come to define sexual and gender difficulties as pathological is underscored for each of the sexual and gender problems. The sex script defining \"normal\" sexuality and gender provides the social backdrop for viewing and diagnosing other forms of sexual and gender expression as pathological. A variety of other sexual problems, including sexual disappointment, the pain of affairs, infertility, and are not listed in the DSM but may lead to patients presenting in clinicians' offices. Controversies surrounding the paraphilias, the need to distinguish between normophilic and paraphilic interactions, and the implications of such distinctions are discussed. Gender identity disorders are outlined, including the controversies surrounding its inclusion and revision process in the DSM, and the emergence of a transgender community's reaction to diagnostic labeling.",

      "abstract": "Fear of victimization is different than actual victimization but has real consequences for individuals’ behaviors and attitudes. Research on fear of victimization in the United States has typically emphasized individuals’ own fears of experiencing violent, sexual, and property crimes. Yet, some studies suggest that fear of crime for other people whose safety one values – significant others, friends, and children – or altruistic fear is more common and often more intense than one’s personal fear of victimization. While some literature exists on the prevalence of altruistic fear in American households, little is known about altruistic fears specifically rooted in the fear of victimization based on a close family member’s or friend’s religious identity. Additionally, some studies suggest that there is a gendered aspect to altruistic fear, where men and women worry and express their fear for loved ones differently. It is likely that these gendered differences manifest in different ways depending on religious tradition. This paper aims to extend the literature on altruistic fear by applying this phenomenon to hate crime victimization, more specifically the fear of victimization based on religious identity.",

In the process of creating such relationships, individuals inevitably reveal themselves – their personal histories, identities, emotions, thoughts, and bodies. Yet for cancer patients and survivors, such disclosures are complicated by the effects of cancer. For cancer survivors not involved in established committed relationships, the process of dating and disclosure becomes new and uncharted territory marked by uncertainty. Negative feelings about their bodies and sexuality, discomfort in communicating about cancer, and fear of negative reactions to their cancer may lead some survivors to avoid relationships or remain in unsatisfying ones rather than risk telling new potential partners about their cancer. Such issues may lead survivors to feel deprived of fulfilling companionship, support, and intimate relations with a partner.",

      "title": "Ritual crime : anthropological considerations and contributions to a new field of study",
      "abstract": "The occurrence of criminal activities that have been associated or classified as falling within the category of what can be called has received widespread attention in the media in recent years. However, the nature of this kind of criminal activity makes it a difficult issue to deal with in a simplistic manner. In the media, ritual crimes are usually reported on for the sake of sensationalism, with reports mainly concerned with the occurrence of Satanism or Satanist-related activities. If, for example, a ritual murder has allegedly occurred, the media tend to report only the murder but rarely follow the criminal investigation undertaken by law enforcement officers to solve such a case. Police departments have gone as far as establishing law enforcement structures or units specifically for the purpose of dealing with ritual crime. Given the controversial nature of ritual crime, opinions on its existence are varied, ranging from scepticism, apparently as a result of a lack of verifiable evidence, to religious fundamentalist acceptance, which is based on religious beliefs and not on the verification of evidence. However, not enough is known about the ritual crime phenomenon to warrant any justification for preferring one point of view to another. In this paper, it is suggested that knowledge of anthropology could assist law enforcement officers and policy makers in obtaining a more informed perspective on the issue of ritual crime and how to deal with it. Within the context of globalisation, multiculturalism and religious pluralism, understanding the belief systems of local communities becomes crucial in both the investigation of ritual crimes and the creation of legislation to cope with it. This field of investigation could provide new areas to explore while also contributing towards anthropological research, which could be of possible benefit not only to law enforcement, but also community development.",

But the result has not hitherto been satisfactory, in spite of the skill with which their investigations have been conducted, and the unwearied patience which they have brought to the task. The failure has probably arisen from the want of a sufficient number of observations, the authenticity of which could be relied upon; or for want of that accuracy in the data, without which it is in vain to attempt to find the traces of a regular law, disturbed as it must be by the peculiar circumstances under which the observations were made, or by the ignorance, and, in some cases it may be, by the wilful errors of those who have been employed to collect the facts.",

Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. Various explanations such as diagnosticity and salience help explain some findings, but the greater power of bad events is still found when such variables are controlled. Hardly any exceptions (indicating greater power of good) can be found. Taken together, these findings suggest that bad is stronger than good, as a general principle across a broad range of psychological phenomena.",

Parental lack of resolution concerning loss or trauma has been proposed to result in atypical parenting behaviors, which in turn have a disorganizing effect on the parent-child relationship. The authors review the evidence for this transmission pathway, considering other factors (e.g., social environment, child characteristics) that might enrich understanding of the antecedents of disorganization. A threshold approach is proposed to explain (a) why different parental behaviors are linked to disorganization depending on prevailing social conditions and (b) why certain children appear more vulnerable to forming a disorganized attachment relationship.",

Such exposures also may contribute to sexual dysfunction, either by direct organic effects or because of reasonable concerns among the exposed over risking conception and consequent reproductive harm through sexual intercourse. Intimacy among military personnel returning from deployment may be prominently impaired by these concerns, which may persist despite efforts at good health risk communication. This chapter reviews common military toxic exposures with known or perceived reproductive toxicity or effects on sexual health. Recommendations are made for assessing such exposures when evaluating military personnel or veterans suffering impaired intimacy or sexual functioning. This chapter concludes with a recommendation that military specific exposure guidelines consider not only the existing evidence base regarding sexual and reproductive toxicity but also the valid concerns of military personnel about such effects and the possibility of their later confirmation.",

Common misunderstandings about the transgressor (such as the assumption of psychopathy and the likelihood of multiple offenses) are countered with a summary of data derived from the evaluation and/or treatment of over two hundred cases, most of them one-time transgressors. The typical characteristics of the analyst or therapist who engages in sexual misconduct are presented and discussed as qualities that are to some extent present in analysts generally. The temptation to deny this universal vulnerability is viewed as effectively replicating the kind of vertical splitting or compartmentalization that makes one vulnerable to sexual misconduct in the first place.",

      "abstract": "Bioethical problems are almost never settled completely due to the varying contexts and cultures under which they play out.Yet, progress is possible.This does not mean that appropriate solutions are not available for each context and culture, nor does it mean that they are imperfect.Bioethical issues have a special dynamic, which makes them open ended in the context of the diversity and the changing human experiences.Competing moral values can be harmonized in some contexts and cultures, but hardly in others.Scientific advances and breakthroughs open new possibilities for action, which equally liberates and burdens human decision-making.And even when there is an overlapping consensus with regard to the adequacy of normative frameworks, there will still be thorny questions about their application, for which local and general empirical knowledge needs to be generated.Moral disagreements and uncertainties keep bioethics open to sharpening and deepening of the normative and empirical investigations.Philosophical analysis of arguments and presuppositions will have to determine to which extent standard concepts and principles are transferable to new situations and other contexts, evaluate critically the ethical implications of biomedical policies that prove successful, or mark out irrational attitudes against scientific advances with significant potential in terms of social benefits.Empirical research will have to identity in what conditions the application of morally desirable policies can backfire, and, consequently, determine more favorable conditions or document people's evaluative attitudes and explain by what they are driven.Contemporary Debates in Bioethics: European Perspectives aims to contribute to these challenges.It includes 14 chapters by philosophers and social scientists on issues of enduring and contemporary importance, such as organ donation, biomedical enhancement, genetic editing, euthanasia, informed consent, biopolitics, social interpretation of disability, end of life, health-care organizational ethics, and the convergence of computing, information, and biological life.The articles feature rigorous analysis and the original results that will be of interest to scholars working on these important issues.Furthermore, they bring important discussions to the table and are topics that need in-depth analysis.Enhancement technologies constitute one of the most controversial topics in contemporary bioethics.There seems to be a widespread belief that interventions to treat diseases are significantly more permissible than interventions aimed at improving normal capacities, and moreover, that traditional means of improvement (education and institutions) are less problematic than pharmacological, genetic, or biotechnological interventions.These moral asymmetries are pervasive in the public debate and popular culture, but they face philosophical problems.The debate around enhancement technologies deserves an advanced analysis in order to clear it away from gut feelings but also to avoid blindly accepting promising biotechnologies.",

Probability is a formal mathematical concept expressed in its most simple form as dependent probability, which is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the likelihood that, for example, a person with one property will have another property. Thus the probability of a live birth being female is a dependent probability in which the two properties are “live birth” and “female.” Probabilities may also be assigned to beliefs. This kind of probability is known as subjective probability, and in this case the number represents the strength with which we think of a given belief to be true. Something is believed rather than known for certain because whether that thing is the case or not is merely probable. This is the kind of probability that one employs in making a bet with a friend about whether or not something is true.",

      "title": "Précis of<i>The evolution of human sexuality</i>",
      "abstract": "Abstract Patterns in the data on human sexuality support the hypothesis that the bases of sexual emotions are products of natural selection. Most generally, the universal existence of laws, rules, and gossip about sex, the pervasive interest in other people's sex lives, the widespread seeking of privacy for sexual intercourse, and the secrecy that normally permeates sexual conduct imply a history of reproductive competition. More specifically, the typical differences between men and women in sexual feelings can be explained most parsimoniously as resulting from the extraordinarily different reproductive opportunities and constraints males and females normally encountered during the course of evolutionary history. Men are more likely than women to desire multiple mates; to desire a variety of sexual partners; to experience sexual jealousy of a spouse irrespective of specific circumstances; to be sexually aroused by the sight of a member of the other sex; to experience an autonomous desire for sexual intercourse; and to evaluate sexual desirability primarily on the bases of physical appearance and youth. The evolutionary causes of human sexuality have been obscured by attempts to find harmony in natural creative processes and human social life and to view sex differences as complementary. The human female's capacity for orgasm and the loss of estrus, for example, have been persistently interpreted as marriage-maintaining adaptations. Available evidence is more consistent with the view that few sex differences in sexuality are complementary, that many aspects of sexuality undermine marriage, and that sexuality is less a unifying than a divisive force in human affairs.",

      "abstract": "Background: Despite our basic need for social connectedness, solitude is a normal and sought-out part of life. However, previous research often links solitude (the state of being alone) with loneliness, stress, and disease risk, leaving potential benefits of solitude, such as self-reflection and sense of control, relatively understudied. The current study aims to identify the thought patterns and affective states characterizing a full range of both negative and positive solitude experiences occurring in daily life and to identify key individual difference factors shaping the likelihood of experiencing potentially health-promoting kinds of solitude. Methods: 100 adults age 50+ and 50 university students in Greater Vancouver completed up to 30 momentary assessments over 10 days assessing current and desired social situation, thoughts, and affect. Latent class cluster analyses will be used to categorize solitude episodes into distinct types based on thought-affect profiles. Next, a set of individual difference factors will be used to predict the likelihood of experiencing each identified type of solitude. Expected results: It is hypothesized that two or more solitude types will emerge from exploratory analyses, that age, introversion, openness to experience, preference for solitude, and social network strength will predict more positive solitude experiences, and that neuroticism, social anxiety, and loneliness will predict more negative experiences. Current stage: All data collection is completed and analyses underway. Discussion: This study will provide a new framework for conceptualizing solitude by incorporating thought-sampling into ecologically valid time-sampling assessments, and will identify key traits that predict individuals’ propensity to thrive when alone.",

In this study, a non-clinical sample (N = 484), self-identified as male (n = 156) or female (n = 331) victims, indicated reason-messages used with self and/or others for why they stayed in these violent relationships. Analyses of both independent messages and grouped themes showed victims’ communication as inherently (and perhaps, falsely) gendered. Viewed through a gender- (versus sex-) lens, victims’ reasons for staying suggest barriers to support may be communicated as gendered.",

      "title": "Is Short-Term Mating the Maladaptive Result of Insecure Attachment? A Test of Competing Evolutionary Perspectives",
      "abstract": "Different evolutionary perspectives offer competing views on short-term mating and attachment. Some theories argue that short-term mating results from insecure attachment, particularly the maladaptive attachment features of low self-esteem, interpersonal distrust, social avoidance, and emotional instability. Other theories posit that short-term mating is adaptive, having evolved as an ecologically contingent reproductive strategy. In this view, short-term mating has multiple origins-developmental, heritable, and situational-and may not be associated with the maladaptive traits of insecure attachment. Across several different cultures, short-term mating was moderately associated with insecure attachment, and insecure attachment was strongly related to maladaptive personality. However, short-term mating was largely independent of maladaptive personality. In some cases, especially among young men, short-term mating was associated with adaptive personality traits, especially higher self-esteem. It is argued that although insecure romantic attachment is somewhat associated with short-term mating, the causal links between early parent-child attachment and short-term mating are rather limited.",

      "title": "Dissociation and the Parent-Infant Dialogue: a Longitudinal Perspective From Attachment Research",
      "abstract": "Two longitudinal attachment studies of families at social risk have now followed their cohorts of infants to late adolescence. Several key findings have emerged related to outcomes of interest to psychoanalysts. First, data from both studies indicate that disorganized attachment behaviors in infancy are important precursors of later dissociative symptomatology. Second, this early vulnerability is related to patterns of parent-infant affective communication, particularly quieter behaviors like emotional unavailability or role reversal, and does not appear to reside in the infant alone. Finally, the results suggest that the quality of the attachment relationship may in part account for why some people exposed to later trauma develop dissociative symptoms and others do not. To paraphrase Dori Laub (1993), the mother's seeing and not knowing in infancy may be a precondition of her child's knowing and not knowing in late adolescence. It remains unclear, however, whether the early relationship is predictive due primarily to the onset of an internal defensive process in infancy or whether its predictive power resides primarily in enduring patterns of parent-child dialogue that continually reinforce the child's segregated and contradictory mental contents.",

Method: A qualitative study based on a sample of 16 self-neglecting elders. Data collection was performed through in-depth semi-structured interviews, followed by content analysis. Findings: Four major themes emerged from the older participants: “I was unlucky:” a life course of suffering; “That's the way it is:” self-neglect as a routine of life; “They tell me that I'm disabled:” old age as exposing situations of self-neglect; “My empire:” how do I perceive my old age. Conclusions: Self-neglect is not necessarily an issue of old age, but is related to the person's life history. Self-neglect as a way of life accompanied the participants into old age, but it was not originated or created there. The overall message of the self-neglecting elders was to see them as human beings and not as old neglected people; not to label them as an “age syndrome” but to perceive them in a holistic and humanistic manner.",

This is particularly relevant to policymaking during the coronavirus pandemic and racial inequality highlighted during the support for the Black Lives Matter movement. A literature review was performed to define bias, identify the impact of bias on clinical practice and research as well as clinical decision making (cognitive bias). Bias training could bridge the gap from the lack of awareness of bias to the ability to recognise bias in others and within ourselves. However, there are no effective debiasing strategies. Awareness of implicit bias must not deflect from wider socio-economic, political and structural barriers as well ignore explicit bias such as prejudice.",

      "title": "[Suicide: clinical and systematic aspects of the self-responsibility dimension].",
      "abstract": "Suicide is a tragic, extreme, and unusual act which evokes powerful emotions. Doctors, psychologists, social workers, lawyers and Renaissance men are trying to research factors leading to suicide. They believe that finding the critical factors may reduce the incidence of suicide. The causative factors leading to suicide are complicated and diverse. A society's moral stance on the issue of suicide influences an individual's inclination to implement the act itself. There is a wide variety of viewpoints between different societies. Societies, with a supportive view, that treat suicide as a noble act, have a high incidence of suicide. Those with a condemning view, that may even deem suicide as a criminal act, have a lower suicide rate. Society's view of suicide is linked to the question of responsibility for the act itself. The responsibility is composed of moral, public and legal obligations. The question is: should most of the responsibility be the deceased's or society's medical and paramedical personnel, who might be held responsible for not recognizing the warning signs and not preventing the act itself. We wish to contend that a professional, cultural, public and legal approach that preserves an individual's responsibility for one's own decisions - even one of self-destruction - will prevent a moral judgment and criticism of the deceased. The aforementioned may decrease the incidence of suicide seen with a neutral approach that foregoes the deceased's individual responsibility. The second section of the article deals with the legal aspects of the act of suicide as expressed in the legislation for the treatment of the mentally ill. The assumption is that the law reflects the viewpoint of a society, thereby influencing the tendencies and processes within. Therefore, a change or amendment to the law may influence the attitude towards it, and the prevalence of the phenomenon in the long run.",

      "title": "[Adolescent pregnancy].",
      "abstract": "The number of adolescent pregnancies brought to term in France has continued to decline while the number of abortions remains stable. Adolescent pregnancies cannot be considered \"accidents\" either in their social or psychological aspects. Pregnant adolescents carrying to term tend to be more disadvantaged than those seeking abortions. Early pregnancy may be a response to difficult life conditions. Despite appearing to constitute an infraction of a social code, adolescent pregnancy may in fact represent an attempt at social integration through motherhood. Adolescents failing in school, with poor employment prospects and feeling family pressures may view pregnancy as a means of social recognition. But such factors by themselves do not explain pregnancy; the primordial role of psychological factors must be examined. For some adolescents, pregnancy may represent an attempt to understand their own sexual identity as the transformations of puberty unsettle their previous self-images. Or they may be failing to perceive or actively denying the possibility of pregnancy. Adolescent pregnancies may be the result of transgressions of prohibitions. The traditional prohibition of sexual activity has relaxed to the degree that it is being replaced by a new prohibition on adolescent pregnancy and a prescription to use contraception. But contraception deprives an adolescent in search of sexual identity of proof of fertility as well as of the image of spontaneity and naturalness. Use of contraception is in conflict with the questions, doubts, and anxieties of adolescence. For adolescents in a reactivated oedipal stage, heterosexuality is often at the service of incestuous fantasies involving the mother. Abortion and perhaps pregnancy itself may assume the character of a rite of passage into adulthood for some adolescents. The important thing for many is the ability to become pregnant, to be a mother like their own mother.",

      "abstract": "Should people with mental health conditions 'come out proud,' disclosing information about their condition(s)? Recent research highlights how disclosing this information can promote empowerment and decrease self-stigma. However, many people with mental health conditions still fear that stigmatization and discrimination follows if they disclose information about their condition. This article shows that their fears reflect reality. It shows how recent research on the philosophy and psychology of stereotyping and implicit bias, and how mental states are attributed, suggests that they face a serious dilemma. If they want to avoid being misperceived, for example, as dangerous or incompetent, then both disclosure and nondisclosure bring substantial risks. Disclosure could lead them to be misperceived due to stereotyping. Meanwhile, nondisclosure could lead to their mental states, dispositions, needs and character being misperceived. There are strategies that can be used to reduce the misperception associated with disclosure, that is, strategies to combat stereotyping. However, whether or not these strategies are implemented is often beyond the control of people with mental health conditions. So, it shall be argued, societal changes are required to ensure that people with mental health conditions can be 'out and proud' without penalization.",

      "abstract": "Sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) elders who have lost or expect to lose a partner or loved one are at elevated risk for experiencing hidden or disenfranchised grief due to historical and current stigmatising social structures that lead to identity concealment. Identity concealment is associated with a range of negative health (e.g. depression, anxiety) and psychosocial (e.g. social isolation, lower sense of belonging) outcomes that may adversely affect one’s ability to cope with and recover from loss, yet little is known about the association between identity concealment and complicated grief. Guided by two empirically supported, complementary frameworks (i.e. minority stress theory and relational-cultural theory), this theoretical review increases understanding and awareness of identity concealment as a risk factor for complicated grief and other poor bereavement outcomes among SGM elders, with special consideration for intersections of gerodiversity. Such knowledge can help health professionals, policymakers, and other agents of change develop culturally responsive interventions that foster social, psychological, and physical well-being among bereaved SGM elders.",

Needs concerning cognitive and communicative development have gained far less attention although they belong to species-specific means of human adaptation, depend on intrinsic motivators, and are very often involved in the symptomatology of disorders in social behavior. Most mechanisms of dialogic interchanges are based on nonconscious processes and escape parents' rational control. They may be disturbed or inhibited due to pathological deviations and/or unfavorable sociocultural circumstances, both on the parental and infant sides. Preverbal communication plays a key role in the environmental support to infant cognition, communication, and social integration. The elucidation of its forms and therapeutic application has proved helpful not only for infants but also for children whose communicative age is lower than their chronological age.",

      "title": "An immunoreactive theory of selective male affliction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Males are selectively afflicted with the neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders of childhood, a broad and virtually ubiquitous phenomenon that has not received proper attention in the biological study of sex differences. The previous literature has alluded to psychosocial differences, genetic factors and elements pertaining to male “complexity” and relative immaturity, but these are not deemed an adequate explanation for selective male affliction. The structure of sex differences in neurodevelopmental disorders is hypothesized to contain these elements: (1) Males are more frequently afflicted, females more severely; (2) disorders arising in females are largely mediated by the genotype; in males, by a genotype by environment interaction; (3) complications of pregnancy and delivery occur more frequently with male births; such complications are decisive and influence subsequent development. We hypothesize that there is something about the male fetus that evokes an inhospitable uterine environment. This “evocative principle” is hypothesized to relate to the relative antigenicity of the male fetus, which may induce a state of maternal immunoreactivity, leading either directly or indirectly to fetal damage. The immunoreactive theory (IMRT) thus constructed is borrowed from studies of sex ratios and is the only explanation consistent with negative parity effects in the occurrence of pregnancy complications and certain neurodevelopmental disorders. Although the theory is necessarily speculative, it is heuristic and hypotheses derived from it are proposed; some are confirmed in the existing literature and by the authors' research.",

Lacking possibilities of identification in the context of a general relativism of traditional norms and values, radical changes in the structures of the family and of our society, accompained by over-exaggerated demands on one's personal performance and prosperity, and significant failures of communication as well as the unreflected liberalization of a \"permissive society\" make young people look for new possibilities of identification which they try to find in sub-cultural groups and fascinating experiences which drugs. Many juvenile drugconsumers show increasing crises in their personalites and farreaching psychological distrubances often followed by a serious development. All these phenomena illustrate the frustrated search for genuine personal identity in an illusionary world of drugs. Only the solidaric and constructive cooperation of the generations can overcome the manifold problems and conflicts of young people which are concentrated in their identitycrises, and only this cooperation can open up new perspectives for a future which is humane and worth living, a future which is the real aim of the subcultural movements and psychodelic experiences.",

      "title": "Identification, Stigma, and the Self",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter examines the identification and stigmatization of illegitimate individuals in the wider community, and effects of stigma on individuals’ sense of self-worth and identity. The chapter draws on concepts of secrecy, stigma, shame, and tolerance developed by other historians of illegitimacy and sexuality, and historians of religious discrimination. Given sociological arguments that stigma requires identification to operate, the chapter interrogates the reliability of the identification of illegitimate individuals in various sources, including a large cohort study of illegitimacy in the parish registers and poor law documents of two London parishes. It argues that identification by the state varied considerably across the life cycle. Parents often succeeded in falsifying their child’s baptism record, and officials were flexible in their recording of illegitimate status. In records not produced by the state, such as diaries and correspondence, individuals displayed considerable knowledge about a person’s birth status, and illegitimacy was often noted as part of their social identity throughout the life cycle. However, contemporaries used specific terms (such as ‘bastard’ or ‘natural’) to signal various mitigating circumstances, including the type of parental relationship or the socio-economic status of the child. Identification and stigma operated on a spectrum, and there was not a blanket condemnation of all illegitimate individuals. Diaries and letters written by illegitimate individuals demonstrate that most experienced stigma and frustration at the disadvantage caused by their status, but this external stigma was rarely internalized as shame. This is a distinct difference to the experience of illegitimate individuals in later periods.",

Patients with foreign body ingestions or insertions generally fall into four broad categories: (1) children; (2) mentally handicapped or retarded persons; (3) adults with “unusual” sexual behaviors; and (4) “normal” adults and children. Children usually are not “repeat offenders,” whereas mentally handicapped or retarded persons frequently are. The latter individuals may be seen multiple times for foreign body ingestions and insertions. Normal adults may sometimes be subject to foreign body injuries because they are engaged in criminal activities, or because they are subjected to spouse abuse or child abuse. The purpose of this lesson is to describe the categories of foreign bodies and their probable sites found in children and adults; also to call attention to the radiopacity of specific foreign bodies to determine which imaging methods are applicable.",

Dinar Candy’s case brought to the thoughts on the limitation of pornography meaning and the determination on freedom of expression in action of wearing bikini. The research is conducted through a qualitative approach using secondary data. The results show, first: phornograph is limited by ‘subjective reason’ such as if the phornography is aimed for personal interest, then the action is not phornography. The other is ‘action-room limitation’ in which an action can be formulated as phornography if the standard and characteristic in the room where the action is done consideres that the action is obscene or aims to sexual exploitation. The room refers to specific place such as beach, roadside, hotel, or other specific places, not wide social room. Second: If someone’s feeling is expressed by wearing bikini in a room which based on its decency standard allows to wear bikini, then the action can be determined as freedom of expression. In contrary, in a room where bikini is considered against morality, or it is spread to public, then such action is againsting the phornogrphy law.How to cite item: Donandi S, S. (2022).

For example, people willingly participate in extreme charity fundraisers – exerting effort, enduring pain, and risking bodily injury – to advance desired causes.

In other words, acceptance as part of an important ingroup is in jeopardy in identity denial situations. Typically, individuals are denied ingroup status because they do not resemble a prototypical group member, so their common ingroup identity is called into question or unrecognized by fellow group members. Identity denial is sometimes a subtle, exclusionary experience, sometimes a blatant questioning of belonging. Within recent years, there has been a growing empirical literature in psychology on denial of American identity for visible ethnic and racial minorities (e.g., Asian Americans, African Americans, and Latino/as).",

Males are more likely to exhibit risky behaviour than females. Although minor or infrequent antisocial acts may be frequent in adolescence, not all adolescents get involved, and many do not get involved a lot. The most powerful predictors from middle childhood to chronic delinquency in adolescence are: troublesomeness in school; hyperactivity/poor concentration; low intelligence and poor attainment; family criminality; family poverty; and poor parenting. Social control theory argues that antisocial behaviour is less likely when the young person has a stake in social institutions such as the family, school, or clubs and societies.",

Such questions are increasingly at the core of many contemporary debates about gender, both within philosophy and in public discourse. Growing efforts are being made to highlight the importance of gender identity to gender categorization. Philosophical theories of gender have traditionally focused on gender role—the social norms, obligations, and positions that others impose on you based on perceived gender. But the experiences of trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people have shown that an exclusive focus on gender role is inadequate for theorizing gender. We also need to consider a person's relationship to gender categories and gender norms. Two people might both be perceived by others as women, but while one thinks of herself as a woman the other thinks of themself as genderqueer. And this difference in gender self-identification is not merely a difference in personal feeling. A gender nonconforming woman and a genderqueer person—even if they are treated similarly by others—will often experience and navigate gender norms and roles quite differently, and this difference matters to a full understanding of gender.",

It was hypothesized that this pre-existing incapacity for experiencing intimacy would manifest itself in a significant relationship outside of the marital dyad (i.e., with the codependent's closest friend). Despite widespread professional and public acceptance of Codependency as an identifiable unique diagnostic entity such acceptance has been solely based on clinical observation without reference to prior related empirical research on wives of alcoholics.

      "abstract": "What is imagined by “intimacy” as a quality of relationships is often associated with particular ways of behaving. Intimacy is sometimes defined narrowly to mean the familiarity resulting from close association. In this sense, domestic life across much of the life course in all societies is intimate. Living arrangements that involve sharing domestic space, a “hearth and home”; the caring activities associated with bearing and raising children; and other forms of routinely giving or receiving physical care necessarily provide familiarity and privileged knowledge. Sometimes the term “intimacy” is also used even more narrowly to refer to sexual familiarity with another person. In everyday current usage, intimacy is often presumed to involve more than close association and familiarity, for example, also involving strong emotional attachments such as love. However, in both popular and academic commentaries, intimacy is increasingly understood as representing a very particular form of closeness and being special to another person founded on self‐disclosure. This self‐disclosing or self‐expressing intimacy is characterized by knowledge and understanding of inner selves. Privileged knowledge gained through close physical association is not a sufficient condition to ensure this type of intimacy. People living side by side can feel trapped together as strangers who know nothing of each other's inner worlds.",

      "abstract": "Greater attention to secular and nonreligious individuals has provided much-needed balance as well as alternative interpretations of commonly-held assumptions regarding religiosity/ spirituality (R/S). Contrary to the theory that R/S provides unique benefits in areas such as prosociality and mental health, analogous secular mechanisms exist. The conflation of effects attributed to R/S together with secular effects represents a congruence fallacy. Studies often lack proper controls found in other areas of psychology (e.g., dismantling or placebo designs) that could detect when religion is acting as a proxy for more basic underlying influences. For example, an increased focus on the nonreligious has revealed that religious belief has often been confounded with factors such as strong worldview conviction, social engagement, and normative cultural fit. R/S differences co-occur with demographic, personality, cognitive, and epistemic variables that exert causal influence independent of any religious content. Experimental and treatment outcome studies featuring effects attributed to R/S often have not included equivalent secular conditions or stimuli. The association between spirituality and well-being has been artificially inflated because of conceptual blurring on assessment measures, leading to the mis-categorization of some nonreligious individuals into the spirituality domain. In sum, a more specified and critical approach is needed in order to validate assumptions that religiosity and spirituality exert unique effects.",

According to data from a representative sample (Study I, N = 603), existential indifference slightly decreases with age and is especially common among singles and unmarried partners. The existentially indifferent show low commitment to all sources of meaning; they demonstrate particular disinterest in self-knowledge, spirituality, explicit religiosity, and generativity. Whereas their mental health (depression, anxiety) is comparable to that of individuals who experience their lives as meaningful, their psychological well-being (positive affect, satisfaction with life) is considerably lower (Study II, N = 135).",

Yet studies of birth order generally fail to support these beliefs. The apparent contradiction can be resolved by taking into account the context-specific nature of learned behavior. There is abundant evidence that people do not automatically transfer behavior from one context to another: They wait until they have evidence that what they learned in Context 1 will also be useful in Context 2. Because patterns of behavior acquired in the family of origin tend to be useless or inappropriate in other settings, birth order effects show up only in that context. Outside the family they grew up in, firstborns and later-borns are indistinguishable in personality.",

A critical reappraisal of the evidence suggests a more balanced view of the mother-child relationship should be taken. A classification of the condition, founded on facts not concepts, is urgently required. Non-organic failure to thrive should be viewed in a multidimensional context, in which potential influences upon the symptomatic infant are considered. Inadequacy of nutrition is caused by both a failure of adequate provision of food and by inadequate intake. A vicious circle of maladaptive behavioural interaction between caregiver and infant is often present, sustained by high emotional tensions. Clinical intervention should aim to clarify the contributions made by both caregiver and infant to that interaction and thus break the cycle. The basis on which intervention is made should be direct observation of the parent and child relationship in as many different environmental contexts as feasible, especially during feeding. The multidisciplinary team has an important role to play in management. An emphasis on parental culpability in the aetiology of non-organic failure to thrive, in the absence of direct evidence of neglect, is wrong.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the question whether rejection experiences negatively relate to the social trust of Children Born of War (CBOW) and if this connection is mediated by sense of self-worth. CBOW is a group of people born out of relations during war- and post-war times, involving one parent being a foreign soldier, a para-military officer, rebel or other person directly participating in the hostilities, while the other parent is a member of the native population. Also children born to child soldiers and children fathered by members of a peacekeeping troop are included within this group. These children, due to their biological background, often grow up in a surrounding in which they are perceived as child of the enemy. The general hypothesis is that, due to their exposure to rejection experiences by their caregivers as well as by the society, CBOW are less likely to develop trust. It is further assumed that this relationship is mediated by the sense of self-worth. A structural equation model was applied to test the relation using a sample of Norwegian children born of war. Results indicate that CBOW who experience rejection share a lower sense of self-worth, which is further connected to lower trust, whereas no direct association between rejection experiences and trust was found.",

Available research literature on the responses of married persons to divorce is reexamined in terms of an alternative query: under what conditions is divorce, a potentially traumatic experience, actually experienced as a stren, a personality enhancing or growth experience? Seventeen factors contributing to this outcome are discussed: the definition of divorce as a normal event; the personalities of the participants, including the ability to define experiences as strens; age and sex; marital life style; the quality and length of marriage; the length of termination of the marriage; the status of 100initiator or noninitiator; attachment and the ex-mate; income and education options; traditional or nontraditional gender roles; supportive networks; geographical mobility; the presence of peer support groups; and the role of a significant other.

      "abstract": "Five to 11-year-old U.S. children, from either a religious or secular background, judged whether story events could really happen. There were four different types of stories: magical stories violating ordinary causal regularities; religious stories also violating ordinary causal regularities but via a Divine agent; unusual stories not violating ordinary causal regularities but with an improbable event; and realistic stories not violating ordinary causal regularities and with no improbable event. Overall, children were less likely to judge that religious and magical stories could really happen than unusual and realistic stories although religious children were more likely than secular children to judge that religious stories could really happen. Irrespective of background, children frequently invoked causal regularities in justifying their judgments. Thus, in justifying their conclusion that a story could really happen, children often invoked a causal regularity whereas in justifying their conclusion that a story could not really happen, they often pointed to the violation of a causal regularity. Overall, the findings show that children appraise the likelihood of story events actually happening in light of their beliefs about causal regularities. A religious upbringing does not impact the frequency with which children invoke causal regularities in judging what can happen, even if it does impact the type of causal factors that children endorse.",

      "abstract": "Loneliness, a feeling of being alone or abandoned, is often associated with old age. The elderly can feel lonely for various reasons. It is not just the number of relationships, but also the quality of these social ties, that influence loneliness. Being close with companions and family members is essential for the elderly. Additional factors, such as being female, having a low socioeconomic status, or being institutionalized can raise loneliness among the elderly. Loneliness can have a noteworthy influence on the well-being of the elderly, leading to depression and even death. There are several existing interventions to tackle loneliness, but their significance is minimal. This article aims to raise awareness of the epidemic called senior isolation.",

      "title": "Where ethics comes from and what to do about it.",
      "abstract": "The practical difficulty with applying ethical theories to particular problems is that ordinarily people pay little attention to theories when they make moral decisions. Instead, we are guided by our ethical beliefs, which are primarily the result of cultural factors beyond our reach - factors subject to rational scrutiny and to change, but largely out of our control. One of the most alarming aspects of describing an ethical problem, and of hearing it described by others, is discovering just how many ways it can be done. How a moral problem is described will turn on an array of variables: the role and degree of involvement in the case of the person who is describing it, the person's particular profession or discipline, her religious and cultural inheritance - indeed, with all of the intangibles that have contributed to her character. What is more, the description any person offers will also vary - notoriously - according to whether an ethical decision has been made or is still to come, whether that decision is now judged to be a sound one or a poor one, whether the consequences were intended or unforeseen. Consider a relatively common case: a middle-aged man with multisystem organ failure, poor but not hopeless prognosis, now incompetent, experiencing what seems to be considerable pain, whose family is faced with the decision about whether to continue his medical treatment. Think of the possible alternatives to the brief and inadequate description I have offered here. A clinician will describe the patient's medical problems, his hospital course, his treatment, his laboratory work, and so on. A moral philosopher will be less interested in the medical details of the case than she will the moral ones, and her description will be constructed from a vocabulary of terms such as autonomy, justice, and beneficence, and the patient's goals, values, and wishes. The patient's wife will describe not a but a continuing chapter in her life. A chaplain, social worker, nurse, or hospital administrator will offer still another description, as will the patient's daughter, his minister, his friends, his colleagues, and his enemies. The perceptions of each of these will change as the patient's story unfolds: what seemed to be minor decisions at one time now appear disastrous; incidents that might have been overlooked now seem to be portents. And any description offered will reflect whether the patient is in a Tel Aviv teaching hospital, a Heidelberg Krankenhaus, or a Chicago V.A- facility. Perhaps the most frustrating feature of describing a moral problem is the gulf between moral description and moral experience. No description, it seems, can do justice to the realities of our moral problems.[1] It is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, to capture the countless subtleties that go into the perceptions and judgments of each person involved: the hopes, fears, prayers, guilt, pride, and remorse; the conflicting emotions that accompany irrevocable decisions; the self-imposed pressure to carry through with an action once a decision has been made. Much of what goes into actual moral choices remains unarticulated. To express these things, even to perceive them consciously, requires a talent possessed by few of us other than novelists and poets. A second problem comes from the realization that in describing a given case, one has done much of the ethical work already. A person's moral judgment is reflected in what he chooses to include in a description: whether he mentions that the patient's wife has visited her critically ill husband only twice over the past three weeks, whether he reports a bed shortage in the ICU, if he notes that the patient's children stand to inherit the dying man's estate, how he describes the patient's prognosis, whether he brings up the option of palliative care, if he notes that the nursing staff feels strongly that treatment should be stopped, whether he mentions that the patient was an IV drug abuser. …",

Focus is on sociology's contribution to addictions to drugs and alcohol, rather than on tobacco, gambling, or more debatable \"addictions.\" There are unexpectedly convincing arguments that drug addiction is largely a myth, based on stigmatizing some drugs and types of user as inherently problematic, then seeking confirmatory evidence whilst ignoring similar behaviors and problems with other drugs, and other types of user. Sociology has made a major but largely behind the scenes contribution to addiction research, often fronted by sympathetic clinicians. There is a substantial body of sociological and psychological theory on how people construct, perceive and manage risk, mostly not considering addiction. Sociological understandings have made an important but under-appreciated contribution to research on and interventions for addiction.

This suffering accounts for a greater risk at having mental and physical problems. The goal of this study is to evaluate if there are problems in the process of grief, in different groups of bereaved. In this evaluation the focus is on different aspects of the loss, the cause of death and the formal relationship with the deceased. When a specific group of bereaved people has significantly more problems in the process of grief, special care can be delivered to them. In this study the first hypothesis was to see if the formal cause of death still has his influence on the process of grief when a correction was made for two aspects of the death, namely the violentness and the unexpectedness of the death. The results made clear that the formal cause of death did not hold his influence on the process of grief. From this we can expect that the aspects of cause of death are more important than the formal cause of death. The second hypothesis in this study was to see if the loss of a child has a more negative impact on the process of grief than the loss of another significant relationship. The results made clear that this is the case, the loss of a child contributed to higher scores on the outcomes. The third and last hypothesis in this study was to see if the violent aspect of the death has the most negative impact in the case of losing a child, in comparison with other significant relationships. The results made clear that this is not the case.",

However, adolescence is also identical with the ‘rebellion’, in psychology terms called storm and stress time because of considerable radical shocks and changes from the previous time. Self-identity searching for occurs in adolescence, but in this time someone can be entrapped in the life that can harm their future; consuming alcoholic beverages and engaging in the conflict is the mischief the adolescent frequently does. Alcoholic beverages consuming behavior is frequently harmful for the self and others. Such adolescents are also often involved in conflict as the result of consuming alcoholic beverage. The consequence of consuming alcoholic beverage, someone becomes uncontrollable in speaking, acting, and sensitive, it of course will result in the conflict.\r\nThe objectives of research are to find out the types of conflict in the term of adolescent’s behavior consuming alcoholic beverage, to find out the factors causing conflict in the term of adolescent’s behavior consuming alcoholic beverage, to find out the effect of conflict in the term of adolescent’s behavior consuming alcoholic beverage, and to find out the attempt of coping with such conflict in the term of adolescent’s behavior consuming alcoholic beverage.\r\nThis study belongs to a descriptive qualitative research. The data source employed was the respondents in the research location, document and archive. Techniques of collecting data used were observation, interview and documentation. The sample employed in this study was taken using purposive sampling. Then data validity employed was source and method triangulations. Data analysis used was an interactive analysis model including data collection, data reduction, display and conclusion drawing is the procedure occurring simultaneously as the cycle and interactive process. The theory employed was conflict and action theories.\r\nThe result of research shows that the types of conflict in the term of adolescent’s behavior consuming alcoholic beverage include conflict with family, conflict with community environment, inter-organization conflict, inter-community conflict, peer conflict, inter-individual conflict. Meanwhile the factors causing conflict in the term of adolescent’s behavior consuming alcoholic beverage include: opinion difference, misunderstanding, there is disadvantaged party, unpleasantly behavior, sensitive feeling, and social change. The effect of conflict in the term of adolescent’s behavior consuming alcoholic beverage includes: increasing the solidarity among the members of group, individual personality changes, the relationship fracture between the groups in conflict, the relationship loss between the peers, damage and injury. The attempt of coping with conflict in the term of adolescent’s behavior consuming alcoholic beverage includes: family counseling, religious morality education, law apparatus establishment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRAK\r\nMasa remaja sering digambarkan sebagai masa yang paling indah, dan tidak terlupakan karena penuh dengan kegembiraan dan tantangan.

      "abstract": "Privacy is a word of many meanings. The meaning that is most relevant to this essay is secrecy?the interest in concealing personal information about oneself. But I need to distinguish between a per son's pure interest in concealment of personal information and his instrumental interest, which is based on fear that the information will be used against him. In many cultures, including our own, there is a nudity taboo. Except in the sex industry (prostitution, striptease, por nography, and so forth), nudist colonies, and locker rooms, people generally are embarrassed to be seen naked by strangers, particularly of the opposite sex, even when there are no practical consequences. Why this is so is unclear; but it is a brute fact about the psychology of most people in our society. A woman (an occasional man as well) might be disturbed to learn that nude photographs taken surrepti tiously of her had been seen by a stranger in a remote country before being destroyed. That invasion of privacy would not have harmed her in any practical sense. Yet it might cause her at least transitory emo tional distress, and that is a harm even if it seems to have no rational basis (in that respect it is no different from having nightmares after watching a horror movie?another emotional reaction that is real de spite being irrational from an instrumental standpoint). But if the stranger used the photos to blackmail her, or, in an effort to destroy her budding career as an anchorwoman for the Christian Broadcasting System, published the photos in Hustler magazine, she would have a different and stronger grievance. In many cases of instrumental concealment of personal informa tion, the motive is disreputable (deceptive, manipulative): a person might want to conceal his age, or a serious health problem, from a pro spective spouse or his criminal record from a prospective employer. But the motive is not disreputable in all cases; the blackmailed woman in my example was not trying to mislead anyone in resisting the publi cation of the photos.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : In this paper we have pointed out how coercive psychological techniques are prevalent in our society, not only in malignant situations such as POW and hostage experiences and terroristic kidnappings, but also in relatively benign situations such as religious retreats and childrearing practices. Analogous methods are also applied in advertising, in our educational systems, in therapeutic situations and behavioral modification efforts. It is important to reexamine these techniques emphasizing the ethics and human rights involved, particularly in those areas where we have some control. Certainly, within both civilian and military life, individuals differ in their susceptability to thought control. Perhaps if all of us were not continually conditioned from birth onward to bend to others' value systems in almost every institution we enter, coercive persuasion might be easier to resist. Research has shown us that individuals are far less susceptible to coercive persuasion where there is group support from comrades, where there exists a well-ingrained sense of values, and where the individual has a strong commitment to a cause, be is self, God, or country. Thus, we are back to a recognition of the critical importance of early childhood training and skillful, effective parenting.",

While being in a relationship or not is unrelated to antisocial behavior, romantic partner characteristics (antisocial behavior and antisocial influence) are associated with greater antisocial behavior. As males age, they become increasingly resistant to romantic partner characteristics. In contrast, females become increasingly vulnerable to the effects of romantic partner characteristics on antisocial behavior as they age, particularly when these relationships are relatively shorter. Females in shorter romantic relationships with partners who are antisocial or exert antisocial influence are at risk of persisting in antisocial behavior.",

But when, and why, is it morally problematic? I argue that in many cases everyday lookism is wrongful because it involves morally objectionable appearance discrimination. I consider various respects in which everyday lookism can be morally objectionable in virtue of the acts of wrongful discrimination it involves. I argue that these acts are wrongful when they are demeaning, or when they have unjust consequences whether singly or cumulatively. There are a number of ways in which they may have unjust consequences. First, the appearance norms in which these acts are rooted may be biased in such a way that the acts contribute to creating an unjust distribution of benefits and burdens. Second, these acts may combine to make everyday lookism oppressive in virtue of impairing the personal autonomy of its victims or contributing to doing so. Third, these acts may be unjustly harmful in terms of their effects.",

      "abstract": "Fear is part of the life and existence of any culture or individual. Over the years, the object of fear in a society and the strategies to combat it may change, but the expectation that people can be completely free from fear is simply an utopia. Different branches of psychology always tried to find distinguished explanations for the methods of originating and overcoming fear, although the fact is one, fear arises where there is a lack of individual’s personal maturity. When a person avoids every new life experience and does not try to move to a new stage of growth, it all accumulates in him/her in the form of fear and the individual experiences developmental fixation. It is also interesting to talk about the differences that exist between fear and anxiety, as these two emotions are often interrelated. If we refer to Barlow, fear differs from anxiety in that, fear is present-oriented and relatively certain, rather than future-oriented and relatively uncertain. Uncertainty not only increases anxiety levels, but is also responsible for a person’s various mental disorders. That is why, in the current situation in the world, when the Covid-19 pandemic affected the life of each individual, it is important to focus on the fear of the unknown situation caused by uncertainty. Usually, people want to control the present because with this they also want to take control over the future. In order to know what we are afraid of; it is necessary for a person to have insight by approaching the problem with consciousness and asking the questions to himself/herself. People in general have tendency to imagine a harsh scenario of the expected consequences of the future, which in many cases is completely far from the reality. It is fact that in case of having „apocalyptic\" thoughts it becomes impossible to deal with fear. In the end, those who fearlessly „approach\" this mentioned unpleasant emotion win the battle of overcoming fear.",

      "title": "Aging and sexuality.",
      "abstract": "Recent research suggesting that a high proportion of men and women remain sexually active well into later life refutes the prevailing myth that aging and sexual dysfunction are inexorably linked. Age-related physiological changes do not render a meaningful sexual relationship impossible or even necessarily difficult. In men, greater physical stimulation is required to attain and maintain erections, and orgasms are less intense. In women, menopause terminates fertility and produces changes stemming from estrogen deficiency. The extent to which aging affects sexual function depends largely on psychological, pharmacological, and illness-related factors. In this article I review the physiological sex-related changes that occur as part of the normal aging process in men and women. I also summarize the effects on sexual function of age-related psychological issues, illness factors, and medication use. An understanding of the sexual changes that accompany normal aging may help physicians give patients realistic and encouraging advice on sexuality. Although it is important that older men and women not fall into the psychosocial trap of expecting (or worse, trying to force) the kind and degree of sexual response characteristic of their youth, it is equally as important that they not fall prey to the negative folklore according to which decreased physical intimacy is an inevitable consequence of the passage of time.",

      "abstract": "Factors of loneliness experienced by women from different social groups, identified with factor analysis, are considered. Six structural factors were identified: neuroticism, an individual’s position in relation to herself and others, sociability, interpersonal relationships, personal potential, behavioural types. Each of these factors has a direction, so determines a woman’s sociality or, vice versa, deepness of her loneliness. We have determined that personal qualities developed due to experienced negative emotions, including low self-esteem, too high demands toward themselves and others, depression, fear and anxiety, insecurity, or emotional instability, contribute to antisocial behaviour (social indifference) and loneliness. A woman’s aggressive-negative position is one of the factors influencing her maladaptation to society and making her feels lonely. We can also argue that destructive communications also contribute to the feeling of loneliness. We have found that harmony and comfort at interpersonal relationships and loneliness depends on a woman’s position in interpersonal relationships, their distance and valence. Women with a high personal potential are less likely to experience feelings of loneliness than women with low personal potential. Moreover, fear and aggression directly affect the development of women’s depressed-aggressive behaviour, which leads to social maladaptation; this fact allowed us to understand the causes for the fear of being alone and the mechanism forming women’s feeling of loneliness.",

      "title": "When pride goes wrong.",
      "abstract": "The term pride is often viewed in a favorable light. It conjures up positive images such as a toddler's glee after successful performance of a task, a parent's delight in the athletic accomplishment of a child, a coach's jubilation following an important victory, and an athlete's elation after a record-setting performance. Few would find fault with these positive images of pride. Pride, however, can degenerate into something abhorrent. Athletes cheat and injure others in order to achieve success and bolster their pride. Coaches can become controlling and abusive of athletes as they seek success and enhancement of their pride. Parents meddle into the affairs of coaches and abuse their children in the pursuit of athletic success, their means to enhancing parental pride. Pride can be the motivation for antagonistic actions as individuals compete for the social standing, fame, and riches associated with athletic success. truth, pride is double-edged: destructive and ludicrous in the wrong place and the wrong proportions, but heroic and admirable in the right ones (19, p. 46). How does pride positively serve individuals as they navigate the waters of social relationships and as they pursue success? How does pride, which can serve as a positive social attribute, become something negative? In order to answer these questions, the nature of pride as well as its positive social functions shall be examined. Hubristic pride will be explored as the origin of many ills plaguing sport and society. When pride suggests traces hubris, it becomes a negative force in the lives of many and all that fall within reach of its acridity. By better understanding the difference between pride and hubristic pride, coaches, parents and administrators may be better able to take action to prevent hubristic pride from causing harm to themselves or others. The Nature of Pride and Its Positive Functions Pride is a basic emotion observed universally in human beings (35). It is exhibited through specific and recognizable non-verbal expressions spontaneously displayed when individuals experience pride. They include a low-intensity smile, expanded posture, slight head tilt, and arms to the side with hands on hips or raised above the head with hands in fists (36). Children exhibit recognizable signs of pride by the age of two and a half years and are able to recognize physical expressions of pride in others by age four. Pride is generally considered to be a positive emotion. It can be thought of as a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in one's actions. Pride is often linked to success and it is achieved through the receipt of social approval and the admiration of others (33). When individuals are rewarded with positive feedback and when they see faces brimming with pride over their accomplishments, they feel pride and understand that they stand well in comparison to others (26). Success enhances self-esteem and feelings of pride. Self-esteem and a sense of pride serve as positive means to find success in society (6,21). Pride in One's Work and Efforts Pride is sometimes used to describe the satisfaction achieved through the completion of a task to the best of one's ability. Former Major League Baseball player and Hall of Fame member Don Sutton illustrated the belief that one should take pride in doing one's job and in doing it well (22): I grew up in rural Clio, Alabama and in rural northwest Florida where your work ethic was what you took pride in, whether you might have been a farmer or a carpenter or whatever. You showed up on time, you did your job, and you went home. (5) Sutton believed it was his responsibility to prepare himself for games to the best of his ability each day and that by doing so; he could feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. National Football League quarterback and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Drew Brees explained why he believed some athletes are superior to others. …",

      "abstract": "I discuss several forms of bias, or fallacious thinking, that lead to parochialism, that is, a willingness to sacrifice self-interest for in-group members while neglecting or underweighing negative effects on outsiders, so that an out-group could lose more than the in-group gains from the sacrifice. In the self-interest illusion, people fallaciously think that their contribution to their group comes back to benefit them and make their sacrifice worthwhile. This illusion is larger when an outgroup is affected, and it is specific to group benefits; it is unrelated to the desire to hurt another group out of sheer competition. A second bias is the tendency to de-personalize the individuals involved and think about the groups. This is reduced when people make analogous decisions about individuals. I suggest that approval voting -- at least when both groups vote -- can lead people to take the out-group into account. Omission bias, the preference for harming others through omissions rather than actions, is greater for out-group members. Parochialism can be moralized: people think of it as absolute and objectively moral, they are willing to impose it moralistically on others, and they consider the support of the in-group to be their duty as citizens. I conclude with suggestions for reducing the harmful effects of parochialism.",

      "abstract": "The male experience of infertility has been widely misunderstood, largely because cultural socialization and methodologic limitations restrict men’s expression. While many have believed that men are not emotionally impacted by infertility, recent studies show that men actually experience a variety of complex emotional reactions to an infertility diagnosis, including depression, helplessness, and threats to their masculine identity. In addition, men commonly report feeling they have little to contribute to medical treatments – even in cases of male-factor infertility. Qualitative research has provided insight into the complex inner landscape men experience when navigating infertility. Healthcare and mental health professionals are in a unique position to increase men’s involvement in the treatment process. Fertility counselors now have the skills and training to help men navigate the infertility journey by giving them the tools and strategies they need to cope with this unexpected life stressor, increase social support, and enhance their overall quality of life and well-being.",

The claim is made that sexualized behaviour need not always be an indication for sexual abuse, but could rather result from a sexualized children culture or tradition. The teaching that one must always believe juveniles who claim that they have been sexually abused is considered doubtful an the general claim that \"fathers are the abusers\" is criticized. The suitability of the victim-perpetrator terminology for the work in child guidance centres is questioned. Finally, the frequently recommended conspirative way of dealing with allegations is rejected and instead the plea is made for closer co-operation between experts and police or state prosecutor. All in all it ist argued that child guidance centres should call more attention to their own particular possibilities in dealing with sexual abuse.",

The catastrophic prospect of boundary violations, particularly with minors, can lead to a timid avoidance of the erotic in the work with adolescents, yielding is term as ‘erotic insufficiency’. The body of the adolescent is changing radically before his or her own, as well as the eyes. The emerging bodily experiences of the adolescent (first menstruation, first wet dream, first masturbation to orgasm, etc.) are parts of a ‘virgin territory’. Timid avoidance of erotic feelings in the consulting room deprives adolescents of sincere adult thinking in relation to allowing and managing sexual feelings.",

Dentro do campo da sexualidade, a ejaculação precoce pode ter várias consequências negativas na vida de um homem, incluindo: ansiedade e estresse, problemas de relacionamento, problemas de saúde mental. A insatisfação sexual pode levar a uma diminuição do desejo sexual, tensão e ressentimento em um relacionamento. Em alguns casos, pode até levar a uma separação ou divórcio. Felizmente, existem várias opções de tratamento para ejaculação precoce, os homens podem procurar ajuda de um profissional de saúde e utilizar medicamentos prescritos, terapia comportamental ou uma combinação de ambos que auxiliarão no tratamento desse problema.

Além disso, a ejaculação precoce pode desencadear ansiedade, estresse e baixa autoestima nos homens, afetando sua saúde emocional e bem-estar geral. Outra consequência relevante é o impacto nos relacionamentos íntimos, com a ejaculação precoce contribuindo para conflitos conjugais, diminuição da intimidade emocional e até mesmo o término de relacionamentos. The history of human sexuality is long and complex, and is influenced by many factors, including culture, religion, politics, science, and technology. Within the field of sexuality, premature ejaculation can have several negative consequences on a man's life, including anxiety and stress, relationship problems, and mental health problems.: Sexual dissatisfaction can lead to a decrease in sexual desire, tension, and resentment in a relationship. In some cases, it can even lead to a separation or divorce. Fortunately, there are several treatment options for premature ejaculation, men can seek help from a healthcare professional and use prescription medications, behavioral therapy, or a combination of both that will help treat this problem. It is concluded that the consequences of premature ejaculation in men have negative impacts on sexual satisfaction, emotional health, and intimate relationships.

      "title": "Medical Errors: Responsibility and Informal Penalties",
      "abstract": "Economic analyses of sources of legal compliance mainly address the threat of formal penalties. Formal penalties are state-imposed and involve material or physical deprivations in the form of fines and incarceration. The other disciplines, however, especially psychology and sociology, go beyond the issue of formal penalties by discussing the role of informal ones in refraining individuals from certain socially unwanted acts. We define such informal penalties as either socially imposed (shame) or self-imposed (guilt). Socially imposed penalties include embarrassment or loss of respect that individuals might experience from significant others when they violate social norms. Such penalties also arise if one feels that he/she might be potentially judged by significant others for behavior that is inappropriate or immoral. Self-imposed costs, on the other hand, are feelings of guilt that arise when individuals offend their own conscience by engaging in behavior they consider morally wrong. Examples include feelings of responsibility or remorse for some offense, crime, or wrong-doing or bad consciousness due to the violation of internal codes. As follows from what has been presented, the distinction between formal and informal penalties depends upon the source of punishment. Whereas formal penalties are imposed by the state, informal ones are imposed by significant others or by oneself. Economic decision-making models are applied to analyze the role of formal penalties in preventing tax evasion. Such models predict a higher frequency (and amount) of tax evasion than is actually observed. 1 The high degree of honest tax-reporting being observed is by some believed to follow from the presence of non-pecuniary evasion costs such as guilt, social stigma, and reduction of self image. 2 One study provides evidence on individuals’ intention to violate law based on perceived threats including shame, guilt and legal sanctions,",

Although the phrase language deprivation syndrome may be new, the observation, that deficits observed in some deaf people's life skills might be due not to sensory deprivation or to social impoverishment, but specifically to deprivation, is not. Language deprivation is often the unintended outcome of well-intentioned efforts to promote a child's development. The existence of deprivation is a corollary to the existence of a critical period for learning one's first language. The most severe cases of deprivation therefore follow a child's not being exposed to consistent and fully elaborated during the entire critical period, approximately the first five years of life. Language deprivation persists in large part because it crosses the boundaries of multiple professional disciplines, none of which is solely responsible for a child's outcome.",

When the construct \"pedophile\" was separated from the construct \"sex offender against a minor,\" there were no reliable findings regarding \"pedophiles.\" \"Sex offenders against minors\" were noted fairly consistently to have experienced early disturbances in mother relationships and were found for the most part to be non‐violent and not aroused by sexually aggressive stimuli involving children (although a smaller portion were violent and/or were aroused by such stimuli). A subgroup of these offenders displayed the passive, lonely and shy profile frequently thought to be associated with the pedophile, although such tendencies were not clinically significant and were similar to profiles found among other types of sex offenders. With the exception of the tautological diagnosis of \"sexual deviate,\" little clinically significant pathology was found among either \"pedophiles\" or \"sex offenders against minors.\" Recommendations are made for more productive approaches for future research.

      "abstract": "Love, an intimate relationship in human society, has a special psychological meaning for everyone and enables each individual to get a sense of belonging, self-worth and the spiritual needs of love and being loved.Most of the current papers are focused on the educational level of the orientation and correction of marital values, and there are many gaps in the analysis of the psychological effects behind, which are far from meeting the current needs for the solution of the marital dilemma in China.This article adopts a literature research approach to explore the psychological problems faced by people in romantic affairs, as well as the causes, from a social psychological perspective.It will provide constructive help and reminders for coping with romantic psychological disorders at the social, school, family, and individual levels.The research finds that: in love, people are always easy to be attracted to the advantages of one side of each other, and indulge in love that cannot be controlled.However, they always have disputes over communication, break up for economic reasons, and often lose themselves in love.Unreasonable use or unconscious indulgence of the halo effect, compulsive repetition, sunk cost effect, Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, Freud's psychoanalysis theory, partners' effective communication barriers, Lucifer effect, etc. are the psychological root causes of love problems.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective This study explores the experiences of direct‐to‐consumer (DTC) genetic test results of recipients who learn of unexpected biological paternity, not parent expected (NPE). We characterize the process of disclosing NPE discoveries, as well as the benefits and the repercussions of such disclosures on individuals, families, and others. Background The popularity of DTC genetic testing is increasing. Consequently, many discover unexpected information about their ancestry, heritage, and paternity. Methods This qualitative study used an inductive thematic analysis of in‐depth interviews with adults ( n = 27; aged 40–70) who received DTC genetic test results revealing unexpected biological paternity. Results The NPE disclosure dilemma encompasses uncertainty about narrating their discovery; gauging the dispositions of others; wondering what repercussions may arise; and managing feelings about stigma, betrayal, and anger. Culture, history, and family dynamics are vital in navigating disclosures. A desire to understand their origins, connect with new genetic families, and validate their sense of self is essential. Biological connections of kinship remain important arbiters of relatedness for many individuals. Conclusion Disclosure of NPE discoveries differs from other stigmatized identities because the secret belongs to someone else; thus, self‐disclosure affects the entire family system. Implications Drawing on family systems theory and disclosure processes model, our findings provide insights into the intricate dynamics inherent in NPE disclosure.",

      "abstract": "Background —Stroke is a complex genetic disorder with a variable phenotype. Investigations of heritable factors in complex genetic disorders use pedigree and genetic techniques, which pose different ethical and methodological challenges than those routinely encountered in therapeutic research. Building consensus on acceptable research practices in this field is vital to the success of multicentered collaborations. Summary of Review —We review important ethical and methodological concerns related to the collection, storage, and release of pedigree research information. The human studies aspects of pedigree research are complicated methodologically because individuals can be active or passive participants and pedigrees can be proband derived, partially validated, or fully validated. Current research ethics frameworks do not work well outside of a dyadic researcher-subject relationship. Privacy and confidentiality for family members must be considered in pedigree research. Investigators should anticipate potential conflicts of interest among family members when designing a pedigree research protocol. Conclusions —We propose a “proband-initiated contact” methodology in which the proband or the proband’s designate allows identification of potential families without breaching the privacy of individuals in the family. In situations in which family history data are collected without direct contact between researchers and individuals in the proband’s family, an Institutional Review Board may waive consent by family members after appropriate review of the protocol and application of rules for granting waivers of consent. Certificates of Confidentiality should be considered.",

      "abstract": "Separate lines of research show that men overestimate the extent of male peers' sexual activity, and independently, that sexually aggressive men believe that other men approve of coercive behavior. This study examined the intersection of these lines of inquiry, testing whether the degree of male participants' misperception of other men's sexual behavior differs as a function of perpetrator status. In a national sample, we presented heterosexually active men (n = 497) with sexual scenarios varying in sexual acts, partner types, and circumstances. Results showed that participants significantly overestimated the typicality of all types of sexual situations for other men. Participants also misjudged the desirability of scenarios consistent with a traditional masculinity sexual script to other men; these scenarios reflected an adversarial perspective on relationships and an impersonal approach to sexuality – a known risk factor for sexual aggression. Further, sexually aggressive men overestimated the desirability of these traditional masculinity scenarios to a greater extent than non-aggressive peers. Findings suggest that interventions that provide accurate knowledge about social norms, or \"typical\" sexual desires and behaviors among other men, may reduce pressure to live up to perceived but perhaps inaccurate masculine ideals, as well as reduce social norm-related risks for sexually aggressive behavior.",

      "abstract": "Sociologists tend to define deviance in one of two ways: by the negative reactions an act, the expression of a belief, or a physical characteristic generates, or by the violation of the norms or the rules that prevail in a given society or group. Reactivist definitions come in two varieties: the “hard” or strict reactivist definition, which defines deviance as acts, beliefs, or conditions that have already attracted a negative reaction from one or more audiences, and the “soft” or moderate definition, which defines deviance as behavior, beliefs, or conditions that are likely to generate negative reactions from audiences. In contrast, the normative definition identifies deviance as a violation of a norm held in certain social circles or by a majority of the members of the society at large. A norm is a standard about “what human beings should or should not think, say, or do under given circumstances” (Blake &amp; Kingsley 1964). Put another way, a norm is a social expectation concerning thought or behavior in particular situations. Violations of norms tend to draw reactions or sanctions from their social audiences. These sanctions generate the pressure that most people feel to conform to social norms. However, even if the actor, the believer, or the possessor is not detected or chastised for a normative violation, the non‐normative act, belief, or trait is deviant nonetheless. To the normative definition, what defines something as deviance is a formal violation of the rules.",

      "title": "Stress, Coping and Ageing",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY While on one hand, when one grows old, one becomes, vulnerable to stresses because fewer resources are available, ageing an the other hand confers certain advantages in coping with stresses in life. Illness as a stress taxes considerable energy and efforts from the elderly in coping with it. Systematic studies in Chinese are few and far between. Empirical research in this regard is in want. Keywords: stress, coping, ageing, Chinese STRESSES AT OLD AGE In general, life is characterised by a multiplicity of stresses. People react to these stresses with their own clusters of defense mechanisms or coping skills. As a result, these protective mechanisms determine the amount of strain an individual experiences and the subsequent likelihood of its expression as psycho-pathology. In particular, old age is marked by the presence of a wide range of stressors. The older person is often subject to biological deterioration, social extrusion, and economic deprivation. The course of events at this period of lifespan is such that these traumas may occur in rapid succession without allowing the person time to regain his balance before confronting the next stressor. Even taken individually, particular stressors will separately dictate an array of coping mechanisms for successful outcomes. Evans (1984) draws on a number of studies to suggest that adverse life events occur more frequently in old age and that their occurrence causally increases the prevalence of illness in old age. As the elderly population encounters these and other loss events, resolution of life events may be hampered by their relative social status in relation to younger age groups. Dowd (1980) has argued that social exchange between young and older age groups is characterised by an imbalance in the exchange ratio which effectively places the elderly in a double bind, namely, that declining resources in old age entails negotiating from weakness at a time when resources are exchanged for less than they would be for a younger person. Alternatively, it is still possible that older adults actually encounter fewer stressful events than the young (Lowenthal, Thurber & Chiriboga, 1975; George, 1980; Harris, 1989). But the fact remains. many of the stresses of younger adults' lives have pleasant aspects. Leaving home, getting married, having a baby, buying a house, getting a promotion are all stressful, but they also bring challenge and reward. In contrast, many of the stresses of later adulthood are primarily negative: poor health, reduced income, death of a spouse (Chiriboga & Cutler, 1980). In this line of thought, problems in the life of the aged often are conceptualised as divergences from an optimal state of well-being, whether these divergences are caused by health problems, or by loss of social roles, economic resources, or significant others (Atchley, 1989). However, it may in fact be the case that the elderly are particularly prone to experience multiple, albeit low prevalence of, life events, which could act synergistically to cause decline in well-being (Fried & Bush, 1988). None the less, even when elderly people might cope better with loss of a spouse or close relatives, and friends than do younger counterparts, they undoubtedly exhibit greater vulnerability when confronted with certain life events. Notable among these is residential relocation. This has local relevance when we realise there is a booming industry of old-aged home in Hong Kong owing to mass emigration of younger people In recent years (Cheng, 1993). WHY MORE VULNERABLE While the potentially adverse consequences of stress are universal and apply across the lifespan, there are at least several reasons why elderly person are particularly vulnerable. Firstly, relative to younger contemporaries, they are typically confronted with a multitude of major life events following on the heels of each other. …",

Using a high-stakes experimental paradigm and an immersive role-playing paradigm, we examined the psychology of experimentally-induced partial innocence on plea decisions. Participants were randomly induced to be either wholly innocent, guilty, or partially innocent of committing an academic transgression and then given the choice to accept or reject a plea deal to avoid disciplinary sanction. Partially innocent participants pled to cheating nearly as often as guilty participants and vastly more often than innocent participants. Partially innocent participants—not unlike guilty participants—experienced greater feelings of guilt than did innocent participants. In turn, these feelings of guilt, but not shame, were associated with taking responsibility for comparable, less severe, and more severe transgressions not committed.",

      "title": "Intergenerational transmission of antisocial personality disorder: Maternal role and its declination",
      "abstract": "Antisocial personality disorder is a well-established disease which features space from cruelty to lack of empathy and remorse. Its etiology has been deeply analyzed both for genetic and environmental implications. The role of family context has been underlined throughout the whole psychopathology as an explanation to the etiological conflict between nature and nurture. Even if this conflict seems to be apparently solved, it is still possible to ponder about family implications in terms of causes and consequences. In the antisocial field, maternal role may offer interesting and surprising food for thought. Even if it is commonly believed an intergenerational transmission of aberrant behaviors, particularly in terms of learning behaviors and lack of empathy assimilation, it exists a side part of maternal pathological expression that may play a role in the intergenerational transmission and it is extremely difficult to be detected. Female declination of this disorder may be expressed also through somatic implications and complaints, leading to the hypothesis of a self-reflection of the lack of consideration for other's needs, which is distinctive. It is of extreme importance, particularly in terms of prevention, to consider and identify these connotations of the disorder to be able to try to interrupt the cycle of transmission through generations.

The relatively low degree of institutionalization of adolescence as a status position and the marginal position of the adolescent in terms of role expectations in American society are reflected in the fact that most of the norms governing adolescent behavior do not have adolescent behavior patterns as their reference point. Rather, the norms and expectations governing adolescent behavior have either child or adult behavior patterns as their reference point. The exhortations of parents and other adults admonish the adolescent either to like a grown-up or to quit behaving like a child.. They rarely encourage him to like an adolescent.

      "title": "Couple Therapy with GLB-Straight Relationships",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mixed-orientation relationships can be mutually satisfying and unproblematic. They may become challenging when one partner's gay, lesbian, or bisexual orientation is revealed unexpectedly during a long-term relationship, and the G/L/B partner wishes to act on his or her same-sex attractions, or the straight partner cannot come to terms with the revelation. Awareness and disclosure of same-sex attractions are often delayed due to the cultural and personal effects of homophobia and biphobia. Couple therapy can help these couples by helping them to understand the different experiences and therapeutic needs of the partners, sorting through and addressing the underlying relational issues brought out by the conflict, providing education and resources, and offering possibilities for redefining the relationship. The therapist should be aware of the diverse outcomes that can result and be prepared to facilitate the negotiation of changes. Successfully creating a sustainable relationship depends on the quality of the relationship before disclosure and both partners' willingness to focus on reconstructing the relationship.

      "title": "What’s love got to do with jealousy?",
      "abstract": "Romantic love and jealousy seem antagonistic, but the expression of both emotions have evolutionary functions that can go in the same direction of maintaining a relationship. Considering natural selection designed adaptations to solve the problems surrounding reproduction, then love and romantic jealousy are emotions aimed at staying cooperative for a period of time, where love solves the adaptive challenges of promoting pair bonding, cooperation, and protecting offspring; and jealousy is triggered by a threat or the loss of a valuable cooperative relationship, either on behalf of descendants in need of resources, or a close romantic bond. Consequently, understanding love and romantic jealousy points in the same adaptive functional domain of protecting a romantic pair bond. Specifically, love can be comprehended in two different ways and in regard to jealousy. First, conceiving love as the attachment to significant others one develops throughout lifetime, and secondly, it contemplates affective dependence. Results from a sample of single and committed individuals ( n = 332) show the predicted positive correlation between attachment and jealousy as stable traits, consistent with previous literature. In addition, there is a non-significant and low correlation, respectively, between attachment and love as a measure of dependence. Furthermore, in the single participants group, jealousy was associated with love. The discussion emphasizes the need for expanding a functional account of love and jealousy as complementary emotions of our human affective endowment. Finally, it would be informative to study attachment as a relational trait and love as a specific affection for a romantic partner that could be manipulated to elucidate the functional design of jealousy.",

      "abstract": "Aims: two important processes involving the exercise of power are mobbing and suppression of dissent. These are examined, compared and contrasted with the aim of expanding the understanding of organisational and professional negative dynamics. Methods: The characteristic features and patterns of mobbing and suppression of dissent are examined. Areas of overlap and difference are noted and discussed. Results: Dissent is a challenge to a dominant group or set of ideas, and often met with various reprisals, such as ostracism, harassment and censorship: dissenters are frequently subject to mobbing. However, there are some different processes involved. Some targets of mobbing are chosen because they are different, not because they are challenging an orthodoxy. Some forms of suppression do not involve mobbing: a dissident researcher might be denied jobs and have publications and grant applications rejected, but not be subject to any personal abuse. The result is that individuals or ideas may be marginalised without the usual features of mobbing. Mobbing and suppression of dissent overlap with reprisals against whistleblowers. Some whistleblowers are mobbed or suppressed. However, suppression can occur without whistleblowing, for example when researchers obtain results unwelcome to powerful groups. Conclusion: A greater understanding of processes of suppression can assist mobbing researchers understand the wider dimensions of power used by groups against opponents. Mobbing sometimes is used to suppress. They both share many strategies, but nonetheless they are different. Key words: mobbing, suppression of dissent, whistleblowers",

In histories characterized by unrepaired losses, people found adults suffering loneliness and isolation, anxious/insecure attachments where conflicted longings for closeness can lead to needs for bodily affect regulation, such as masturbation, to calm and soothe. Boys are pressured/forced to move into a relational vacuum leading to a tendency towards avoidant attachment, making for a tendency towards relationless sexuality in adult life.

Violation refers to the outrage or utter disregard to a person’s body and, therefore, corresponds to a denial of love. Violation implies physical violence of any sort to the body or the psyche, causing an offense, a negative feeling to whom suffers such abuse, which leads on many occasions towards death. Dispossession means to jeopardize a person’s right to own property, of any sort, and therefore, corresponds to a denial to the recognition that derives from Law.

Some bisexual individuals internalize society's negative attitudes, resulting in an experience of self-stigma. Consequently, many bisexual individuals report a reduced sense of belonging. The current study explored whether self-stigma mediates the association between experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice and a sense of belonging within a bisexual sample (n = 529) while also identifying how experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice vary as a function of participant gender (man, woman, non-binary) and the source of prejudice (gay/lesbian or heterosexual). Self-stigma fully mediated the association between anti-bisexual experiences and a sense of belonging. Women and non-binary individuals reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences than men, and all participants reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences from heterosexual versus gay/lesbian sources. Efforts to improve a sense of belonging among bisexual individuals should focus on reducing anti-bisexual prejudice and anti-bisexual self-stigma.",

      "abstract": "The concept malignant bonding describes a relationship of a perverse couple whose relationships continues to bond at expense of sadistic and sexual acts perpetrated together against vulnerable and dependent persons, such as their own children or other immature individuals who fall under their control and dominancy. Technology has afforded most sophisticated means to do so; from only recording voices of those innocent children as in 60s to making of home videos and downloading different images from internet are now easily available. It is difficult to disentangle possible meaning of this perverse recording—is it another kind of remembering? Or is it a form of malignant bonding between past and present experience? Not only there are notorious cases from media such as Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, called The Moor murderers in 60s in UK and later on West Family. \r\n\r\nThese are examples of both extra family and interfamily malignant bonding but I have also been able to corroborate these in my own clinical findings, which I have termed concept of the malignant bonding. This couple these two different persons, have felt, as from moment of their first meeting, in almost automatic pilot mode, very close and united together not knowing exactly why. However, this great sense of wonder starts fading away when union is to be in some way contrived or coercive from within. Now, taboo elements is no longer present and sense of excitement is gone. What happens next? The purusing of transgressing has become compelling element and as such using and exploiting, including sexual abuse of children may start. There is an irrepressible need to continue succumbing to these transgressive actions because, just like in pornography, it makes them feel alive. They feel really dead inside themselves and their own way to make sure they are still alive is by exerting this enormous sense of power and control over their children. \r\n\r\nThis power has an added element of libidinizing interaction between couple. This can be initiated and even stimulated not only by man but also by woman in couple. We are longer talking of who is victim of perpetrator within couple. They have both become partners with equal participation in designing and execution of their actions against their own severe very early traumatic experiences.",

      "title": "The Mystery of Mammalian Puberty: How Much More Do We Know?",
      "abstract": "THE MYSTERY OF MAMMALIAN PUBERTY: HOW MUCH MORE DO WE KNOW? SERGIO R. OJEDA* Introduction The advent of sexual maturation is one of the most remarkable events in the life span of an individual. In both humans and lower species the attainment of puberty signals sexual availability, but in even the most primitive cultures puberty also represents the end of absolute parental dependence and the initiation of greater (and not necessarily welcomed) social responsibilities. The ancients were fascinated, as we are, by the somatic changes associated with sexual development but were not particularly attentive to the psychological manifestations of the process. Nowadays this is recognized as important, but in contrast to the somatic changes, little if anything is known about the influence that hormones may have in shaping and/or initiating pubertal psychological and behavioral shifts. Strong morphological , biochemical, and molecular evidence now exists, indicating that steroid hormones of gonadal and adrenal origin are recognized by specific receptor molecules in discrete brain areas, thereby affecting neuronal function in various manners. Thus, it would not be unreasonable to suspect that the underlying biological component of pubertal changes in mood, cognitive behavior, and social adaptation involves the action of steroid hormones on relevant neuronal populations. While detection of psychological changes during human puberty may require considerable experience, the somatic changes are so conspicuous that they cannot pass unnoticed by even the most casual observer. There is little doubt that a major part of these changes is determined by the integrated activation of different components of the neuroendocrine system. For instance, breast development in girls requires the concerted action of many hormones, including gonadal steroids, prolactin, and *Division of Neuroscience, Oregon Regional Primate Research Center, 505 N.

The neuroendocrine mechanisms involved in the onset of mammalian puberty are exceedingly complex and not readily accessible to detailed scrutiny. It is thus not surprising that progress toward their elucidation has been slow and painstakingly acquired. This article does not intend to review the existing literature in the field; rather, it will attempt to provide a perspective of how our thinking has evolved over the years, where we are now, and what may be some new avenues of research that may lead us to solve the mystery of puberty. Necessarily succinct—and to provide a more focused perspective on the problem, the article will draw mainly from evidence gathered in rats and rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Those readers interested in more details are referred to recent in-depth review articles [1-3]. No attempt will be made to discuss the intriguing but still poorly understood area of psychoneuroendocrinology of puberty. Finally, in discussing the neuroendocrine regulation of puberty, we shall make the assumption that the anatomical and functional core of this process is the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Basic interactions within the axis include production of the neuropeptide luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) by a group of specialized hypothalamic neurons, the transportation of LHRH via the portal vasculature to the anterior pituitary where it stimulates gonadotropin secretion, the stimulatory effect of gonadotropins on gonadal function, and the regulatory effects of gonadal hormones on hypothalamic -pituitary function. The Early Days An early implication that sexual maturation was controlled by the central nervous system came with the clinical observation that delayed puberty in patients with Frohlich's syndrome was associated with ventral brain damage [4]. It was not until 1932, however, that Hohlweg and Junkmann [5] advanced the concept of a neural \"sex center\" involved in controlling puberty and reproductive cyclicity. Unexpectedly, this concept did not gain acceptance until 20 years later, when Harris and Jacobsohn conclusively demonstrated the pivotal role of the hypothalamus in controlling anterior pituitary function [6]. These findings initiated an era in which experimental situations were imposed to manipulate the neuroendocrine axis and attempts were made to measure hormonal changes. Surprisingly, many basic conclusions and core assumptions that have governed our understanding of...",

This can scarcely be disputed, but to assert, as many authorities do, that a variety of severe psychological abnormalities may arise in the child as a result of such deprivation is to make an assumption of some magnitude. It requires an even greater assumption to postulate a causal connection between a long-past occurrence like childhood bereavement and a psychiatric illness which develops in adult life. It will be contended here that, with some exceptions, the evidence for such a connection is meagre. In particular, it will be shown that there is no apparent justification for regarding parental deprivation as an aetiological factor in depressive illness.",

Behavioural measures, on the other\nhand, tend to show that self-reported religious prosociality\ndoes not reveal itself in real-life behaviour. Conversely,\nthere is a growing body of evidence that suggests that\nreligious situations/contexts/ecologies do have significant\nprosocial effects (increased cooperation, generosity,\nreciprocity, trust and altruism; reduced cheating etc.)\nirrespective of religious belief or individual religiosity, be\nthey expressions of extended prosociality or parochial in-group\nfavouritism. Recent experimental studies, supporting these\neffects for in-group members, moved these findings into natural\nsettings by using public good games in real-life religious\ncontexts. However, the effects of religious primes on out-group\nmembers have yet to be investigated. To address this research\nquestion, we conducted the first study of cross-religious\nprimes on prosocial behaviour. This poster discusses the\nresults of our field experiment that compared the effects of\nChristian, Hindu, and secular contextual primes on generosity\namong Mauritian Catholics, using a within-subject experimental\ndesign. Specifically, participants made economic decisions in\nthree different locations: an in-group religious setting (a\nCatholic church); an out-group religious setting (a Hindu\ntemple); and a neutral secular setting (a restaurant). We\npredicted that Catholic participants would be more generous in\nboth Christian and Hindu contexts compared to the secular\ncontext, and that there would be no main effect of an\nindividual's religiosity on generosity.",

      "abstract": "It is generally accepted that today quite different demands are made of a 'terminated analysis' from those made a decade ago or even earlier. In analytical work with people it can be proved, without exception, that they suffer from a special anxiety. In tracing back this anxiety, the psycho-analytical work always led back to childhood, to a similar situation. Usually it was grown-ups who had, by their actions, evoked sexual excitation, thereby producing in the defenceless child amounts of pleasure it was not yet able to bear. In psycho-analytic literature one always finds fear of punishment as the primal cause of the formation of character. The intention of punishment is always to force the child to identify himself with the punishing authority, therefore to transform his ego in order to enable him to avoid further punishment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Why do people think that someone living a morally bad life is less happy than someone living a good life? One possibility is that judging whether someone is happy involves not only attributing positive psychological states (i.e., lots of pleasant emotions, few unpleasant emotions, and satisfaction with life) but also forming an evaluative judgment. Another possibility is that moral considerations affect happiness attributions because they tacitly influence attributions of positive psychological states. In two studies, we found strong support for the second hypothesis. Moral considerations only appear to affect happiness attributions when they also affect attributions of positive psychological states. Additionally, both studies supported a hypothesis about why moral judgments have these effects. Specifically, we found that when people judge that someone is living a bad life, they infer that the person is not at peace with themselves. However, when this inference is blocked, moral considerations do not affect attributions of happiness or positive psychological states. In sum, although “happiness” appears to be a purely psychological concept, happiness judgments are sensitive to moral considerations because people often assume that immorality disrupts intrapersonal harmony.",

      "abstract": "Addiction, which is one of the major problems of society and is spreading severely day by day, is considered a complex process where an individual develops an uncontrollable desire for a substance or behavior, continues this desire, and has difficulty ending it despite both physical and psychological harm. Food addiction is a type of addiction where individuals consume food not only to meet their physiological needs but also uncontrollably for emotional and psychological satisfaction. Individuals with food addiction tend to eat to cope with emotional states such as stress, anxiety, and depression, leading to unhealthy eating habits and weight problems. In such addictions, the treatment process requires addressing not only the improvement of physical symptoms but also the emotional and psychological factors that trigger the addiction. Although food addiction usually arises from depression or other psychological disorders, in some cases, individuals may feel the need to eat to feel better after experiencing abuse. This situation can become uncontrollable, leading to food addiction, which negatively affects both the mental and physical health of individuals. This study is a case study of a 41-year-old woman named S.A., who developed food addiction as a result of sexual abuse by her parent at the age of 13. The gradual progression of the abuse and the subsequent development of food addiction are examined in detail, along with the effects of EMDR and CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) on overcoming the food addiction.",

The particular focus here is on cases in which complainants are said to lack the capacity to consent. Persons who are asleep, unconscious, or in a persistent vegetative state can be categorically and uniformly held to be incapable of consenting, without much risk of overinclusiveness. But the situation presented by persons suffering from intellectual or communicative deficits or who are intoxicated is more variegated and complex. There is a danger that if incapacity in these spheres is defined too broadly, some people who suffer from mental disabilities or who drink for the purpose of making themselves less inhibited might be denied the opportunity to have genuinely consensual sex.",

A lack of knowledge of causes, symptoms and treatment options of mental disorders in the public and a lack of personal contact with affected individuals can result in prejudices and negative attitudes towards them–and subsequently in stigmatization and discrimination. Human beings suffering from mental illness often are recognized as 'strangers'. But, social-psychological and philosophical analysis of the recognition of 'strangeness' in mentally ill individuals as one of the main predictors for social distance towards them, shows, that the other person only remains a stranger if the available cognitive patterns of interpretation fail. Society must provide the people living in it with the interpretational patterns to take away the recognized strangeness from mentally ill persons and thus making him, or her, an accepted other member.",

Early onset predicts a long antisocial career. Since antisocial behaviour and risk taking is more prevalent in men, explanations may be biological as well as social. Antisocial individuals tend to be versatile in their behaviours, although early adulthood is characterised by a switch from group offending to lone offending. Overall, diversification in antisocial behaviours is seen up to the age of about 20, followed by gradual specialisation in particular types of antisocial behaviours, such as illicit use of drugs.2\n\nIndependent precursors of an antisocial lifestyle include antisocial child behaviour, impulsivity, school failure, an antisocial family, poor parenting, and economic deprivation.2 Turning points away from an antisocial lifestyle include getting a job, getting married, moving to a better area, …",

      "abstract": "Peer contagion refers to the process of mutual influence that occurs between an individual and a peer. Historically, peer contagion has included influence on behaviors and emotions with potential negative developmental consequences, including aggression, bullying, weapon carrying, disordered eating, drug use, and depression. Increasingly, however, “contagion” of positive behaviors and emotions is being investigated as well. Nevertheless, in general, the study of peer influence and contagion processes has been a relatively recent one, with increased interest since the late 20th century. Mechanisms of peer influence like peer coercion, deviancy training, and even evolutionary and neural explanations for peer effects are all being increasingly studied in natural and laboratory settings. Much of the literature on peer influence focuses on childhood and adolescence, and for good reason. An abundance of evidence suggests that peer influence is strongest and most impactful among youth, though to a lesser degree adults can still be subject to social influence by their peers. Additionally, adolescence in particular seems to be a critical developmental period for social and neural processes critical to engaging with peers. Peer influence need not be intentional; in fact, individuals may engage in relationship behaviors that satisfy immediate needs for an audience or companionship, and inadvertently influence themselves or others. Peer influence processes are ubiquitous, occurring both in natural peer interaction settings and intervention settings that purposely aggregate children and adolescents together. The issue of peer contagion in intervention settings is an important one, with evidence suggesting at least some interventions that aggregate high-risk youth can have unintended, harmful iatrogenic effects.",

      "title": "Into the Twilight Zone: Informing Judicial Discretion in Federal Sentencing",
      "abstract": "Recent changes in federal sentencing have shifted discretionary decision-making back to federal district court judges, while appellate courts review challenged sentences for reasonableness. Each judge brings considerable legal experience and qualifications to the bench, however, cultural experiences cannot necessarily prepare judges for the range of persons or situations they will address on the bench. Social psychologists who have studied social cognition have determined that the human brain creates categories and associations resulting in implicit biases and associations that are often unconscious or subconscious. Moreover, research suggests that such biases may be overcome or at least compensated by education on awareness of bias and countermeasures. Identifying unconscious preferences or biases and learning effective mechanisms for managing and changing unwanted preferences can impact the reasonable exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis in sentencing decisions. Judges are expected to render decisions impartially. Nowhere is the need more critical than judicial determinations impacting liberty interests by imposing criminal punishment, and in particular, imprisonment. Lack of awareness or education is likely to lead to suboptimal sentencing outcomes based upon in-group bias, inaccurate cultural associations, and other cognitive flaws that will invite further political disruption. In contrast, investing in cultural competence and social cognition educational programs, and structuring programs to encourage interest in and attendance at such programs, can inform judges to improve their discretionary decision-making by overcoming any latent biases, thereby benefiting society through a more just legal system.",

Both stigma and social comparisons help to define the person's status in a ‘normal’ reference group, and are important antecedents of the individual's self esteem. Fifty students with a mild mental handicap completed a self esteem and social comparisons procedure which yielded discrepancy scores between the way they saw themselves and others (friends, siblings, non‐handicapped others, and ideals). They also talked about their perceptions of stigma and their aspirations for their lives. The students who perceived the most stigma had the lowest self esteem, the lowest ideals, and had the largest discrepancies between their scores and the scores of others. They also felt the least likely to fulfil their aspirations. The students with low self esteem also tended to view others in a negative light and to experience impoverished interpersonal relationships. The study also suggested that some students may derogate others, especially younger opposite sex siblings, to maintain their self esteem. This points to the importance of social comparisons within the family. Some implications for research and the professional management of stigma are discussed.",

Man has the right to live or not to be killed, but not the reciprocal right to die or to kill, although in borderline cases this is debatable. The right to die is executed by way of suicide and voluntary euthanasia. Suicide is committed due to hopelessness, shame or guilt feeling, terminal illness, loyalty to a dead person, and for political reasons. It can be performed by an individual, a pair (suicide pact), a family, a group or en masse. The medical profession should prevent all suicidal attempts and help the surviving victim, since it is its duty to prolong life and ameliorate suffering. Euthanasia is either positive or negative (not infrequently, and inaccurately, termed active or passive), voluntary or involuntary, direct or indirect, and by not implementing extraordinary or ordinary procedures in life saving. Reasons are put forward why euthanasia is condoned or condemned. The moral difference between the two forms of euthanasia are questioned by some serious ethicists. Conditions for negative euthanasia are presented if it is performed selectively, for which the demand is unfortunately real. Key Words: right to die-euthanasia-suicide-patient rights - bioethics",

These include youngsters with developmental deficiencies that interfere with their capacity to master the environment. Children with a strong family history of alcoholism or drug abuse also seem to be at high risk. Obviously, there is some overlap between these two groups, not only because parental drug abuse and alcoholism may damage the fetus, but because chemically dependent parents are more likely to abuse or neglect their children because of the impact of their own illness on their functioning as parents. In addition, families in which drug use is modeled as a typical behavior are more likely to produce adolescents who use drugs, although rigid rules against drug use are relatively ineffective in preventing adolescents from experimenting with drugs. Finally, certain behavior patterns in young childhood--particularly severe aggressiveness, rebelliousness, and learning problems at school--seem to be correlated with the development of chemical dependency during adolescence.",

Wright, including those regarding intimate pairing, have been culturally superimposed upon an archaic substratum designed within our ancestral environment for the purpose of carrying genetic material from one generation to another. Intimate relationships are not only affiliative or presentient, but contain a mixture of objective-complementary and subjective-concordant aspects. The literal loss of an intimate partner constitutes not only the loss of that individual and its tangible repercussions, but also the loss of the relational process that encompasses the intimacy.",

      "abstract": "Pedophilia is a complex, emergent and polemic theme.However, pedophilia does not imply committing abusive acts against children; once it is possible the pedophile sexual fantasy never emerges out of his mind.On the other hand, in case such sexual deviance exceed the limits of the person's imagination, then the child sex abuse is configured.It is relevant to observe that not only the pedophile practices acts which can be qualified as child's sex abuse, but also those acts practiced by opportunists or occasional abusers.Within the pedophile-child's relationship, the option for a study of the child is justifiable, mainly because it holds the position of victim and, as such, there cannot be any doubt that the damages are larger as a result of the abuse acts.In fact, a benevolent eye is set upon the child who suffered the abuse and needs, somehow, to receive the necessary support to rescue it from this situation.It is mentioned, in this paper, that historically children have always been victims of violence acts, and that the theme of child sex abuse comprises other aspects equally polemic, among which we can detach infantile sexuality and incest.In this connection, it is said that the existence of a healthy infantile childhood is relevant for the full development of children.It is pointed out that the child sex abuse has the peculiarity of being involved in a climate of secrecy, i.e. the silence covering abusive practices against children, so that the maintenance of the abuse is kept for a long time, the black cipher on this context being notable.With reference to the study of child sex abuse practiced by pedophilists, this focus is justifiable, in view of the seduction and deception involving pedophilic activities, which contribute to potentiate the trauma experienced by the victim.In this sense, it is said there are risk factors which precede the abuse, as well as theories about the victim are mentioned.It is noteworthy that the child and the abuser occupy distinct positions in the power relationship between them, and we must emphasize the need for investigation about which of the children, vulnerable by themselves, are on the victimization risk group.Risk factors for victimization are pointed out, such as, sex, age, social isolation and conflict relations with parents or between them.The process of approximation between the pedophile and the victim is indicated, as well as de damages suffered by the victim child.Criteria are supplied for the diagnosis of infant sex abuse, and factors capable of potentiating the victimization trauma are indicated.The initial and longterm abuse effects are described and, finally, considering the reflections on the risk factors prior to the abuse and on the damages after it, emphasizing the importance of taking preventive and remedial actions on infantile sex abuse, all of them based on multi-sector and multidisciplinary actions.",

She became anxiety-ridden when she saw that the social goals she had hoped to attain through her long struggle for an education were beyond her reach. Shortly after she realized that her education and her job did not solve her personal-emotional problems, her ego structure collapsed, and she experienced a psychotic episode. This woman felt throughout her life that she was handicapped severely by her family background. She aspired to a higher status than the one ascribed to her by her family of orientation, and she struggled to achieve a desired social position through education. In the end, she was trapped by her failure to utilize her educational achievement to solve her emotional needs in the social sphere. Class V. The class V patients, both psychoneurotics and schizophrenics, were either semi-skilled or unskilled workers. They felt their jobs were unsatisfactory; they worried about how long they would last, the nature of the work, that they did not pay enough to meet the needs of their families, that there was no advancement, that the job carried no status, and so on through a long series of specific irritations. The jobs they aspired to were relatively modest ones, such as stationary engineer, machinist, a foremanship, clerical work. Significantly, not a single class V patient realized his occupational aspirations. As a group, they were aware of the connection between good jobs, steady jobs, jobs that paid a living wage, and a dreamed-of standard of living. Occupational aspirations were stronger among the class V women, both patients and spouses of patients, than among the men. Apparently, they visualized the connection between education, jobs, and mobility than the men. About one-half of the men hoped for a steady, semi-skilled factory job; the remainder dreamed of skilled jobs. Their wives, however, wanted more money, shorter hours, higher status jobs for their husbands, and a better shake for the kids.",

      "abstract": "The need to belong refers to the strong, pervasive, and universal human motive to develop lasting, positive, and significant relationships with other people. This motive evolved through natural selection because our hominid ancestors who were motivated to establish and maintain connections with others were more likely to survive and reproduce than those who did not make efforts to be accepted and maintain social connections. As a result of the need to belong, people often behave in ways that increase the likelihood that they will be socially accepted, and lower the likelihood that they will be rejected. For example, people may try to increase their relational value to other people by achieving goals and being successful, conforming to social norms, being a good social exchange partner, being liked, and being physically attractive. Indeed, people are rarely indifferent to the possibility of being rejected. Depending on the circumstances, concerns about rejection can result in several emotions, including hurt feelings, social anxiety, jealousy, embarrassment, guilt, and shame. Although every normal person is motivated to be accepted and to belong, people differ in the strength of their need to belong.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The homosexual adolescent's decision to come out as gay or lesbian for the first time is a task which requires a certain level of inner and outer resources. Despite the fact that coming out is viewed by the literature as one of many necessary developmental steps in sexual identity formation and self-acceptance, coming out can be viewed as a unique stage in this developmental continuum. Coming out is an acknowledgment of one's orientation to another person. Thus, coming out is more than an intrapsychic process; it influences interpersonal relationships as well. A whole host of factors, including identity confusion, low self-esteem, depression, alienation, withdrawal, substance abuse, and indulgence in self-destructive behavior, may result if the adolescent has little or no support in this critical developmental stage process. Involvement in the gay community or other types of homosexual peer groups offers a unique sense of support that is especially needed during the coming out period.",

      "abstract": "Young children seem to overextend a ‘seeing = knowing rule’ so that they neglect to notice that people gain knowledge from inferring as well as from seeing. Yet that cannot be a sufficient explanation of children's problems with conceptualizing knowledge, because rule underextension occurs in children's claims to know something that they have not seen (nor inferred). The two errors were studied together with pairs of children aged 4 and 5 years. Each child had their own box, items on the table were shared out into the boxes, and either both children, or neither, or one of them, looked in their own box. Children were asked if they and the other knew what was in each other's box; and were asked for explanations and predictions. About a quarter of the children showed full competence. In others, overextension and underextension occurred; yet almost all children explained that inference was involved in knowing, without bias towards giving such explanation more for self than for other. Error patterns were not predictable from a test for understanding the term ‘know'. It is suggested that children have a framework conception of ‘knowing’ in which another's mind is treated as similar to own mind, but problems arise in implementing that insight before children manage to conceptualize constraints on knowledge.",

      "abstract": "A few decades ago the range of pathological forms of addictive behaviour was determined by the clinical consequences of excessive consumption of psychoactive substances. Today a lot of descriptions of new psychopathological phenomena appear, they are connected with a person’s new activities or opportunities under present-day conditions rather than with a person’s taking previously unknown chemical substances. These opportunities are connected with both having access to varieties of new gadgets and a wide range of means of creating illusions of the complete and prompt satisfaction of needs of communication, security, recognition, love, creativity, development. How much has the new opportunity era changed into the time of new addictions? The analysis showed that the prevalence of many forms of behavioural addictions is significant, particularly among young people. A disharmonic personality may shift from one addiction to another over time, illuding the people around them and specialists into thinking that this personality is “cured”. But the addiction will take another form, which will be “new” in a behavioural or technological way only. The “new” addictions reflect the ontogenetically ancient desire of a disharmonic personality to use an artificial method or technique to release high emotional tension, whether it is a psychoactive substance, communication in a social network or an impulse purchase in a shop. This way of getting rid of emotional discomfort makes a person feel pleased for a while, creates the illusion of solving a problem easily. Eventually, it leads to a reduction in the constructiveness of behaviour and the formation of addictions in a large variety of their forms. Under today’s conditions of intensive technological development behavioural addictions become more and more widespread, their definite clinical and scientific classification is not elaborated. Addictive behaviour takes various forms without changing the psychological and sociocultural mechanisms of its formation, and the degrees of social importance of these forms are varied.",

Narrative review conducted to summaries the roles of social workers in conversion therapy, all studies were included published in English language up to the end of 2022. There is no empirical evidence to support pathologizing or medicalizing sexual orientation and gender identity differences. According to studies, sexual orientation variation is widespread, and there is significant variation in patterns of sexual and gender expression both between individuals and within individuals over time. Conversion therapy creates an environment that is inherently discriminatory.

In this Article we propose that interparental hatred may be a key relationship dynamic driving the behavior of some in this group. We suggest a distinction between two types of interparental hatred: one that arises from responses to separation‐related stresses ( reactive hatred ) and the other ( entrenched hatred ) that is indicative of more embedded, dysfunctional interpersonal dynamics and/or personality structures. While reactive hatred is typically time limited and amenable to professional intervention, entrenched hatred tends to overwhelm rationally informed attempts to mediate, negotiate, or even adhere to orders regarding suitable parenting arrangements. We contend that while effective intervention in these cases requires all the generic skills and responses necessary for dealing with highly conflicted disputes, it is also important to name and appropriately challenge interparental hatred when it is detected.",

      "abstract": "Factors contributing to illegitimate adolescent pregnancies are examined in the hopes of providing a basis for establishing preventative and remedial approaches to the problem. Most of the information comes from previously published material. 7 nonsexual impulses which can be expressed in sexuality often leading to illegitimate pregnancy are 1) feelings of inadequacy; 2) a wish to be loved; 3) a wish to mother; 4) a wish to have a gift for the mother; 5) competition with the mother; 6) a wish to have a baby to identify with; and 7) hostility toward men. Studies indicate that somewhere along the line both the mother and father of an unwed mother have failed. Often the girls feel unloved and are not taught how to deal with and control their emotions. Many come from broken homes and have difficulty relating with other people. They appear to have a strong desire for self-punishment. The unwed mother is not usually promiscuous but her knowledge of sex and contraception often is very limited. A profile of the putative father generally does not reveal a sexual exploiter. Often he is very involved with his partner and willing to marry her. But he is immature and lacking in responsibility. He often does not have a strong masculine identity. Illegitimate pregnancies create social and financial problems to both the mother and the child. Those who give up their babies for adoption were found to be more stable intelligent and mature and to feel the stigma of illegitimacy more strongly. Many unwed mothers eventually marry the putative father; those who dont can pose serious problems related to economic support education child care and health. One way to cut down on the number of illegitimate children is to educate and provide contraceptives for girls who have already had an illegitimate pregnancy since about half of all illegitimate births are to mothers who already have 1 or amore illegitimate children.",

The nuclear industry is also affected by workplace trends which currently indicate that there will be fewer jobs and individuals who are employed will be required to have greater technical skills. This reshaping of the workforce is partially due to an aging workforce and diversity within the work environment. The reshaping brings with it the need for greater productivity and employee expectations for increased pay and/or benefits. If employee satisfaction is not realized there is a real possibility of disgruntled employees who then become a potential insider risk to the organization. Typically this is an individual who has been employed for several years, becomes dissatisfied with the job, or some other aspect of their life. If the dissatisfaction is directly related to work the individual may retaliate in a destructive manner. Perceived inequities are a major factor and directly related to situational pressures, opportunity, and personal integrity. It is known that the greatest losses within an organization are attributed to employees working alone or in a conspiracy with fellow employeesmore » who engage in theft and other fraudulent activities. In the nuclear industry this threat is intensified by the nature of the work, the materials employees come in contact with and the potential of an occurrence that could adversely affect a large geographic region and/or the security of a country.

      "title": "Attachment and Social Withdrawal in Autism: Hypotheses and Findings",
      "abstract": "Abstract Autism is characterized by an impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. This paper summarizes the research into the social abnormalities in autism, and reviews the empirical support for two behavioural hypotheses on autism, i.e. that autism results from impaired attachment, or from intense and prolonged approach-avoidance conflicts. The core social impairment of autistic subjects seems to be a deficit in attunement and timing of actions and reactions rather than a difference in frequencies of behaviours. Attachment behaviour of most, if not all autistic children tends to be disorganized; nevertheless, they do form attachment relationships in terms of preferential proximity seeking or reunion behaviour in the Strange Situation Test. Attachment studies performed sofar however have methodological limitations ; particularly the study of maternal-infant attunement and reciprocity has been neglected. Empirical evidence fails to support the presence of approach-avoidance conflicts in autistic subjects, and is further at variance with the predicted consequences of such conflicts. Insufficient attention has hitherto been paid to the clinical heterogeneity of autism in behavioural studies. A promising approach to deepen our understanding of the development of the autistic symptomatology is the early detection and subsequent behavioural study of 1-2 year old children at high-risk for autism. Finally, behaviour observation studies in autistic subjects are likely to benefit from the concurrent assessment of physiological indices of arousal, and from the integrated measurement of social-cognitive processes.",

      "abstract": "This chapter aims to provide a general review of factors that can lead to honest false testimony by either party to cases involving disputed sexual consent. We focus on three issues. First, we review the inherently and deliberately ambiguous nature of many sexual communications. That is, sexual communication often takes place indirectly, in ways that allow for multiple interpretations of meaning (e.g., via hints, nonverbal communication, lack of resistance rather than explicit consent, etc.). Second, we discuss the vagaries of memory for consent interactions. Given the ambiguity of initial consent interactions and the context in which they are later recalled, memory can be predictably distorted such that each party honestly remembers the same interaction differently. Third, we consider the implications of the involvement of intoxication in many disputed sexual encounters. Collectively, these factors pave the way for misinterpretation, miscommunication and false gist (or fully fabricated) memories for what took place: a state of affairs that can lead both parties report honest, but completely different accounts of the events in question.",

      "abstract": "In the past several decades, as positive psychology has grown in prominence and research on psychological well-being has flourished, it has become increasingly clear that people can exert a large degree of control over their own happiness. Savoring is undoubtedly a broad concept. It can be directed inwardly toward one's inner states of calm, of pride, of love, and more. Savoring is closely linked to many desirable outcomes, including higher rates of subjective well-being or happiness. Savoring has been also proposed as a mechanism through which positive affect broadens awareness, encourages exploration, and expands behavioral skills. A number of studies have identified some interesting individual differences in the ability to savor. Females report a greater tendency to savor, a difference that emerges around age ten and persists throughout the lifespan. Higher levels of trait mindfulness, extraversion, optimism, and affect intensity, and lower levels of neuroticism, guilt, and hopelessness, are associated with a greater perceived capacity to savor the moment.",

When dealing with HIV/AIDS and older adults, it is essential that all parties involved address the many preconceived ideas and myths that present obstacles to education, diagnosis, and treatment. The first is that seniors are not at risk for HIV/AIDS because they do not have sex, the second is that persons to whom they are providing services could not possibly have a current or past history of substance abuse, and the third is that persons are most likely heterosexual. In addition to failing to recognize that older people are indeed at risk, another factor that prevents timely diagnosis of HIV/AIDS in the older population is the supposition that the symptoms experienced by the aging patient are related to diseases common to elderly persons. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS status produces a wide range of emotional responses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Child victimization has traditionally been seen solely in terms of child abuse. There can be no doubt that child abuse in its various forms is a serious social problem. However, the focus of public and professional attention on abuse has obscured the problem of children who are the victims of other, often no less serious crimes. Children are far more likely to be thought of as potential offenders than as victims of crime. Yet, as we have seen, they can be victims of a whole range of crimes. They may also be witnesses to crimes committed against other members of their families. The most serious types of personal assault, rape, and even murder often take place in the presence of children or in circumstances of which they are aware. More commonly, they may be present in households where a burglary occurs. Where an offence is committed against a member of a child’s family or against the household in general the child is unlikely to be seen as a victim. None the less, children’s experiences may be such that they ought properly to be recognized as victims in their own right.",

      "abstract": "Hope is not singular or fixed; instead hopes take multiple forms that constitute precarity. Drawing on interviews with white women ‘on benefits’ in the North East of England, in a period before Brexit, I explore different kinds of hope that surfaced in relation with neoliberal forces of, and beyond, austerity. (1) Multiplied hopes, hedging bets and holding several possibilities together; (2) Conflicted hopes, pulls towards paradoxical attachments; (3) Suspended hopes, framed by the limits of the now; (4) Negative hopes, invested in promises that despair could be pushed onto others; (5) Hopes for the absence of optimism, a mode of being present in the present, staying with mutual contingency and withdrawing from the cruelty of unknown futures, a strategy increasingly denied to women who were more than ‘left-behind’. By exploring the different forms that hopes take, we can better understand what hopes do. I argue that hopes in decline were not lost, nor orientated towards upward progress, but invested instead in maintaining a position. They were both sustaining and debilitating through situations of loss and uncertainty, and as such constituted a stretched-out present, tensed with decline.",

      "abstract": "Research into serotonergic parameters associated with suicidal behaviour has resulted in many inconsistent and ambiguous findings. In this mini-review, we have tried to name some examples of methodological and conceptual vagueness and pitfalls in biological suicide research. The existing literature indicates various critical issues considered when interpreting existing data in this area: -- The 'suicidality' construct is not useful in biological suicide research. Autodestructive tendencies mostly occur in suicide completers and are probably not found in many suicide attempters and individuals with suicidal thoughts. No consistent association has been found between suicide intent and injury, suicide intent and suicide risk, choice of suicide method (violent vs. non-violent) and suicide risk, suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide. No close relationship between different degrees and different forms of suicidal behaviour has yet been demonstrated with any degree of consistency. According to many studies, serotonergic markers do not correlate with the various qualities and intensities of suicidal behaviour. -- The association between suicidality and impulsivity or aggression is weak. There probably is a disturbance in impulse and aggression control, but only in a subgroup of'suicidal' patients. -- It might be misleading to use nosological constructs of depression in order to characterize suicidal individuals in biological suicide research. Biological variables might be associated with specific depressive symptoms, but not with some nosological construct or the sum score of a depression rating scale. -- The alleged association between peripheral and central serotonergic parameters is based on assumptions for which there is insufficient proof. Several studies indicate that there is no correlation between changes in central and peripheral serotonergic parameters. The mechanism of changes of peripheral serotonergic parameters is not sufficiently understood.",

The public is likely to regard simple molestation as of such little moment that in most cases it is not even reported. It accepts prostitution as an inescapable evil, shrugs in disgust at cases of homosexuality or perversion, and expresses profound disgust on learning of masturbation in public. The physician's attitude is hardly more enlightened. He treats the pervert (paraphiliac) with contempt and speaks of him as a degenerate, though the term carries a connotation of moral opprobrium that has no place in medical work.

Whether the clinician uses biologically congruent names and pronouns may depend upon the patient's progress in adopting the cross gender role as well whether family or friends either know or accept such changes. In certain situations, such as meetings with family members, the therapist may address the patient with gender congruent names; whereas on other occasions use cross-gender pronouns or names.",

Identity development involves exploration of possible roles and choices in particular domains such as occupation, dating, and friendship, followed by commitment to a set of values and behaviors in one of these areas. In this study, women who reported that their parents encouraged autonomy while still maintaining closeness also reported more exploration in their friendship and dating relationships. In contrast, reports of parent‐child boundary dissolution, characterized by role‐reversal, enmeshment, and overinvolvement, were related to less exploration, particularly in dating relationships. Mother‐daughter boundary dissolution, specifically, was linked to women'stendency to base their commitments to a career and relationships with others on parental values and expectations without ever exploring alternative choices. Father‐daughter boundary dissolution was related to lower exploration as well as lower commitment to values and beliefs in any area. These findings lend support to theoretical and clinical impressions that inter‐generational boundary violations hinder the development of an independent identity.",

      "abstract": "Every person goes through periods of low self-esteem at some stage in life, it’s unavoidable. Replacing this negative conditioning with more positive programming is critical to building a successful and harmonious life. Stress is perhaps the most common issue of man’s everyday life. Stress is so universal and widespread that it is considered as a hallmark of human life. Married women especially with responsibilities of job, children and ageing parents can particularly feel overwhelmed by stress of daily life and that might accentuate if women have lower esteem. Low self-esteem can lead to psychological effects that cause a person to be more susceptible to stressful situations. Conversely, high self-esteem can act as a sort of protection against high levels of stress. Individuals with low esteem tend to feel helpless, powerless, and incapable of overcoming the obstacles placed in front of them. People today suffer from stress in a range of situations. Stress is present in people’s lives and is believed to be the cause of psychopathologies, diseases, and inability to adapt to any given environment or work. Stress is considered a complex defensive-balancing mechanism of the body that develops in two stages: during the first stage, individuals assess the stressor and the demands stemming from it, and during the second stage, they evaluate whether or not they have enough resources to meet the stressor demands. The latter stage draws attention to the individual’s subjective assessment of the stressor, which conditions their reaction to it. Different people may react differently to the same stressor. The stress response refers to body reactions, which can either be physiological, emotional, or behavioral reactions to stimuli that cause stress.

      "abstract": "The systemic oppression of women and gender-based discrimination has deep roots in human civilization. As evident in both written texts and widespread practices, conscious and unconscious biases associated with patriarchy have been and continue to be interlaced with power struggles, control, and conformity enforced by the male-dominant cultures of the time. Brought into bold relief in this pandemic, recent dramatic events (the tragic murder of George Floyd and the overturning of Roe v. Wade, for example) have heightened social outrage against bias, racism, and bigotry and have also brought us to an inflection point demanding our better understanding of the pernicious and long-term mental health effects of patriarchy. There are compelling grounds to further expand their construct, but efforts to do so in psychiatric phenomenology have, until now, failed to gain momentum and substantive attention. The resistance may in part lie in misconceptions that patriarchy is supported by archetypal endowments of the collective unconscious constitutive of shared societal beliefs. While many continue to live with the adverse experiences associated with patriarchy within the current times, critics have argued that our concepts about patriarchy are not empirical enough. Empirically supported deconstruction is necessary to debunk misinformed notions that undermine women’s equality.",

      "abstract": "Sexual intercourse has become overly simplified. To some, it has become no more than a sexual act involving two or more persons. The days of being overwhelmed by the concept and expressing excessive reservation about the act and discussion of it are waning. Even young ones are beginning to see it as a rite of passage to adulthood. Only in religion and culture do we find those still interested in conserving other dimensions namely; when it is moral and when it is immoral as well as notions of responsibility. Even among them, it is becoming a matter of teaching than it is of practice. And it is not the place of the law to wade into such matters unnecessarily. However, there are issues surrounding sexual intercourse that bring it to the fore of public attention. Paramount among them is when it is had without the consent of the other party. Some see it as a right, fun, revenge or a result of brief moment of loss of control. Sometimes, the Devil is blamed too. These reasons are given in a bid to evade responsibility, guilt and the consequences. The problem however has not always been about consent as a matter of grammar but the intricacies inherent within it namely; how same is to be sought and given, what valid consent constitutes, if it can be withdrawn after it has been given, and the practical difficulties in each case. This article shall endeavour to discuss these issues and more.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Sex/gender-related factors contribute to contextual issues influencing the recognition of autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and modulate how neurodevelopmental characteristics are manifested. This review summarizes the empirical literature to provide directions for improving clinical diagnostic practices. Recent findings Timing of autism and/or ADHD diagnosis, particularly in girls/women, is related to the individual's developmental characteristics and co-occurring diagnoses, and expectancy, alongside gender stereotype biases, of referral sources and clinicians. This is further compounded by sex and gender modulations of behavioural presentations. The emerging ’female autism phenotype’ concept may serve as a helpful illustration of nuanced autism phenotypes, but should not be viewed as essential features of autism in a particular sex or gender. These nuanced phenotypes that can present across sexes and genders include heightened attention to socially salient stimuli, friendship and social groups, richness in language expression, and more reciprocal behaviours. The nuanced female-predominant ADHD phenotypes are characterized by subtle expressions in hyperactivity-impulsivity (e.g., hyper-verbal behaviours). Optimizing neurodevelopmental diagnoses across sexes and genders also requires an understanding of sex-related and gender-related variations in developmental trajectories, including compensation/masking efforts, and the influences of co-occurring conditions on clinical presentations. Summary Equitable diagnoses across sexes and genders for autism and ADHD require understanding of the nuanced presentations and the Gestalt clinical-developmental profiles, and addressing contextual biases that influence diagnostic practices.",

      "abstract": "In workplace interactions, professionals who are demographically different from the majority of others in their profession (e.g., one of a few African Americans in a predominately White group of doctors) often experience “identity ambiguity”—the sense and feeling that one’s claims to a professional identity are questioned or not fully accepted in an interaction because of one’s atypical demographic background. We assert here that identity ambiguity can have meaningful psychological and behavioral effects on the demographically atypical professional. We offer a model which explores how such experiences of identity ambiguity evoke identity threats and negative emotions. In turn, we describe how these reactions can impact work role engagement and in-role and extra-role performance for demographically atypical professionals. We discuss the implications for organizations and for individuals who have trouble claiming and/or being granted an identity in work interactions.",

This can be observed in the domains of personal well-being and prosociality. Despite the commonly held theory that religious beliefs produce benefits such as greater morality and mental health, these associations are actually driven by nonreligious underlying mechanisms. This chapter examines claims made about religion’s benefits. Are there really “effects” of religion in these social domains that are quite distinct from secular effects? There are many reasons to doubt whether religiosity and spiritual belief are special and irreplaceable factors responsible for the benefits of living social lives. There are better reasons to conclude that only secular factors and natural causes explain prosociality and personal well-being.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The criminalisation of prostitution takes various forms: some offences target sex‐workers, others are aimed at third‐parties (pimps or advertisers) or criminalise clients for consumption. I argue that existing theories cannot justify any offences specific to prostitution; hence, either current prostitution‐specific offences should be extended to other types of sexual relations or the criminalisation of prostitution should be abolished. I propose a ‘continuum’ of different scenarios in which consideration, either monetary or in‐kind, was necessary for sexual relations to take place – from street prostitution to marriage solely based on financial interests. The absence of variables found in prostitution from the other scenarios on the continuum does not impinge on the normative flaw that existing theories attribute to prostitution. Consequently, even if existing theories can justify the criminalisation of prostitution, they cannot justify prostitution‐specific offences because the same justification would over‐inclusively apply to forms of sexual relations whose criminalisation is commonly regarded as unjustified.",

They isolate an alleged characteristic of a social group, class, or category, such as laziness, duplicity, greed, or licentiousness, and insist upon enframing all members of the group or category in terms of this characteristic. Prejudices themselves may need to be critically questioned, qualified, or rejected in the light of experience, but they should not be simply run in with forms of discrimination. Racial prejudice, say, may go hand-in-hand with racial discrimination, but racial prejudice should be challenged because it is racist, not because it is prejudiced. The definitional power of stereotypes lies in the essentialist manner of their representation. They allow no alternative, and are absolute in their depiction or placement of others. Their attribution of homogeneity to certain social groups or classes then seems incontestable because it is immutable.",

The assumption that because of their disability some people simply do not have the cognitive abilities to exercise choice and control over their lives, and as a result must be restricted in the name of protection, is at the root of the ableism that pervasively shapes their lives. People with disabilities have been subject to, violated, and harmed by these ableist assumptions for centuries, and they underlie the legal and social justification for restricting or obstructing their right to legal capacity and liberty.",

      "title": "Genetic Risk for Substance Abuse and Addiction: Family and Twin Studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract Evidence from family, adoption and twin studies indicates that genetic variation contributes to the risk for developing addiction to alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs and to the comorbidity of addictions with other psychiatric disorders. For instance, it is estimated that 50–60% of the variation in risk for alcoholism is accounted for by genetic factors. Genetic influences are implicated in multiple aspects of substance involvement, including predispositions to drug‐seeking behaviour and development of physiological dependence. These influences likely occur through multiple mechanisms, ranging from cellular processes (e.g. metabolic, pharmacologic) to psychological (e.g. personality traits). Environmental factors are also key – individuals' psychosocial histories may outweigh their genetic predispositions or can combine with genetic factors to magnify or decrease risk for developing addictions. Key Concepts Substance abuse and addiction run in families. Genetic epidemiology uses family, adoption and twin studies to address whether the familiality of addiction is due to environmental factors, genetic transmission or a combination of both. For both men and women, 50–60% of the risk for developing alcoholism is familial and virtually all of this is due to genetic factors. Experimenting with tobacco is primarily environmentally influenced, but genetic factors influence who develops addiction. Addiction to illicit substances also appears to have a genetic component for males; fewer studies have been conducted in females. The available research is based on samples of European ancestry; genetic and environmental estimates could differ for other populations.",

      "abstract": "Why do people think that someone living a morally bad life is less happy than someone living a good life? One possibility is that judging whether someone is happy involves not only attributing positive psychological states (i.e., lots of pleasant emotions, few unpleasant emotions, and satisfaction with life), but also forming an evaluative judgment. Another possibility is that moral considerations affect happiness attributions because they tacitly influence attributions of positive psychological states. In two studies, we found strong support for the second hypothesis. Moral considerations only appear to affect happiness attributions when they also affect attributions of positive psychological states. Additionally, both studies supported a hypothesis about why moral judgments have these effects. Specifically, we found that when people judge that someone is living a bad life, they infer that the person is not at peace with themselves. However, when this inference is blocked, moral considerations do not affect attributions of happiness or positive psychological states. In sum, although “happiness” appears to be a purely psychological concept, happiness judgments are sensitive to moral considerations because people often assume that immorality disrupts intrapersonal harmony.",

And so, friendship was explored in terms of its formation and its maintenance and how they fueled its unfortunate dissolution. There was a total of 11 informants who responded through in-depth interview. Results showed that deep connections of friendship were formed through commonalities, shared experiences, intimacy, early year foundation, and open communication. Friendship maintenance include trust and intimacy which can be developed through the following strategies namely, self – disclosure, honesty, tolerance, constant communication, frequent bonding, and unconditional support. Other findings on why the relationship terminated were due to betrayal, third party, and personal conflict which accordingly resulted into experiencing of unpleasant emotions.",

From early childhood to adulthood, individuals face inclusion and exclusion from social groups, social relationships, and various other opportunities; this makes such instances of inclusion and exclusion pervasive components of social life. A fundamental aspect of development, therefore, is the ability to understand when exclusion is necessary to make groups work well and when it is wrong and unfair. Intergroup inclusion and exclusion is a relatively new line of research, and refers to exclusion that occurs due to in‐group bias, out‐group distrust, prejudicial attitudes, and stereotypic expectations. Thus, as children begin to recognize, with age, the role of prejudice and bias in decisions to exclude out‐group peers, their understanding and evaluations of the consequences and implications of intergroup inclusion and exclusion also develops. Intervention techniques, such as promoting intergroup contact (e.g., cross‐race friendships), can help ameliorate the prevalence of intergroup exclusion and reduce prejudice and bias in childhood.",

      "abstract": "are stable to the extent that causal factors are expected to be long-lived or recurrent rather than short-lived or intermittent.Attributions are global to the extent that causes are believed to affect a broad range of situations rather than a limited set of circumstances.An individual who responds to failure on a mathematics test by saying \"I'll always be a failure in everything I do\" exhibits rather extreme internal, stable, and global attributions for the failure.On the other hand, an individual who responds to a similar situation by saying \"Some of the questions in this week's test were extraordinarily difficult\" exhibits external, unstable, and specific attributions.The reformulated learned helplessness model holds that individuals who make internal attributions for perceived noncontingency are likely to suffer deficits of self-esteem, and to blame themselves for events they believe they cannot control.It is also hypothesized that stable attributions will tend to extend the duration of deficits over time, and that global attributions are likely to result in the generalization of deficits to a variety of situations.Thus, the hypothesized depressive attributional style, consisting of internal, stable, and global attributions for undesired outcomes, is posited to lead to an expectation of future noncontingency and thus to symptoms of helplessness.According to the model, individuals with this type of attributional style are more likely to become depressed when faced with important life events that are perceived as uncontrollable.Abramson et al. (1978) further suggest that the model has preventative implications in that it may be possible to identify people who are depression-prone prior to the actual onset of depression by assessing their attributional style.In a subsequent publication, Seligman, Abramson, Semmel, and von Baeyer (1979) addressed themselves more specifically to the notion of a depressive attributional style.An attributional style questionnaire (Peterson, Semmel, von Baeyer, Abramson, Metalsky, & Seligman, Note 1) was developed to assess each of the three relevant attributional dimensions.The questionnaire yields scores for each dimension as well as a composite attributional score.The authors found that for hypothetical negative outcomes, internal, stable, global, and composite scores each correlated significantly with measures of depression in a group of college undergraduates.Seligman et al. (1979) concluded that their findings supported both the notion of a depressive attributional style and the reformulated learned helplessness model of depression..They did point out that the \"model predicts that the insidious attributional style for bad outcomes does not by itself result in depression\" (Seligman et al., 1979, p. 246), but that depression ensues when these types of attributions are made for important life events.Although not made explicit by the authors, the assumption seems to be that the more strongly an individual exhibits this attributional style for hypothetical situations, the more likely the individual is to make similar attributions for important life events, and thus the more likely to become depressed following such events.A number of questions arise from the Seligman et al. (1979) study.The most obvious, as pointed out by the authors, is whether the results generalize to other populations.A second question is to what extent attributional style, as assessed by the Peterson et al. (Note 1) scale, has predictive value in identifying depression-prone individuals prior to the onset of depression.As Seligman et al. (1979) have noted, their study supports the hypothesis that depression and attributional style are related, at least in college undergraduates, but does not inform us as to the direction of the relationship.It may be interesting to examine whether individuals identified as depression-prone according to their attributional",

      "abstract": "Abstract As prenatal genetic testing technologies have become both easier and more accessible, women are increasingly choosing prenatal genetic testing for a reason that is largely unexamined in the clinical literature: preparation. This reasoning, offered not only from pregnant women but frequently from testing laboratories and health care providers, reflects long‐held assumptions that prenatal genetic results—properly delivered and followed with information, clinical surveillance, and/or social supports—prepare families for a child with a genetic condition, and even improve health and social outcomes for children and families. But these assumptions remain unexamined, since there are no clear definitions or recommendations for prenatal preparation. Preparation may refer to several overlapping ways in which prenatal information may change parents' approach to the rest of the pregnancy, including: (a) clinical activities, including surveillance, interventions, and delivery planning; (b) social and informational support, such as interacting with patient support groups and gathering information about quality of life; and (c) psychological “coping” or adjustments to the reality of raising a child with a genetic condition. These meanings and activities intersect and influence one another and form a foundation for postnatal family adaptation, but they are rarely parsed out in studies examining the impact of prenatal diagnosis. Based on previous work delineating conceptual models as middle terms between theory and reality, we are building a conceptual model that incorporates an empirical understanding of meanings and actions encompassed by prenatal preparation. Comparing diverse families' expectations with the resources they are offered can identify (mis)matches between priorities and approaches.",

Two clinical case reports were used here to (i) illustrate all these aspects of infertility suffering, (ii) to evidence the difficulty for infertile men to speak about their infertility and (iii) underlie the importance for professional of medical assisted reproduction to be attentive to this suffering that many men keep silent. An empathetic attention to infertile men may give a way to express this suffering and thus allow the beginning of a psychoanalytic approach which is necessary in infertility and especially for infertile men who do not easily express their suffering. La souffrance de l’infertilité chez l’homme peut prendre plusieurs aspects. Elle peut avoir une dimension narcissique. Elle peut avoir une dimension objectale, être tournée vers l’autre.

Deux cas cliniques vont éclairer cette souffrance que beaucoup d’hommes taisent d’une manière défensive.Cette attitude défensive pourra donner le change et faire croire à une bonne adaptation à la situation. Malgré ou à cause de ce silence les acteurs de l’assistance médicale à la procréation devront rester attentifs à ne pas se laisser abuser par cette apparente absence de difficulté.

      "abstract": "The development of abnormally aggressive human behavior is complex and multifactorial. Aggressive patterns of behavior often begin early in life and, once established, are notorious for their resistance to change, which has led some to believe that environmental interventions offer little hope for significant reductions in the prevalence of violent behavior in our society. Recent findings from research in the field of developmental psychopathology, however, have shed some new light on this very old problem. This paper specifically reviews the attachment literature and interprets it in the context of what has already been learned from research in epidemiology and behavioral genetics on environmental contributions to aggression over the life span. Environmental factors may influence the development of aggression by affecting children's early relationships with primary caregivers or by limiting opportunities for children to engage in positive relationships with caring adult figures. Longitudinal studies directly correlating early attachment relationships with levels of aggression in later childhood have been limited in number but suggest that insecure early attachment relationships may predispose children to the development of abnormally aggressive behavior, particularly when such relationships represent the entirety of their early social experience. Interventions aimed at either enhancing parent-child relationships or providing opportunities for alternative relationships with caring adult figures, particularly in high-risk settings, may help to prevent abnormally aggressive behavioral outcome.",

An experiment is ethical or not at its inception; it does not become ethical post hoc–ends do not justify means. There is no ethical distinction between ends and means.

      "title": "Psychological Factors in Alcoholic Women",
      "abstract": "We have presented data on 69 female alcoholics who have had three or more interviews. Almost all are of high socioeconomic status. The majority are Protestant and college-educated. They drink at home and do not come to the attention of public agencies. Their childhoods were invariably disturbed, with a dependent relationship toward a cold, dominant parent, usually the mother. Half the fathers were alcoholic. Many patients felt an identification with the father rather than the mother. All patients grew up feeling inadequate and worthless and unable to express their hostility directly. Marital disharmony appeared to be the most frequent factor perpetuating our patient's alcoholism, though many had drunk heavily before marriage. The marriages were troubled by inadequate emotional communication and poor sexual adjustment. Nevertheless, they were remarkably long-lasting and free of infidelity. The husbands were usually overtly domineering but invariably controlling and unable to express feelings. Patients who remained single had retained the ambivalent dependent relationship toward one or both parents. Alcohol, initially the \"enabling drug\" which provided the missing feelings of adequacy and acceptability, became later the releaser of hostility, tool of revenge, and means of self-punishment. All patients exploded their anger when drunk. The following modal pattern appeared in 27 of our cases: cold domineering mother, warmer but alcoholic father, \"miserable self-image,\" cold domineering husband, resort to alcohol patterned after father's drinking. We have speculated on what basic factors may be crucial to the development of alcoholism in an individual woman.",

      "title": "Is it Thinking and not Feeling that Influence Variability of Stuttering in Social Situations? About Stuttering and Social Cognition",
      "abstract": "In many cases of stuttering the severity of the symptoms tend to vary substantially in relation to the social situation, typically with less stuttering when talking all alone and more stuttering in socially demanding contexts. The factors underlying situational variability is of clinical importance. In theories of stuttering it has often been assumed that this variability is related to emotional reactions of anxiety and fear. However, the relation between emotions and stuttering is not clear. For example, observations of effects of strong fear in persons who stutter suggest that fear sometimes may facilitate speech fluency (Bloodstein & Ratner, 2008). Further, studies of effects of treatment in adults who stutter indicate that the anxiety for social situations may be successfully reduced without significant effect on the severity of the observable stuttering. It is here hypothesized that it is social cognition (thinking) and not social anxiety (emotion) that has the main interfering situational effect on stuttering. Social cognition involves thoughts about what one thinks of oneself, and what others may think or expect. For persons who are concerned about stuttering it is likely that social situations often involve thoughts about possible scenarios, including what other may think if they stutter and alternative plans how to act. Social cognition is a normal process, which does not need to be associated with social anxiety. Neuroscience research has shown that social cognition is especially related to processing in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which means the cortex region in the medial wall hidden between the two cerebral hemispheres in the most anterior part of the brain. This region is adjacent to regions which are crucial for the initiation of propositional speech, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area (SMA). Cortical regions in the brain may be roughly divided into two partly opposing networks: goal directed versus \"reflecting\". It seems that activities which activate the goal-directed network, such as focused attention, tend to reduce the momentary severity of stuttering. One hypothesis about the cause of stuttering is that persons who stutter tend to have bilateral speech motor control. A consequence would be the need to synchronize both sides, via long pathways between the hemispheres. It is conceivable that such organization would be sensitive for interference, for example from processes related to social cognition in the medial frontal lobes. It is suggested that stuttering is a threshold phenomenon, meaning that fluent speech may be close to the neurophysiological threshold for disruption, but as long as the threshold is not passed, no obvious symptoms are shown. Thresholds create non-linear effects, which imply the possibility that significant interfering effect of social cognition may be shown also for normal social cognition, without strong social anxiety. It is important to emphasize that it is not suggested that social cognition is a factor underlying onset of stuttering, because data from preschool children who stutter do not provide support for elevated shyness or social anxiety at the time around onset.",

      "title": "The Science of Empathy",
      "abstract": "Empathy plays a critical interpersonal and societal role, enabling sharing of experiences, needs, and desires between individuals and providing an emotional bridge that promotes pro-social behavior. This capacity requires an exquisite interplay of neural networks and enables us to perceive the emotions of others, resonate with them emotionally and cognitively, to take in the perspective of others, and to distinguish between our own and others' emotions. Studies show empathy declines during medical training. Without targeted interventions, uncompassionate care and treatment devoid of empathy, results in patients who are dissatisfied. They are then much less likely to follow through with treatment recommendations, resulting in poorer health outcomes and damaged trust in health providers. Cognitive empathy must play a role when a lack of emotional empathy exists because of racial, ethnic, religious, or physical differences. Healthcare settings are no exception to conscious and unconscious biases, and there is no place for discrimination or unequal care afforded to patients who differ from the majority culture or the majority culture of healthcare providers. Much work lies ahead to make healthcare equitable for givers and receivers of healthcare from all cultures. Self- and other-empathy leads to replenishment and renewal of a vital human capacity. If we are to move in the direction of a more empathic society and a more compassionate world, it is clear that working to enhance our native capacities to empathize is critical to strengthening individual, community, national, and international bonds.",

      "title": "Do You Love Me, Too? Perceptions of Responses to I Love You",
      "abstract": "Saying I love you to a romantic partner for the first time in a new relationship is a terrifying moment that exposes the initiator to vulnerability and can sway the balance of power within the relationship. However, this moment can also be terrifying for the receivers of I love you, especially if they do not love their partners in return. The receivers then have to choose whether to be honest with their partner-potentially hurting their partner's feelings-or to be dishonest and preserve their partner's feelings while being untrue to themselves. In this type of awkward situation, it is possible that women and men may prefer different responses to I love you. One reason that women and men may prefer different responses to I love you is that they have different timelines for falling in love. Harrison and Shortall (2011) surveyed college students to explore which gender says I love you first. Contrary to popular perceptions that women fall in love first, they found that men reported falling in love more quickly and were more likely to say I love you first. In addition to falling in love at different rates, women and men may also have different motives for saying I love you to their partners. To investigate such motives, Brantley, Knox, and Zusman (2002) surveyed college students to explore when and why they say I love you to their romantic partners for the first time. They found that men were more likely than were women to say I love you first in a relationship and to do so as a means of obtaining sex from their partners. Thus, men may have ulterior motives for saying I love you to their partners. Not only do men say I love you in order to have sex with their partners, but evidence suggests that they have other reasons for saying it as well. For example, a diary study of college students' romantic relationships indicated that men were more likely to say I love you first in order to force women to commit to the relationship (Owen, 1987). By contrast, women were more likely to refrain from saying I love you first, presumably because they were better able to distinguish love from other related emotions such as like or lust, and also because they view their role in the relationship as reactive and men's role as proactive (Owen, 1987). Therefore, it seems that men often say I love you in order to move their relationship forward either emotionally (i.e., with commitment) or physically (i.e., with sex). Whereas men say I love you to obtain sex from their partners, women appear to use the opposite strategy, namely using sex to obtain love. Consistent with this notion, Regan and Dreyer (1999) questioned college students about their motives for engaging in casual sex and found that men engage in casual sex to improve their social status and to show their sexual prowess, whereas women engage in casual sex to improve their chances of obtaining a long-term committed relationship. According to Reiss (1981), this pattern is the result of a patriarchal society in which men receive positive reinforcement for being promiscuous, but women are only justified in having sex if love is involved. It is also possible that women and men have different motives for saying I love you and engaging in sexual intercourse because they have different goals in mind. According to Sexual Strategies Theory (Buss & Schmitt, 1993), in order to obtain maximum reproductive fitness, men should operate on a short-term mating strategy that involves impregnating as many women as possible, whereas women should prefer a long-term mating strategy in which mates are carefully chosen for their resources and protection. However, Buss and Schmitt (1993) suggest that in order to obtain sex from women, men may need to act as if they want a long-term relationship when, in fact, all they want is casual sex. Saying I love you to their partners may be one way that men attempt to convince women of their commitment. By contrast, waiting to have sex until I love you has been said may be how women attain emotional and resource investment from men. …",

A chromosomal abnormality, or chromosomal aberration, is a disorder characterized by a morphological or numerical alteration in single or multiple chromosomes, affecting autosomes, sex chromosomes, or both. The normal human karyotype contains approximately two meters of DNA organized into 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs of homologous autosomal chromosomes and a set of sex chromosomes that compromise two X chromosomes in females or an X and a Y chromosome in males. All the genetic necessary for growth and development derive from chromosomes (around 20 to 25 thousand genes). Chromosome abnormalities usually involve an error in cell division (mitosis or meiosis), which may occur in the prenatal, postnatal, or preimplantation periods. These alterations have significant clinical consequences, i.e., spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, neonatal death/hospitalization, malformations, intellectual disability, or an identifiable syndrome. Accurate identification of these chromosomal errors is essential for prevention strategies, genetic counseling, and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "We first seek to explore the relationship between attachment styles of professional financial service customers and their ability to experience customer satisfaction and build relationships with a commercial bank. Secure attached people identify with the commercial bank, feel satisfied and are loyal with the commercial bank. Second, we question whether attachment styles and degrees of satisfaction are also reflected in a capacity to feel pleasure in attachments to luxury products, feel happiness and pro-activeness, develop positive relationships with others, and sleep well for multiple samples of non-commercial customers. Apparently, secure attached people form enjoyable attachments with luxury goods/brands. Equally, in life in general they show a proactive attitude and generosity toward others, and feel low envy. Anxious attachment style relates negatively with appraisal of and relationship formation with commercial banks, negatively with enjoyment and attachment to luxury goods, and negatively with generosity towards people and happiness. In addition, anxious attachment style relates positively with envy towards people and low sleep quality. Avoidant attachment style does not relate with any of the above variables except for a negative association with happiness with life in general. Finally, none of the attachment styles scales relates with the BIS-BAS scale, except that anxious attachment relates with the BIS scale, indicating largely that the attachment system does not function as an approach-avoidance system but helps in homeostatic regulation of stress due to the experience of quiescence with others. By studying how attachment styles affect people in commercial and general social domains we hope to pave the way for further exploration of the fundamental mechanisms that drive secure attached people as opposed to insecure attached people to generally experience positive emotions and outcomes in life. We tentatively suggest that compared to insecure attached people, secure attached people possess a different “style of being in the social world.”",

      "title": "Agent-Relative Deontological Thresholds",
      "abstract": "Abstract Personal relationships can change the deontic status of acts. Such change usually takes the form from optional to required. However, it also seems possible that relationships can change the deontic status from impermissible to optional or even required. In other words, agents can be required to do things for a friend that would be impermissible when done for a stranger. In this paper, I examine these controversial forms of deontic change. I argue that friendships can, in fact, make otherwise impermissible acts permissible or even required, but only in certain cases. The question, then, is why friendships can play such a role, and why they can only do so in certain situations. I argue that the idea of deontological thresholds provides a unified explanation for both questions. This idea posits that otherwise impermissible actions become permissible or even required only in very specific situations, namely to avoid a moral catastrophe. I then argue that such deontological thresholds can be agent-relative and that friendships influence whether an agent-relative deontological threshold is reached. This explains why only friends, not strangers, can be permitted or required to perform certain otherwise impermissible actions. I contend that friendships play this role because of the fundamental knowledge by acquaintance that friends have of each other’s overall virtuous characters.",

      "abstract": "Much of what are understood as ‘mental health difficulties’ reflects shortcomings in the ability to develop and sustain healthy relationships. Many of those embarking upon life as someone with a psychiatric diagnosis are people whose difficulties can be traced to adolescence, or even earlier in life. Unsatisfactory relational experiences during childhood are acknowledged contributors to subsequent psychological vulnerability. Numerous studies identify associations between other forms of relational disturbance, and the onset and maintenance of psychological difficulties. Some eighty years’ psychotherapy research has repeatedly suggested that the quality of therapeutic relationship is a major determinant of outcome. Sophisticated analyses of large databases now confirm this beyond doubt. All concur that social exclusion and stigma are the most disabling consequences of living as someone with a psychiatric diagnosis. None of these facts are disputed but there is continuing resistance to broad acknowledgement of their implications. This has many parallels with other examples of paradigm shift, as so clearly outlined by Thomas Kuhn. Uncertainties about the value of medical psychiatry and growing recognition of the role relationships play in the genesis and relief of mental health difficulties suggest that psychiatry can be seen in similar terms. This paper develops that thesis.",

Criteria for conditions for which genetic screening is appropriate include (1) existence of implications for action for those individuals so identified, (2) ability to determine who is at risk (this may involve performing a laboratory test or simply determining relationship to an affected individual), (3) the likelihood of benefits of notification outweighing its burdens, and (4) availability of adequate means for counseling and follow-up. Screening for nongenetic conditions (eg, lead intoxication) is usually intended to discover people with diseases due to extrinsic influences. Genetic screening discovers something within a person's own makeup and may make him feel unworthy or guilty. This raises social, ethical, and legal questions having to do with consent, privacy, confidentiality, and stigmatization. Hence the need for adequate counseling and follow-up.

      "title": "The Significance of Penis Envy in Women",
      "abstract": "In every woman's analysis, there is inevitably a period in which appears a feeling of envy and covetousness for both the male sex organ and its symbolic equivalents. This penis envy may be simply episodic with some patients, but with others it can be central. Pseudo-desire, promulgated by envy, achieves a semblance of satisfaction, as shown in the phallic attitudes of some women, who are immersed in imitation of the other sex, or at least of the image they have of it. Penis envy will disappear by itself the day the patient no longer has that painful feeling of deficiency which caused it. If one agrees to abandon an object-oriented view of the envied penis— and to defer all questions concerning the sociocultural legitimacy of the envy—then one can undertake a truly psychoanalytical approach. The association of penis envy with conscious or unconscious hatred toward the mother is frequently observed.",

      "title": "Schone schijn of niet? Een fake good/fake bad onderzoek naar de invloed van een mannelijke of vrouwelijke onderzoeker op de sociale wenselijkheid bij een vragenlijst over emancipatie",
      "abstract": "Sociaal wenselijk gedrag is een fenomeen dat voor bijna iedereen bekend zal zijn, of het nu is om jezelf in bescherming te nemen of om een ander niet te kwetsen. Het aanpassen van gedrag of mening om niet af te wijken van sociale normen komt veel voor, zowel in het dagelijks leven als in wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Veel voorkomende situaties zijn: het niet geven van een eerlijke, negatieve mening over iemand anders of het niet willen bespreken van persoonlijke informatie over financien of seksueel gedrag. Dit gedrag komt ook terug in wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar onder meer politieke en maatschappelijke opinies. Het kan er voor zorgen dat resultaten onbetrouwbaar worden en onderzoek onbruikbaar wordt. Het blijkt dat onderzoeken naar persoonlijke gegevens, zoals stemgedrag of seksualiteit, gevoelig zijn voor sociaal wenselijk gedrag. Respondenten in een onderzoek met gevoelige vragen geven antwoorden waarmee ze een betere indruk van zichzelf denken achter te laten of geven antwoorden die beter aansluiten bij de algemene publieke opinie. Om dit sociaal wenselijk gedrag in onderzoek te ondervangen, is het belangrijk te weten wanneer er een grote kans is op sociaal wenselijk gedrag door respondenten en welke maatregelen dit gedrag verminderen. \r\nEen onderwerp waarvan wordt verwacht dat het gevoelig is voor sociale wenselijkheid, is emancipatie. Er zijn al veel gelijke rechten tussen mannen en vrouwen, vooral in de westerse wereld, maar nog steeds blijkt dat vrouwen op veel gebieden een achtergestelde positie hebben ten opzichte van mannen. Vrouwen krijgen minder salaris voor hetzelfde werk, bekleden minder posities op topniveau en zijn meer verantwoordelijk voor zorgtaken dan mannen (Portegijs, 2010). Een actuele situatie is de verkiezing van een nieuwe Amerikaanse president. Was Barack Obama bijna acht jaar geleden de eerste gekleurde president van Amerika, nu is Hillary Clinton in de race om de eerste vrouw te worden die deze functie bekleedt. Dat niet iedereen even gelukkig zou zijn met een vrouwelijke president, komt naar voren in het onderzoek van Streb et al. (2008). In de publieke opinie was er grote steun voor een vrouwelijke president van Amerika, maar in het onderzoek naar de sociale wenselijkheid van die opinie bleek dat het een heel gevoelig onderwerp is. Ruim een kwart van de respondenten gaf aan zelfs van slag te zijn bij het vooruitzicht dat een vrouw leider zou worden van het land en stelde de antwoorden voor de opiniepeiling overdreven positief te hebben ingevuld (Streb et al, 2008).\r\nSociale wenselijkheid is hiermee een interessant onderwerp om verder te onderzoeken, vooral in combinatie met een maatschappelijk relevant thema als emancipatie. In deze scriptie staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag centraal: heeft het opnemen van geslachtkenmerken van de onderzoeker in de instructie en vragenlijst invloed op de sociale wenselijkheid van de respons? De vragenlijst die in dit onderzoek wordt meegenomen is afkomstig van de Eurobarometer 2015. Dit is een onderzoek dat eerder door de Europese Unie is uitgezet om in verschillende Europese landen te meten wat de opinie is over emancipatie en ongelijkheid tussen mannen en vrouwen. Nederland is niet meegenomen in het onderzoek, wat betekent dat de vragen zijn vertaald alsmede zijn aangepast aan de onderzoeksvraag van deze scriptie. \r\nHet onderzoek is verricht volgens de fake good/fake bad methode om te meten in welke mate de vragenlijst gevoelig is voor sociaal wenselijke antwoorden. De fake good/fake bad methode is niet bedoeld om de eigen mening van respondenten te achterhalen, maar om te bepalen welke antwoorden sociaal wenselijk of sociaal onwenselijk zijn. Wanneer er een significant verschil bestaat tussen deze twee mogelijkheden, is er sprake van een vragenlijst met gevoelige vragen.",

      "title": "Pornographic Films and Unconscious Homosexual Desires: An Hypothesis",
      "abstract": "The possibility that heterosexual behavior may serve to gratify unconscious homosexual desires has been noted. Blanchard (1959) , for example, discussed group rape and noted that the sharing of a female for sexual purposes in one another's presence might well gratify unconscious homosexual desires of the males cornmicting the sexual assault. Men who have certain heterosexual preferences (such as anal intercourse or female partners who have masculine characteristics) may also be gratifying unconscious homosexual desires. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that a similar inference could be made about males who habitually attend heterosexual pornographic films. In a typical cinema in which pornographic films are shown, the audience is usually completely male, alchough no studies of the composiuon af audiences have been p u b lished. Most likely, a man watches these films in the presence of other men. If there is a period of live entertainment (dancing or sexual intercourse), the men typically move closer to the front for this, thereby sitting in close proximity. The content of pornographic films emphasizes close-up views of penises. Fellatio is prominent. All ejaculations are shown and the semen visible. There are also close-up views of the genital areas during intercourse. Aside from a few views of the female face and breast, the content is very similar to that of homosexual films, in which views of fellatio and intercourse also comprise most of the film. Heterosexual films also contain episodes in which one female services several males at one time, with a combination of fellatio, vaginal intercourse, and anal inrercourse. In these scenes, several men are sharing the same female, much as occurs in group rape, but of course without the use of force on an unwilling female. The audience, though not active participants, may be seen as passive participants. The theme of heterosexual pornographic films is that the males get pleasure. The females, though supposed to be enjoying the sexual activity, are used for male gratification. The films may be conceptualized as gloriFying the male penis and the male orgasm If it is correct to suspect that heterosexual pornographic films do gratify unconscious homosexual desires, then it might be hypothesized that males who habitually watch such films would give evidence of unconscious concerns as manifest, for example, in sexual impotency or on objective tests of unconscious homosexual desires that have been devised (Lester, 1974). Such studies have not yet been conducted.",

This paper presents two cases, whose heterosexual preference were changed in late adolescent age after a severe psychological event, to draw attention to the study of the possible underlying mechanism. Case 1, one identical male twin, was seriously punished at age 12 years, as he loved a girl in his classroom. Afterwards, he feared to contact with girls, and became attracted to young men at age 17 years, and kept same-sex sexual behaviors since then. However, his twin brother is always heterosexual. Case 2, a girl at age 16 years, was unexpectedly betrayed by her boyfriend, she bore great pain and distress in the beginning. Since then, she had a definite opinion that men were unbelievable, and gradually turned her heterosexual preference and had same-sex sexual behaviors with a girl classmate more than 3 years. Our case presentation indicates that severe frustration of primary heterosexual desires or behaviors and the successive cognitive regulation might lead susceptible adolescents into reorienting their sexual preference. The role of prefrontal cortex and related neuromodulatory pathways were discussed.",

      "abstract": "Child abuse emerged from the shadows half a century ago and is now recognised as a major public health issue. It is now realised that child abuse encompasses physical, psychological and social aspects, as well as sexual elements. It extends beyond obviously aggressive acts to include neglect, lack of adequate protection and failure to nurture. It is no longer accepted that parents and other adults punish those who depend on them at their discretion. The epoch of the Roman pater familias, with a right of life and death over family members (and slaves) is over. It is accepted that the state, with its legal ‘monopoly of legitimate violence’ may sometimes have to invade the private sphere of individuals and families if it is to detect and prevent ill-treatment, despite some exquisite sensitivities in this regard. But the threshold is ill-defined. Adverse reactions to ‘curiosity’ by outsiders may be justified by a families’ alleged freedom to treat their members as they choose. Yet an overly cautious approach may lead to serious situations being detected when it is already too late. In the 1990s Europe has been shaken by gruesome cases of ill-treatment of children, in particular involving sexual abuse, and sometimes with lethal consequences (the Dutroux affair in Belgium attracting most public attention). Health and related professionals must be diligent about situations where there is a risk of abuse so as to prevent it happening. Of course these professionals, whether privately or publicly employed, should aim for balanced decisions, respecting the rights of the persons concerned as well as maintaining what lawyers describe as proportionality. But it is also imperative to show some courage. In this respect, one should not refrain from speaking out about smoking as a form of child abuse. Such abuse, which may take place in a variety of situations, may not have the same dramatic features than broken limbs, haematomas and brain concussions have, but it is ill-treatment nevertheless.",

As central as this ambition has been to a wide variety of research programs, it has been called into question by those who doubt that criminal behavior is susceptible to scientific explanation or prediction or who worry that the desire to explain and predict masks a desire for pervasive social control. The recent pursuit of this ambition by human geneticists has inspired particularly strong hopes and fears. The success of genetics in understanding human disease suggests that it could be a powerful tool in the scientific investigation of human behavior, including criminal behavior. At the same time, the checkered history of human genetics suggests that it can easily be abused, misrepresented, or misunderstood, regardless of the validity of the studies or the motivation of the researchers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Homophobia is still a scourge in the modern era. Despite a greater acceptance of sexual variations and same-sex marriage in many countries, homophobia is widely sustained by religious, political and cultural values and beliefs at individual and social level. Most of homophobic attitudes are based on the principle of heteronormativity according to which heterosexuality is the standard for legitimating social and sexual relationships and homosexuality is considered as an abnormal variant. Homophobia may be also recognised at institutional level (state-sponsored homophobia, social homophobia) and supported by laws or religious beliefs. Moreover, internalised homophobia (IH) is defined as the inward direction of societal homophobic behaviours at individual level and refers to the subjective psychological impact of these negative attitudes. In fact, IH is significantly associated with a high prevalence of internalising mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, stress/trauma-related disorders, etc. We believe that a set of immediate actions are needed in order to contrast homophobia and its impact on mental health, in particular political initiatives, educational trainings and scientific research should be promoted with a specific focus on mental health needs of people target of homophobia.",

      "title": "Legacy of betrayal: A grounded theory of becoming demoralized from the perspective of women who have been depressed.",
      "abstract": "AbstractSeven previously depressed women were interviewed about their understanding of how they had become depressed. The grounded theory method was used analyze the interview transcripts and develop a theory that reflected their understanding. The core theme was labeled Becoming Demoralized. The women had depressive episodes when they became demoralized by Betrayed: Being Abused, Being Disrespected, and Being Left. These betrayals often resulted in feelings of being Left Out Of The World, feeling Nobody Cares About Me, which also contributed demoralization. The experience of being demoralized involved believing one is Not Worthy Of Love, There Is I Can Do To Change Things, and Nothing Is Ever Going To Get Better. Some women were demoralized in childhood, and then further demoralized by later, often similar, Betrayals, A few women did not become demoralized until they were Betrayed as adults. The self-perpetuating nature of demoralization can result in chronic or recurrent depression.Most theories of depression do not specifically address the causes of depression in women or the higher prevalence of depression in women than men (see Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990 for review). The lack of attention gender differences in research has been described as sexism of omission (Collier, 1982, p.4). To remedy this lacuna in knowledge about depression in women, it has been argued that theoretical explanations should germinate from women's experiences and understanding (Stoppard, 1997). Otherwise, theorizing will continue be divorced from the perceptions of those who have actually experienced depression. Moreover, without an exclusive focus on women, androcentric models, which use men's experience as the normative standard, remain unshaken, and only a partial and distorted view of women is possible (Harding, 1987). The goal of this study was develop a theoretical understanding that inherently reflected the views of women who had been depressed. As DuBois (1983), a feminist researcher, has stated: to address women's lives and experiences in their own terms, create theory grounded in the actual experience and language of women, is the central agenda for feminist social science and scholarship (p. 108).Much of the recent research on depression in women utilizes qualitative methods (for example, Jack, 1991) and is reflective of the growing influence of social constructionism (see Berger & Luckman, 1966) on depression research. For example, this epistemology is reflected in the critique by Wiener and Marcus (1994) of the meaningfulness of the diagnosis of a syndrome of depressive symptoms (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV, American Psychiatric Association, 1994). They have criticized the traditional diagnostic category of depression because of its ... imprecision, inconsistencies, ambiguity, overgeneralization, and contradictions . and because it subsumes very different psychosocial transactions. They advocate the replacement of symptom based diagnoses with transactional taxonomies that focus on the meaning of behaviour.A focus on the socially constructed meaning of depression has been undertaken in recent research. For example, Lewis (1995) explored, using qualitative methods, how male and female participants subjectively experienced depression, how they arrived at and understood the label of depression, and how they made sense of their experiences. Additionally, in Speaking of Sadness, Karp (1996) described the identity-altering process that male and female participants experienced as they came see themselves as depressed and continued theorize about themselves and how they became depressed. Whereas these studies did not specifically address gender, Schreiber's (1996) grounded theory study focused on women's experience and examined participants' process of recovery from depression. This process, labeled (Re)Defining My Self, involved a woman's search for personal identity within her social environment. …",

On the contrary, we would argue that human beings are always constrained by the 'web of culture' and that socially defined concepts can always be expected to influence our thoughts, feelings and actions in very many profound ways. Indeed it often seems to be the case that our basic modes of thinking are shot through with implicit meanings and expectations? and these keep us in thrall precisely to the extent that we are unable to formulate them explicitly to ourselves and to other people.",

      "abstract": "Research on casual sexual relationships and experiences (CSREs) has increased in the last decade; however, there is no consensus about the scope and definition of CSREs. To describe the main forms of CSREs, a latent profile analysis was performed on single and sexually active men and women aged from 18 to 30 years old who described their last casual sexual experience. Five profiles were identified: 1) the one-time sexual encounter; 2) the ex-romantic partnership, in which one still has sexual contact after ending their romantic relationship; 3) the mostly about sex partnership, in which contacts are primarily sexual, whether or not a friendship exists; 4) the intimate and sexual partnership, a hybrid of friend and romantic partner with whom one has frequent sexual and social interactions without commitment or intent to form a couple; 5) the friendship first partnership, a friendship to which sex is added, where social activities and friendly interactions dominate. Participants across profiles differed according to the number of sexual partners in the past year, their intention of having other sexual contacts with the partner, being under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the most recent sexual encounter with their partner and their type of sexual exclusivity agreement. This research contributes to a better description and understanding of CSREs among young adults and to further specifying its area of investigation.",

      "title": "Romantic Conflict Narratives in Emerging Adult Couples: Viewpoint and Gender Matter",
      "abstract": "Healthy romantic relationships entail understanding the needs of the self and other when interpreting conflict events. Yet how couples make meaning around specific conflicts and their capacity to reflect on their own and their partners’ unmet needs is understudied. Using narratives, we examined destructive (e.g., extreme anger and break‐up anxiety) and constructive (e.g., perspective taking) interpretations of past romantic conflicts in 80 emerging adult heterosexual couples and the extent to which such interpretations varied by viewpoint and gender. Couple members were interviewed separately about two conflict episodes in which their partner did not meet their needs (victim viewpoint) and two episodes in which they did not meet their partners’ needs (perpetrator viewpoint). As anticipated, destructive interpretations were more evident in the victim viewpoint and for female couple members. In contrast, within constructive interpretations, the use of insight was greater in the perpetrator than the victim viewpoint. Although perspective taking was expected to be more common in the perpetrator viewpoint and in female narratives, this was not the case, as this type of constructive interpretation was infrequent in narratives about conflict. The findings revealed aspects of meaning making that might be useful to mental health professionals concerned with building skills to improve romantic competence in emerging adult couples.",

      "title": "5: Unacceptable Behaviours and Their Cures -",
      "abstract": "-Unacceptable Behaviours - Says Who? Cures: The Good Fuck and Pull Up Your Socks. Doctors and Hospital. And Patriarchy.Anger, illness, and self-harming are deviations not only from health (i.e. soundness of bod_y and mind) but also from normalcy (i.e. what is seen as acceptable behaviours of body and mind). They are physical manifestations closely related what is generally called madness. And clearly, as Matthews explains,Any and all behaviour can be called mad, depending upon social context, values held by and relationship of power between judge and judged. Even in case of medical profession, which alone can legitimately and conclusively diagnose or define person as mad, each doctor's is subjective, inevitably biased according her or his age, sex, class position, etc; and in so far as is made of behaviour alone, it is inevitably about what ought be.1That moral judgement renders subject's behaviour (men and women alike) unacceptable, even if assertion that the medical profession alone can legitimately and conclusively diagnose or define person as mad remains extremely doubtful. Nevertheless, female characters studied here are all mad, from standpoint of reason - they behave 'mad', although they are not really ill: there are no organic signs that something is wrong; there are no lesions, no viruses, no lumps.Following Michel Foucault, I argue that women's bodies are signs that women are controlled. When these signs become visible, women are labelled deviant. Forms of female deviance, such as those described here, are socially constructed states that symbolize both hegemony of scientific medicine and Victorian social constraints on women.2 Thus inscription of pain on female body and killing of babies are signifiers of female protest against patriarchal oppression, and form of feminist politics of action-reaction. Female characters inscribe on their bodies suffering they cannot speak. As French psychoanalyst Jacques Salome affirms, What cannot be spoken must be suffered.3Madness is label applied those who deviate from acceptable and accepted norm. The suffering and pain that female characters in works of fiction I am looking at endure are normal - hence acceptable - as long as they alone suffer, as long as no label of is stamped on sufferer. When baby is murdered or life is too obviously in danger, society intervenes - doctors are brought in, tablets are dispensed, women are locked in hospitals, strapped their beds sometimes, and 'cured'. There is no denying that to label of madness is a method of control over women.4 The 'cure' is often control over woman's body, sometimes over her spirit, too.Anger - drive of many harmful activity performed by female characters - is also often labelled deviant, pathological, and unfeminine. The social resonance of anger in women is telling. In Western, Judaeo-Christian cultures, woman is regarded as an angel, as result of centuries of biblical/religious conditioning. And an angel does not get angry, otherwise it (she?) becomes devil, like Lucifer in Old Testament. Therefore an angry woman is devil. Anger is not acceptable - - in woman. Crump further explains:Women are further inhibited from expression of anger by requirement live out behaviours of woman, and nice lady rather than being perceived as unfeminine or bitch. (2)This is manifest in texts considered here. The social need for woman appear a good woman/nice lady/angel shapes expression of woman's anger in same way as phrases 'a boy does not cry/whimper/play with dolls' shape male social behaviour. Women are allowed (supposed?) use passive-aggressive forms of anger expression, such as pouting, whining, manipulating, backbiting, or gossiping,5 though this is what Crump clearly identifies as myth derived from lack of scientific knowledge. …",

We examined these connections with a random sample of 464 coupled partners. Compared with women from intact families, women from divorced families reported less trust and satisfaction, but more ambivalence and conflict. For men, perceptions of relationships were contingent on the marital status of their partners' parents, although men from intact and divorced families did differ on structural constraints that affect commitment. Young adults who were casually dating showed the strongest effects of parental divorce, suggesting that the repercussions of parental divorce may be in place before the young adults form their own romantic relationships.",

Regardless of the emotional circumstances that surround the actual experience and the way in which they take place, an aggressive, even violent fantasy is very frequently associated with the 'first time'. This fantasy can complicate or hinder access to a shared sexuality with a partner. This article links such fantasies, on the one hand, to the Oedipal disappointment often experienced when a young person takes their initial step into genital sexuality, and, on the other, to the revival of an infantile sexuality endowed with a sense of separation. The exploration of the violent fantasies and death drive in therapy may facilitate the advent of a more consensual form of engagement with the other.",

      "title": "Racial Emotion in the Workplace",
      "abstract": "Almost everyone in the United States is likely to experience or have experienced racial emotion in the workplace. One person feels uncomfortable making conversation with her co-workers of a different race, for fear that she will use the wrong name or say something that is perceived as biased or offensive; another is anxious that his colleague will judge him as less intelligent than the whites on his team. One feels anger at the telling or emailing of a racial joke; another feels frustrated when a colleague raises concerns about bias during a post-interview debriefing. These emotions — and the behaviors that give rise to them and respond to them — are sometimes difficult to describe. We lack a language of racial emotion in the workplace, in no small part because many of us (especially whites) prefer not to see it. But racial emotion does exist, and we ignore it to the detriment not only of our individual relationships, but of our visions and efforts for equality.Drawing on a rich body of social science research on emotion and interracial interaction, this Article pushes beyond the recent cognitive turn in understanding discrimination to expose racial emotion as a source of discrimination at work. It uncovers the ways that the law (through Title VII of the Civil Rights Act) and organizations currently close racial emotion out of antidiscrimination discourse and close space for developing positive racial emotion at work. By theorizing racial emotion and the relationships that result as a potential source of discrimination, the Article positions the law to better see and address workplace discrimination and to set normative and regulatory grounding for organizations to open space and develop conditions for positive racial emotion and interracial relationships at work. To this end, the Article proposes several specific doctrinal changes, particularly around behavior of “racial assault,” in individual disparate treatment, hostile work environment, and retaliation law. It resists, however, calls for greater policing of all racial behavior through these laws, urging instead legal regulation of discrimination at the systemic level as a way of directing organizational attention toward developing work conditions that will foster conversation and learning across difference.",

In some states, the homosexual is labelled as a criminal; in others, homosexuality is not a legal affair. Psychological theories tend to consider the homosexual from two general positions: the Oedipal and the non-Oedipal. The present study was conducted to try to determine how Oedipal and non-Oedipal male homosexuals perceived their self-image and emotional stability. Significant differences were found between the two groups. Considering self-image, Oedipal subjects were found to be more negative. They had less self-worth, self-confidence and self-acceptance than non-Oedipal. They had more negative self-concepts, self-attitudes, and self-motivation. Oedipal homosexuals had less emotional stability. They had more emotional problems, shame, guilt, withdrawal, and depression than non-Oedipal subjects, as well as less success in sexual activity and commitment to the homosexual partner.",

Dai risultati raccolti emerge che i bambini del primo ciclo hanno paure piu astratte e\r\nirrazionali, legate all’immaginazione, come ad esempio la paura del buio e dei mostri. Mentre i\r\nbambini del secondo ciclo hanno paure piu razionali legate a situazioni concrete, come ad esempio\r\nla paura di essere rapiti o farsi male. Ma cio non puo essere generalizzabile, poiche gia nei bambini\r\ndel primo ciclo, seppur in minoranza, sono presenti paure concrete, come quella dei ladri o di alcuni\r\nanimali. Dai dati raccolti emerge quindi che e vero che ogni fascia d’eta e caratterizzata dalle sue\r\npaure, ma cio non e assoluto poiche ogni bambino si distingue in base alle esperienze, il carattere e\r\nl’ambiente in cui vive. Per quanto riguarda, invece, le strategie adottate dai bambini, emerge,\r\nindipendentemente dall’eta, l’importanza di affidarsi a una figura adulta, in questo caso i genitori.\r\nLa ricerca condotta permette di avvicinarsi all’emozione della paura, spesso considerata in maniera\r\nnegativa, di modo che i docenti siano consapevoli della rilevanza di questa emozione sul vissuto e\r\nsulla salute psico-fisica del bambino. Per questo motivo ritengo che il docente abbia un ruolo\r\nfondamentale nell’accogliere le paure del bambino e aiutare i propri allievi a riconoscerle e saperle\r\ngestire.

      "title": "The Co-Occurrence of Autism and Gender Diversity",
      "abstract": "Gender diversity refers to gender expressions and/or gender identity experiences that vary from the common experiences of gender. Gender-diverse people may be gender nonconforming, gender nonbinary, gender fluid, gender exploring, transgender, and so forth. Some gender-diverse individuals experience gender dysphoria and/or gender incongruence and may require gender-affirming supports, including gender-affirming medical interventions. The co-occurrence of autism and gender diversity has been highlighted in a series of studies internationally as well as through rich community expressions. Studies in gender-referred individuals reveal high rates of autism traits as well as high rates of existing autism diagnoses. Studies in autistic populations reveal greater gender diversity characteristics. The long-term course of gender diversity in autistic individuals is poorly understood. Clinical guidelines have been developed for adolescents with the co-occurrence, but much work remains: No gender-related measures have been developed and tested for use in neurodiverse populations, no programs exist to support gender-diverse neurodiverse adults, and little is known about co-occurring mental health profiles, risks, or protective factors for people with the co-occurrence. The inclusion of this chapter on co-occurring autism and gender diversity within a book on “co-occurring psychiatric conditions” is problematic, because gender diversity is not a “psychiatric condition,” but instead a form of human diversity. The diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria is useful only insomuch as it allows individuals to obtain necessary gender-related supports. The authors’ choice to include this chapter in this book reflects a compromise, motivated by the need for educating both autism and gender specialists in this common co-occurrence.",

      "title": "Debunking Sex and Disentangling Gender From Oncology",
      "abstract": "Ontological OppressionThe construction of otherness because of assumptions about personhood-otherwise known as ontological oppression 1 -excludes or misrepresents bodies or identities on the basis of preset categories.Ontologic constructs of gender in oncology encompass the notions that gender is inseparable from and synonymous with sex assigned at birth (henceforth sex), that gender is a static social concept across history or a fixed identity across the personal life course, and that sex is an objective and fixed category that can be easily assessed by a clinician.In addition to sex being conflated with gender, sex is used to make assumptions about a person's anatomy, chromosomes, and/or endogenous hormones. 2 The presence of transgender and intersex people therefore challenges unquestioned assumptions and conflated concepts that are pervasive in medicine and particularly salient in oncology for several reasons.First, discourses regarding specific cancers (eg, ovarian, endometrial, prostate) are often conflated with gender.Second, cancer epidemiology is often linked to a conflated sex/gender marker (eg, breast cancer incidence described specifically for women or men).Third, oncology subspecialty care is often gendered, and in the context of cancer treatment, occupying exclusively gendered spaces may be particularly painful.Last, mistakes regarding laboratory values or chemotherapeutic dosing may be particularly hazardous.Conflated conceptions of bodies and selfhood are interwoven throughout oncology training, algorithms, and epidemiological and other biomedical analyses.Cancer epidemiology (eg, women have higher rates of cholangiocarcinoma than men), differential diagnoses, and many other core aspects of oncology rely on conflated concepts of gender and anatomy.These conflations render invisible and pathologic transgender and intersex people whose anatomy, chromosomes, or hormones do not match categorical expectations.Such ontological oppression has many consequences including stigma and substandard care.This analytic essay, authored by queer and transgender academic clinicians, researchers, nonacademic community members, and allies, proposes a systems-based approach to degendering oncology, which we define as the conscious and explicit disentangling of gender, anatomy, hormonal milieu, karyotype and other biological factors in oncologic diagnoses, epidemiological analysis, and knowledge production along with eliminating sex from our conceptual framework of bodies and disease.We provide examples of the implementation of degendering oncology, including steps that can be taken immediately by clinicians, researchers, and administrators.",

      "title": "Being Bad on the Side Commentary on Paper by Eric Sherman",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sherman underscores the tenacity of phobic avoidance of homoeroticism, especially between men. Homophobia and anxieties related to gender identity are prevalent. I agree with Sherman that the feeling of being psychically penetrated can represent a particular threat to men. Sherman's use of the image of opening Pandora's box reveals a fear of a vulnerable, “vaginal” opening in men. In defense, rigidly “professional” relationships may prevail. This clinical scenario often repeats an early developmental dynamic with the father; erotic desire between males has a deep genetic history of dissociation and denial. Psychoanalytic theorists have had difficulty approaching this topic of passions for the same sex. Thinking further about elements that might entrench this dread and avoidance, I focus on the image of “being bad on the side,” with its potential meaning with regard to the primal scene. Homoeroticism might unconsciously register as a form of “cheating” on the heterosexual, reproductive couple—not sanctioned, tabooed, “cursed,” and thus particularly tantalizing and frightening. Analytic understanding of male development allows for the recognition of an especially strong sense of both attraction and danger for the male pairing—a “Laius curse.”",

A consequence of this state of affairs, as anyone investigating the theme soon realizes, is that there is a difference between the theory on women and women as they really are. The patients who have led people to reflect on these issues are women who, although they have reached important maturational stages and a good organization of the self, reveal in different ways a mixture of guilt feelings and of illegitimacy when carrying out projects of their own outside of traditional patterns. In order to develop, the ego ideal needs an environment that welcomes the child's accomplishments by offering her satisfactory narcissistic confirmation, while at the same time imposing on her sufficient frustrations so that the character of ideality as driving force and promise is not lost.",

      "abstract": "This article challenges a common view of delinquents as asocial and amoral regarding their support of other people. Support is measured through indications of the willingness to extend assistance to persons at various social and physical distances who are victims of crime. Delinquents seem indeed to be less supportive than other juveniles of people in general. However, when the nature of intervention (direct as opposed to indirect) is taken into account in situations of conflict, delinquents show more loyalty than other juveniles to family and friends. In this respect, delinquents' loyalty is undivided, suggesting that the social cohesion of delinquents may be more particularistic and intense than the more extensive and universalistic support given by other juveniles. Contact with other delinquents is directly related to in-group loyalty and may account for part, but not all, of the relationship between it and delinquency. Further analysis reveals an important departure from an additive model: Delinquents who are involved in dyadic relationships with other delinquents are “too” loyal. The findings are interpreted in terms of Simmel's view of conflict, group structure, and group cohesion.",

      "abstract": "The sense that abortion is the last resort for women placed in a distress situation by the continuation of the pregnancy should be preserved. No woman requesting abortion regards it as trivial, and postabortal depressions are more common than the banalization of the procedure might imply. Reasons for terminating the pregnancy are usually among the following: breakup of the couple, a recent loss, advanced age of existing children, emigration, or material difficulty. The psychological situation of pregnant adolescents is confused and sad, mixing the normal difficulties of adolescents with the affective problems of pregnancy and perhaps family problems as well. Pregnancy to an adolescent can symbolically represent a lack, a competition, or a selfpunishment; it can function as a proof of femininity, or a means of informing the parents of the girl's sex life. Pregnancy and abortion are experienced differently by adult women, who at a certain age feel a strong drive to realize the wish for maternity. Nevertheless, some women suffer a permanent conflict between the desire to have and the desire not to have children. Adult women may desire pregnancy, even accidental pregnancy, to prove their fertility, relive their own childhood, reassure themselves about menopause, fill a lack, or for numerous other reasons apart from wanting a child. Voluntary abortion can be defined as a strong unconscious desire for pregnancy tied to a conscious rejection of maternity. Interviews with women requesting abortions disclose the numerous conflicts that may exist with a maternal image, with the woman's own body, in the case of a recent loss, or at the breakup of a marriage. Studies have shown that the ambience in which the abortion is performed is of overwhelming importance for the later attitude of the woman; personnel involved should avoid adding to the trauma already experienced by the woman by making her feel guilty.",

      "title": "Profile of Islamic suicide bombers: A literature review",
      "abstract": "Aim To try to define the profile of Islamic suicide bombers. Methods Literature review of scientific articles (PubMed-Google). Results According to the very few relevant studies there does not seem to exist a single psychological characteristic that differentiates suicide bombers. However, some profiles have been proposed. Islamic bombers are predominately young men (60–70%), mostly single, originating from all social, economic and educational backgrounds (the more educated ones have increased lately). They appear to possess dependent and/or avoidant traits; other times impulsive and/or emotionally unstable ones. They are described as submissive against authority figures, inadequate in handling stressful situations and with a rather constricted view of reality. Suicide bombers do not appear to suffer from major psychopathology. Sometimes, they want to take revenge for the injury/killing of (a) loved one(s). The conviction of ethnic humiliation and victimization, the view that the enemy is dominant and that the rules of the game are unjust appear crucially important: only an unexpected, devastating act of self-sacrifice (martyrdom) could turn the tables on. Suicide bombers' families are generously compensated and enjoy high social status. Religion seems to provide ethical legitimization to similar acts. Islam condemns suicide except when used to champion Islamic values or fight against infidel invaders (Jihad). In these cases, there is the promise of absolving all the individual's sins and of after death pleasures. Conclusions The decision to become an Islamic suicide bomber appears determined by a plethora of personal, social, political and religious factors. This kind of suicide resembles Emile Durkheim's type of altruistic suicide.",

      "title": "A ROLLER-COASTER RIDE: NON NORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND ROMANTIC COMPETENCE IN ADOLESCENT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS",
      "abstract": "Despite the development of romantic relationships is a normative experience of adolescence, several risk factors connected to the this experience may lead to problems for adolescents’ adjustment and health. The adolescent romantic experience cannot be considered as a linear way, rather it should be studied as a path where an interplay of factors leads to several different outcomes basing on personal and contextual characteristics. Also, the development of the romantic experience is an “in-progress path”, thus inconsistencies may emerge and coexist. \r\nThe dissertation starts from this reflection, considering both normative and non-normative aspects of the adolescent romantic experience. The work is divided in two main studies. The first one, is focused on two non-normative experiences: Adolescent Dating Violence (chapter I) and Sexting (chapter II). The main aim is to identify factors that can be associated to those phenomena. The second study deals with the construct of Romantic competence and a specific measure to assess it is evaluated. The skill-based model of Romantic competence is a theoretical framework useful to both conceptualize and evaluate the romantic experience considering its complexity (chapter III and IV). Finally the association between Romantic competence, Adolescent Dating Violence and Sexting is preliminarily explored (chapter V).",

Sexual health problems can be caused by an ongoing illness, medication use, past surgery and/or relationship issues. The WHO has defined 'sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well being in relation to sexuality and it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity' [1]. Good sexual health comprises an absence of sexually transmitted disease (STD), fertility problems and unwanted pregnancies and also the ability to enjoy one's sexuality without abuse and/or oppression [1]. The topic of sex and sexuality in itself is now no longer confined to hushed discussions in the twenty-first century. Yet, there is still anxiety and abstinence when the topic of sex comes up for discussion, especially more so between the clinician and the patient [2, 3]. This leaves a tremendous void in the delivery of complete holistic healthcare.",

      "abstract": "The \"Hedonistic Paradox\" states that homo economicus, or someone who seeks happiness for him- or herself, will not find it, but the person who helps others will. This study examines two questions in connection with happiness and generosity. First, do more generous people, as identified in dictator experiments, report on average greater happiness, or subjective well-being (SWB), as measured by responses to various questionnaires? Second, if the answer is affirmative, what is the causal relationship between generosity and happiness? We find a favorable correlation between generosity and happiness (i.e., SWB is directly related to several measures of happiness and inversely related to unhappiness) and examine various possible explanations, including that material well-being causes both happiness and generosity. The evidence from this experiment, however, indicates that a tertiary personality variable, sometimes called psychological well-being, is the primary cause of both happiness and greater generosity. In contrast to field studies, the experimental method of this inquiry permits anonymity measures designed to minimize subject misrepresentation of intrinsic generosity (e.g., due to social approval motives) and of actual happiness (e.g., because of social desirability biases) and produces a rich data set with multiple measures of subjective, psychological and material well-being. The results of this and other studies raise the question of whether greater attention should be paid to the potential benefits (beyond solely the material ones) of policies that promote charitable donations, volunteerism, service education, and, more generally, community involvement, political action, and social institutions that foster psychological well-being.",

      "abstract": "Most of us are fairly sure we know what we mean when we describe someone's behaviour as 'polite'. To define the criteria with which we apply that description, however, is not quite as easy as we might think. When people are asked what they imagine polite behaviour to be, there is a surprising amount of disagreement. In an effort to find some kind of consensus we may of course take refuge in very general statements, but our usual way out of the dilemma is to resort to giving examples of behaviour which we, personally, would consider 'polite'. We might make statements like 'He always shows a lot of respect towards his superiors', or 'She's always very helpful and obliging', or 'She speaks really well', or 'He always opens doors for the ladies or helps them on with their coats', etc. Some people feel that polite behaviour is equivalent to socially 'correct' or appropriate behaviour; others consider it to be the hallmark of the cultivated man or woman. Some might characterise a polite person as always being considerate towards other people; others might suggest that a polite person is self-effacing. There are even people who classify polite behaviour negatively, characterising it with such terms as 'standoffish', 'haughty', 'insincere', etc.",

At an early age, these role reversals are often discouraged—girls and boys may be verbally or physically bullied when they don't conform to what other children (and adults) think they should play with. Parental permission must be secured, and in some instances, a parent or guardian may be required to be with the child during the experiment. Another consideration is realizing the natural limitations of children (in terms of boredom, fatigue, energy level, etc.). Hormones may affect toy choices indirectly, perhaps through an influence on activity level, motor skills, abilities, or temperament. Further, natural variations in levels or availability of testosterone among normal males and females might contribute to individual differences in sex-typed behavior.",

Potential incest ” and sometimes incest realization ” can be seen in the symbiotic link which the parent and the child often develop. This link can also deal/treat with the incestual fantasies that the trauma enhanced. Another figure of “incestuality”, which can be observed in those contexts, is tyranny. The clinical observation of children who are handicapped frequently reveals a development of tyrannical links. Such tyrannical links are also the effect of an attempt to deal with incestuality, to resist incestuality. If “incestuality” is primarily a violence done on the other, on his subjectivity, paradoxically, it is also, in this traumatic contexts, an attempt at repairing the link. The suture of the genealogical links is especially sought through the encroachments of the imagos and the transmission fantasies which can be frequently observed.",

The transgression of incest implicitly carries its own denial, to the point that it is trivialized as if it were simply a particular form of family communication. The incestuous sexual relationship is necessarily a form of masturbation, because sexuality remains auto-erotic in the sense that it is played out as though the other person had no existence. The desperate quest of incestuous parents is often motivated—as Simona Argentieri emphasizes—by confusion between masculine and feminine, and the impossibility to mourn the loss of androgyny. Unlike the Oedipus situation, which integrates desire into the law, thereby allowing the emergence of otherness, incest blurs the limits between the members of a family and introduces confusion.",

The task for personality researchers is to identify the specific non-shared environmental factors that contribute to personality differences. Parenting practices are often blamed. It is common to hear that parents were too lax with their children or sometimes even that parents were too harsh and that the teen was rebelling against parental authoritarianism. Children with conduct disorder tended to evoke the same kinds of parenting behaviors regardless of whether the interaction was with their own mom or another adult in the study. Parenting might be a response to personality as much as it is a potential cause of personality. Moreover, parenting itself might not act to make siblings similar because parenting is a function of specific parent–child interactions.",

      "abstract": "Alcoholism is a disease that attacks regardless of age, religion, nationality, sex, level of education, mental health, family situation, socio-economic status or character. Research on students' attitudes towards alcohol was carried out in Poland and Ukraine, in the countries where there is widespread positive feedback on its effects. In wide social circles put to the survey, alcohol consumption is a tradition taking place during different celebrations or almost every meeting. In addition, the use of alcohol means a quick drink up of large quantities of strong alcoholic drinks. This way of drinking does not function as a symbol of the meeting or its background, but becomes the center and the main reason. Alcohol used by teens generally does not cause surprise or concern. Many communities treat alcohol drunk in childhood, as natural and inevitable. It sometimes happens that young people and even children receive the first can of beer or a glass of champagne from the hands of their own parents. Until recently, public awareness of the phenomenon of using psychoactive substances has related to the margin of society, people from the so-called pathological and criminal environments. A little later there were reports that the alcohol and other drugs are in the range of interests of adolescents, coming from \"good homes\" and having good future prospects. The aim of the study was to investigate the attitudes of Polish and Ukrainian students towards alcohol. The main problem of the research focused on the question: Is there a difference in the attitudes of young people towards alcohol because of the country of origin? Research shows that among the students there is a problem of alcohol abuse. We must therefore start to implement effectively, not just \"on paper\", alcohol prevention programs already in primary schools.",

Disclosure brings about unwelcome intrusions into privacy, and it can change relationships by adding stress and reducing intimacy. Nondisclosure brings about the fear of being found out or the fear of forced disclosure if a partner is suddenly at risk, such as when a condom breaks during sexual relations. Full disclosure is generally the practice in long-term relationships, but casual encounters often do not result in full disclosure. Disclosure is sometimes discovered by looking for clues in a partner's behavior or from conversation. Health educators should try to encourage HIV-positive men to use condoms in their sexual encounters.",

      "title": "THE GENDER SYSTEM AND INTERACTION",
      "abstract": "▪ Abstract The gender system includes processes that both define males and females as different in socially significant ways and justify inequality on the basis of that difference. Gender is different from other forms of social inequality in that men and women interact extensively within families and households and in other role relations. This high rate of contact between men and women raises important questions about how interaction creates experiences that confirm, or potentially could undermine, the beliefs about gender difference and inequality that underlie the gender system. Any theory of gender difference and inequality must accommodate three basic findings from research on interaction. (a). People perceive gender differences to be pervasive in interaction. (b). Studies of interaction among peers with equal power and status show few gender differences in behavior. (c). Most interactions between men and women occur in the structural context of roles or status relationships that are unequal. These status and power differences create very real interaction effects, which are often confounded with gender. Beliefs about gender difference combine with structurally unequal relationships to perpetuate status beliefs, leading men and women to recreate the gender system in everyday interaction. Only peer interactions that are not driven by cultural beliefs about the general competence of men and women or interactions in which women are status- or power-advantaged over men are likely to undermine the gender system.",

      "title": "Domestic violence and hate crimes: Acknowledging two levels of responsibility",
      "abstract": "Sometimes people harbor certain negative attitudes about a group and go on to commit crimes involving persons whom they perceive to be group members. For example, individuals have been beaten to death because of their sexual orientation, lynched because of the color of their skin, or shot because of their religious affiliation. When someone is targeted because she or he is a member of a group for which the perpetrator feels hatred, we often identify this as a crime. Much domestic violence also has its source in negative attitudes, in this case attitudes about the subordinate place of women relative to men in society and the appropriateness of using violence to keep them there. (1) Some people believe that when a crime against an individual is motivated by a negative attitude about a particular group, for example, gay men, the crime is aggravated. In other words, if a vicious beating is also a gay-bashing, the crime is more serious than an equally vicious beating that is directed against a particular individual for reasons not having to do with prejudice. Proponents of this view might support enacting legislation that deals specifically with hate crimes. I accept that crimes motivated by harmful negative attitudes about some group have an extra component that is lacking in similar crimes not so motivated. This component stems from attitudes arising from misconceptions that are potentially harmful to members of that group. I do not, however, endorse the view that hate crimes and their relatives, such as crimes of domestic violence, are for that reason worse than similar crimes otherwise motivated. Nevertheless, I shall argue that this extra component means that, in addition to the usual punishments for these crimes, we have reason to insist on counseling as a part of a just response to those who are convicted of them. The aim of such counseling would be the revision of these negative attitudes. Counseling is particularly appropriate when the attitudes that contribute to the criminal acts are mainstream. For example, homophobia is not restricted to gaybashers. Nor are racist attitudes restricted to perpetrators of racist crimes. Nor is the view that women are subordinate to men restricted to those who beat their female partners. Certainly, anti-semitism was by no means restricted to Nazi sympathizers. My argument for the appropriateness of counseling as part of a just response to convictions in the case of crimes motivated by negative attitudes of these kinds rests on a claim about moral responsibility. Specifically, I argue that incorporating counseling acknowledges two levels of moral responsibility: moral responsibility at the level of the individual perpetrator and moral responsibility at the level of the community. We have good moral reason to take a more integrated approach that includes counseling and involves not only law enforcement and penal institutions but also community-based social services. This does not rule out the possibility of incarceration. Nevertheless this approach urges that we move beyond the idea that a jail or prison term is by itself sufficient to address a conviction for criminal behavior supported by negative attitudes of the kind involved in hate crimes and domestic violence. I expect some opposition to the suggestion that a criminal conviction might warrant anything beyond those punitive consequences with which it is traditionally associated. In particular, opponents may worry that the criminal nature of these acts is compromised when we include social services in the response. Not only are they being treated differently from other assaults, but the treatment associations of counseling might suggest diminished agency, thus undermining the claim that perpetrators are responsible. This would cast into doubt the appropriateness of regarding these wrongdoers as criminals at all. Taking these worries seriously, I address them both. I show that the integrated approach makes sense once we understand the kinds of changes that need to be in place if we are to address the social aspect of these crimes. …",

Consequently, this symptom pattern may have particularly negative effects on the transition from adolescent to adult roles. A general population sample of 200 young adults was assessed on Cluster A PD at mean ages 17 and 22, and subsequently provided detailed narratives about their monthly experiences and behaviors between these two ages. Adolescent Cluster A PD was related to the developmental trajectories of residential, career, financial, romantic, and family formation roles during this period, and trajectories were related to a change in symptoms over this period. Symptoms were associated with early parenthood and less advanced education, but for other developmental outcomes tended to differ for men and women. These gender differences were attributable, in part, to the differential meaning and consequences of early parenthood for men and women.",

      "abstract": "Everyday lookism, by which I mean the widespread practice of commenting upon and judging the appearance of others, is often regarded as morally troubling. But when, and why, is it morally problematic? I argue that in many cases everyday lookism is wrongful because it involves morally objectionable appearance discrimination. I consider various respects in which everyday lookism can be morally objectionable in virtue of the acts of wrongful discrimination it involves. I argue that these acts are wrongful when they are demeaning, or when they have unjust consequences whether singly or cumulatively. There are a number of ways in which they may have unjust consequences. First, the appearance norms in which these acts are rooted may be biased in such a way that the acts contribute to creating an unjust distribution of benefits and burdens. Second, these acts may combine to make everyday lookism oppressive in virtue of impairing the personal autonomy of its victims or contributing to doing so. Third, these acts may be unjustly harmful in terms of their effects.",

      "title": "Human kin detection",
      "abstract": "Natural selection has favored the evolution of behaviors that benefit not only one's genes, but also their copies in genetically related individuals. These behaviors include optimal outbreeding (choosing a mate that is neither too closely related, nor too distant), nepotism (helping kin), and spite (hurting non‐kin at a personal cost), and all require some form of kin detection or kin recognition. Yet, kinship cannot be assessed directly; human kin detection relies on heuristic cues that take into account individuals' context (whether they were reared by our mother, or grew up in our home, or were given birth by our spouse), appearance (whether they smell or look like us), and ability to arouse certain feelings (whether we feel emotionally close to them). The uncertainties of kin detection, along with its dependence on social information, create ample opportunities for the evolution of deception and self‐deception. For example, babies carry no unequivocal stamp of their biological father, but across cultures they are passionately claimed to resemble their mother's spouse; to the same effect, ‘neutral’ observers are greatly influenced by belief in relatedness when judging resemblance between strangers. Still, paternity uncertainty profoundly shapes human relationships, reducing not only the investment contributed by paternal versus maternal kin, but also prosocial behavior between individuals who are related through one or more males rather than females alone. Because of its relevance to racial discrimination and political preferences, the evolutionary pressure to prefer kin to non‐kin has a manifold influence on society at large.

      "abstract": "]awara merupakan salah satu dari entitas dari masyarakat Banten yang cukup terkenal Ia dikenal bukan saja karena pengaruh kharismanya yang melewati batas-batas geografis, tetapi juga budaya kekerasan yang melekat padanya. Sehingga ia dikenal sebagai subculture of violence dalam masyarakat Banten. Sebagai subkultur kekerasan, jawara memiliki motif-motif tertentu dalam melakukan kekerasan. Mereka pun mengembangkan gaya bahasa atau tutur kata yang khas, yang terkesan sangat kasar (sompra) dan penampilan diri yang berbeda dari mayoritas masyarakat, seperti berpakaian hitam dan memakai senjata golok.Kekerasan yang dilakukan jawara pada umumnya dimaknai oleh yang bersangkutan sebagai upaya pembelaan terhadap orangyang dipandang melakukan pelecehan harga diri yang menyebabkan yang bersangkutan merasa malu. Pelecehan terhadap harga diri dinterpretasikan oleh kalangan jawara sebagai pelecehan terhadap kapasitas dan kapabilitas diri dan ini sangat terkait dengan peran dan status sosial di masyarakat. Karena itu pelecehan terhadap harga diri dipahami sebagai pelecehan terhadap peran dan statusnya di masyarakat.Batasan tentang pelecehan harga diri itu memang tidak tegas karena itu sering dinterpretasikan secara suryektif oleh pelakunya. Sehingga yang menyebabkan kasus pelecehan harga diri itu berbagai macam seperti tuduhan pencurian, gangguan terhadap istri atau pacar, balas dendam atau kekalahan dalam politik desa atau persaingan bisnis. Dalam konteks ini kekerasan yang dilakukan jawara memang sangat terkait denngan \"konstruksi maskulinitas\" dalam budaya masyarakat.Kekerasan yang dilakukan jawara selain sebagai sarana untuk mempertahankan harga diri, kekerasan juga dipandang sebagai alat untuk meraih posisi atau status sosial lebih tinggi sebagai seorang jawara yang disegani dalam lingkungan komunitas mereka. Sehingga mereka biasa menjadi pimpinan jawara (bapak buah) denga memiliki sejumlah pengikut (anak buah). Bahkan dengan posisi dan status sosial ini mereka pula dapat meraih kedudukan formal dalam lingkuugan institusi formal seperti menjadi jaro, kepala desa, bahkan untuk menjadi bupati atau wali kota.Kata Kunci: Jawara, Budaya Kekerasan, Banten",

      "title": "It takes two (or more): The social nature of secrets",
      "abstract": "The lion's share of research on secrecy focuses on how deciding to keep or share a secret impacts a secret-keeper's well-being. However, secrets always involve more than one person: the secret-keeper and those from whom the secret is kept or shared with. Although secrets are inherently social, their consequences for people's reputations and social relationships have been relatively ignored. Secrets serve a variety of social functions, including (1) changing or maintaining one's reputation, (2) conveying social utility, and (3) establishing friendship. For example, if Beth has a secret about a past misdemeanor, she might not tell any of her friends in order to maintain her reputation as an outstanding citizen. If Beth does share this secret with her friend Amy, Amy could interpret this as a sign of trust and think that their friendship is special. However, Amy could also choose to share Beth's secret with the rest of the friend group to show that she is a useful member with access to valuable information about others. Attention to these social functions of secrets emerges from a young age, and secrets play a prominent role in human relationships throughout the lifespan. After providing an overview of what is currently known about the relational consequences of secrecy in childhood and adulthood, we discuss how social and developmental psychologists could work together to broaden our understanding of the sociality of secrets. Future steps include incorporating more dyadic and social network analyses into research on secrets and looking at similar questions across ages.

It was hypothesized that frequent physical aggression toward a partner, in the range of shelter samples, is largely caused by antisocial behavior and mutual couple conflict and, thus, that there would be greater similarity across genders in such behavior than has previously been supposed. It was also predicted that levels of injury and fear would be higher in women but that some men would experience these impacts. Findings indicated similarity across genders both in the prevalence of frequent aggression and in its association with antisocial behavior. Furthermore, such aggression was likely to be bidirectional in couples. Contrary to the hypothesis of the study, rates of injury and fear for the women were not significantly higher than for the men.",

Working in integrated teams and under the upcoming changes in reimbursement, primary care providers will be able to screen for, assess, treat, and/or refer sexual problems to colleagues within and outside of their practice. This requires a small but significant increase in the team’s level of knowledge about sex. Sexual problems have multiple etiologies: physical, including hormonal and structural, individual/psychological, and relationship-based. These causes interact with one another and require concurrent, rather than sequential, interventions. Major sexual problem areas include low and/or discrepant desire levels, difficulty becoming aroused (erectile dysfunction in men, low excitement in women), difficulty in achieving orgasm in women and men, premature ejaculation, and sexual pain in women. Working through integrated, multidisciplinary teams, much more can be done for patients in this important area of health.",

      "abstract": "Paternalistic actions are performed for the target's own benefit, i.e., for the purpose of improving or increasing her personal well-being or welfare. Some accounts of well-being imply that an agent's attitude (or lack thereof) towards an action (or its likely outcome) has a direct bearing on its welfare-value for her. Since paternalistic actions interfere with autonomy or rational self-governance, these accounts may imply that paternalistic actions cannot be overall beneficial, or else that they are always simultaneously harmful to a significant degree. Some even imply that paternalistic actions can never occur, because the autonomous choice of an end is a condition of its status as a welfare-good. This chapter evaluates several proposals of this kind, e.g., that rational self-direction, autonomous living, and the endorsement of ends are either conditions on personal benefit, or else non-instrumental welfare-goods, or else key instrumental goods. However, it is argued that there is no plausible account of personal well-being or any of the goods just mentioned that supports the claim that paternalistic action cannot succeed.",

      "abstract": "Although suicidality is frequently the cause of stigma, it is conversely true that stigma may be the cause of suicidality. The present paper focuses on the complex relationships that exist between suicidal behavior and stigmatizing attitudes.A narrative review of the topic will be presented on the basis of the relevant literature collected from an electronic search of PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases, using stigma, public stigma, structural stigma, perceived stigma, self-stigma, suicide, attempted suicide, and suicidality as key words.A negative perception is frequently held of suicidal people, labeling them as weak and unable to cope with their problems, or selfish. Individuals who have attempted suicide are subject to similar processes of stigmatization and \"social distancing\"; insurance policies include an exclusion clause against death by suicide. Subjects with a direct personal experience of depression or suicide strongly endorse a feeling of self-stigma; those who have attempted suicide are often ashamed and embarrassed by their behavior and tend to hide the occurrence as much as possible. Similar processes are observed among family members of subjects who have committed suicide or made a suicide attempt, with a higher perceived stigma present in those bereaved by suicide. Perceived or internalized stigma produced by mental or physical disorders, or through belonging to a minority group, may represent a significant risk factor for suicide, being severely distressing, reducing self-esteem and acting as a barrier in help-seeking behaviors.With the aim of preventing suicide, greater efforts should be made to combat the persisting stigmatizing attitudes displayed toward mental disorders and suicide itself. Indeed, the role of stigma as a risk factor for suicide should further motivate and spur more concerted efforts to combat public stigma and support those suffering from perceived or internalized stigma. Experts and scientific societies should form an alliance with the media in an effort to promote a marked change in the societal perception of mental health issues and suicide. As stigma may result in severe consequences, specialist care and psychological interventions should be provided to populations submitted to stigma.",

      "abstract": "It is sometimes thought that sentimentalism has a difficult philosophical time with issues of paternalism because it cannot invoke the idea of autonomy the way Kantians can when dealing with cases where paternalistic intervention for someone's sake seems morally unjustified. But contemporary sentimentalism can, in fact, deal plausibly with the entire range of examples that preoccupy the literature on paternalism. Respect for others' autonomy can be unpacked in terms of empathy with their ideas, fears, and aspirations, but there are times, as with children, when empathy with a larger future can justify, say, a parent's overriding a child's fear of doctors. The parent empathizes with the fear but their empathy with the child is more strongly engaged by what they see will happen if the child doesn't go to the doctor's. There are also examples involving adults where the Kantian thinks paternalistic intervention is unjustified, but where the sentimentalist can hold that paternalistic intervention with some adult can be justified in terms of respect understood as being fully empathic with that person. Sentimentalism can offer a quite intuitive view of the morality of paternalism that stands opposed to Kantian ideas in this area.",

      "abstract": "Social exclusion, or ostracism, is being excluded or rejected by others. It is the common behaviour within social situations. Detecting social exclusion could be essential for the survival of human creatures, as social exclusion could threaten the basic needs of human creatures: self-esteem and feelings of belongingness. Williams temporal need threat model introduces how individuals react toward ostracism. Usually, individuals can recover from social exclusion quickly by behaving pro-socially to reconnect to others and fortify the basic need(s) threatened by social exclusion. However, for individuals with higher social anxiety or social anxiety disorder, the negative social belief about themselves (unpopular, shyness) within a social situation inhibits their recovery speed from exclusion and desire to reconnect to others. When social exclusion happens, individuals with higher social anxiety or social anxiety disorder become more vulnerable in social situations. Individuals lose their ability to get used to social situations when they suffer long-term social exclusion. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is suggested to be a helpful therapy for individuals suffering from long-term social exclusion and social anxiety disorder.",

      "title": "The Instability of Sexual Preference",
      "abstract": "Abstract Whether an explanation for sexual preference is biological, psychological, or sociological, the basic presumption usually is that sexual preference is set early and changes little through life. In this view, any changes in sexual feelings, sexual behaviors, or romantic feelings are especially unlikely after adulthood. Further, it would be sexual feelings that would be least likely to change because they are assumed to be the most basic element of sexual preference. Despite these presumptions, evidence of substantial change in an individual’s sexual preference does exist. For example, one recent study noted the effect of the feminist movement on women’s sexuality, teaching some women that relating both emotionally and sexually to other women is an option.1 Another study focused on a group of women who were all heterosexual in behavior and identity before participating in swinging.2 As a response to their husbands’ wishes and their observations of other women, they became involved in sex with other women, and all of them eventually identified themselves as bisexual. Their bisexuality, moreover, was an addition to their previous heterosexual interest, and they still preferred heterosexual sex.",

      "title": "Consequences of violence experienced in childhood",
      "abstract": "A family is an institution where a person acquires all social roles and behaviour patterns. One of the main factors destroying a family’s harmony is domestic violence. Violence against children is a relevant issue in all countries. The extent of this problem is increased by the established opinion of society that the family’s problems are only its business. They are not made public, and the family itself must solve the problems within its environment. Empirical data were analysed after conducting qualitative research based on a semi-structured interview, which allowed a better understanding of an individual, delving into her problems and clarifying the need for assistance and its importance in her personal life. Content analysis was applied after conducting the research. The research involved 8 women who experienced various punishments as a means of upbringing in childhood. The research revealed that the causes of violence against children in a close environment often do not depend on children’s behaviour or other characteristics related to them. Violent families often live below the poverty line and have alcohol addiction or other social problems. Parents are usually violent because they were abused as children, and they consider it an acceptable way of communication and parenting. The consequences of violence against children are obvious and range from low self-esteem to self-harm and suicide. Children who have experienced violence in their close environment often become abusers themselves. It has been determined that in their childhood, the respondents who participated in the research experienced all four forms of violence distinguished in the scientific literature: physical, psychological, sexual, and neglect. However, it has been revealed that the majority of the respondents did not seek help because, at the time when they were children, there was little talk about children’s rights and methods of raising children. If corporal punishment occurred, it was considered to be one of the generally used and acceptable methods of raising children.",

Maternal infanticides are infrequent events; however, when they do occur, a number of cases fall within the framework of a postpartum mental illness. The term infanticide is commonly used interchangeably with homicides of children under the age of five. Infanticide and filicide by both males and females are explored.",

      "title": "Mood Disturbance Across the Life Span",
      "abstract": "Abstract As the most frequently reported form of mood disturbance, depression is said to be the “common cold” of emotional distress. Sadness is a common, human response to loss, failure, rejection, or disappointment. This sadness can be profound, as it may be after the death of a loved one. However, sadness is not depression unless it becomes complicated by negative feelings about our futures and our selves. Depressed people feel badly about themselves, they blame themselves for things going wrong in their lives, and they have trouble imagining a better future. Depression that is clinically meaningful involves physical symptoms as well, including changes in appetite, energy levels, and sleeping patterns. Depression is usually preceded by one or more highly stressful life events, which typically involve loss or devaluation, such as the break up of a relationship, or failure at school or work (Brown &amp;Harris, 1978). Even positive life events can entail an element of loss and so risk depressed mood. For instance, when women first become mothers, they may be overjoyed by the baby’s birth but at the same time feel that they have lost freedom and control over their lives.",

      "abstract": "As a technique of social control intimately associated with the display and control of power, humor reflects empowerment. Contemporary women have few traditions of using power, and a variety of covert factors have discouraged women's use of humor. The most significant of these is the way that the popular mind has defined humor as a male prerogative. Humor can only be achieved through use of symbolic and linguistic codes. Society has not fully recognized how jealously men guard the use of these codes. Because women's participation in humor has been alternately impeded and underestimated, it is important for social scientists and feminists to try to understand the factors responsible. This is not easy, partly because attitudes and beliefs are so deeply held that one may fail to see the very thing at which one is looking. An additional difficulty with humor is that its implicit symbolism enables meaning to coexist on multiple levels. Thus, it remains unclear to the critic whether a particular image or stereotype is being lampooned or upheld. And yet humor, perhaps more than other social measures, is a subtle indicator of the status of a subgroup. When the dominant group is ready to laugh at one's jokes, then one is a member of society.

      "abstract": "With the recent upswing in research interest on the moral implications of disgust, there has been uncertainty about what kind of situations elicit moral disgust and whether disgust is a rational or irrational player in moral decision making. We first outline the benefits of distinguishing between bodily violations (e.g., sexual taboos, such as pedophilia and incest) and nonbodily violations (e.g., deception or betrayal) when examining moral disgust. We review findings from our lab and others' showing that, although many existing studies do not control for anger when studying disgust, disgust at nonbodily violations is often associated with anger and hard to separate from it, while bodily violations more consistently predict disgust independently of anger. Building on this distinction, we present further empirical evidence that moral disgust, in the context of bodily violations, is a relatively primitively appraised moral emotion compared to others such as anger, and also that it is less flexible and less prone to external justifications. Our review and results underscore the need to distinguish between the different consequences of moral emotions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Interpersonal acceptance‐rejection theory (IPARTheory) asserts that recollections of parental rejection in childhood tend to result in psychological maladjustment and intimacy problems in later romantic relationships. Informed by IPARTheory, we investigated the association between maternal &amp; paternal rejection, and fear of intimacy by the mediating role of psychological maladjustment in a Turkish sample with 462 mostly young adults. We further explored the moderator role of gender in Model 1 and the moderating roles of both gender and intimate partner rejection in Model 2. Model 1 revealed that adults who had experienced maternal and paternal rejection in childhood tended to be psychologically maladjusted. Consequently, they also tended to have a fear of intimacy, regardless of gender. Model 2 revealed that women who recall having been rejected in childhood by their mothers tended to be psychologically maladjusted and to have a significant fear of intimacy when they also experienced moderate or more than moderate intimate‐partner rejection. However, both women and men who experienced paternal rejection in childhood tended to be psychologically maladjusted and to experience a greater fear of intimacy when they perceived any degree of intimate partner rejection. Implications of the results for theory, research, and practice are discussed.",

The effects of the social order on health and disease are many and varied. Social definitions determine the actions which persons and societies take in the face of given symptoms and disorders. Social practices may exert their effects di rectly on the organism and its physical capacities or may operate primarily through psychological processes which are linked to the maintenance of bodily equilibriums. In either instance, these effects tend to be nonspecific as to disease. Social status, variations in life styles, adaptation to new or stressful situations, work group structure, and family patterns have been found to be associated with differences in the in cidence of a variety of diseases. The intricacies of dealing with social factors in disease and the ramifications for the larger society are plainly seen in the case of smoking.",

Risk is an unavoidable part of pregnancy and childbirth, one that women must balance against other vital personal and family interests. Two particular issues relate to the fairness of claims that pregnant women are never entitled to put their fetuses at risk: relative risks and relatives' risks. The former have been used-often spuriously-to advance arguments against activities, such as home birth, that may incur risk; the latter implicate the nature of relationships in determining the acceptability of coercing or precluding activities. Motivated reasoning by clinicians and judges leads to inaccurate risk assessments, and judgments based on false claims to objectivity. Such judgments undermine the moral and legal standing of pregnant women and do not advance the interests of fetuses, pregnant women, families, or states.",

The differences are possible and presented in anxiety generators i.e. triggers, its' manifestations and coping strategies, etc. The contemporary theoretical standpoints make the important distinction between sex and gender identity. Sexual identity is determined by the anatomical attributes, whereas gender identity refers to the continuous subjective experience of one's own sex. Gender is directly related to gender roles representing anticipated, imposed, socially desirable behaviours that are sexually differentiated. Although gender related stressors are inevitable, individual coping strategies determine the level of efficacy of individual adaptational styles. Neither man nor women can be perceived as having a higher risk of developing gender anxiety disorder. Moreover, the sexes seem to be equally susceptible to it. The studies of the domain underline the importance of coping mechanisms which, if not efficient in dealing with gender stressors, result in chronic anxiety in women, making them more prone to the development of depression, and in substance abuse in men.",

There have been times when one discipline has claimed the central role, or even a monopoly, in explaining crime, only to be supplanted by another with similar claims. It is now abundantly clear, however, that the complex phenomena of crime and delinquency are not amenable to explanation in terms of a single discipline: There are social, psychological, and physiological correlates of persistent criminality, and these demand explanation within the framework of the relevant discipline. This is an uncomfortable state of affairs, because most criminologists are specialists who are trained to work within their parent disciplines and inadequately informed about the state of other fields of scholarship. But we ignore the activities of our colleagues with different specialties at our peril – that is to say, at the risk of wasting time and energy on poorly defined issues. We must constantly be glancing across at our fellow criminologists from other disciplines to see what they are doing, how their empirical studies are progressing, and what changes are taking place in the theoretical frame in which they are working, for if we do not do this, we shall inevitably discover that we have been laboring away at some problem that others have abandoned or redefined. Paradoxically, although the nature of the questions each of us asks is constrained by our parent discipline, developments in other disciplines may render those questions trivial or pointless.",

This school environment is essential for the processes of adaptation and personal adjustment where gender is built. \nThe present work is focused on the playground as a space and time that takes place during school hours and facilitates both coexistence and interpersonal \nrelationships. Objective: to determine if gender influences the acceptance and rejection relationships that occur during recess in primary and secondary schools, \nboth when choosing and / or rejecting their peers, and in the motivations that justify said choice and / or rejection. Methodology: Mixed, centered on the \ninterpretive paradigm that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results: Girls and boys choose girls and boys respectively, both in the first and second \noption respectively, to interact during recess due to personality (fun, friendly, funny), friendship (best friend) and play reasons. Regarding rejection, there is \na significant relationship with gender, but in a different sense than expected. Both girls and boys reject in first and second place mostly boys. The reasons \nare related to the personality of the rejected partner, affective characteristics, and differences in the type of games. Conclusions: Acceptance relationships in \nthe playground are related to gender. This pattern, however, is not manifested in the rejection, that occur mainly for reasons of personality, affection, and \ndiscrepancies in the type of game. These motivations induce theoretical and practical implications regarding the reorganization of the playground and \nthe utility of a socio-emotional intervention programs on gender equality, cooperation, and interpersonal relations and promotes social and educational \ninclusion.",

      "title": "\"Discredited\" and \"Discreditable:\" The Search for Political Identity by People with Psychiatric Diagnoses",
      "abstract": "You're never the same--mental health diagnosis is an opinion and attitude. You cannot cure or have remission from others' attitudes of rejection. (1) Friends and family--they don't understand my illness/disability--they think I am getting away with something--that there is nothing wrong with me. (2) INTRODUCTION Identity matters. In particular, identity matters to people who are stigmatized and stereotyped because they belong to a socially disfavored group. Although individual members of these groups may have very different ideas about how to respond to prejudice and mistreatment, the matter of identity itself--membership in the group--is generally not at issue. Justice Clarence Thomas and the Reverend Jesse Jackson may have sharply conflicting ideas about the meaning of being an African American in our society, but the identity of each man as an African American is hardly open to question. When it comes to disabilities, however, these distinctions begin to blur, in part because disability is as much about environmental context and social functioning as it is about any physical or mental characteristic. Asthma may or may not be a disability, depending on the presence of pollen and pollutants in the air. Mild mental retardation may be less disabling in a rural farming community than in a busy urban environment. In addition, impairments exist along a spectrum, both physical and functional, rather than representing a dichotomy between a class of clearly identified people differentiated unmistakably from nondisabled people. Therefore, a person's self-identification as disabled is often not as automatic as self-identification with respect to race and sex. In fact, self-identification as a person with a disability is often a long, complex, and difficult process. In this respect it may resemble self-identification as gay or lesbian. Disability, unlike race and sex, but like sexual preference, is usually not identifiable at birth, (3) and often becomes salient in an individual's life after she has formed a personal identity. Indeed, one of the most hurtful aspects of disability discrimination is that newly persons find it very difficult to accept that people who knew them before they became can treat them so differently once they are disabled, and people with hidden disabilities are shocked when they are abandoned by old friends and even family after they reveal their disabilities. The fact that disabilities exist along a spectrum contributes to another disparity between the identity of people and the identity of people in other groups that experience discrimination. Because disabilities exist along a spectrum, it is unclear when someone actually becomes Disability is a status that is initially identified, named, or conferred, not by the individual, but by usually medical experts, although the ramifications of disability are significantly social and political. Furthermore, unlike race or gender, experts hold themselves out as being able to mitigate or treat disability. (4) Although people with disabilities have challenged the claims and dominance of experts for many years, experts retain a position of primacy in defining both the categories and the meaning of physical and mental disability, and are considered the only authority on the mitigation, treatment or cure of the disability. (5) The centrality of experts to the experience of disability has enormous social, legal, and political consequences. A large number of cases under the Americans with Disabilities Act involve claims by the plaintiff that she is disabled. (6) Defendants dispute these claims by hiring experts to refute the plaintiff's claims to identity as a person with a disability. In many cases, the Supreme Court has rejected the plaintiff's claim to belong to the protected group--persons with disabilities. (7) This process--permitting experts and the judiciary to determine whether an individual fits into a protected class--would be unthinkable in the case of race, gender, age, religion, or sexual orientation. …",

The purpose of this review is to provide an update on recent findings and to consider their implications. Research on children raised in institutions, children adopted out of institutions, and young children who have experienced neglect in families is considered. Reactive attachment disorder may be identified reliably in a minority of children being raised in severely neglectful environments. The emotionally withdrawn/inhibited pattern and the indiscriminately social/disinhibited pattern arise in similar conditions of risk, but respond differently to intervention and appear to have different correlates. Much has been learned about the emotionally withdrawn/inhibited pattern of reactive attachment disorder and the indiscriminately social/disinhibited pattern. Much less is known about so-called secure base distortions or relational disorders of attachment.",

      "abstract": "Unlike many conditions described in this volume, having a hearing loss or being deaf does not necessarily result in specific deficits in functioning. Functional outcomes depend on a complex interplay of physiological, developmental and environmental factors. We start with the premise that hearing loss by itself will often have an impact on cognitive organization but not necessarily or consistently on intellectual, neuropsychological, emotional, social or behavioral functioning. Disruption of these functions depends heavily on other factors that may be associated with etiology of the hearing loss or the interaction between individuals and their environment, including communication, family, educational, emotional and sociolinguistic environments. At the same time, effects related to a hearing loss can have significant negative impact in each of these areas, particularly without comprehensive and appropriate supports.",

      "title": "Loneliness and Quality of Life among Elderly People",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONLoneliness is the feeling that emerges when social relationship are felt to be deficient and may arise from a perceived lack of companionship and refers to the experience of negative feeling due to inadequacy of existing relationship (De jong-Gierveld and Havens, 2004). Loneliness is defined as a subjective negative feeling related to the person's own experience of deficient social relations. Loneliness is a universal phenomenon embedded in the human experience closely associated with changing life circumstances.Loneliness may be regarded as a 'geriatric giants', leading to impaired quality of life, greater need for institutional care and increased mortality. Loneliness looms large in old age. Partners, friends, and relatives literally die on you. Your social circle keeps getting smaller with years. And the clammy fingers of death play a fearsome tune on your spine. Failing health, along with a decreased level of activity or social life can make old age frightening.Loneliness is defined as an individual's subjective experience of a lack of satisfying human relationships. In other words, it is a feeling that may be affected by the social relationship experienced by the individuals. Thus loneliness is a negative feeling causing distress to an individual Savikko's (2008).WHO defines Quality of Life as individuals perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way by the person's physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships, personal beliefs and their relationship to salient features of their environment.Quality of life is also related to a range of objective and subjective factors, including the range and quality of social networks and the experience of loneliness. While there may be a widely-held stereotype associating old age with social isolation and with loneliness (Forbes, 1996), international research evidence indicates that the majority of older people are neither lonely nor socially isolated (Victor et al., 2002).Loneliness often is regarded as the psychological embodiment of social isolation, reflecting the individual's experienced dissatisfaction with the frequency and closeness of their social contacts or the discrepancy between the relationships they have and the relationships they would like to have. Loneliness itself has been linked with decreased quality of life, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, elevated blood pressure and cortisol, heightened inflammatory responses to stress and modifications in transcriptional pathways linked with gluco corticoid and inflammatory process.According to Weiss (1973) loneliness can be divided into experience of emotional isolation or of social isolation. Emotional isolation represents the subjective response to the absence of a close and intimate attachment figure, e.g. the lack of a loved one or a spouse. Emotional loneliness is a subjective feeling and it can only be quantified by the individual experiencing it (Andersson 1998). In studies with a subjective perspective of loneliness, the results may reveal the intensity (very lonely - not at all lonely) of loneliness or only the participants' experience of being lonely (feels loneliness - does not feel loneliness).REVIEW OF LITERATURESingh and Kiran (2013) examined the relationship of loneliness of elderly female with their quality of life and other demographic issues through review of related researches. Findings revealed that loneliness is a particularly relevant issue in relation to elderly widows, whose rates of mortality illness and depression exceed those of their married counterparts, every woman who loses a husband through death experiences a painful period of bereavement, often accompanied by severe loneliness, obsessive thoughts of the deceased, restlessness, insomnia, somatic complaints, and even hallucinations of the deceased, and poor mental wellbeing. …",

Typically, there is a great deal of complexity in the system of concern and uncertainty concerning the relationship between cause and effect. The reasons for this include the facts that (a) one typically encounters combinations of toxic substances, rather than single pollutants; (b) the system of concern may not in itself be clearly understood, even in the absence of chemical perturbation; and (c) data, particularly from field studies, are often incomplete. Yet, the environmental toxicologist is frequently challenged to address the effects of natural or anthropogenic perturbations, either after the fact or, ideally, in the planning stage of any human endeavour that might have an environmental impact.",

      "abstract": "Jealousy is defined as one of the most common automatic responses to endangering a relationship by a third party, and in evolutionary psychology it has the function of maximizing self-reproduction fitness, ensuring paternity security in men, and maintaining partner's resources in women. These include romantic jealousy, in men assuring certainty of paternity, and in women assuring the maintenance of partner's resources. Thus, according to this logic, a woman’s sexual infidelity should be more threatening for men and a man’s emotional infidelity (emotional involvement with other women than a primary partner) should be more threatening for women. Many previous studies confirm the existence of sex differences in jealousy; men reporting a higher level of sexual jealousy and women reporting a higher level of emotional jealousy. On the contrary, studies of romantic jealousy in homosexual individuals show inconsistent results. Some studies suggest that the type of sexual and emotional jealousy does not depend on the sex of the individual who is jealous, but rather on the sex of the partner or the sex of the rival. Therefore, the aim of this review is to introduce romantic jealousy from an evolutionary perspective and to acquaint the reader with current knowledge of the study of cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects of romantic jealousy in heterosexual and homosexual men and women.",

On 16 February 1995, in the small Minnesota town of Delano, a 14-year-old boy and his best friend ambushed and killed his mother as she returned home. On the too-rare occasions in which friendships are taken into account developmentally—either in diagnosis or research—children are differentiated merely according to whether or they have friends. Striking differences exist, however, among these relationships—both from child to child and companion to companion. Cross-sectional comparisons show that, first, children who have friends are more socially competent and less troubled than children; they are more sociable, co-operative, altruistic, self-confident, and less lonely. Some similarities among friends derive from the well-known tendency among human beings for choosing close associates who resemble themselves. Children and the friends are similar to one another, especially in attributes with reputational salience.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study was designed to explore in depth the relational experiences of five gay men who identified themselves as having difficulty developing intimate relationships with other men. The premise of the study was that these men's early paternal object relations, represented in unconscious phantasy, influence their adult object relations, also represented in unconscious phantasy, as powerfully mediated by the internalization of a heterosexist interpersonal environment during boyhood. The chief hypothesis was that the experience of growing up within a heterosexist environment would have a strong and negative influence on these men's subsequent relationships. I found that, for these five men, the dominant factor in their adult relationships was their internalized childhood relationships with their fathers, as represented in their unique, unconscious phantasies. However, a further, unexpected cross-case finding was that these men's phantasies about the experience of a painful outcome to the Oedipus (the loss of the primary oedipal object), seemed to have been powerfully re-stimulated by later experiences of rejection, or fear of rejection, by adolescent male peers. The consequence of this particular, psychically resonating experience appeared to be that these men re-worked their unconscious phantasies, incorporating their painful adolescent experiences into their negative underlying phantasies about themselves in relation to other males.",

What is at stake is brought out by considering certain objections to father‐daughter incest and certain features of taboos. The objections that matter do not depend on social ties and distinctions having a biological basis, but there is nonetheless a biological element in incest taboos. To see it, one must look to the nature of the Oedipus complex, and to the conditions for the development of the individual and of society. There may be prohibitions which are necessary (to morality, to society, to humanity) even though they may not be justifiable within a narrower conception (e.g. utilitarian) of morality and justification. And so taboos which are universal (occur, in one form or another, in every society), and absolute (allow no questioning), and impose strict liability (allow no excuse), may not be irrational: they may mark the boundaries that shape a way of life.",

      "abstract": "Although the belief that personality is linked to health goes back at least to Greek and Roman times, the scientific study of these links began in earnest only during the last century. The field of psychosomatic medicine, which grew out of psychoanalysis, accepted that the body and the mind were closely connected. By the end of the 20th century, the widespread adoption of the five-factor model of personality and the availability of reliable and valid measures of personality traits transformed the study of personality and health. Of the five broad domains of personality (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and intellect/openness), the most consistent findings in relation to health have been obtained for conscientiousness (i.e., hard-working, reliable, self-controlled). People who are more conscientious have better health and live longer lives than those who are less conscientious. These advantages are partly explained by the better health behaviors, good social relationships, and less stress that tend to characterize those who are more conscientious. The causal relation between personality and health may run in both directions; that is, personality influences health, and health influences personality. In addition to disease diagnoses and longevity, changes on biomarkers such as inflammation, cortisol activity, and cellular aging are increasingly used to chart health in relation to personality traits and to test explanatory models. Recognizing that both personality and health change over the life course has promoted longitudinal studies and a life-span approach to the study of personality and health.",

      "abstract": "It is a sad truism that there is nothing that people will not do to other people. This may be at the individual level, as with the psychopathic serial murderer, but it is particularly the case with regard to collective behaviour. This can occur in groups, institutions and organizations driven by ideology, patriotism, extreme belief in a leader, kinship or clanship, by racial hatred or by religious fanaticism. People become absorbed in the group and, within its solidarity, restraints are removed and they commit acts they would almost certainly never contemplate doing as individuals. To a degree then, the organization or collective is complicit. Indeed, I argue that there is ample evidence to support the contention that ‘organizations kill’. In essence, I will maintain that there are no ‘individuals’ in organizations and that organizations commit ‘crimes’. This draws attention to the social-psychology of ‘deviant’ behaviour in organizations and I will lilustrate this with regard to policing and the business corporation. And in relation to the latter, I will argue that the law seems unable, or unwilling, to tackle the issue of corporate blame. It remains fixated on the individual and the organization too often manoeuvres successfully to evade the criminal label.",

      "abstract": "Professional concerned with early child development and care have focused their attention on the physical maltreatment of children while excluding abandonment from the definitional sphere of abuse and neglect. At the same time there has been little cross-cultural research on child abandonment, particularly in Third World countries. The short- and long-term effects of abandonment of the child, however, may be more crippling and difficult to reverse than those resulting from physical battering or emotional neglect. Our knowledge of abandonment to date is restricted to retrospective clinical descriptions of abandoned children and their families as well as anthropological records of abandonment. Close inspection of the few existing reports in certain Non-Western cultures reveals that the abandonment of children is not limited to Western (Euro-Americanl societies. Moreover, the incidence, expression, and probable causes of abandonment show extreme variance both within and between these cultural entities. Factors contributing to abandonment may include aspects of pre- and post-natal risk, child temperament characteristics, a low quality of attachment between mother and infant, lack of caregiving skills, personality attributes of the mother and father, marital dynamics, family stress and economic difficulty. We have much to learn about how to prevent abandonment by careful examination of those cultures in which the incidence of abandonment appears to be exceptionally low. Effective intervention and prevention may also be augmented by research oriented toward the detection of high-risk abandonmentprone families, areas, and sociocultural groups.",

      "abstract": "During the transition to parenthood, perceived imbalances in family work typically increase. Little is known, however, about which individuals are especially prone to perceive unfairness in the division of family work during this time. Using data from a longitudinal study of married couples expecting their first child and controlling for marital distress and other relevant variables, we observed that when husbands were psychologically distressed, both they and their wives were subsequently more likely to perceive unfairness to wives in the division of family work. No analogous significant and prospective effects of wives' levels of distress on their own or their husbands' perceptions of unfairness were found. We also found that once wives perceived the amount of child care they did as unfair, both they and their husbands were later more likely to experience psychological distress, controlling for marital distress and other relevant variables.",

      "abstract": "\"The\" cause or causes of the abuse of minors by Catholic clergy have been the subject of research, with conclusions sometimes drawn that are unwarranted. When causes are incorrectly passed over or are misidentified, the corrections that would be suggested will be ineffective. For example, mandatory celibacy among clergy has been too readily dismissed as a contributing factor, largely because of a faulty interpretation of data by the researchers who conducted the John Jay College research. I will be making observations of a critical nature before I begin making preventive or corrective proposals. We do not yet know enough for proposals to be definitive, so I will be pointing toward stratagems rather than confidently identifying them. Topics related to causality include the ecological fallacy, constant causes, probabilistic causes, thresholds, remote vs. proximate causes, and catalysts. Possible causal factors discussed will include mandatory celibacy and loneliness, clericalism and patriarchy as an element within that, intrusive governance and resultant powerlessness, youth counter-normative subcultures, a special clergy image, and avoidance of sexuality. Potential solutions include a married clergy, the ordination of women, less isolation and policing in formation programs, and the breaking down of special clerical images. The theological scholarship behind Church policies concerning ordination and homosexuality are evaluated.",

      "title": "Prejudice and Homosexuality",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY. The recent psychodynamic literature on homosexuality is reviewed and a negative view is shown to remain prevalent. It is suggested that this may be the result of prejudice as opposed to simple error or to justified belief. In order to support this suggestion a theory of the origins and operation of prejudice is outlined. Next it is shown to be a consequence of this theory that prejudice should be especially likely in the domain of sexuality. Then an understanding of the psychic mechanisms which maintain prejudice is applied to a close reading of three papers concerned with homosexuality, which are shown to retain the marks of prejudice despite their compassionate and thoughtful stance. The way in which the logical distortions which mark prejudice are discernible in all three papers and operate to perpetuate some prejudices about AIDS, HIV infection, homosexuality and perversion is also shown. The prevalence of prejudices about homosexuality is noted to be especially great amongst psychodynamic therapists. It is argued that some reasons for this lie in the nature of psychoanalytic theory particularly in the way that homosexuality challenges some choices implicit within psychoanalytic theory. The parallels between this situation and that of the prejudiced individual are noted and suggestions are made for steps that might reduce prejudice in this area. Finally it is argued that the ill effects of prejudice on theory in this area are detrimental to psychoanalysis as well as to homosexuals. Prejudice and its effects are argued to be major barriers to the construction of good theory about homosexuality and, more optimistically, the work of some analysts who have questioned the prevailing attitude to homosexuality is reviewed.",

      "title": "Couple Relationships and Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "The importance of close relationships as a system of support for individuals with eating disorders cannot be overstated. As well as the family of origin, romantic relationships can provide a close connection and a source of comfort and support to deter from eating-related distress and promote recovery. On the other hand, such relationships can add another layer of complexity to the ED picture, and the intimate nature of the couple relationship is unique; thus, it cannot be assumed that support and interventions developed for the family of origin are directly relevant to couple relationships also. For such relationships to facilitate recovery, and to provide appropriate support, the nature of these relationships and partner experiences must be explored and better understood. Existing research is somewhat limited with regard to romantic relationships and EDs, but suggests that people with EDs experience low level of satisfaction in romantic relationships, and this is associated with ED symptomatology, perhaps bidirectionally. People with EDs also report high levels of insecurity in their relationships. Furthermore, the ED impacts upon sexual relationships, including libido, and the anticipation of a partner's physical expectations can drive ED behaviors. Studies examining experiences of the partner who does not have an ED highlight distress, and a sense of helplessness and powerlessness. There is a reported desire to help their loved one, but a need for more external support. Positive emotions such as responsibility and gratitude for being able to help are also noted. The importance of supporting recovery via the couple relationship as well as supporting those within the couple relationship is clear, including consideration of unique factors inherent in romantic and couple relationships, and necessitating a different approach from those provided with other family members. Research into couples-based treatments for specific EDs, such as UCAN for AN and UNITE-BED for binge eating, has emerged over the last decade and shown early signs of efficacy. Further work is required to demonstrate the impact of such approaches and refine these therapeutic programs. This should include consideration of greater diversity in relationships, including sexuality, gender, ethnicity, and culture.",

      "abstract": "The facial disfigurement of women, whether through deliberate mutilation, accidental injury or the ravages of disease, was and still is a subject that evokes strong reactions, both positive (sympathy for the victim, attempts at rehabilitation and/or reconstruction of the damaged features, psychological counselling) and negative (shock or repulsion at the appearance of the victim, the passing of judgement or calculation of fault that led to the disfigurement, her rejection from the community). Whilst men, too, might suffer traumatic facial damage, the gendered assumption that a woman valued and was valued for her beauty (regardless of the number of onlookers permitted to see her face) was and still is a strong element in the habitus of many communities. Our evolution as human beings has led us to scrutinise the face before all other features, to determine community membership (is s/he one of us?), recognition (who is s/he?), likely reception (is s/he friendly?) and subjective value (is s/he pleasing to the eye?). Any disruption of the facial features confuses such signals, and may even send out misleading ones to the viewer (for example, if features are missing, or paralysis or disease limits facial expressions). The equation of beauty with good and ugliness with evil is a powerful idea.",

Although manifested quite differently in their level of enthusiasm, children in the roles of Developing and Non-motivated have highly noticeable affective responses when seeking information. Developing Searchers are notably enthusiastic when searching, and are eager simply to be using the computer. More negative emotions, ranging from dislike of searching to uncertainty, place a child more firmly into the role of Non-motivated. While this dichotomy of emotions toward search itself is apparent for the roles of Developing and Non-motivated, there are numerous other emotions occurring during searching that do not associate to roles, with the exception of frustration. Frustration with perceived search failure is notably higher for children in the sub-role of Distracted than for children in other roles.",

According to Webster, “It is the scientific study of crime as a social phenomena or criminals and their mental traits, habits, discipline etc.” It is the science of criminal behaviour. Now, What leads to criminal activity in society? Is it a nature or nurture? Certain factors of causation of crimes are Poverty, Peer Pressure, Drug abuse, Politics, Religion differences, Unemployment, Unfair Justice System etc. But there are two main factors affecting criminal behaviour in society :-Environmental Factor :- It means the kind of people with whom he or she is surrounded with. It may include abused childhood, alcoholic parents, bullying in schools and colleges, use of abusive language, stress, domestic violence, Drug or substance abuse, traumatisation and harassment. Biological Factor :- Is someone born to be a criminal ? Dr Adrian Raine conducted a research upon violent criminals and wrote a book “Anatomy of Violence”. When a woman consumes alcohol or substance abuse during her pregnancy, it will affect the mind of an unborn child, there will be hormonal imbalance or syndrome and the brain will not develop completely. The “Pre-Frontal Cortex” is a Guardian Angel of behaviour. Criminals who have poor functioning of pre-frontal cortex, they commit crimes in a fit of rage. Criminals who have high functioning of pre-frontal cortex, they commit crimes with methodical process.The “Amygdala” is a Seat of Emotions. It control emotions such as empathy , remorse , conscience etc. Brain scans revealed that psychopathy in criminals was associated with poor connectivity between weak Amygdala and strong pre-frontal cortex. Some criminals have low resting heart-rate due to which, they have lack of fear while committing a crime.Therefore, the causes of psychopathy remains a mystery.",

However, rigidly projecting vulnerability into the other leaves these couples in a bind that bonds them to one another unconsciously. If they disavow their vulnerability, they will feel chronically disconnected from the other. If they reclaim it, they have to face the profound grief and loss of a childhood that never was. As both members of the couple are in this unconscious bind, it is suggested that they form a shared defence; an internalised destructive couple, akin to Rosenfeld’s mafia/gang in the individual. In doing so, they unconsciously cling to a protective, defensive position in relation to one another and, sometimes, to the treatment. An elaborated case example illustrates how such a powerful shared defence can lead to a negative therapeutic reaction halting the progress of the treatment.",

However, different types of relationships may present specific challenges to obtaining and maintaining consent. In monogamous relationships, based on the assumption that two partners are exclusive and faithful to each other, clarity and open communication about desires, boundaries, and agreements are crucial to ensuring consent. It refers to mutual agreement and respect for the partner's wishes regarding intimacy and sexual interactions. However, this assumption may not always be clear or agreed upon by both parties. In non-monogamous relationships, operating on the premise that one or both partners may have multiple romantic or sexual relationships with other people, consent becomes even more complex because it involves multiple people and varied dynamics. Open communication is essential to clarify and reinforce the agreements and wishes of all parties involved. Respect for the boundaries and needs of each individual becomes fundamental in ensuring consent in such relationships. Regardless of the type of relationship, consent requires transparency, mutual respect, and clear and explicit agreement between all involved. It is an ongoing process that requires open and honest communication to ensure mutual understanding and respect.",

      "abstract": "Romantic love is a psychobehavioral motivational state that facilitates pair-bonding in humans. Evolutionarily, it is thought to help establish and maintain long-term pair-bonds that enhance a heterosexual couple’s reproductive fitness. Romantic love can also occur in same-sex partnerships, yet not much is known, either psychologically or behaviorally, about the similarities or differences in how romantic love manifests in homosexual or bisexual couples compared with heterosexual couples. This study investigated romantic love in a cross-cultural sample of heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual young adults (N = 783) experiencing romantic love. We analyzed differences between sexual orientation groups on six variables pertaining to different aspects of romantic love. These variables included number of times ever in love; the timing of falling in love relative to starting a romantic relationship; intensity of romantic love; obsessive thinking about a loved one; commitment; and frequency of sex per week. Homosexual females reported a significantly lower frequency of sex per week than heterosexual and bisexual females. Bisexual males reported a greater number of times ever in love than heterosexual males. Other variables revealed small or very small differences between sexual orientation groups. This study provides initial findings indicating that romantic love manifests in somewhat different ways across sexual orientation groups.",

The case of si-nais (housewives) in Hong Kong shows that we can never assume that married women (or any social category) are privileged by virtue of their status on the sexual hierarchy. The blessings of social respectability apparently enjoyed by these women may work to enable or hinder women's expression of their erotic desires and sexual fulfillment, depending on their special social circumstances. These women's imagination and experience of good sex is composed of a multitude of components. Women may feel good because they can achieve other psychological and social aims that are important in their lives (which could be related to the maintenance of marriage or the peace of the family). Women may feel good because of the erotic satisfaction that they derive from different pursuits including interests, leisure or other intimate relationships, rather than sexual fulfillment in terms of orgasm or physical pleasure. Women may reformulate their pleasures variously at different stages of their lives. Social respectability, orgasm, emotional intimacy, or any other specific element, may all enter or leave the formula for good sex.",

Drawing on previous research, it illustrates that sex offenders with an antisocial personality are a heterogeneous group, differentiated by several factors. They victimise children, adults or both, those who victimise adults or adults and children are more psychopathic. They are motivated primarily by non‐sexual factors like opportunistic impulsivity or generalised anger, and violence is a source of erotic pleasure in some cases. A small group of men, however, are driven to offend by sadistic sexual fantasies of a serious nature, which develop over time and later form the basis of their violent predatory assaults. Varying definitions of antisocial personality confuse the research, and diagnostic co‐morbidity means that pure psychopathic types are probably rare.",

Apart from studies of the biological determinants of perimenopausal symptoms, they have also examined the contribution of various psychosocial factors in their occurrence and severity. Although menopausal symptoms are primarily considered to be a result of the sometimes intense hormonal fluctuations that are experienced during perimenopause, this does not necessarily exclude the role of psychosocial factors such as demographic characteristics, cultural or ethnic background, attitudes toward menopause, specific lifestyles and habits, specific previous life experiences and personality traits. A review of recent research findings and contributions of these psychosocial factors in the development of perimenopausal symptoms engaged will be presented in this work. Studies have clearly shown that certain psychosocial factors contribute to the occurrence and severity of symptoms or increased risk for perimenopausal symptoms, including the risk for major disturbances, such as clinical depression.",

      "abstract": "In an ordinary interaction, communicants have various, mostly unconscious goals which reflect their interactional, social and personal needs. In these interactions, people’s minds try to find a balance between reaching these goals and consuming cognitive energy. If a speaker puts too little effort into speech production, she risks not achieving her communicative goals. This is especially typical when the atmosphere is relaxed, a good example of which is family discourse. An analysis of recorded conversations shows that there are certain regular manifestations of risk-taking in family discourse, such as expressing immature thoughts, raising a large variety of topics and overguessing. A substantial amount of risk-taking in family discourse is in one way or another connected with false confidence in the interlocutors’ common ground. Family members know each other well, which results in an overestimation of the similarity of their understanding of words and objects. This attitude leads them to use cryptic, hard-to-comprehend speech. Quick, everyday interactions are mostly automated, and the speakers do not recognise that their speech is full of implicitness and underdeterminacy.",

It explores how these seemingly gender-free dynamics become linked to masculinity. The chapter suggests that national or religious ethnicity or peoplehood can be psychodynamically experienced as cultural selfhood and that, as such, threats to it are experienced directly as threats to the self. It argues that the psychic fault-lines of masculinity and male selfhood express two developmental and fantasy components: These are maleness as not-female, the male self as defensively separate and warding off the other, defensively needing to split self from other if hate takes over, and maleness as adult man rather than boy-child, not humiliated, shamed, or defeated by another man. The worst male violence may occur when fantasies of humiliation by men become linked with fears of feminization and loss of selfhood.",

Yet in his often-quoted statement, he admitted he was at a loss when it came to understanding what women want. Freud is not alone: a great many men are perplexed by women’s behavior. They often find it contradictory, frustrating, and incomprehensible. One of the reasons for men’s confusion is their failure to recognize the distinction between emotional and material investment. Most women want men who are loving and tender with them but they also want men who are winners. This desire for both types of investment often causes them to behave in ways that men find baffling. For example, women tend to want more cuddling and tender shows of affection than men do, and women’s complaints about men in this respect are perennial. But at times many women also want their male partners to act passionately, lustfully, and masterfully. A woman can alternate between wanting to cuddle and nurture the man, wanting the man to cuddle and nurture her, and wanting him to act as though he were ravishing her. And all of these alternations can occur in one encounter. The same alternations can occur in verbal transactions. Sometimes a woman wants a man to be sensitive, considerate, and compliant. Other times she may want him to take a stand and argue with her.",

In reviewing the literature on this issue, the authors found that Hispanics are younger, poorer, and less educated than the average American; have an average unemployment rate; are heterogeneous in aspects such as race/genetics, health care access/utilization, acculturation, and legal status; differ in risk of some mental illnesses and in risky behaviors according to birthplace/acculturation; are at increasing risk of behaviors and health issues that complicate mental illness and its treatment, such as obesity, diabetes, and sedentary lifestyle; have less access to health and mental health care and receive less care and lower-quality care; tend to receive mental health care in primary care settings, often face linguistic barriers, and are more likely not to have mental disorders detected; seem less likely to suffer from depression and anxiety but tend to have more persistent mental illnesses; are more likely to somatize distress and to report psychotic symptoms in the absence of a formal thought disorder; do not appear to differ from Caucasians in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics; seem to have lower medication adherence, which could be a function of socioeconomic and linguistic or educational factors; seem to respond well to adapted psychotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions and receive significant additional benefit from supplemental services such as case management, collaborative care, and quality improvement interventions.",

The same applies to the parents and relatives of patients, and to professional associates. The large majority are, so that any rare exceptions appear almost incredible. In this respect interviews with doctors and other health workers differ from those with lawyers and the police where the veracity and goodwill of the client is not automatically taken for granted. Downright deliberate dishonesty or premeditated manipulation of truth on the part of patients, their relatives, and people caring for them may be construed as reflecting some personality or psychiatric disorder. Milder forms and shades of “near truth”, “selected truth”, “graduated truth”, “white lies”, “exaggerated facts”, and data chosen for maximum impact, are more frequent and are probably not always suspected or detected. In all communications between people, degrees of licence and flexibility are found, and are institutionalised in different societies and cultures. For example, it has been good manners in Britain not to be too outspoken or blunt, and to use understatement. This is reminiscent of Voltaire's “Speech was given to man to conceal his thoughts.” The term “graduated truth” is used in medical work when it is thought to be in the interests of the patient to deliberately and knowingly conceal or modify the truth. This paper considers some facets of services for mentally handicapped people where “graduated truth” is used in practice. These are: selectivity of data; differential behaviour; fabrication, fantasy and make‐believe; and patient management.",

      "title": "The development of aggressive behaviour during childhood: What have we learned in the past century?",
      "abstract": "Research on human aggression has been a flourishing industry in the 20th century. As the attention shifted from an instinctual paradigm to a drive paradigm and a social learning paradigm, what have we learned on the development of aggressive behaviour during childhood? Are children born with an aggressive instinct or do they have to learn to aggress?This question has deep philosophical roots, but it also has important practical implications. Should interventions prevent children from learning to aggress or should they help children learn to inhibit aggressive reactions? Since most of the 20th century work on the development of aggression was concentrated on adolescents and elementary school age children, there appeared to be an implicit assumption that aggression is learned during these developmental periods. It is argued that to understand the origins of aggressive behaviour and prevent chronic cases of physical aggression we will need to focus on the development of aggressive behaviour during the first few years after birth, and differentiate among forms of aggressive behaviour. The form of agressive behaviour that is generally considered more “serious” or “socially unacceptable” (physical aggression) is clearly ontogenetically antecedent to less “serious” forms of aggressive behaviour, such as verbal aggression or indirect aggression. Furthermore, as a rule the frequency of physical aggression appears to decrease with age. However, infants’ physical aggression has generally not been considered developmentally significant. This is probably because of “the weakness of their limbs” and the apparent lack of “intentionality”. To have a relatively complete description of the life-span developmental trajectories of human aggressive behaviour by the end of the 21st century, we will need to start recruiting pregnant women very soon.",

Many of these appear to be illness roles. Since anthropologists and historians have long made a point of addressing the functions such illnesses serve, their study can help to illustrate how people use illness behavior. Several themes emerge with respect to these disorders. First, enactments of culture-bound syndromes are used to obtain attention and care that would otherwise not be forthcoming. They are also used to seek redress for grievances that cannot be stated directly. They may also serve as a ticket to membership in groups. Enactments of culture-bound syndromes may be used to excuse misbehavior or to gain relief from work and other burdens, and some­ times they are used to allow the patient to harm other people. Consistent with these functions, culture-bound syndromes are generally enacted by those who lack power to meet their needs more directly and by those who are not allowed to directly express their anger, hostility, or frustration, whether because of their station or because their society is decorous and strict.",

      "title": "Core and Surface Characteristics for the Description and Theory of Personality Differences and Development",
      "abstract": "Individual differences in personality are often described on the basis of a small set of dimensional core characteristics that are commonly defined as largely consistent patterns of thoughts, feelings and actions across time and situations. Some theoretical approaches even consider them to provide the biologically founded basis for individual differences in so–called surface characteristics such as self–related evaluations, social attitudes, values, goals or interests, which are commonly hypothesized to be less stable or more environmentally malleable than core characteristics. We examine these hypotheses by reviewing findings about potential core and surface characteristics on the basis of four criteria: (i) level of stability in individual differences; (ii) level of heritability; (iii) direction of causation; and (iv) shared genetic variance. The results from our review call into serious question the labelling of some sets of constructs as either core or surface characteristics of personality. Although certain dimensions—often labelled as basic traits (e.g. extraversion)—are systematically linked to more specific characteristics (e.g. social attitudes and interests), the so–called basic traits do not appear to provide an essential basis (i.e. the more stable and genetically anchored source) for these characteristics. We argue for more integrative models of personality in adulthood. Copyright © 2014 European Association of Personality Psychology",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is a natural psychoactive chemical found in beverages made from coffee. In addition, it is added by the manufacturers of a large number of sodas and energy drinks. It does this by stimulating both the brain and the central nervous system, enabling you to avoid being sleepy while still keeping you attentive. A state of emotional or physical tension is defined as stress. It can be induced through the experience of something or thinking of something that causes you to feel uncomfortable, irritated, or nervous. Your body's response to adversity or demand is what we call stress. Among couples, male infertility is common. A failure in spermatogenesis is accountable for nearly half of all occurrences of infertility in marriage. Ageing, psychological stress, diet, physical exercise, coffee, hot water, hot scrotum, and cell phone usage are some of the few modifiable lifestyle variables that have a role in the development of infertility. Many hypotheses have been proposed to establish the link between stress in the workplace, life events (war, earthquake, etc.), and inability to conceive have been linked to inferior or degraded semen quality. In this review, we will discuss the effect on male fertility of elements including quality of life (such as exercise, diet, and other alterations to one's daily routine) and psychological stress. In addition, the effects on male fertility of elevated scrotal temperature, improper dietary habits, and physical inactivity will be discussed. The loss in male fertility, mainly due to ageing, inappropriate lifestyles, and environmental factors, is a significant public health concern in this century. Couples can enhance their quality of life and increase their chances of naturally conceiving a child by altering their way of life and supplementing it with nutraceutical antioxidants and an organised educational, environmental, dietary, and physical exercise program.",

Sibling status was defined in terms of four groups: only, firstmiddle-, and lasthorns. First-borns scored significantly higher in self-esteem than last-borns; only and middle-borns did not score differently from any nf the other groups. Only children exhibited a stronger internal locus of control and scored higher on the self-centeredness item than other groups. No relationship was found between sibling status and loneliness. In terms of achievement, firstand middle-borns scored more competitively than last-borns. Only and first-borns had higher aspirations than later-horns. No sibling status effects were found in the areas of mastery, willingness to work, or personal concern about the costs of achievement. Results suggest that the impact of gender and family size on these sibling status effects are areas in need of further assessment.

So they aspire to character attributes rather giving rise to problems in relationships than preventing them. Pretentions to the quality of partnerships in the clinical sample are higher than in normal population. Women in the clinical sample aspire to the former social roles of men which causes dispositions of struggles of power. Depressive characteristics of anancastic men are judged as reliability and seriousness by the women whereas men want women to be hysteric, charming, kind, and fond of life so that men dislike women's depressivity.

      "title": "The Personal Name Problem and a Data Mining Solution",
      "abstract": "Almost every person has a life-long personal name which is officially recognised and has only one correct version in their language. Each personal name typically has two components/parts: a first name (also known as given, fore, or Christian name) and a last name (also known as family name or surname). Both these name components are strongly influenced by cultural, economic, historical, political, and social backgrounds. In most cases, each of these two components can have more than a single word and the first name is usually gender-specific. (see Figure 1). There are three important practical considerations for personal name analysis: • Balance between manual checking and analytical computing. Intuitively, a small proportion of names should be manually reviewed, the result has to be reasonably accurate, and each personal name should not take too long to be processed. • Reliability of the verification data has to be examined. By keeping the name verification database’s updating process separate from incoming names, it can prevent possible data manipulation/corruption over time. However, the incompatibility of names in databases can also be caused by genuine reasons as such as cultural and historical traditions, translation and transliteration, reporting and recording variations, and typographical and phonetic errors (Borgman and Siegfried, 1992).",

The label homo phobia is commonly used by supporters of the right to be gay (homophiles) to describe any condemnation of homosexual activity, especially when it takes the form of verbal or physical ‘gay bashing’. A phobia is an intense, irrational fear, a pathological reaction supposedly engendered by intra-psychic conflict. To regard everyone who considers homosexual practice immoral or socially undesirable, as suffering from a ‘phobia’ is scarcely sensible, although some theorists, supported by little evidence, suggest that all opponents of homosexuality are reacting against their own suppressed homosexual tendencies.",

There are also difficulties in distinguishing sibling rivalry and sibling violence. A large number of research shows high prevalence rates of sibling violence. Despite the fact that sibling violence has been documented as the most common form of intrafamilial violence, it has been largely overlooked in comparison to other forms of intrafamilial violence. There is a small number of data on sibling violence in Croatia and little attention is paid to this phenomenon. Sibling violence can lead to many negative short-term and long-term consequences such as depression, anxiety, lower levels of self-esteem and posttraumatic stress disorder.

      "abstract": "Psychological, clinical and neurobiological findings endorse that empathic abilities are more developed in women than in men. Because there is growing evidence that yawn contagion is an empathy-based phenomenon, we expect that the female bias in the empathic abilities reflects on a gender skew in the responsiveness to others' yawns. We verified this assumption by applying a linear model on a dataset gathered during a 5 year period of naturalistic observations on humans. Gender, age and social bond were included in the analysis as fixed factors. The social bond and the receiver's gender remained in the best model. The rates of contagion were significantly lower between acquaintances than between friends and family members, and significantly higher in women than in men. These results not only confirm that yawn contagion is sensitive to social closeness, but also that the phenomenon is affected by the same gender bias affecting empathy. The sex skew, also found in other non-human species, fits with the female social roles which are likely to require higher empathic abilities (e.g. parental care, group cohesion maintenance, social mediation). The fact that female influence in social dynamics also relies on face-to-face emotional exchange raises concerns on the negative repercussions of having women's facial expressions forcibly concealed.",

But if downplayed, responsible adults may fail to provide disabled young people with proper sex education and with information that will allow them to avoid undue risks or with permission to enter into relationships safely. They may also fail to give disabled children and young people information about how to report any sexual behaviours that are coercive or disrespectful, using the same channels as other young people.",

Singles, LATs, cohabitants or marrieds? Older people themselves or those in their surroundings, such as children, relatives or the generalized other? Attitudes are likely to depend on who the persons holding the attitudes are and what their experiences are. Finally, the chapter uses Swedish data to update and fill in some of the gaps in previous research. By not focusing solely on marriage it shows that older people’s interest in repartnering is likely higher than what has been proposed before.",

      "abstract": "Four males with idiopathic sexual precocity and 14 males with sexual precocity secondary to virilizing adrenal hyperplasia were seen in a longitudinal study of psychosexual development for up to 18 years. The distinguishing psychological traits of sexual precocity in the male so far uncovered are: a tendency to high IQ, as previously reported by Money and Lewis (17) and Money and Meredith (18); increased energy expenditure, especially in infancy; a possible increased incidence (by no means universal) of behavior tantrums and impulsive anger; early occurrence of the capacity for frankly sexual imagery in dreams and daydreams, its content, however, determined by cognitional experience; and early establishment of the capacity for erotic and sexual arousal in relation to visual imagery and visual perception as well as tactile sensation. It is possible, though not proven, that by influencing development of central nervous system pathways in utero, or by a triggering mechanism later in pubertal childhood, androgen may be responsible for these various traits. The psychological maturation of males with physical sexual precocity otherwise keeps in step with that of boys of the same chronological and/or social age. Accelerated social maturation may be deliberately fostered in order to bridge the gap between chronological age and physique age.",

      "abstract": "Einleitung Loneliness is considered one of the most important risk factors for depression. Socio-cognitive models of loneliness assume that loneliness is related to the risk of depression through cognitive biases in all stages of information processing. As a result, lonely people tend to engage in behaviours that elicit negative responses in others that confirm and reinforce these cognitive biases, which are thought to set off a cascade of behavioural, affective, and biological processes that increase the risk of depression. Other explanations, such as the stress generation in depression thesis, emphasize the importance of health selection. It is hypothesized that either depressive symptoms themselves (e.g., anhedonia, deficits in social cognition and cognitive function) or depressogenic factors (e.g., genetic factors, neuroticism, attachment styles) lead to impaired social functioning that may increase the risk of loneliness. Thus, although previous research has demonstrated a strong link between loneliness and depression, the exact causal nature of this relationship is still critically debated. This study is the first to investigate the effect of loneliness on depressive symptoms by accounting for both forms of health selection.",

I reject the solution that friendship is simply a preferred indifferent instead of a good and argue that though Seneca’s account can consistently explain both why friendship’s nature as a good does not threaten the completeness or the self-sufficiency of the sage, Stoic friends must choose between intimate friendships that leave them vulnerable or impersonal friendships that lack intimacy but do not undermine their happiness. The consistent Stoic must choose the latter, but I argue that this conflict shows why we ought to reject the Stoic model of friendship.",

      "abstract": "VAWnet is a project of the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence. “The relationship between substance abuse (SA) and intimate partner violence (IPV) is complex and should not be reduced to ideas about one causing the other. Many theoretical perspectives explain the co-occurrence of SA and IPV including: substance use disruption of thinking processes; adverse childhood experiences; power motivation; during the process of obtaining and using substances; and co-occurring situations like hostile personalities, antisocial personality disorder, or poverty; however none of these theories account for all the co-occurrence of SA and IPV to indicate that SA causes IPV.” Substance abuse (SA) and intimate partner violence (IPV) are closely associated in the public mind. Many people believe that men’s abuse of drugs or alcohol is a primary reason for their battering. Others think that SA may increase the risk for IPV, but is not a direct cause of IPV. Still others believe SA and IPV are separate issues, which only appear to be related due to other factors. In fact, both SA and IPV have many causes and many effects, and their apparent correlation applies to only a sub-group of batterers and victims (Testa, 2004). For some men who batter, SA may increase the frequency or severity of their violence. For other men, SA and IPV are separate issues whose apparently high rate of co-occurrence may stem from shared pre-conditions such as antisocial personality (Fals-Stewart, Leonard & Birchler, 2005) or from a belief that when they get drunk or high, they are going to be violent (Field, Caetano, & Nelson, 2004). Finally, for some men, both substance abuse and IPV may be manifestations of an underlying need for power and control related to gender-based distortions and insecurities (Gondolf, 1995).",

      "abstract": "Intergroup aggression (e.g., political demonstrations or sports fan violence) often involves some degree of interpersonal motoric or vocal synchrony, namely choral chanting of slogans, choir singing of pre-learned songs, choral motor gestures or choral rhythmic jumping. At the same time, these activities exhibit the features of rigidity, repetition and redundancy, which we usually use as defining observable signs of religious or secular ritual behavior. On the one hand, it is obvious that not all participants take direct violent action. On the other hand, they do little to stop these acts. One explanation could be that those people are afraid of their own harm, whether physical injury or loss of social capital. However, it is possible that this is not the whole story. Previous studies suggested that synchrony is one of the factors facilitating aggression by increasing the tendency of people to help their synchrony partners, even in case of aggressive behavior. However, the effects of synchronization on the perception and judgement of such behavior remain to be explored. We suggest that moral hypocrisy of the spectators (i.e., tendency to judge the same transgression less harshly when committed by myself than by others), resulting from being in synchrony with the perpetrators, contributes to the explanation of their inaction and as such constitutes a main component of the group behavior that we need to fully understand. We designed an experimental study using the social intuitionist model of moral judgement which sees moral judgement as largely based on intuition and social environment. Building on previous research which suggests that people judge the same moral transgression as less immoral when the offender is an in-group member, we predicted that participants will judge transgression of their synchrony partners less harshly than participants in asynchrony and control conditions.",

The child victim of sexual abuse, may be initially seen with specific or nonspecific signs and symptoms of the abuse. Moreover, these manifestations may be physical ailments directly referable to the injury, or, more commonly, they may represent symbolic behavioral manifestations of the injury.

Furthermore, racial identity's role as a protective factor in the context of internalized racism remains unclear. This study examined the longitudinal impact of internalized racism on psychological distress (depressive and anxiety symptoms) and the moderating role of racial identity beliefs among 171 African American emerging adults. Full cross-lagged panel models revealed no main effects of internalized racism beliefs on psychological distress. However, several racial identity beliefs moderated the relationship between internalized racism beliefs and changes in psychological distress over a year later. Initial levels of alteration of physical appearance, internalization of negative stereotypes, and hair change internalized racism beliefs were related to subsequent psychological distress, but only for those with certain levels of racial centrality, private regard, public regard, and assimilationist, humanist, and nationalist ideology beliefs. These findings suggest that, over time, internalized racism and racial identity beliefs can combine to influence the psychological well-being of African American emerging adults.",

      "abstract": "Author(s): Sobraske, Katherine Nichole | Advisor(s): Gaulin, Steven JC | Abstract: The study of jealousy from an adaptationist perspective is dominated by the hypothesis that 1) relationship threats are either or in nature, and 2) there are sex differences in response to these threats. While there is considerable support for sex differences in response to researcher-created stimuli, the notion that people spontaneously conceive of threats as either or threats is untested. Using an unobtrusive, mixed-methods design, I mapped the cognitive space of jealousy. Contrary to conventional supposition, the sexual-emotional distinction is not a primary means of threat organization; instead, threats are organized by 1) their severity, 2) the presence of a specific rival versus a partner's disinterest, and 3) a partner's deceptive actions versus their honesty. A sexual-emotional distinction, if present, is not among the principle means of threat organization. In addition to the analysis of an aggregate population, I also provide analysis of several comparison subpopulations. Because jealousy is an adaptive response to a (suspected) loss to a romantic rival, a facultative response should account for the traits of rivals in the local mating environment. Using the same unobtrusive, mixed-methods design as the study described above, I evaluated the prediction that jealousy responds facultatively. Specifically, men with many attractive -- and, therefore, threatening -- rivals are more attentive to their partners' deceptive actions and to their partner's intentions to stay or leave the mateship. Women with many sexually-accessible -- and, therefore, threatening -- rivals are more attentive to their partners' deceptive actions. To avoid the costs of a mate's infidelity, is predicted to rank highly among a suite of reproductive success-enhancing traits. Specifically, I predicted that men would highly value sexual and women would highly value emotional fidelity. I evaluated community and university members' responses to a zero-sum allocation task using various quantitative statistics. My predictions were largely supported: Both community and university men highly valued fidelity in a mate. Additional analysis revealed university men were an adequate proxy for community men vis-a-vis mate preferences. Data from community women supported the prediction by highly valuing fidelity in a mate. Conversely, university women most valued fidelity; they least-valued cues of resource acquisition, counter to standard selection logic and multiple previous studies of university women. This suggested the presence of an uncommon mate market affecting university women's preferences. To describe how an uncommon mate market affected university women's preferences, I conducted long-form, semi-structured interviews, analyzed with framework analysis. The prime mover of university women's mate preferences appears to be the demography and geography of Isla Vista, affecting women's intrasexual competitive tactics and men's responses to them. In this mate market, women find themselves in the uncommon position of being able to use a man's fidelity -- typically a noisy signal -- as an honest signal of his devotion to the mateship.",

      "abstract": "Research shows that racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression permeate the medical field on structural and individual levels, subjecting marginalized patients and health care workers alike to subhuman treatment. This treatment manifests through conspicuous disparities in access to and quality of healthcare for patients entering the medical sphere. Regarding those who operate within it, healthcare workers are faced with disparities in representation, especially as one progresses up the hierarchy of leadership, in addition to facing perpetual risk of being discriminated against by both colleagues exhibiting prejudice and potential incoming sources of prejudice: patients. All marginalized peoples within and outside the realm of medicine are subjugated at the unjust hands of bigotry and this treatment is correlated to heightened levels of mental distress and/or disorder and lower social mobility. Medicine is often regarded as a pillar of reason and knowledge given its supposed total allegiance to scientific principles but the concurrent presence of utterly illogical, discriminatory beliefs and according behaviors that infiltrate its plane nullifies such a proposition. This text explores the existence of marginalization in medicine and offers solutions for contending it through which equity for all is attainable.",

In other areas, particularly those where privately sponsored services prevail, for example, medical work, child guidance, family casework, recreational services, et al, workers operate with a genuine sense of to society as well as to the individual or the group. However, this sense of for the most part arises out of their general professional orientation rather than clearly spelled out or legally established policy. The term social therefore is one which carries a variety of professional connotations. All American workers probably would agree that there can be no profession of any kind without responsibility. Their definitions of the term responsibility, however, might vary from a general sense of obligation to the client to a clear-cut type of accountability to higher authority. Such higher authority might be seen not only within the agency or program in which the worker operates, but in the wider and less personal authority of society itself.

      "abstract": "1. This paper has dealt with the definition of the term sexual psychopath (and suggested alternatives), with special reference to the difficulties that have been encountered in applying it for legal purposes. 2. The range of psychiatric opinion as to the definition and possible applications of the term is so broad and the relevant scientific data and formulations so tentative, that the term is nearly meaningless for diagnostic purposes. 3. The term sexual psychopath is used by psychiatrists not as a specific diagnostic label, but as a descriptive term necessary for administrative purposes. Social maladjustment in the sexual sphere is the main criterion for application of the term. 4. Therefore, until psychiatric nomenclature is further refined, it is important that tentative, clinically useful terminology relating to sexual personality pattern disorders not be forced into legal statutes as final and definitive. 5. There is a distinction between psychiatric and legal concepts and definitions f sexual abnormality. While psychiatry is concerned with the entire range of sexual behavior as clinical phenomena, either overt behavior or latent or repressed tendencies, the law is concerned only with sexual behavior that is dangerous or morally offensive. 6. Legal definitions of sexual psychopath make use of both psychiatric and legal terms but these terms are not themselves specific enough to justify their use in legal finding. 7. The sexual psychopath laws, based on inexact psychiatric terminology, have proved to be as ineffective administratively as the criminal sex laws. 8. Efforts to correct current unsatisfactory sex legislation take 2 main forms: (a) clarification of definitions in present laws, and (b) formulation of new legislation that will provide psychiatric consultation but will not depend for its application upon precise diagnosis. 9. Even though psychiatric concepts and definitions in the area of antisocial sexual behavior are still in the formative stage, psychiatric consultative services appear to offer the most fruitful approach to the problem of the sex offender.",

      "abstract": "▪ Abstract There is little consensus about the meaning of the terms “health disparities,” “health inequalities,” or “health equity.” The definitions can have important practical consequences, determining the measurements that are monitored by governments and international agencies and the activities that will be supported by resources earmarked to address health disparities/inequalities or health equity. This paper aims to clarify the concepts of health disparities/inequalities (used interchangeably here) and health equity, focusing on the implications of different definitions for measurement and hence for accountability. Health disparities/inequalities do not refer to all differences in health. A health disparity/inequality is a particular type of difference in health (or in the most important influences on health that could potentially be shaped by policies); it is a difference in which disadvantaged social groups—such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women, or other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination—systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups. (“Social advantage” refers to one's relative position in a social hierarchy determined by wealth, power, and/or prestige.) Health disparities/inequalities include differences between the most advantaged group in a given category—e.g., the wealthiest, the most powerful racial/ethnic group—and all others, not only between the best- and worst-off groups. Pursuing health equity means pursuing the elimination of such health disparities/inequalities.",

      "title": "The Politics of the Psychology of Prejudice",
      "abstract": "Social psychologists have identified a number of individual difference predictors of prejudice, including political conservatism, lower cognitive ability, psychological rigidity, and lower openness to experience and agreeableness. This research has examined prejudice expressed primarily against disadvantaged and low-status groups. In this chapter, I discuss emerging evidence that challenges these conclusions about the individual difference antecedents of prejudice. Specifically, from an ideological conflict model perspective, the link between some (but perhaps not all) individual differences and prejudice has emerged, not because these individual differences predict prejudice per se, but because of value conflicts between adherents to these individual differences and the types of targets groups social psychologists have chosen to study. The association between these individual difference variables and prejudice toward alternative (e.g., high-status, conventional) targets often either reverses direction or is statistically zero. Worldview conflict lies at the heart of prejudice across the political spectrum. Social psychologists who study prejudice often have the well-meaning and admirable goal of reducing prejudice toward historically marginalized groups. However, to understand the psychological processes underlying prejudice, researchers must explore prejudices toward a wider array of targets than they have traditionally.",

      "abstract": "The concept of need is commonly overlooked by philosophers and social scientists. Often considered exclusively instrumental and/or demarcating minimal attainments, needs are commonly allowed only a minor role in accounts of well-being and related moral and political theories. While this may be true of some conceptions of needs, this thesis defends the critical importance of a different kind of need. These ‘personal needs’ fulfil all necessary conditions for genuine needs, but instead mark out ultimate ends that are far from basic. Moreover, rather than representing preconditions for the lives of human beings in general, personal needs are specific to individuals. Yet also unlike subjective preferences and aims, personal needs are the requirements of things a person is objectively committed to and cannot give up. // Personal needs directly relate to a person’s private evaluation of their own life. Yet they also have wide relevance to other contexts of evaluation within and without philosophy. They play a structural role in a new framework for conceptualising well-being and its role in ethics and policy. In particular, personal needs introduce incommensurability into the fundamental structure of persons’ interests. Located in the same context of individual choice as utility theory, they represent a direct, fundamental challenge to formally monistic teleological conceptions of well-being prevailing in much of social science, policy, and philosophy. Among various potential connections, this framework promises to (a) make sense of some people’s claims that they cannot be compensated for certain losses, (b) help motivate the incommensurability claimed to exist between dimensions in multidimensional well-being measurement (including those drawing on the capabilities approach), and (c) inform approaches to interpersonal distribution that oppose aggregation. This thesis also touches on issues concerning the concept of well-being, the objectivity or subjectivity of well-being, axiology, and coherentist practical reason.",

In fact, is a real consent possible?Instead to insist on problems in terms of medical research, one would have to insist perhaps more on the fact that the medical practice in general would have to answer more to ethical grounds and to scientific rules.

      "title": "Suicide, Risk for Suicide, Depression and Alcohol Dependence *",
      "abstract": "Ill-being arises from the multiple interactions involved in a specific tension, that between an individual with social characteristics and the values and norms promoted by the society that individual lives in. The way a person expresses ill-being tends to vary by gen- der: depression and suicidal behavior are more common among women, whereas suicide and alcohol dependence are more common among men. Focusing on a single way of expressing ill-being could therefore lead to misinterpretation of results. While divergences among ways of expressing ill-being expose the specificities of those ways and their differ- entiated effects for particular groups, convergences make it possible to arrive at conclusions that can be generalized to all individuals. Gender-specific indicators have been developed on the basis of recent data that capture major changes in the form of the couple and house- hold types. These indicators can be used to examine whether and to what degree women are protected against ill-being by having an intimate partner and children. These elements are usually determined on the basis of suicide studies alone. Men are more likely to commit suicide than women -sociology offers few such regular observations. The higher suicide rate for men was first found by nineteenth-century studies; it has been found for nearly all countries except China (Baudelot and Establet, 2006). Analysis of gender differences for suicide, timidly begun by Durkheim, is no longer focused on the problem of explaining this fundamental difference between men and women; sociologists have been more concerned to inquire into the antagonism between what the two sexes stand to gain or lose by marriage. Despite his systematically gender-specific analysis of marital status, Durkheim said little about what",

      "title": "Psychiatric Morbidity and Sexual Dysfunction in InfertileWomen.",
      "abstract": "Introduction:\r\nCenturies of misconceptions and myths regarding infertility have\r\nIncreased the problem. Motherhood is of great social significance and\r\nInfertility is perceived as a threat to men’s procreativity and the\r\nContinuity of the lineage. (Jindal et al.1990, Jindal et al.1989, Singh et\r\nAl.1993). Infertility can threaten a woman’s identity, status and economic\r\nSecurity and consequently, be a major source of anxiety leading to\r\nLowered self-esteem and a sense of powerlessness. Although perceptions\r\nOf women’s roles and attitudes may be shifting, particularly in the upper\r\nAnd middle classes, bearing a child still remains an important factor in the\r\nSocio-economic well being of most Indian women (Dasgupta et al.1995).\r\nTherefore if a woman could not have children she is singled out,\r\nOstracised, ridiculed and stigmatised.\r\nInfertility can also result in a strained relationship in the\r\nMarital home. Men tend to hold their wives responsible for infertility and\r\nMany wives tend to blame themselves for childlessness irrespective of\r\nWho may be responsible (Desai et al.1992). In some cases women are\r\nThreatened with another marriage or divorce and many fear abandonment\r\nAnd loss of social and economic security. They could also be victims of\r\nViolence, abuse and social exclusion (Singh et al.1996).Though\r\nChildlessness usually has a negative impact on marriage though some\r\nHusbands are supportive and defend their wives against family pressure or\r\nCriticism (Widge et al. 2001).\r\nWomen go through various treatment-seeking modes to\r\nAvoid the adverse consequences of childlessness. Adoption is not an\r\nAcceptable option for many as women face psychological, familial and\r\nCommunity pressure to produce a biological child (Unisa et al.1999).\r\nCouples seek varied traditional methods and religious practices, including\r\nVisits to temples, abstaining from visiting place where a woman has\r\nDelivered a child, observing various rituals and rites, wearing charms and\r\nVisiting astrologers.\r\nCouples may delay seeking medical advice because of the fear\r\nOf a final definite diagnosis, emotional stress, the physical discomfort of\r\nThe tests they would have to undergo and admitting failure in their efforts\r\nTo conceive. Irrespective of who the infertile person is, it is the woman\r\nWho usually initiates the first contact with a physician. Although most\r\nStudies reveal that male participation in infertility diagnosis and treatment\r\nTends to be limited as infertility is perceived to be a woman’s problem, in\r\nSome contexts, husbands also participate and accept treatment if required\r\n(Unisa et al. 1999).\r\nStigmatising beliefs, limited male participation, cost, indifferent\r\nQuality of care and lack of services in the public sector are major barriers\r\nTo prompt and appropriate treatment seeking. Patterns of treatmentseeking\r\nDepend on the woman/couple’s socio-economic status, decisionmaking\r\nWithin the family, the level of information and accessibility of\r\nTreatment.\r\nThe problem is that infertility affects every aspect of a woman's\r\nLife. It affects their relationship with their husbands because men and\r\nWomen don't respond to infertility in the same way. It affects their sex life\r\nBecause they're told when they can and can't have intercourse. It affects\r\nRelationships with friends and family because everyone else seems to be\r\nGetting pregnant effortlessly. It affects jobs because they have to miss\r\nTons of time for doctor's appointments and procedures. They feel helpless\r\nBecause they're going through all these invasive tests and procedures\r\nWhich hurt. And it costs a ton of money.\r\nInfertility is a life crisis with invisible losses, and its\r\nConsequences are manifold. But given the value Indians have placed on\r\nHaving children infertile couples should receive much more care and\r\nHelped in their quest to complete a family.\r\nSCOPE OF THE STUDY\r\nThe study focussed on psychiatric morbidity and sexual\r\nDysfunctions in infertile women, a common presentation in Gynaecology\r\nOP. The study aims to correlate socio-demographic variables, personality\r\nProfile, duration of infertility, psychological symptoms and to understand\r\nThe relationship of these variables.\r\nPLAN OF THE STUDY\r\nThe present study has been planned as follows:\r\nReview of literature\r\nMethodology\r\nResults and Interpretation\r\nDiscussion\r\nConclusion",

Although scientific progress constantly provides greater potential to forensic investigations, new ethical implications arise from the need to balance the greater efforts towards justice which science allows against the protection of individual human rights. The issue that arises in our case is that a biological sample (and consequently a genetic profile) acquired without the consent and knowledge of the subject might become discrimi natory and stigmatizing for the subjects involved (individuals involved in the life of the victim, but neither suspected of carrying out the crime, nor prosecuted) should the investigative activity enter the public domain. The protection of an individual’s privacy within the context of the investigations goes beyond normal parameters of guarantee, because the risk of placing the identification pr ocess outside the control of the individuals is real. This risk therefore has a social relevance, considering that the investigative process might become discriminating and stigmatizing should the investigation enter the public domain. The safeguarding of privacy rights and the guarantee of society security must not contradict, but rather complement, each other.",

Increased knowledge reduces professionals' doubts about handling these enormously complex cases, and the greater confidence moves these professionals just a little way toward certainty. The behavioral sciences can assist legal professionals in their efforts to determine the validity of a given child sex abuse (CSA) allegation. To provide some information from those fields, the author reviewed the pertinent literature. Some findings emerged: 1) clinicians' judgments about the veridicality of unconfirmed CSA allegations may well lack a firm scientific basis; 2) no psychological test or method reliably indicates whether a child has been sexually mistreated, or whether someone has committed an act of abuse; 3) children do sometimes falsely accuse; 4) the concepts of “memory repression” and “recovered memory” are not scientifically substantiated; 5) medical evaluations are often inadequate to determine the presence or absence of sex abuse; 6) the most reliable indicator of sexual mistreatment is often not the physical examination, but rather the child's own report; 7) certain features of the child's account suggest that the accusation is valid. It is concluded that conducting such interviews is of paramount importance; suggestions are made to improve these interviews' quality.",

      "abstract": "At least 10 per cent of the world's people have a significant, long-term, physical or mental impairment which can and usually does disable them from taking part in the usual educational, social and economic activity in their community. This is due to barriers in attitudes, in the built environment and in the way society is organized, which prevent us from participating on an equal level with others. The reason why most of these barriers exist is because societies have until very recently not recognized that the systematic way in which they discriminate against disabled people, when backed by discriminatory laws and practices of the state, often amounts to oppression. Barnes (1991) gives a full account of the discrimination disabled people encounter in all areas of life. This oppression has developed from our history, from myths and beliefs that attribute characteristics to disabled people which are unrelated to the reality of disabled people's lives. Such collections of attitudes often determine how non-disabled people respond to the 'different' in their midst; how they form stereotypes of the disabled person as saint, sinner, superhero, freak, fiend, victim, obsessive avenger, isolationist, the butt of jokes, just a burden, or someone to be pitied. The particular form of stereotyped thinking depends on the society's history, its explanation of how it has come to be and the resultant culture.",

      "abstract": "Q ^•ettling for second best (or even third or fourth) is something few of us are prepared for in any public way. There are no school or college courses in how fail, or how substitute one set of goals for another when attainment of the first becomes impossible. Although we are told that it is whether one wins or loses, but how one plays the game, we are still exhorted to try and try again. Yet the crisis of failure, or an accommodation diminished expectations, is a common experience. Few of us achieve all that we want and, ultimately, through the trick of biology, there is inevitably too little time do all the things one might have desired, or of which one might have thought himself capable. The social-psychological mechanisms of the management of failure remain an unexplored area, and one could find a dozen reasons in the character of American society account for this particular failure of nerve. But the central question is not why psychology and sociology have failed attend this task, but, rather, the positive use of individual failure in the operation of society as a whole, and especially in the university. In Equality of Educational Opportunity, by James Coleman and others, there is substantial evidence support the structuring of education, at least at the elementary and high school levels, around a school and classroom mix of children of varying academic talents. Coleman's evidence argues against the existence of the track system and other forms of ability discrimination in the schools on the ground that in mixed situations the less academically talented do better and the more academically talented do no worse. Why, in social-psychological terms, those students who are conventionally labelled as less talented perform better in these situations is unclear; but the evidence is that many do perform better and that they come be more like those who appeared originally be more talented.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses identity development in adolescence. Adolescence is the stage of the life cycle that is most crucial in the crystallization of identity. Identity as a concept refers to a collection of traits and personal characteristics. Traits are habitual patterns of behavior, such as honesty/dishonesty, happiness/sadness, or intelligence/stupidity. Personal characteristics include physical attributes, such as height, color of hair and eyes, and condition of skin; and background factors, such as ethnic-group membership and religion. Because identity is so central to psychological functioning, it is important throughout the life cycle. Identity in adolescence is shaped by resolutions of earlier crises and will evolve further in later stages. Infancy and childhood are important because they result in identifications and identity elements that contribute to the resolution of the adolescent crisis of identity. These early stages are preludes to the central normative crisis of identity in adolescence. When an adolescent makes commitments contributing to an adult identity, particularly occupational decisions, before having a chance to experiment freely with possible roles, the sense of identity that results has no proper foundation. Such an identity results from commitment before the experience of an identity crisis has run its course.",

In addition, it seems likely the child's interest in and attitudes toward his peers are functions in part of the relations with his parents that develop out of the triangular interactions of parent, child, and sib. Since the psychological literature has not given the playmate problem much attention in considering the effects siblings have directly and indirectly upon each others' attitudes and interests, we have selected for study the question of the relation between certain characteristics of the associates or playmates of young children from two-child families and the relative age as well as sex of their sibs. Sex differences in playmate patterns were also given some attention. To be more specific, in addition to the sex of the child, the independent variables in the study are the child's ordinal position in his sibship, the age difference which separates him from his sib, and the sex of the latter. The dependent variables are the age and sex of the children",

      "title": "What Factors Moderate Self-Other Discrepancies in Decision Making? Results from a Vaccination Scenario",
      "abstract": "When we make risky decisions for others, we tend to follow social norms about risks. This often results in making different decisions for others than we would make for ourselves in a similar situation (i.e., self-other discrepancies). In an experiment, we investigated self-other discrepancies in young adults' decisions to purchase a vaccine against a sexually-transmitted virus for themselves or for another person (i.e., the target of the decision). When the target's preferences were in line with social norms, surrogates showed large self-other discrepancies in line with these norms. When the target's preferences were contrary to social norms, surrogates did not show self-other discrepancies in line with these preferences; instead they still followed social norms, F(1, 140) = 21.45, p < .001, η p 2 = .13. Surrogates with lower numeracy, F(2, 128) = 3.44, p = .035, η p 2 = .05, and higher empathy, F(2, 128) = 3.72, p = .027, η p 2 = .06, showed self-other discrepancies more in line with the target's preferences, even when these were contrary to the norm. Surrogates whose own risk attitudes were contrary to social norms showed larger self-other discrepancies, F(1, 128) = 5.38, p = .022, η p 2 = .04. These results demonstrate that perceived social norms about risk can predict self-other discrepancies in risky decisions, even when the target's preferences are known and at odds with the social norm. Further, the surrogates' numeracy, empathy, and propensity to take risks influence the extent to which risky decisions for others resemble risky decisions for oneself.",

      "title": "RITUAL CHANGE: S AND A WE TWIN-BIRTH FESTIVALS BEFORE AND AFTER TANZANIA'S VILLAGIZ ATION *",
      "abstract": "Sandawe attitudes towards twins (pasa ) differ markedly from those of some of their Bantu neighbours in that they celebrate the birth of twins with much joy and festivity and never practise infanticide on them, even though the dangers inherent in such births are considered quite serious. The Sandawe welcome twins and honour their mothers by immediately according them the status of female elders (di'sesu) even if they are still very young, no matter if either one or both the infants are still-born or die at birth. Elderhood is normally accorded Sandawe women after giving birth to two children and, although in one sense twin parturition is seen as a single birth, it is also two and, in addition, it is considered proof of great fertility. At the same time the Sandawe are keenly aware of the high risk of mortality, both in respect of twin infants and their mothers; they also genuinely fear supernatural forces associated with twin births, and their manifestations in the form of lightning. This danger not only threatens the twins themselves, but also their parents, other members of the household, and the wider circle of relatives. Since this danger is thought to be most acute at birth, immediate precautions have to be taken but, because twins remain exposed to special lightning dangers throughout their lives, they perform appropriate rituals at least once a year (every growing season) even after they have grown up and become parents themselves. Not to do so would be quite unthinkable. The rites are referred to as either doa or iyari. Doa appears to be their original Sandawe name; iyari is nowadays more commonly used although the word is of Rimi (Bantu) origin. It is also heard as yari or yali, and it is a general term for ritual, although without further specification it usually refers to twin ritual. The word doa is a Sandawe term for 'payment which is made afterwards': if a person asks his neighbours for help in threshing the millet crop, but the beer for their reward is not yet ready, he would say dio i does' 'afterwards I shall pay'. Thus the verb doe means 'to pay later', 'to provide afterwards', or 'to pay what is left in debt'. It is also commonly used for paying off bridewealth debts. Twin-birth rituals are called doa because the birth of twins adds an unexpected debt to the payments to be made to a wife's family, in recognition of the extra fertility which she has provided. The word doa may therefore be literally translated as 'supplementary payment', the rituals incorporating this economic aspect of the re-distribution of wealth which is involved in marriages. For this reason it may be clear that the Sandawe word doa has no connection with the Swahili (Bantu) ndoa , 'marriage', which is derived from the Bantu verb - oa , 'to take a wife'. The foci of these rites are provided by the leba tree, black pots, the child-bed, and sets of twin shields, as well as the accompanying sacrifices. From the literature little is known about the rites. When Professor Kohl-Larsen and his wife visited Sandawe country in June and",

La non-recidive qui est le signe de la desistance ne suffit donc pas pour qu’on puisse parler de resilience car la conformite normative peut etre simplement un abandon adaptatif au meme titre que la delinquance pouvait l’etre. Meme si une delinquance violente peut etre le fruit d’un moi faible, d’une incapacite a tolerer les frustrations ou a controler les ecluses du passe, une grande part de la delinquance repose sur des mecanismes adaptatifs adequats quand bien meme ils sont moralement ou juridiquement inacceptables. Pour que la resilience secondaire se mette en place il nous semble que des mecanismes supplementaires tels que la sublimation ou un sursaut narcissique engendre un investissement d’objet hors soi. Plusieurs cas nous montrent que ces personnes sorties de la toxicomanie ou de carrieres delinquantes plus ou moins severes se sont appuyees sur un etayage narcissique externe ou sur des mecanismes de defense tournes vers la generativite pour entreprendre des actions sociales altruistes ou des activites educatives ou theâtrales qui qualifient la resilience secondaire.",

      "abstract": "Some patients are incapable of engaging in a relationship with a partner on a long‐term basis. To explain these relationship issues, they invoke reasons that have to do with external reality rather than with their own internal reality. The authors present several clinical examples that have given rise to an initial attempt at theorizing the concept of the internal couple: some patients fail to internalize a positive representation in which they can see themselves as part of a couple. Psychoanalysts tend to think of the father and mother (or their internal representatives) as separate entities, differentiated and complementary, and not in terms of a single object that brings them together as an internal couple. In the author's view, an internal parental couple is also internalized by the infant under the guise of various internal objects. The internal parental couple thus appears as a complex construction that goes beyond the mere addition of father plus mother. Underneath their neurotic veneer, these patients have severely damaged representations of internal parents and of the internal parental couple. Unable to identify with a stable and procreative internal parental couple, they tend also to attack the psychoanalytic couple. Early distortions in the oedipal sphere may be one cause of the stumbling‐block they encounter on the way to introjecting a well‐attuned couple‐as‐object and the idea of parenting.",

      "abstract": "The renewed interest by the economic literature in the effect of birth order on children’s outcomes has neglected trust as a long-term output of familial environment. Acknowledging childhood as a crucial stage of life for the formation of social preferences, we go deeper into the early-life determinants of trust, a widely recognized driver of socio-economic success. We analyze if and how differences in the order of birth predict heterogeneous self-reported trust levels in Britain. We draw hypotheses from psychology, economics and sociology, and test alternative explanations to the association between birth order and trust. Relying on an index measuring birth order independently from sibship size, we find a negative and robust effect of birth order, with laterborns trusting less than their older siblings. This effect is not accounted for by personality traits, strength of family ties, risk aversion and parental inputs. It is only partially explained by complementary human-capital outcomes, and it is robust when we use alternative dependent variables and control for endogenous fertility. Multilevel estimates suggest that trust is mostly driven by within- rather than between-family characteristics. The effect of birth order is eclipsed by education outcomes only for women, while it is counterbalanced by mother’s education for the entire sample, thereby leading to relevant policy implications.",

In fact, our desires for bad things often compete with our desires for good things, and the former often overcome the latter. There are bad people – evil ones even. They are bad because their desire to do what's bad almost always wins out over their desire to do what's good. They seek to harm others as a way of benefiting themselves. The most dangerous are those who are very knowledgeable. Smart but evil people are far more effective in harming others than are the ignorant and foolish ones. Even if we focus on good people (people who want to be good and benefit themselves and others), we find that many of them allow their desires for the bad to overwhelm their desires for the good. Weakness of will is a major reason why even good people often do bad things. One of the major problems with the world is that most people usually think about themselves and what is good for them, personally, when they act. The world would be a better place if, rather than focusing on our own self-interest, we were to focus on what is good for others.",

Kin recognition mechanisms include familiarity (learning the characteristics of close associates during immaturity so that animals avoid breeding with those with whom they are reared) and phenotype matching (where phenotypic cues such as odors associated with genes of the “major histocompatibility complex” that reliably vary with kinship are matched to cues learned from the self or close relatives). Such mechanisms allow avoidance of inbreeding with unfamiliar as well as familiar relatives.",

      "title": "Talking to relatives about genetic testing for BRCA1/2 and its risk implications: an on-going discussion",
      "abstract": "Background: Access to genetic cancer risk information can be highly dependent on whether familial risks are discussed within the family. Despite its essential role in ensuring family members have access to genetic services, there are a number of gaps in the knowledge available on people’s experiences regarding talking to their relatives about genetic testing for BRCA1/2 and its risk implications. In particular, research to date has focused far more on with whom and why (motivations) family communication regarding genetic testing occurs, rather than when or how it is occurring. Method: The study is qualitative in nature, employing in-depth interviews and constructing eco-maps as a method of identifying relevant family members and guiding the researcher through the family structure and relationships. These methods were chosen in line with an interpretive description methodology to ensure depth and richness in analysis and reporting of findings. Results: The Key Findings are as follows: 1. Communication between emotionally close relatives is different to communication with emotionally distant relatives; with emotionally close family and friends it is about sharing and supporting; whereas with emotionally distant family it is about gaining and imparting information. 2. A family’s engagement in communication regarding genetic testing is implicitly linked to their experiences of cancer burden, and how openly this is discussed in the family. 3. There is a lack of understanding of risks to men and their offspring based on perceptions of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer being a female disease. 4. Emotionally distant and male relatives are only contacted selectively. Those undergoing genetic testing for BRCA1/2 are not good at identifying all at-risk family members in order to share the implications of the genetic test with them. 5. As far as the family are concerned, members do not have the right to make an informed decision to decline. 6. Plans for telling people in the future, especially children, is a cause of worry and concern for those undergoing testing and needs further support, especially in the longer term. Conclusions: Developing interventions to help manage problems associated with family communication regarding genetic testing for cancer risk should be a top research priority, especially as the numbers of people affected by these issues is set to rise as more genes are discovered. The longitudinal view identified gives deep insight into how and when genetic testing for BRCA1/2 are discussed within these families, allowing future interventions to be targeted where they are most helpful.",

Yet, at the individual level an event or events must be perceived as affecting immediate social relationships before anomia occurs. Previous victimization research reports suggest that crimes may cause interaction problems for the victims. This passibility was analyzed using two notional samples collected by the Notional Opinion Research Center in 1973 and 1974. Using regression to analyze the impact of robbery and burglary on anomia scores no significant relations were found. Bath are usually non‐recurrent experiences that either do not have long‐term effects on individuls, or anomia as measured here is too far removed to serve as an adequate measure .",

      "title": "A Study of Indian Female Substance Abusers in Treatment: Demographic and Psychometric Variables",
      "abstract": "THE ADDICTIVE PROCESS The drug epidemic is several decades old in India. It has moved from culturally accepted recreational phenomena towards the newer drug use of Heroin,  ocaine and other designer drugs. Routes of administration have shifted from oral intake and inhalation to chasing and injecting drug use. While this, in a way, represents man’s hedonistic nature, it is also a symptom of the inherent dysfunction in  society and its social groups and structure. Societal dysfunctions and the modern rat race has led to the breakup of the family unit, bringing along a lack of parenting and value systems. The need to belong, however inadequately, comes across as a sign of changing times and values. Success, failure, low self esteem, low job opportunities, problems of identity etc., are nodes in a viscous cycle of self destruction. Not the least impediment in this cycle is the example set by our peers and role models of over-indulgence in mood altering substances which is justified by them as stress reducing agents. With advancing addictive behaviour, a balanced lifestyle takes a back seat. For, as many that fall victim to substance abuse, many more, through individual example and dysfunctional families, perpetuate addictive behaviours, addictive logic and self destructive coping mechanisms. Obsessive and compulsive addictions include work, sex, food, gambling and many more. As the newer trend of “Polydrug abuse” is experienced and observed across the globe, it becomes essential to focus treatment strategies onto the whole person instead of focusing upon the visible symptoms of addiction. Addiction is all pervasive; it is a disease as listed in the DSM 4 of the American Psychiatric Association. It is a disease of relationships - lack of human ones and a compensatory attachment to other things. It is also a disease of attitudes, reinforcing the fact that being substance free without commensurate change of lifestyle or spiritual awakening invariably tends to result in relapse. Addiction is an abnormal relationship with an object or an event. The individual departs from the normal and socially accepted functions of the object or event and sets up with it a pathological relationship. For the addict - the food, sex act or the drug takes up a new function. Under relatively normal circumstances, human beings get their emotional and intimacy needs met by connecting with other human beings, their own selves, their community and with a spiritual power greater than themselves. It is through a balanced combination of these relationships that people get healthy emotional nurturance. This way of acting intimately involves a pattern of reaching out to life. In addictive patterns of behaviour this reaching out motion is almost totally inward, bordering on the point of withdrawal. As Craig Nakkan (Ref.14) points out; addiction exists within the person and when an individual connects with his addiction he withdraws from external relationships. This is what underlies the social inadequacy aspect of addiction. The longer that an addictive illness progresses, the less a person feels the ability to have meaningful relationships with others. An addictive lifestyle is marked by a progressive loss of control and an emotional evading of the realities of living. Addiction is an emotional illusion - an illusion of meeting emotional needs through addictive behaviours. It is a commitment to a negative and self destructive way of living; basically a faulty mechanism of coping - a repetitive seeking of the illusion of relief through avoidance of reality and its consequences. In dealing with this extremely complex problem of addiction, practical strategies concentrate on demand reduction activities instead of on supply reduction approaches. In polydrug and substitute addictions any numbers of escape routes are available to allow the “unchanged” client to continue his indulgence of self gratification and opt not to be “in recovery”. “Whole Person Recovery” begins with an abstinence from drugs and other chemicals and progresses towards maintaining a drug free life style in terms of actions - working towards the top priority of remaining drug free. Along with this, it is also important to have acceptance and a sense of reverence for higher values and a spiritual way of life. Adapting to work and responsibility by balancing self reliance and interdependence with others and by following a self disciplined routine is vital to the recovery process. If addiction is viewed in terms of social inadequacy “Whole Person Recovery” requires reestablishing comfortable and honest relationships with others.

In these cases, the alleged perpetrators denied any wrongdoing. Both plaintiff and defense attorneys were interested in the credibility of their clients. The authors point out that it is always the trier of fact (the judge or jury) who determines what actually happened between two individuals who give different accounts of an interaction. Nevertheless, forensic experts can give information to attorneys and to the trier of fact that will help with the determination. For example, alternative explanations for the plaintiff's account of events can be ruled in or out. In addition, the authors discuss how, from a clinical perspective, perceptions of being harmed can lead to psychological signs and symptoms, but without corroborating evidence, the presence of such phenomena are not dispositive of whether a given event actually meets legal definitions of rape or boundary violations.",

      "abstract": "Experimental evidence shows that experiencing maltreatment in early childhood affects the way a person responds to angry faces. This is viewed by many developmental psychologists as an adaptive response to an abusive or hostile environment. However, it is also widely thought that, in a non-abusive environment, these alterations to the way a person responds to angry faces also puts an individual at greater risk than average for developing psychiatric disorders. Why is this the case? This chapter develops a potential explanation suggested by Eamon McCrory and Essi Viding in 2015 for why maltreatment-induced alterations to neurocognitive systems increase a person’s vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders. According to their general approach, spectators visually code or classify angry faces as ‘threat cues’. This type of response makes sense in a hostile or abusive environment, because, in such an environment, angry faces are reliable indicators of an environmental threat. However, this chapter argues that in ordinary non-abusive environments, angry faces do not reliably indicate the presence of an environmental threat and that, for this reason, a person cannot visually identify another person as a threat on the basis of their facial expression.",

      "title": "The Origins of Trust: Humans’ Reliance on Communicative Cues Supersedes Firsthand Experience During the Second Year of Life",
      "abstract": "How do people learn about things that they have never perceived or inferred—like molecules, miracles or Marie-Antoinette? For many thinkers, trust is the answer. Humans rely on communicated information, sometimes even when it contradicts blatantly their firsthand experience. We investigate the early ontogeny of this trust using a non-verbal search paradigm in four main studies and three supplementary studies (N = 208). Infants and toddlers first see where a reward is, and then an in-formant communicates to them that it is in another location. We use this general experimental set-up to assess the role of age, informants’ knowledge, cue’s familiarity, and communicative context on trust in communicated information. Results reveal that infants and toddlers quickly trust familiar and novel communicative cues from well-informed adults. When searching for the reward, they follow a well-informed adults’ communicative cue, even when it contradicts what they just saw. Further-more, infants are less likely to be guided by familiar and novel cues from poorly informed adults than toddlers. Thus, reliance on communication is calibrated during early childhood, up to the point of overriding evidence about informants’ knowledge. Moreover, toddlers trust much more strongly a novel cue when it is used in a communicative manner. Toddlers’ trust cannot be explained by mere compliance: it is highly reduced when communicated information is pitted against what participants currently see. Thus, humans’ strong tendency to rely on familiar and novel communicative cues emerges in infancy, and intensifies during the second year of life.",

      "abstract": "Gifted children, those with unusually high ability in one or more domains, not only develop more rapidly than typical children, but also appear to be qualitatively different. They have an intense drive to master, require little explicit tuition, and, if intellectually gifted, often pose deep philosophical questions. Although some psychologists have tried to account for the achievements of gifted individuals solely in terms of drive or “deliberate practice,” no evidence allows us to rule out innate differences in talent. Profiles of gifted individuals are often uneven: Extremely high ability in one area can coexist with ordinary or even subnormal ability in another area. Scientific investigation of the gifted reveals the importance of drive and hard work in achievement of any kind, and the lack of necessary correlation among abilities in different areas.",

      "abstract": "Being popular means getting noticed by many. Popularity is measured as well as staged. Rankings and charts provide information on what is popular while vying for popularity themselves. They do not speak to the quality or originality of the popular, only to its evident success across different scales of evaluation. People do not buy good products, they buy popular ones; they do not listen to the best music, but to popular music; they do not share, like or retweet important, but popular news. Even the ‘unpopular’ can be popular: a despised politician, a hated jingle, an unpopular measure. The popular modifies whatever it affords with attention. Its quantitatively and hierarchically comparative terms (‘bestseller’, ‘outperformer’, ‘high score’, ‘viral’) generate valences that do not inhere in the objects themselves. Conversely, the non-popular, which does not find any measurable resonance in these terms, risks being dismissed as irrelevant or worthless simply because it does not appear in any rankings or ratings. This can also be observed particularly with artefacts whose relevance as part of high culture could be taken for granted even when they do not achieve mass resonance.

      "abstract": "Abstract Although the literature regarding the etiology of oral clefts is extensive, unique causal factors remain unknown. The widely held belief is that oral clefts are of multifactorial etiology, with both genetic predisposition and environmental influence playing a role. In this chapter, the term environmental is used in its broadest sense to include characteristics of the individual, such as age, sex, and race; behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol use; as well as other exposures, such as occupational or environmental ones. While no strong risk factors for oral clefts have been identified, several potential environmental risk factors have been investigated, including smoking, alcohol, caffeine, benzodi azepines, and corticosteroids. In evaluating the role of specific risk factors or a category of risk factors in epidemiology, several criteria are examined for causality. These include consistency, strength of association, biologic plausibility, temporal sequence, and dose-response relationship. Often, there is a remarkable lack of consistency for several of the risk factors discussed in this chapter. Also, many of the measures of association are not strong. In addition, usually there is little information regarding the temporal sequence between exposure and outcome. A dose-response relationship can seldom be demonstrated. Therefore, making inferences about the causality of oral clefts is largely an inconclusive task. In this chapter, the current evidence regarding the role of environmental risk factors in the etiology of oral clefts is discussed.",

      "title": "Sexual abuse allegations and parental separation: Smokescreen or fire?",
      "abstract": "If allegations of sexual abuse of a child are made after parents separate, the challenges of resolving custody and visitation issues are greatly increased, with the abuse allegations overshadowing other considerations. These are high conflict cases, and settlement may be very difficult (or inappropriate) to arrange. The involvement of a number of agencies and professionals, with overlapping responsibilities and potentially conflicting opinions, may complicate the resolution of these cases. A significant proportion of allegations of child abuse made in the context of parental separation are true, but this is a context with a relatively high rate of unfounded allegations. While some cases of untrue allegations are due to fabrication, more commonly unfounded allegations are made in good faith. Preexisting distrust or hostility may result in misunderstandings and unfounded allegations, especially in cases where the children involved are young and the allegations are reported through a parent. Some cases of unfounded allegations may be the product of the emotional disturbance of the accusing parent. This paper discusses how parental separation affects the making of child sexual abuse allegations, with particular emphasis on how separation may contribute to unfounded allegations. Recent research is reviewed, and national data from Canada on allegations of abuse and neglect when parents have separated is presented. Legal issues that arise in these cases are discussed in the context of American and Canadian case law. The authors discuss factors that can help distinguish founded from unfounded cases. The paper concludes by offering some practical advice about the handling of this type of case by mental health professional, judges, and lawyers.",

      "title": "Against racial profiling",
      "abstract": "A police officer sees a suspicious bulge in the pocket of a passing pedestrian and deliberates whether to stop and search. The pedestrian is also a young, black man, and from past searches and convictions, the police arguably know that such men are much likelier than other people to carry an illegal firearm. Should the police officer be instructed to take this information into account? This article objects to racial profiling because it relies on the following type of inference: from the individual’s membership of a certain racial group, the searcher is invited to infer that the individual is likelier to exhibit some culpable behaviour. The article shows that such an inference to culpable behaviour requires contradictory presuppositions about the freedom of the suspected behaviour. On the one hand, racial profiling ought to presuppose that the individual suspect’s behaviour is unfree because the inference it involves takes the suspect’s behaviour to be determined by his race, age, and gender, none of which is within his control. On the other hand, similarly to criminal trials, search practices ought also to presuppose the exact opposite: that the individual is free to determine his own behaviour. If the suspected behaviour is free, the involved inference to culpable behaviour is not probative of the individual suspect’s behaviour, so profiling methods which rely on it are useless. And if the suspected behaviour is unfree, the inference is probative, but the suspect is not culpable and should thus not be put to trial, whatever the profiled search yields.",

      "abstract": "If we take the definition of censorship as the control of information and ideas circulated within a society through the suppression of words and images, you have part of the answer. But we should not only think of overt forms of control and suppression, but also more indirect forms that occur through socialization. In all communities, individuals are socialized to act in accord with established norms and practices. Those who do not may be labeled deviants and stigmatized. Anxious to avoid stigmatization, but also to gain from acting in acceptable ways, people engage in self-censorship. They monitor what they say and do, and perhaps even what they allow themselves to think. Broadly speaking, we might say self-censorship can take two forms: a choice made and an unintended practice, a sort of disciplinary blindness that we don’t even recognize. So self-censorship has obvious advantages to society and individuals alike. For individuals, it may help to avoid harm and advance one’s career. And societies rely on self-censorship even more than shaming or punishment to reduce the frequency of threatening and destabilizing behavior. But it also can be damaging when it is too effective, as it discourages freedom of thought and expression, both of which are critical to personal and social adaptation and development. As with so many things, there is a happy medium, although it is invariably difficult to find, sustain, or logically justify.",

      "title": "“WHO ARE YOU, WHO AM I?” Does a psychologist need philosophy to better understand the sexual abuse of minors?",
      "abstract": "This article attempts to look at the issue of sexual abuse from an anthropological point of view because the attempts by various scholarly disciplines to describe and analyze the phenomenon of sexual abuse, including attempts to identify causes and effects, do not provide clear answers to the question of the nature of what happen in sexual abuse. The first steps of the analysis show the need for a philosophical reflection, and point to the directions of such a reflection which can help to understand that the harm inflicted on a young victim by sexual abuse consists in a damage at the “core of the person,” of his own subjectivity, of his own “self.” It is an “anthropological harm or damage” resulting from “becoming an object” for the abuser. It interrupts the process of becoming an autonomous subject who understand himself and is able to enter in a dialogical relationship with others.The gist of the damage of child sexual abuse remains hidden behind the tangible long-term effects. These effects are often insurmountable during the victim’s lifetime. It indicates that we are dealing with damage to “who I am” – damage to the being of a sexually abused person. So, the person harmed in this way knows neither who I am – the person who experienced this harm, nor who you are – the perpetrator who harmed him and, in a sense, who the other is in general. Understanding the “anthropological harm” inflicted by sexual abuse clearly shows the challenge of the process of transitioning from the experience of “becoming an object” to discovering and rebuilding one’s own subjectivity, one’s own self, without denying the harm. Anthropological reflection concerns also the person of the perpetrator, who turned out to be the “bearer of evil.” Here, we have questions about intentionality, about responsibility for one’s actions, but also about the whole misery of a human being who, by objectifying another person, probably reduces himself to an object. Also, in the case of the perpetrator, understanding the process of becoming a perpetrator may help in the process of his resocialization, that is, the process of restoring his experience of his being as a free person open to meeting the other “you” who must not harmed.",

      "abstract": "Antisocial personality disorder is a well-established disease which features space from cruelty to lack of empathy and remorse. Its etiology has been deeply analyzed both for genetic and environmental implications. The role of family context has been underlined throughout the whole psychopathology as an explanation to the etiological conflict between nature and nurture. Even if this conflict seems to be apparently solved, it is still possible to ponder about family implications in terms of causes and consequences. In the antisocial field, maternal role may offer interesting and surprising food for thought. Even if it is commonly believed an intergenerational transmission of aberrant behaviors, particularly in terms of learning behaviors and lack of empathy assimilation, it exists a side part of maternal pathological expression that may play a role in the intergenerational transmission and it is extremely difficult to be detected. Female declination of this disorder may be expressed also through somatic implications and complaints, leading to the hypothesis of a self-reflection of the lack of consideration for other's needs, which is distinctive. It is of extreme importance, particularly in terms of prevention, to consider and identify these connotations of the disorder to be able to try to interrupt the cycle of transmission through generations.",

Across many different studies and measures, men have been shown to have more frequent and more intense sexual desires than women, as reflected in spontaneous thoughts about sex, frequency and variety of sexual fantasies, desired frequency of intercourse, desired number of partners, masturbation, liking for various sexual practices, willingness to forego sex, initiating versus refusing sex, making sacrifices for sex, and other measures. No contrary findings (indicating stronger sexual motivation among women) were found. Hence we conclude that the male sex drive is stronger than the female sex drive.

      "abstract": "There is little doubt that media use has a meaningful influence on how we view and treat members of our own and other ethnic/racial identities. Exposure to negative and disparaging representations of ethnic/racial groups in the media has been found to contribute to the development of stereotypes, prompt bias, promote prejudice and discrimination, and even undermine the esteem of ethnic/racial media users. Alternatively, seeing more constructive depictions can reduce stereotyping and encourage more favorable interracial relations in society. Given these considerable consequences, determining how and how often ethnic/racial groups are depicted in the media is meaningful. However, it is important to interpret such effects within the appropriate context. First, it should be acknowledged that media use is only one of numerous factors that can influence attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding one’s own and other ethnic/racial groups. Thus, none would argue that self-concept, stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination, or other aspects of interracial dynamics in society stem from any single cause (including media). This does not mean, however, that media use cannot causally increase the likelihood of such outcomes. Instead, it suggests that factors ranging from the amount of time one spends with media, to the number and quality of representations of different groups across media, to one’s own experiences and values, together and individually, can contribute to ethnic/racial views and dynamics at the individual and societal levels. It is also important to acknowledge that the statistical effects of media use are small. In other words, when you consider the magnitude of the influence of media exposure on user’s racial attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, the impact is modest. This should not be assumed to mean that the practical effects on interethnic/interracial outcomes are inconsequential. Small effects can still have pronounced implications when considering the massive size of the population of media users alongside the fact that media use is cumulative across time, platforms, and devices. This means that even a small effect can have a considerable impact as the influence accumulates across multiple exposures throughout the day, over a lifetime, and across the vast population of media users in society. Indeed, nearly everyone in society uses media, repeatedly throughout the day and across time, which nearly guarantees that the bulk of the population has been exposed to the messages about race/ethnicity offered in its content, potentially contributing to the ways that people think about and behave toward ethnic/racial groups at any given time.",

These juvenile delinquents sometimes have mental disorders/behavioural issues such as post traumatic stress disorder or bipolar disorder, and are sometimes diagnosed with conduct disorder partially as a result of their delinquent behaviours. Many factors like schools, neighbourhood, Family, Society, Situations are equally responsible for the degradation or fall of a child. Hence, instead of labelling them as one we must try and find ways, rectify the errors in their lives which led them to behave in this manner.

      "abstract": "Adolescence, the second decade of life, is a period of transition from childhood to adulthood marked by rapid changes, which are physical, social, and psychological in nature. Of the 12 million girls born in India every year, 1.5 million girls die before the age of one and one out of every four does not live to celebrate her fifteenth birthday due to gender discrimination and gross neglect. This can be linked to neglect of females as infants, as children, as adolescents, and as mothers. Impaired mental and emotional health is a precursor or consequence of many health-risk behaviors such as physical, sexual, social, or emotional abuse. These dilemmas arise out of everyday issues like peer influence, dating identity, emerging sexuality, independence, separation, identity crises, anxiety, and responsibility as well as more serious ones like violent behavior, experimental sex, teenage suicides, and other health-related disorders.",

Older adolescents indicated more dating experiences, times in love, passion, identity, and intimacy. They also reported more commitment-related romantic beliefs but less romantic idealization. Across all grades, females indicated fewer times in love and less tendency to believe in love at first sight but greater intimacy and self-consciousness. In addition, predictions of psychosocial intimacy were examined. For both males and females, greater intimacy was associated with less self-consciousness but more passion, commitment-related beliefs, and psychosocial identity. Implications for creating empirically based resources for facilitating positive development in adolescents’ interpersonal lives are discussed.",

      "title": "Communion or Suspicion: Which Way for Woman and Man?",
      "abstract": "Authoritative and prolific teachings of the Roman Catholic Church have proposed a model for intimate heterosexual relationships between men and women which might be called the “communion and mutual service model.” This model is grounded in an anthropology of both sexes based upon humanity’s creation in a Trinitarian God’s image and likeness. It consequently understands man and woman as radically equal, and inherently social. It also views sexual differences as oriented to interpersonal communion. In this view, however, heterosexual relations suffer a hereditary brokenness as a consequence of original sin; each sex manifests this differently and in relation to the other. The Church proposes finally that Christ’s life, death, and resurrection show humanity the way of triumph over broken love. For intimate heterosexual pairs, that way requires “finding oneself by losing oneself.”A competing model, the “suspicion model” of intimate heterosexual relations - reacting to past or ongoing situations of oppression, discrimination, or even violence against women – neglects attention to the equality of males, despairs of securing male commitment to spouses or children, and often seeks a strict equality of functional outcomes for both sexes.Family law in the United States is currently grappling with questions that engage the anthropological issues raised by both models, including but not limited to: marriage stabilization efforts, divorce law reform, same-sex marriage and fatherhood initiatives. This paper sets forth the elements of the communion and mutual service and the suspicion models of male-female relationships. It describes and compares secular models of intimate heterosexual relationships currently proposed by scholars of law and/or religion, which models overlap with the communion and mutual service model. Finally, it considers how the communion and mutual service model might correct and illuminate the suspicion model while supporting particular directions in a variety of controverted laws affecting heterosexual, intimate relationships.",

The unconscious desire for a child, vis-a-vis the conscious knowledge of the problems such a child may create, plays a fundamental role in the emotional life of a woman. Men can complicate the problem; they often identify sexual potency with reproductive power, and refuse contraception for their female partners. The role of a physician in such situations is very important, very difficult and delicate. He is the one who knows, who advises, who prescribes, and who must, above all, understand. Information on contraception should be more widespread and more accurate, and every young couple should be convinced that contraception will help resolve many demographic problems, create a more responsible sexuality, improve the affective and economic situation of a family, and diminish maternal and perinatal morbidity.",

      "title": "Legal regulation of anti-discrimination and mobing in the field of labor",
      "abstract": "The absence of discrimination in the workplace is an important condition for productive work, mental and physical health of employees, preservation of a sense of human dignity and personality development, a healthy moral climate in the team, effective communication in production in vertical and horizontal planes and other necessary processes in the field of work, since any labor team is not only a production, but also a social environment. The negative impact of discrimination is felt far beyond the boundaries of a specific workplace, as negative emotions affect a person's family, friendships, and other social relationships. Anti-discrimination problems are the subject of research by specialists in legal, social and economic sciences, in particular, the legal protection of employees is being studied according to individual characteristics: gender, disability, HIV-positive status, migration, gender identity, ethnic or linguistic minorities, etc. There are a number of international and national regulations that prohibit unequal treatment of employees on grounds unrelated to a person's qualifications, productivity, and business qualities. Prohibition of mobbing (harassment) and establishment of responsibility for such actions became a relatively new phenomenon for national legislation. Adherence to the principle of equal treatment of employees and non-discrimination is one of the main areas of activity of the International Labor Organization, which is reflected in the norms of a number of conventions and recommendations. One of the latest is Convention No. 190 on Violence and Harassment, adopted by the ILO in 2019, which once again emphasizes the importance of creating decent working conditions for individuals on the basis of equality in the absence of any violence or harassment. In Ukrainian legislation, there are norms regarding the support of certain vulnerable groups of employees - minors, persons of pre-retirement age, internally displaced persons, persons with disabilities and others. This phenomenon is sometimes called \"positive discrimination\", which is socially determined. Discrimination and mobbing must be excluded from labor relations as those that reduce the quality of life, hinder decent work and human development, therefore the presence of clearly defined norms that establish responsibility for such actions is very important. Anti-discrimination legislation provides for disciplinary, material, financial, administrative and criminal liability for relevant offenses. Changes were made to the administrative legislation regarding the establishment of liability for mobbing (harassment) at the workplace, but there are no clearly defined norms regarding liability for violation of the prohibition of discrimination, as well as no definition of the act itself.",

      "abstract": "Introduction and objective: Consensual non-monogamy (CNM) refers to various relationship types in which at least one partner, with the other’s consent, forms sexual and/or emotional connections with other people. In open relationships, partners are allowed to engage sexually with others, but emotional intimacy is reserved for the primary relationship, which takes precedence. The aim of this article is to gather the most up-to-date information on open relationships.Material and methods: A review of studies available on the PubMed platform (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) was conducted, including articles with free full-text access that used the keywords: “open relationship”, “CNM” and \"Consensual non-monogamy.\"Brief Description of the State of Knowledge: CNM includes open relationships, polyamory, polyfidelity, and swinging. Interest in open relationships has increased in recent years, with more people expressing curiosity about them than those actively participating. Men, individuals with high cognitive empathy, those less prone to jealousy, and those capable of experiencing compersion—the joy from a partner’s involvement with others—are particularly interested in open relationships. Summary: Research suggests potential benefits of CNM, including greater relationship and sexual satisfaction compared to monogamous arrangements. However, open relationships can also pose challenges such as social stigma, the potential breakdown of the primary relationship, or complications in parenting for those involved. Despite growing interest, CNM and phenomena like compersion remain under-researched, providing an open field for further investigation into their dynamics and impact on individual and relational well-being.",

      "abstract": "There has been an increasing number of people who get married for love. Notwithstanding the importance of love in marriage, partners know little about it. They are not familiar with determinants of love and do not understand that love can change and can be affected, for instance, by a childbirth. There are other factors that affect love in marriage, about which the spouses are largely ignorant. Communication, comproise, mutual understanding and respect are of utmost impedance in a marriage as well. These are only some of the factors that make a quality and functional marriage. When a marriage is disfunctional and devoid of all important determinants needed for a successful marriage it can result in conflicts, quarrels and even domestic violence. When this happens, a separation is a better option. Nevertheless, a divorce does not bring peace to a family since it results in separation, grief, loveliness and a lot of negative emotions. Adivorce does not only affect the parents, but it can also have long-term consequences as for as children are concerned. If unables to accept ther parents divorce, children can develop behavioral disorders and have stunted development. Reluctant to accept any negative change in life, they react in a negative way to a divorce. However, if provided with parental unreserved support and love, children may accept a separation in an easier way. Educational system and institutions play an important role in this as well. Children feel that they lack safety in their own home during a divorce period. Therefore, it is a kinergarten teacher’s role and duty to ensure that thay feel safe and secure in their kindergarten by helping them to adapt to new life circumstances.",

      "abstract": "As research into Alzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders becomes more complex, risky, invasive, and commonplace, the need intensifies for discussion of the ethics of involving persons with dementia in research, specifically research of greater than minimal risk and of no expected direct benefit to the subject. (It is beyond the scope of this paper to consider the ethical issues related to research involvement of cognitively impaired children or children or adults with intermittent and/or reversible cognitive or psychiatric impairments. For such discussions, refer to the references in notes 1–6.) Reviewing such studies pushes our traditional analysis tools to their limits. Simply balancing and prioritizing the basic ethical principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice that serves us well in reviewing the vast majority of studies is inadequate when reviewing research of such ethical complexities as studies with marked risks and no expectation of direct benefit to subjects unable to consent or withdraw. Moving up to the level of theory, placing these principles within the commonly applied frameworks of consequentialism, deontology, or virtue ethics bring us no closer to reducing the tensions such research creates between upholding individual autonomy and advancing society's need to learn how to treat and cure these devastating diseases. What is needed is the introduction of more contemporary moral analyses. Specifically, we need to become more inclusive of the diversity of values perspectives of our general citizenry. In more theoretical terms, we ought to elevate to a more central role a communitarian perspective and a feminist ethics emphasis on relationships and context as we rush to keep in step, ethically, with this rapidly expanding area of medical inquiry.",

It is much less clear, however, why some individuals who are socially connected with individuals with positive attitudes towards violence, and who experience the same structural conditions, do not themselves have the same attitudes. This article investigates this research question by presenting original data from two networks of individuals with positive and negative attitudes towards violence in Italy, exploring the factors that might explain why some individuals reject violent protest despite having crucial bonds (i.e. friendship, kinship or romantic relationship) with individuals who have positive attitudes towards violence and despite belonging to the same social movement. The findings suggest that individuals with positive attitudes towards violence tend to have narrower and less sophisticated political views, are less professionally engaged, and are more driven by the search for meaning in life than individuals who reject violence.",

The type of cognitive processing on the part of the nonreligious includes a preference toward intellectualism and interest in science. Their cognitive processing also tends to be analytic and rational as opposed to intuitive and emotional. Secular individuals have personalities marked by openness to new experiences. Seculars have a lower rate of marriage and prefer smaller families. This is related to their tendency to delay marriage and cohabit to a greater extent than their religious counterparts. Many of these cognitive and personality traits have common origins as evidenced by their co-occurrence in early development and the partial influence of genetics. Some of these characteristics may not necessarily reflect the absence of religiosity per se but rather a basic underlying temperament, of which secularity is merely one expression.",

      "abstract": "A given aspect of cultural tradition can rarely, if ever, be studied in isolation. No matter from what viewpoint the researcher approaches his subject he finds himself inevitably involved with its wider ramifications. Beliefs, traditions, language and many other aspects of human culture interweave and interrelate to such an extent that no single isolated approach can be definitive. It is therefore with a great deal of trepidation and considerable misgivings that one approaches such a study as that of traditional figures of fear. In this brief exploratory paper it is intended to do no more than outline a few of the problems and complexities of this field of enquiry, especially with regard to classification and etymology, in the hope of stimulating further comment and criticism. In passing, it is inevitable that some reference will be made to the development of the study of frightening figures itself and to the methodology and terminology employed. When we speak of bogeys or bogeymen we may perhaps think primarily of childhood days when they may have had a specific meaning for each of us. On the other hand as adults we may simply use these words as general cover-terms for anything which inspires fear. Fear is a potent force at work in all levels of human society. Virtually everyone experiences it to some degree and although we may learn to overcome it perhaps by discovering through experience that at least some of our fears are groundless most of us retain some measure of it throughout our lives. It operates in many ways and with varying intensity, depending, for instance, on the great diversity of cultures and of individual personality. One might perhaps expect the so-called 'primitive' cultures to be more dominated by fear than more 'civilised' societies but this is not necessarily so. It may well be that to a",

      "abstract": "Group-living primates are likely to spend a substantial amount of time grooming and resting with a small number of other group members. Such close and enduring relationships are regarded as affiliative. The properties of affiliative relationships are not fully understood and no consensus exists on how to quantitatively describe them. In this review, I explain the primate behaviors that are related to affiliative relationships and examine the means for using these behaviors to measure the relationship. Traditionally, affiliative relationships are defined by the frequency of proximity and grooming. Individuals with frequent proximity and grooming tend to perform altruistic behaviors for their partners without immediate return from them, groom each other in a reciprocal manner in the long-term, show distress and reconcile after agonistic interactions, and synchronize their behaviors with those of their partners. Thus, in addition to measuring the frequencies of proximity and grooming, these behavioral tendencies might be used as indices of affiliative relationships. Similarly, other questions concerning affiliative relationships remain unexplained. Some studies show that affiliative relationships increase reproductive success, but the mechanisms leading to fitness outcomes remain unclear. Although typically in primates, related individuals tend to form affiliative relationships, such relationships are also formed with unrelated individuals. Affiliative relationships could mitigate the negative effects of competition among individuals in large social groups and ensure that the individuals that form the relationship receive benefits from each other (e.g., agonistic support and collective mobbing). It is also unclear whether the affiliated relationships of nonhuman primates are equivalent to those of humans. Further research is necessary to elucidate similarities or differences in affiliative relationships between human and nonhuman primates.",

      "abstract": "Marital instability continues to increase in Africa and other developing countries in the last few decades – in most cases unnoticed – thereby, creating intractable problems in the early years of child development. Contrary to arguments that the phenomenon of divorce /separation is synonymous with the West and the rest of Europe, most developing countries like Nigeria continue to witness cases of ‘unofficial’ divorces, separations and other marital crises which have impeded the development of child at early years. The incessant and unfavourable socio-economic malaise confronting these countries has also made them more vulnerable to the phenomenon. While children’s early development and overall well-being depend more on social, economic, psychological and cultural factors, it is pertinent to understand the implications of unstable or separated couples/parents on the life of the child. A great number of studies have indicated that children raised in non-traditionally married families or unstable homes do not fare well as their counterparts who are brought up in stable and peaceful homes. Thus this study assesses the impact of diverse and marital instabilities as well as home-conflicts on early childhood development in Nigeria. Through empirical analysis, it provides answers to many questions arising from early childhood development and well-being, and marital instabilities.",

      "abstract": "公务员要面对错综复杂的社会矛盾，又要遵循官场有形的法纪和无形规则，在面对自身利益、身份职责、各方评价时，总要寻找一个价值平衡点，作为自己为人、为官的追求。而在这个价值平衡点找不准、或找准了而达不到时，一些不太健康的心理现象就会显现出来。因此，说公务员存在心理健康问题，多数情况下并不是这些人真的“有病”，而是外部环境带给他们的价值观、人生观出现了与其职业身份不相称的偏差。",

      "title": "DISKRIMINACIJA I MOBBING NA POSLU",
      "abstract": "Discrimination is unfortunately a treatment we encounter every day in life, consciously or\r\n unconsciously. Unequal treatment, ie putting a person at a disadvantage on the basis of some\r\n of their characteristics (eg skin color or gender) is a simplified notion of discrimination.\r\n Discriminatory treatment as a phenomenon often occurs during employment and in the\r\n workplace. The law sets out the grounds on which it is prohibited to treat a certain person\r\n unequally. One of the most common forms of discrimination is gender discrimination. The\r\n Gender Equality Act protects and promotes equality between women and men in the labor\r\n market, equal opportunities in employment, working conditions and promotion. In addition to\r\n the notion of discrimination, we have recently come across the term mobbing. Mobbing is\r\n considered a type of behavior in the workplace in which an individual or group, over a long\r\n period of time, psychologically abuses another person with the aim of endangering his dignity,\r\n integrity, reputation and honor. Unfortunately, such behavior in our legal system is not yet fully\r\n defined. As a result of exerting such pressure, a person may develop mental disorders, feelings\r\n of worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and fear, etc. In addition to completely reducing work\r\n performance, it usually puts a person in a situation where he sees no way out, and for fear of\r\n losing his job. , accept manipulation as something akin to the workplace, especially if it feeds\r\n the family. In the legislation of the Republic of Croatia, there are several sources that regulate\r\n the prohibition of discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and protection of dignity in\r\n the workplace, but the term mobbing is not accepted in these sources.",

      "title": "The Concept of Autonomy in Bioethics: An Unwarranted Fall from Grace",
      "abstract": "Despite its foundational role in the development of the field of bioethics, the concept of autonomy has recently come under attack from a variety of nonliberal perspectives in bioethics, particularly communitarian, feminist, and “family-based decision-making” perspectives. The attack on the concept of autonomy usually centers on one (or both) of two related criticisms: first, that the concept of autonomy is too narrowly “atomistic,” ignoring the social context of personal identity; and second, that a narrow concern with a patient's autonomy rights neglects the social dimensions of healthcare treatment decision making (in particular, the impact of healthcare treatment decisions on a patient's community or family).",

      "title": "DEVELOPING SELF-ESTEEM IN YOUNG CHILDREN",
      "abstract": "The development of a positive sense of self-esteem, so critical to small children, remains of central importance throughout life. Perhaps no experience is more distressing, or more linked to behavioural and emotional disturbance of many kinds, than a diminished sense of worth or a low opinion of oneself. The concept of self-esteem is a pivotal one in theories of human nature and personality development. Most people have a sense of what we mean by the term self-esteem, but defining it is complex and difficult. Theorists generally agree that self-esteem is an individual’s subjective evaluation of the extent to which she/he is capable, significant, successful and worthy. Susan Harter (1982), has pointed out that self-esteem is multidimensional and not just experienced as being good or bad, positive or negative. Children may rate themselves very differently on various dimensions, e.g., physical competence, maternal acceptance or social acceptance by peers. Another important fact about self-esteem is that while having positive self-esteem has been equated with all the good things in life and having negative self-esteem with bad, most of us fall somewhere in the middle. In fact, excessive feelings of pride and omnipotence may be negative attributes and lead to distorted personalities and psychological problems. Children need, therefore, to develop a core feeling of competence that is realistic and recognizes both their strengths and weaknesses.",

      "title": "Prenatal programming-potential modulator for development of personality, preferences and skills",
      "abstract": "Background: It was believed that an individual develops his or her personality, preferences and skills due to the influence of various external factors including environment, society, and culture. However, recent studies indicate that this development starts prenatally and that the activities that a mother indulges in, during pregnancy influences fetus personality and skills largely.This study was undertaken to analyze researches and experiments conducted and published in indexed journals to understand the bond between the mother and her fetus and its implications on various aspects of an individual. Theories could then be postulated on probable ways to modulate the fetal preferences in utero for future effective functioning of the individual.Discussion and Conclusion: Multiple studies have shown that the fetus develops an inclination for certain prosodic features while still in the womb, which influences their preferences for certain auditory and linguistic features later in life. There is compelling evidence that the flavor of food consumed by mothers during pregnancy and lactation, pave the way for the creation of a desire for a familiar taste in the offspring. Prenatal stress and depression in the mother can lead to major psychobiological changes in the baby and they were more likely to develop a similar temperament later in life. Many studies also showed a strong correlation between maternal brain activity and fetal cerebral blood flow, resulting in long and short-term neural changes in the fetus and eventually, the infant.In conclusion the activities undertaken by the mother and her emotional state during pregnancy significantly influences certain aspects of a person’s personality, preferences and skills, which starts in utero and persists in later life.",
